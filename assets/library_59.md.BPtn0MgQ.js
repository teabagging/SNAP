Yes, you've already read it if you've read his other books, but way more entertaining in this format for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daddy's Nose is Vime's Nose!","review":"At least that's what my 2 year old said on first seeing the pictures in this charming, if a trifle bizaar, childrens' book.While much of this can be found in \\"Thud!\\", the meta-story makes it for me. And my son doesn't much care as long as I make the noises. And the \\"city folk\\", funny as they are to a Pratchett fan, are still funny to my son.I plan to get this as a Christmas present for a good friend of mine. That's how much I like it; as both a children's book, and as something that makes me laugh as I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I love this book. Love the idea, the story and characters. The illustrations are amazing and I'm planning on reading it to my granddaughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY Terry Prachett!","review":"This children's book follows right along the lines of most of the other Disc World type books that he has written. Probably good for about 2+ children. It is a story about a man who is reading 'Where's My Cow?' to his son. So in a since it is a story...within a story. Very cute and the illustrations are also very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a children's book","review":"Bugger, I should have read the reviews.

Poorly done in photoshop or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"a delightfull little companion","review":"This childrens book by Terry Pratchett is delightfull for both chilren and adults. If you have ever been a parent that had to read to their children the same book about a million times in a row only to have the little darlings ask for it again, then this book is for you. \\"Where's my cow?\\" is the perfect companion to \\"Thud\\". Adults will enjoy the book because it is slightly subversive and if you have read \\"Thud\\" then you will want to scream with laughter because you are in on the joke. Small children will love it because like every good children's book, it is full of color and great sounds to make. The little darlings will want you to read this book to them the next million time in a row. Could be worse ways to spend quality time with you kids. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"my kids' favorite book ever","review":"My husband and I love Terry Pratchett's books and bought this book when our firstborn was a tiny baby, more for us than for our kids. We never thought we'd try reading it to our kids more than once, never thought they'd like it. Our son is now 3 and we have a 2 year old daughter as well, and it has been hands-down their favorite book! We have an entire bookcase filled with children's books, but this book is literally the only one that has tape on every page and is slowly falling to pieces because it is so well-loved and used! I bought brand new copies for my son and daughter, and a third copy for the baby on the way who I expect will probably love it as much as her siblings do, so that someday they can each have a nice copy to read to their own children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, great illustrations!","review":"The story is original, the illustrations are excellent!

In fact, I am going to order a second copy for her very own! I love it for Pratchett's usual off-the-wall humour, but she loves it in it's own right as a story and really enjoys the illustrations. I definitely think it is aimed at a much younger age level than any of his other children's books, but I would highly recommend it for either anyone with small children, or for the Pratchett fan - just don't expect the usual discworld depth & detail for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably nice, if I could read it...","review":"My son loves animals so I was looking for something like the WildLife Fact File - info on each animal, where it lives, what it eats, how long it lives, etc. He loves learning that stuff.

It is more extensive than I imagined it to be, but I am happy. My kids like the pictures"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book - lousy binding","review":"As other reviewers have reported, this is an exceptional, comprehensive introduction to the animal kingdom. The organization according to taxonomy is very helpful, and the taxonomy used is a well-thought-out compromise in this time of terminological controversy and shifting opinion in systematics. The photography is gorgeous, and the text hits the important high points.The only disappointment is the shoddy binding. As others have mentioned, this is a VERY big book, and it is made all the more weighty by the use of thick glossy paper that makes the graphics shine. Such a book requires a particularly \\"industrial strength\\" library binding. Sadly, the book is bound as though it were a coffee table book that need not stand up to much more than an occasional desultory browsing. I've had it in my classroom for less than a year, and the constant use it gets has already worn out the binding. Hence the 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing pictures","review":"The text in this book is very informative but the best part is the photograpphs. They are amazing.

I teach teachers, and so need a good, solid text with few frills. The photos are stunning. I wish it included some information about animal cell specialization. The pictures of animals and discussion of different organizational structures is included, so it is not missing much. The information looks correct so far after a quick skim. The pictures are better than from the big old biology text I was using. I am also using a botany coloring book for the course, and hope for the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book!","review":"This is the book I've been looking for- tons of information and beautiful pictures.

For an animal fanatic like me this is a great book to read/own anywhere. I would highly recommend it. It might not have the animal description length, or depth of other animal books, but it has the necessary information needed to get a feel for each animal described and the pictures more than do it justice. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"This book is fabulous!! It is also typical DK quality, which means the photos are incredible. I bought this book for my 7 year old son for Christmas. He currently wants to be a zoologist and he carries this book with him everywhere! He uses it for reports and has also spent hours just looking through it and reading it. It's beginning to look very tattered due to how much he uses it. It is such a great bargain, weighing in at a little over 600 pages, I'm considering buying another copy for the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 years later DK's Animal is still breathtaking and amazing.","review":"DK's Animal has set the standard for future reference books which include Earth, Universe, Science, History, Prehistoric Life, Ocean, Art and Natural History, books that were published by DK and books that I own.10 years after it's first publication in 2001, this updated book gives a breathtaking and stunning visual look of ouranimal wildlife from huge mammals to tiny insects. With this updated version of DK's Animal one can look at the spectacular beauty of our wildlife with over 50 new species catalogued and represented.

It is a model kit which requires glue, paint and something you can not buy at amazon, EXPERIENCE with model kits of this nature. For those looking for a Toy for kids, do a search for UNIMAX ABRAMS 1/32. As of today, you can find them here at Amazon or your local Target also carries them in 1/32 and a beautiful 1/18 (which I also own). Be aware when looking at Amazon, that tanks are divided in Toys and Collectibles, that's the reason why some are more expensive than others unless you want your kid playing with an expensive collectible. A good Abrams or Bradley tank in 1/32 scale for kids to play with cost around $19.99 to 24.99 and 29.99 to $44.99 in 1/18 scale. 1/18 is big and fun, it fits 3 3/4 inches figures, the size of a Star Wars or G.I Joe figure.Great level of detail, decals for 4 ABRAMS Markings for desert and NATO version.

I have been in the hobby of building miniature military vehicles via plastic or resin model kits, such as Tamiya's M1A2 Abrams main battle tank. After 30 years of constructing these models, I feel I know a thing or two about the hobby. Tamiya produces some of the best model hobby kits available around the world. The completed models provide an accurate depiction of what an Army tank, Air Force aircraft and Navy warships look like. Every year, Tamiya releases a new kit or re-releases classic kits that were no longer producted. If you want a toy tank, then look somewhere else. If you want to construct an accurate redetion of famous military vehicles, then check out all the kits Tamiya provides for newcomers and veterans of the model building hobby.Amazon.com needs to reclassify this item.

His special caterpillar treads are the thing that make him desirable, but they come off very easily and he doesn't move so well (especially on carpet) when he's got them on. My son was three when we got Terrence and although for a child that age he was fairly good at small motor tasks, he couldn't get the treads back on by himself. I spent a lot of time fussing with them. We eventually threw the treads away (about the time our baby learned to crawl--they seemed like a choking hazard) and we use Terrence without them now. While he works fine with regular wheels, the \\"point\\" of Terrence is his caterpillars. I was disappointed in this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The treads are terrible!","review":"The one i bought for my 3 year old son the rubber treads caused lots of frustration.

Masters of the \\"love gone sour\\" song, tunes like \\"This Old House\\" and \\"On Saturday\\" will leave you with a smile no matter how bad your love life is.

They have very strong New Wave influences which might seem to be a bit trendy but they are really better than that. Blondie and others have been cited but I would in may ways put them closer to the Waitresses or ESG. The music is rather simle melodic New Wave with guitar and synthesizer.

Intercut with recent interviews with the late Mr. Russell, you get the feeling of how he worked with small crews, why he approached subjects the way he did, and how these early projects led to the much larger florid and fun features of his later career. Of his BBC programs shown in this set, probably the most perfect and arresting example is the last one offered, a dramatized doc on the composer Frederick Delius' last five years on earth. It is amazingly shot, acted and directed, standing on it's own as a wonderful slice of cinema. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"why the brits survive it all","review":"ken russell perpetuated the bbc hegemony on going a bit further in these depictions of what really was, instead of what could have been.how, yd ask, could a pallid insular admittedly ball of simple fluff been such a twisting firecracker?

Some of my favorites are: \\"I Want to Save You\\", \\"I Woke up in a Car\\", \\"Cavanaugh Park\\", and \\"Fall.\\" I LOVED \\"Punk Rock Princess\\" on Audioboxer but I think they totally destroyed it on here. It sounds so much less personal. I don't like the extra drums and stuff. Not good. The only song that I have to skip over on this CD is \\"Hurricane\\" because this version just makes me cringe.

You have your talent and your pop stars. These guys are as far away from the backstreet boyz as possible. This cd is the best i have heard in years. The band has extreme musucal talent like i have never heard before. They are a rock band with a piano. The way the instrunments work together is nothing short of amazing. At times the band fades except drums and piano and the first time i heard that i thought i was in heaven. The melodies in these songs are just as beautiful and complicated as the music hat backs hem up. The cd was also mixed by Tom Lord Angle (who has also worked with the likes of Weezer, Blink 182 and New Found Glory).

'Leaving through the window' has a few songs you're going to want to skip over after a couple listens (particularly if you C jordan) but otherwise it is a great album, and worth getting if you can't download individual songs. My personal favorite is 'Hurricane', mostly because of the incredible power of the piano and drum bridge in the middle of the song. Try to get this song if you want a taste of the group. The piano sets Soco apart from most bands, but the other instruments hold their own. The style is between emo and elton john, and while the singing can get to be a touch whiny, overall the catchy melodies and instrumentals stand out to make this a great album. Check out their newer album 'north' if you like their stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"its just simply amazing","review":"this is by far the greatest cd that i have ever bought. i dont care what kind of music you listen to soco is a band that is perfect for everyone. every song on this cd is amazing not only in the music but the lyrics just blew me away. also if your a fan of soco i stroungly suggest that you download the song konstine which i believe is the greatest song they have. it is a little lenghty but every second is worth it, the panio playing gives me chills every time i hear it. and andrews voice is just simple amazing. soco has to be one of the greatest bands and i will remain a everlasting fan of this amazing band."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this cd. it is awesome","review":"this album is definatly the best album ive bought all year. i really enjoy \\"Straw Dog\\" and \\"I Want To Save You\\". i bought this only know three of the songs on the album, and ive discoverd that i like all the songs just as much. \\"Cavanough Park\\" was a wonderful emotional collection of memories. but \\"if u c jordan\\" was just fun, although fairly immature. but still good and it does get you hooked. this was definatly a worth while album, and worth your hard earned money. definatly go see them live!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NFG soundalike","review":"I tried very hard to like this music because so many of my friends love it, but I just couldn't - the lyrics are mediocre, the melodies are uninspiring, and I hate the vocals.

The reader gets an insider's, behind-the-scenes view of New York network news but, in addition, we're allowed a peek into a Sotheby's-like New York auction house and meet real-life characters from upper Bergen County, NJ's wealthy elite, New Jersey's Seton Hall University, and the secret and dangerous world of Russian art forgery in \\"Little Odessa,\\" Brooklyn. Victims dropping like flies until, in the last few pages, we discover who (among many believable suspects) would kill to keep the secret of a fraudulent \\"Faux-berge\\" egg from being revealed. Two plucky heroines look for the egg, and for love, and find both in what turns out to be a very exciting nail-biter. Keep 'em coming, Ms Clark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star","review":"Do You Promise Not to Tell? Nope. This is one of the choppiest books I have ever read. I could not figure out the characters; they were never developed. Just as I started to see depth in a character, the chapter would end and the next would be about some other character; it was frustrating. I feel confident in telling readers this isn't worth taking the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great whodunit","review":"Mary Jane Clark has the gift to bring her characters to life. This is a story of a TV producer, Farrell Slater who is on her last leg of her career. Either she gets the story of a lifetime or she'll be at the unemployment line. She is sent on assignment to an auction house that is selling the famous Faberge egg \\"The Moon Egg'. The egg sells for a record 6 million dollars. Farrell soon discovers that the egg is a fake and she knows who has the real one. Soon people who are aware of this egg are dying. This could be the story Farrell needs to get her career back or it could be the story to end her life. I had fun trying to figure out who the \\"bad guy\\" was. Read this book and have fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is authenic Merengue music!","review":"This is definitely one of the best merengue albums.

It is one of the more atractive models.. but it is big! (they all are) and it might not fit with all decors. I wish that the chair had been 3-4 inches lower. The finish is nice , it has real leather where it counts, extra padding is removable and the cover for the leg wells is an attractive feature. The massage program is simple but adequate, but the intensity is not programmable which might otherwise be inferred from the ad.The shipping was free which was a factor in my selection.

Unfortunately I have long since lost my paperwork for this tool and have no idea where to order a replacement rechargeable battery. Can anyone help me?

His techniques are irritating, sardonic and frustrating... but terribly rewarding. 'Even Cowgirls Get The Blues' is littered (literally) with many magnificent ideas that keep the thinking reader thinking, and the liberal reader laughing. Robbins does well at making the sane look obscene, and may lose you for a few chapters, but ultimately delivers his end of the bargain: a richly entertaining novel which leaves you with a little bit more lust for life than you had known before. In this author's opinion, that's pretty hard to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth Reading!!!","review":"When the book started off talking about a girl born with a huge thumb deformity and hitchiking I knew I should have stopped there but I was reading it for a book club.

Tom Robbins has such a creative, warped sense of humor. I love this book, because the underlying message is having self-esteem and maintaining it.

I wouldn't care so much, I guess, but it's a kind of writing I like, done poorly. Robbins knows what he's doing, but he is just astoundingly arrogant and bigoted, so much that it makes my head reel. His tangential asides are not about the plot, or even (as they supposedly are) about themselves, but about Robbins, and about how he's extremely clever. Well, I don't think he's so much clever as he is obnoxious and self-satisfied. His dialogue is sloppy, his plot is questionable, his form is narcissitic at best, and his novel, ultimately, would be interesting only from an historical perspective, and that only if it were actually original. N.B.: I very much like Kurt Vonnegut, Thomas Pynchon, David Foster Wallace, Douglas Adams, Dostoevsky, Barthelme, &c. (that off the top of my head). Judge based on that whether or not my opinion is relevant to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not care for this one","review":"Obviously having read the reviews, this is a love it or hate it book.

There are at least 30 pages dedicated to explaining how an ancient indian tribe kept track of time. WHY? That literally has absolutely nothing to do with the book. Tim Robbins would start on a long, overly detailed, often nonsensical description of something, and I'd start skipping pages, only to find that 5, 6, or even 20 pages later when I tried to pick back up, he was still describing the same thing.I tried to get through it, but this is literally the only book I have ever been unable to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"on and on and on and on","review":"I got this book because it was highly recommended by a college professor.

Not only do I hate the way he writes about women, I feel he has an attitude about it. His repetitive cutesy prose is bothersome when you read a Robbins book for the first time, and by the time you read this book you can barely finish.

When is enough use of simile enough? You know the annual contest to see who can write the most like Hemingway? Why not a similar contest in the style of Tom Robbins?

I'm amazed that anyone could enjoy this pointless, digressive orgy of self-indulgence.

Not surprisingly, others in our group were of the same opinion. If it weren't for our book club, I would not have finished the book. In fact, I would not have even read past the first 30 pages or so. Thumbs, thumbs, thumbs! Good God, is Mr. Robbins obsessed with thumbs? The story told in this book could have been written over 75 pages or so, not 364!Fortunately, our reading of this book prompted the adoption of a rule by our book club that future book selections be researched before we read them.

It is a typical frivolous 70s-style story, posturing as a more genuine 1960s anti-establishment statement but really just baldly commercial.The plot is full of characters that are 2-dimensional sterotypes, from the neurotic Indian advertising artist to the guru in the desert. With its breathtaking pretentions, it is not even as good as a TV sitcom.Not recommended. Watch Mork & Mindy or re-runs of the original Saturday night live instead, if you want a genuine 70s experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"I loved \\"Jitterbug Perfume\\" and thought I'd enjoy \\"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\\" as well. I couldn't even get through half of it. Robbins is WAY too wordy and relies too much on the gag that Sissy's huge thumbs make her an excellent hitchhiker. The characters are one dimensional and the storyline was SO boring I couldn't stand it. I can only assume that Robbins had already become famous by this point and thus refused any help from his editors to spice up his syntax and trim out the fat."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGGGGHH I want the last 2 weeks of my life back","review":"I was attracted to the title, but really after the reading the first page, I knew in my heart of hearts that this book should only be read if you are stoned from sun up to sun down.

A weak score tied to a silly book gives us one of the poorest examples of a Tony winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a single weak link in this cast!","review":"The thing that struck me the most about this recording is that there is not a single bad casting choice or weak link. Sutton Foster is positively luminous as Millie, Marc Kudisch is hysterically stiff as Trevor Graydon, Gavin Creel is adorable as Jimmy and Harriet Harris is fabulously evil as Mrs. Meers.If you're looking for an old fashioned musical with a contemporary sensibility, this is definitely one you should pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no!","review":"I had to rip this out of the player and put on the film soundtrack just to stop the surge of depression.

Of course she has...I mean, the girl has been playing the role for over 2 years now...maybe even longer. But she really sounds settled and AMAZING!There are some really great numbers in this show.

The songs were fun and infectiously toe-tapping, the sets gleamingly art-deco, and the costumes were bright and lovely, but they had to go damage it with that whole ...

I went and saw the show after it won the tony for Best Musical, and expected something special. The only thing special about this show and the cd is the performance of Sutton Foster. She is funny, bright and has a nice voice. Sadly, the material is beneath her and the performance.There are two memorable songs in this show, both sung by Sutton Foster. The rest of the show is a mess and a waste of time. I laughed twice in the entire 2 and a half hour show. The songs don't belong anywhere near a broadway stage, and the fact that it is still running is just sad. One or two love songs in a show is fine...but this show has love song after love song, and they aren't catchy, hummable or even mediocre! There is nothing special about the show \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie,\\" just Sutton Fosters performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roaring 20's Fun","review":"If you'd like a pick -me -up, this is the show to listen to. Great music, a wonderful score, and just fun to listen to. Sutton Foster is just great in the lead. (I think her first show.) If you saw the movie, well, not so crazy, but the basics are still there. It would help a lot if you can catch a touring company or even a high school production. Then the music would make more sense. But try it, you'll like it. I'm only sorry I missed the B'way original.

The reviewer who said it would erase after 6-7 times has a much better toy than ours--you can still see his markings clearly after that many times! I had bought my son a similar toy at Wal-Mart before he received the Doodle Pro, and I have to say, the $4.96 Wal-Mart toy works way better than the Doodle Pro.

This is a modern roots record with heart and teeth, the lyrics full of acute observation, heady inspiration, and Jah praiseology. This record belongs in the top 20 most essential reggae albums you need in your collection. The track listing says there's 14 songs, but the cd offers an unnamed 15th, a paen to South Africa and freedom which, though dated, nudges up to Marley's \\"Redemption Song\\" as one of the \\"Songs Most Likely to Produce Goosebumps on Your Soul's Skin.\\" Just buy it, okay?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a delightfull movie","review":"Finding a good movie is like looking for a good food, you have to know your taste buds. This is a delightfull movie but for the content which is gut-wrenching. Manisha Koirala, is an underestimated actress who thrives in the portrayal of a prostitute in the Bazzar (Market). The script is written by the characters that we see in the inner sanctums of decadent society of corrupt law and legal System. Like \\"Haasil,\\" another down to the core movie that parlays the inner cities this movie exposes the ruthless atrocities unabashedly with real dialect and acting. The movie does not waste time on mundane stuff but comes with a message that is so blunt that keeps you thinking and admiring for the courage to bring to the surface the ills of the Society that should be cured not band-aided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book to read & learn","review":"This is the worst Tax book I have ever read.

Bob Kane is no longer with us, so as a Bat fan it was great to see him in person and draw the batman while taking shots at Stan because (at that time) the batman movie was HUGE and Stan had no deals with any of his characters.

I don't understand the awards for animation. With the exception of the animated humans, it was remarkably un-remarkable to watch. The monotony of the black and white with the weird sexual shapes, sounds and overtones was rather disgusting in a childrens animated movie.I'm no prude I assure you, but I don't appreciate watching a \\"family movie\\" with the rather startling moans and groans that these penguins \\"sing.\\" Gross.Too Bad.

There are scenes when two of his characters are in the same frame and it seems like his accents merged.Second, This movie lacks a real plot. It gives the impression that it is a movie about the penguin getting acceptance for not being like other penguins, but then they add in an adventure that has very little to do with moving the story along. It does make the movie a lot longer than it should have been. It also makes you check how much time is left.Third, The most enjoyable part of this movie was the mixture of music. It was interesting how they would take two or three different hit songs and merge them.If you have young children who want to watch a cute penguin movie I would look for Scamper the Penguin movie from the mid 1990s. That is a great penguin movie.Scamper the Penguin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie!","review":"I'm an adult and I have seen this movie twice. I love it!

But from the very beginning it had sexual undertones and clearly made fun of people of faith.The main character Mumbo seemed to be on a quest to \\"enlighten'the faithful and traditional penguins. I can also bring up how they portrayed the traditional penguins as ignorant, close minded and unforgiving. There is a not so subtle message that we as humans are responsible for the disasters throughout the world. In the movie humans are refered to as \\"The Annihilators.\\" I cannot believe it won an oscar. Must be the same people who gave Al Gore's movie an award. I would not recommend this movie for anybody. It was a horrible and disgusting display of political propeganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST MOVIE EVER MADE ! 0 OUT OF 10","review":"Within the first few minutes of watching Happy Feet I was screaming it was so bad . This movie features the worst music ever, known as R&B. I wanted to go and impale myself on the nearest sharp object throughout the entire movie. The movie doesn't do anything to revitalize the movie industry, it's just another crappy animated movie like Chicken Little and Meet the Robinsons. No part of this movie was enjoyable and it felt like I was being mind-raped in my music and movie tastes section.Well,I didn't kill myself from the agony of this movie, but I better not go near any penguins because I now have the urge to beat the living crap out of a penguin for every bad penguin movie I see."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks!","review":"I saw this movie yesterday at my brother's house, one of my nieces and my sister in law thought it was a great movie. To borrow from the Ferris Buehler movie, \\"I weep for the future.\\" Most of the penguins look pretty much the same so how to tell them apart? Make one Marilyn Monroe and give the rest ethnic accents. There's russian, jewish, jamaican, scottish, hispanic, etc. And then there are the covers of decent songs, re-done for the generation that thinks America Idol is good TV. Morals aside this was just a rip-off of culture to make a lot of cash. And guess what? I just saw the preview of the next penguin movie, this time they go surfing. Just like Fonzie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....Yeah....","review":"....three children (2, 6, & 7) walked away from the large screen surround sound TV about 20 minutes into this movie.

This show is hard to watch without a chilled bottle of Pepto Bismal and a curly straw.It's not quality like Disney. Not even close. No adult humor - no story or plot, just bad singing & Penguins.This movie has a story you could sum up in three sentences.1. All penguins sing to attract a mate.2. There is one little retarded penguin that can't sing, but he can tap dance.3. Evenually, after 1 hour and 20 minutes of boring melodrama, the penguin of his dreams realizes that she was shallow, and she now appreciates his dancing.Avoid this. Especially in Hi Def."},{"rating":"1","title":"Candidate for the all-time worst 100 list","review":"An anti-family film in the guise of a family film, this one takes its target audience, children, into the adult world of its creators.

My 4 year old daughter was bored to tears and stopped watching after 10 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, yes. Best animated feature, nope.","review":"Happy feet started out strong, a penguin who doesn't fit in uses his special ability to overcome adversity. Nice plot line. Halfway into the film I was trying to understand how it beat out Cars - arguably Pixar's best effort yet - for best animated feature. Once I saw the environmentalist conclusion then I understood.Nice CGI, again not as good as Cars. Felt like it was longer than it needed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Al Gore, lttle story","review":"The movie was an environmental film that tried hard to get in a message with little story being the result. I gave it 2 stars just because the \\"latino penguins\\" added a small bit of much needed humor.Basically a penguin gets exiled by the leading \\"pastor penguin\\" because he dances and in his journey he discovers how mankind are destroying the planet. He then dances for the humans and their hearts begin to open to the fact that they should stop fishing and stealing all the penguins fish.And that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"There is very little further criticism that I can give this movie that hasn't already been said in the previously posted negative reviews. I watched it on a trans-atlantic flight and I have to say that the leg cramping and constant up and down to allow my neighbor to exit were more entertaining and a better use of my time. As a positive reviewer said - it's a kid's movie. I agree if only because I'd hate to think anyone with greater than a third grade education would be entertained by this. Many writers and producers of children's movies have managed to make them entertaining for both children and adults, a skill in which Pixar leads the way. Alas, this is not a Pixar film. The only thing of comprable quality is the animation and there's only so much time that will buy when nothing else is worthy of note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Propoganda","review":"Remember when Mary Poppin's said \\"a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down\\"? This movie is saying: \\"a spoonful of cute dancing penguins helps the policital propoganda go down.\\"This is not a kids movie. It is a cartoon aimed at drawing a wide audience (especially kids), in order to force feed them the directors views on morality, homosexuality, and environmentalism.The political undertones and overtones in this movie are so blatant and obvious it is ridiculous.If you want Hollywood to be your moral compass, then this movie is perfect for you, otherwise stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie","review":"This is a very funny enjoyable movie. I don't think that many children would understand it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penguin Porn","review":"So very boring, full of innuendo, absurd story, & soooo very long! And the sexuality! I mean, really, the penguins are getting it on! How can a director who can make such a fantastic variety of movies (Mad Max & Babe) make this turkey? The trailers & commercials for this movie were totally misleading. It doesn't just stick to the social misfit plot. I was shocked it got an oscar nod and worse, won over two vastly superior movies, Cars and Monster House. MH should have won!!!! I would have given this one a razzie, if they had an animated category. See Surf's Up instead of this if you're a penguin lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I didn't hate this as much as some people did, but it was not that entertaining to me either. It was cute idea, but they really messed it up. The kids probably won't like it. I don't know what audience they were aiming for, but this movie fails for any audience. I didn't think the animation was all that wonderful when compared to many other current animated films.Skip this one and get: \\"Ice Age, The Meltdown\\" instead. It's a much better movie, a lot funnier, much more upbeat and everyone will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute movie, but probably not for kids.","review":"I adore penguins, so of course I couldn't miss this movie. I saw it in the theaters and bought it when it came out on DVD. Really cute story. Some plot holes perhaps, but it was adorable enough to make up for it. Only reason I gave it 4 stars was some of the music was too \\"hip-hopy\\" for me. Otherwise, it was great.A must for penguin lovers everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Feet","review":"The quality of the DVD is excellent but the subject matter is somewhat disturbing. The movie is aimed at children but the problems mentioned in the movie (arctic pollution, overfishing, etc.) cannot be resolved easily and the movie's resolution is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up, it's a cute movie!","review":"Come on people. lighten it, it's just a fun light hearted movie, not everything is meant to be so serious, it's meant to make you laugh, my 16 year old nephew and 9 year old nephew thought it was hilarious, it's a cute movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FEEL GOOD MOVIE!!!","review":"I am an older person whose kids are grown and out of the house so I have those good and bad/lonely days but this movie is a fixer for that!

I can understand buying this for kids and grandkids - It is an adorable film! Buy it for yourself or kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good animation movie...","review":"The movie was pretty good overall. The beginning was really good and super cute. The graphics are superb! I really enjoyed the variety and mix of music in the movie. Once the little penguin grew up, it seemed a little lacking. Maybe it's voice of Elijah Woods or the rest of the storyline...I was just disappointed in the how the rest of the movie was played out. The adventures were great, but the ending wasn't really a bang...at least it had a positive ending. Overall, the movie is a keeper and kids will really enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAPPY FEET","review":"Happy Feet is a movie that would draw attention to parents and children alike and both can associate with the issues in this movie.

The movie is entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The only reason why I stayed and watched the movie the whole way through was because I paid to see it. Awful movie. Not entertaining at all. It was just so poor. The animation wasn't fantastic. Political messages shouldn't be in children movies. Not a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not meant for children","review":"I was horribly disappointed by the first two minutes of this film. Why only the first two minutes? Because that is all that I watched. I rented it to watch with my five-year-old daughter, for I had heard great things about this film. Well, the movie opens with a female penguin singing a song by Prince,... \\"you don't have to be beautiful to turn me on... All I want is your body from dusk till dawn....\\" In the background, the male panguing are singing, \\"Let's talk aboue Ex, baby,\\" to the tune of, you guessed it, let's talk about sex, baby. I felt this was very inappropriate for children. My husband stopped the DVD and we didn't even watch it.And, yes, I am very protective of my children and what they watch, but if I don't do it, who will?So, if you worry about the sexual inuendo's that have the ability to influence your children, I reccomend finding something different to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy Feet, Sad flick","review":"After all the hype and advertising that I saw on TV I thought it was a winner. Much to my dismay rather than a winner it was a wiener. After 15 minutes of this animated wonder I was bored.

It just wasn't my cup of tea. It had too muchsinging in it and too much dancing. It just isn't that good.The movie needed a different story line. Nothing much to itexcept for happy feet trying to figure out why the fish wasdisappearing. Not worth buying. I am 31 years old. Boringfor adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weird religious/anti-religious messages","review":"I wish Hollywood would stick to entertainment only if it cannot teach kids anything ethical. Happy Feet has a faint moral message - care for the environment, but even that is heavily politicized and serves to piggyback ride a leftist anti-religious propaganda sprinkled with sexually implicit song lyrics and dialogues:\\"You don't have to be beautiful to turn me on / I just need your body, baby, from dusk till dawn.\\"It had to get an Oscar, had it not?It made me wonder what age group is Happy Feet addressed to? It is unsuitable for children, too tiresome for most adults, \\"lame\\" to teenagers.The other day television said that Madonna doesn't let her kids watch television. She's a smart mom that Madonna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth watching twice","review":"I have three kids that will watch a movie over and over again, even if the movie is not that good. Not once have they requested to watch this one again. We watched it once.To be fair, I caught it about halfway through when my kids were watching it, and I stood with my hands on my hips trying to figure out what the movie was about. Once I figured it out...I didn't like it. Stinky.I am annoyed that even though I read many of the negative reviews on Amazon, I still bought it. I just don't think that the way it was marketed was fair. It's not a feel good story with dancing penguins. It's a bummer. Okay, done.Good animation, though. 1.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for little kids...or grown ups","review":"I bought this movie for toddler, although I had heard that the story was not good, I though she would like the music and the dancing (she loves music) I was sooo wrong! I was expecting either catchy kidie songs or the musical type. Instead the soundtrack consists of great classics, but manny of them are not appropiate for little children and most are butchered with arrangemets \\"ala Chistina Aguilera\\".Besides that, some characters seem to sexualized and, is it my imagination or Mumble really slaps Gloria on the but while dancing?.I am not a conservative, but I found this movie to have messeges and/or portails of intolerance, indolence, bad parenting, sexualized behavior and stereotyping, among other things.And besides, the story is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"It's official: I cannot stand films for children anymore; if wasn't made before 1975, I'm not watching it.\\"Happy Feet\\" left me almost gasping; I thought it would never end. The songs, the singing, the gospel choir cacophany of it all - all very Mariah Caryish - left my head pounding. Most appalling, are the sexual inuendos; unlike in nature, you could identify the female penguins by their gyrating hips. Entertainment for the whole family? Why? Films should made, unapologetically, to delight children. Period. Enough with the double entendres, the \\"adult\\" humour, the political jabs, etc. Ditto for the \\"message\\" that always has to be there: Save the fish! Don't be mean! Don't judge!

The propaganda was so in your face that it puts Bambi to shame. If you want your children to be unecessarily scared by a number of animals with large teeth, then take them to see this movie. If you want your children to learn that their elders are out of touch and full of nonsense, take them to see this movie. If you want your children to cry because they eat fishsticks, take them to see this movie. If you want your children to carry guilt for going to the zoo, take them to see this movie. It's one thing to knowingly pay to see Farenheight 911, it's a whole 'nother thing to pay for propaganda unknowingly and to submit children to it.When we walked out of the theater, I asked our kids what the movie was about. \\"Scary animals?\\", \\"Bad people who steal penguins food?\\". The fluffy and cute main character didn't even stick out to them. What a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon unbox poor quality","review":"I purchased this movie with Amazon unbox. I downloaded it to my high def series 3 Tivo. It was very disappointing. The picture was little on my high def screen. It is a letter boxed standard def program which looks very very small on a high def screen. I even tried changing the aspect on my television. No improvement. Come on Amazon, you know what type of Tivo I have, Tivo knows what type of television I have, let's produce something that is at least watchable on every setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-Stop Enjoyment","review":"Shows that being an individual has its own rewards. Hilariously funny, one of the best times I've had at the movies in years. And the animation was equal to about anything I've seen come out of Pixar/Disney. So there were some sexual connotations, that's what Emperor Penguin singing is all about. Finding the right song, from the right Penguin of the opposite sex to mate with. That was the shame of Mumble's lack of singing talent.Also shows the conservation value of a few captive species. The better to appreciate creatures we probably would never have a chance to see in the wild. \\"Out-of-sight, out-of-mind\\". Thus the fate of the Penguins and their need for fish in order to survive was championed. If only the nations of the world would realize, that we must gather food from the sea sparingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and just wrong","review":"Children's movies are NOT the forum for adult propaganda. Children do not have the capacity to see the lop sided message for what it is, and they become overly emotional and fearful. Save the sermon for appropriate venues. Sucking parents into a theater with their children expecting to see a fun, happy movie and then shoving a viewpoint on them and scaring the hell out of the kids is inappropriate and irresponsible.In addition, I was bored to death. This is just anothe sappy rerun of a long list of gooey gunk. Small children will be fascinated by the dancing and singing litte penguins (until the horror of the evil humans show up). Adults and older kids will sit there rolling their eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so happy feet","review":"I was excited about this one coming out. I love the cast, great actors. It is very slow to start and is kinda mind-numbing! Starts to get better once Robin Williams' character comes in because before that there is not even an attempt at a laugh. Not much in the form of a villian either. Not thrilled by the choice of music, not the normal great selection as with other cartoon favorites! I did however like the integregration of live action with the rest of the animation without looking roger rabbity about it. Overall a snoozer and not worth the time.

It's a thought-provoking film in that it shows how divided people's way of thinking is. How can anyone not have a heart and not care what happens to our Earth and see how unbalanced she is? Money has always ruled over the planet and the animals ... look at the mess it's in now!

They always seem to do this with movies that are this popular, they wait so many months then make this other one that has more features on it. And of course your kids are going to want this one too just because of the new features!!!! They do the same thing to all the Disney movies plus others like Titanic!!! About the real people they put in at the end, I don't think it's because they didn't have faith in making them CG. I think that because the Penguins looked so life-like that they thought it would look better if they used real people, because so far in CG of making people that it's the people that look more fake than anything else. Like the people in Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and even Shrek just to name a few. Yes I said Shrek!

The animation is great, the penguins were delightful and the story was progressing nicely then all of a sudden we have a shift to propaganda for environmental causes, our hero imprisoned and going slightly mad and being down trodden by his own tribe once again.

Not a kid's movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy feet not so happy","review":"I wanted to watch this since it was on the theaters. Now I am just wondering what all the excitement was about. This is a rather dark film. It doesn't have the happyness, joy, or even sadness of the first Toy Story. It's just a dark moody film. There is very little time when you think something good will actually happen.On the good side, the human faces were some of the best done (unless they were real faces) in computer animation.The movie also looks good on HD Tivo. Unfortunately Amazon still doen't have very many animated movies.

Don't blame the movie for some of the sexy songs (which I thought were very funny and well done) when they warned you upfront with a big \\"PG\\" label. Take some responsibility and do a little research before not hiring a babysitter for the night. :-)I didn't find the environmental message to be over the top either but the movie is definitely two parts-- part 1 being about learning tolerance and cute penguins and part 2 about taking care of your environment and semi-stupid humans.But overall they did blend the two parts well and I laughed out loud so many times I had to buy this movie as soon as it came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"*YAWN* HOW BORING AND OVERRATED","review":"THIS IS PATHETIC.

My wife and I watched it after putting our daughter to bed, and while it might not be too scary for older kids, this is nothing I'd go out of my way to expose my kids to.

It was really, really hard to follow.Robin Williams played like, 5 characters and they all were hilarious. It was the only part of the movie that was not in line with the stupid enviromentalist agenda that was being forced into the innocent minds of kids. Why would you have a movie(made for humans)about humans being the evil ones? Should we all go hug a tree and ask it to turn us into penguins?This movie is warped.

In response to the people that thought the movie had too many sexual innuendos, how many kids got it? When they sang the song to the tune of Let's Talk About Sex, the only kid that will get that is one that heard the song before. Let's face it, if that is the fact, then you are a horrible person. I think movie makers that introduce little jabs for the adults (like in Shrek) makes the movie more of one a parent is willing to watch with the little ones. Let's face it, if more parents were willing to watch Teletubbies and Strawberry Shortcake then they might have never added adult humor.

I didn't mind the songs too much, but this scene just went too far. The kids got what was going on as well.

Impressive visuals can't hide the fact that this movie is terrible. The plot is mediocre (singing penguins discriminate a dancing penguin, LAME.) No memorable characters. The adult penguins are ugly,especially in HD, they could have at least made them \\"cute\\". The main character (dancing penguin)lacks charisma. The voice acting is bland and uninspiring, it's as if the actors are reading from the script instead of acting it out. Any Disney animated film would put these voice actors to shame. And it would've been nice if the penguins performed songs made specifically for the film ala Disney, but it seems like the Happy Feet songs are borrowed from the radio. I hate to be comparing this to Disney. But Disney is the gold standard by which all others are measured by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!","review":"I loved the diversity in music in this film! There was a great mix that went well with the story, making it enjoyable for adults as well as children. There are some PG-13 moments with very slight hints to 'reproduction', so parents will want to view it first and determine if it's age appropriate for their youngster. The story is a wonderful tale about a penguin that doesn't have a song in his voice because it's in his feet. If he can't find his own heart-song, how will he ever find a mate? The movie touches on environmental themes, references to being different and finding your own unique qualities, as well as introductions to other cultures. The music plays a key role and is very well woven into the screenplay. Overall, I thought it was very enjoyable and none of the issues the story was trying to highlight were 'preachy'.

Second, the music lyrics are not appropriate for children - unless sexual innuendo is what you deem appropriate for children. Lastly, the move is anti-religious.

The songs are completely inappropriate for the kids who watch this. Every other second the penguins start singing. The seconds they're not, they talk about how hungry they are. (News flash: penguins aren't endagered.) But what really bothered me was how political it was.

Let alone the larger plot of we are destroying the land and outer lying lands of animals, causing problems we didn't know about, and we need to become more aware. Yeah, the little kids really understood that!! I think it was too long, too PC - just too P period.

And the sexism and sexual innuendoes and heavy judgments from the main penguins father and entire social community ostracizing him. The character we are suppose to like,.. how he teats the female penguin that likes him is immature and terrible. All very disturbing.

I was sorely disappointed. The movie did wildlife a huge disservice by casting leopard seals and killer whales as little more than evil predators. Neither species is evil. Both do what they have evolved to do. Lending some moral superiority to penguins which eat fish (and hence is a predator), while not extending the same respect to seals and whales is wrong-headed at best. It confused my nephew and caused him to want to kill whales and seals. All in all, a huge waste of time. Plus the mexican slurs provided by Robin Williams should have been removed, very insensitive.

He became obsessed with it He would not want to play with anything else and asked me to buy more and more Thomas toys. I made tests on him and he showed developmental delays. Two child psychologists and two Occupational therapists told me that it is statistically common that children become too obsessed with this particular toy and they show developmental delays. Therefore, I got rid of all the thomas collection and my child is now again on track for his age. But It took me some time to correct his behavior with therapies. I would not recommend this toy for any child. If your child gets too obsessed with it, discard it and do yourself a favor, do not buy the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute","review":"would have loved it more..if i didnt have to buy it seperate from the 100 piece wooden train set.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for two year old","review":"This is a great purchase for a two year old who love Thomas and/or trains of any kind.

After all the hilarious religious commentary in his other books, it just seemed silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word","review":"**SPOILERS**to describe this book would be deplorable. I HATE the main characters Diamond and the ever superficial bimbo Gwen Mati. A friend of mine raved about Tom Robbins and what a brilliant writer he is. This is the first book I read about Tom Robbins and I am thoroughly disappointed. Reading the chapter where the little superficial bimbo walks into Diamond's bathroom was a no brainer to find out that they would end up doing the nasty and I mean the \\"nasty\\" in every sense of the word. For a moment I felt I was reading one of those sleazy Harlequin novels. I have nothing against including sex in novels, however this was too sleazy for my taste. For me personally this book was bland and lacked context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Drummer","review":"What an interesting book. I don't care much for the stock market or frogs or aliens but I loved this book. So many twists and turns my head is still spinning. Gwen is a wonderful character. Her evolution was intriguing. This is my first Robbins' book but I'm ordering more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I read and deeply enjoyed Robbin's first 5 books, so picked this one up with a sense of anticipation. The merciful thing is that I was quickly disappointed and not left lingering for hope. It was readable, barely, and there were some clever plot devices and ideas, but the whole thing didn't hang together, seemed very silly and contrived, and pretty insulting since it was 2nd person and 'you' are apparently a shallow stockbroker who dosen't know herself at all.Read his other books, skip this one. Even if you're a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining despite use of 2nd person narration","review":"I suppose Tom Robbins used the 2nd person voice just to prove it could be done outside of the \\"Choose Your Own Adventure\\" genre.

What was interesting - albeit disappointing - was that there was a moment near the end of the book when she could have (finally) decided to do the right thing and redeem herself...but she didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up folk","review":"I don't read Tom Robbins for meaning, story, plot, characterization, or any of the other things I might look for in conventional fiction. I suspect he would scoff at the notion that he is somehow presenting a philosophy. I read Tom Robbins for his exquisite word play and his unending ability to fuel my sense of the absurd.C'mon. Who else would define \\"rapscallion\\" as a hip-hop onion?Given the two reasons I read his work, this book scores on both counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck","review":"I have read all seven of Robbins' other novels, and loved them all, in varying degrees.

This is the latest book of his that I read and while it has its moments, metaphors and similes you never thought possible, strange characters and unique perspectives, it didn't quite grip my attention the way some of his other works have. When Robbins is at his best, he manages to tie together seemingly disparate elements be it perfume and immortality, the dance of the seven veils and missing household objects, Camel cigarettes and redheads... perhaps this connection between Timbuktu, frogs, the stock market and cures for cancer didn't quite intrigue me as much.I'll never tell anyone not to read a book, but I would advise you not to read this one first. Don't let your first impression of Tom Robbins be the wrong one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Book","review":"I have never been so disappointed with a book in my life. A so called friend gave me this book and told me i just HAD to read this. I wasted one day of my life that I'll never get back.

But that's just my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You have insomnia","review":"You are reading a novel which describes everything in the second person, written by a fairly hip writer who is known for his brash style, and you wonder why. With each flip of the page you ponder what keeps your attention. It reads like a choose-your-own-adventure book but not nearly as fun. You develop a faint interest in Timbuktu, but you don't give a fig about any of the characters in the book and actualy start to get annoyed with several of them. You start to get sleepy, but you keep reading anyway. You want to finish this book, because you think there will be a point. Then you think about Timbuktu again and wish you had an issue of National Geographic that told you more about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre, fascinating, wonderful!","review":"I loved this book. I've read all six books that Tom Robbins has published (so far! ) and I have to say, it's the only one that I liked as much the second . . . or third . . . or fourth time through. _Woodpecker_ came close . . . but no. The first time I read it I was confused out of my mind the first time through. It's in second person -- not first, or third, or both like _Roadside_ -- and it takes a while to get the info everyone likes to know about the main character -- name, what she looks like, etc. But the flaws so evident in _Skinny Legs and All_ -- to me anyways -- are absent in this book. An overly broad focus seemed to be his downfall in _SLAA_, and in _HAIFP_, the focus is so tight that . . . well, it's very tight. Let's just hope that the new one is as good (or better?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was a big fan of \\"Another Roadside Attraction\\" and \\"Cowgirls,\\" and wish that Robbins could rediscover the empathy and affection he had for the characters in these books. Gwendolyn, the stockbroker heroine of \\"Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas,\\" is fairly unlikeable, which is okay with me. A much bigger problem is what a thin character she is. And why on earth Robbins decided to use the second person voice to tell this story is completely beyond me since he so frequently slides out of Gwendolyn's perspective to deliver lengthy musings that seem far more in character with the author's sensibility than with hers. By the end, I became a weary of Robbins showing off at the expense of his characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosmic Conjecture or Metaphor Mania?","review":"This book may set a new record (even for Robbins) for gratuitous metaphors. The one-minute story line: young, churn-and-burn stockbroker with boring, born-again boyfriend (complete with kleptomaniac monkey) meets former stock-guru now amphibian-wannabe with serious Sirius (dog star) leanings for a madcap Easter weekend, metaphor-laden talkathon.In spite of its over abundance of metaphors and turtle pace, I enjoyed the book and the cosmic conjectures of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book ever!","review":"This was the first book I read from Tom and by time I was finished I was ashamed that I had not taken the time to read his work earlier.

It was uncomfortable looking and a sea of leopard print, red, and nude materials. It was hard to make out exactly what it was. the baby hated it, he couldn't find his hands to get to his teething mouth with all the material. Needless to say, we nixed it. Perhaps if I cut out some room for legs, it will look food on him next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly...","review":"I always hated this book.

Did those parents have any concern for their biological child? There's a difference between making eased contact and the route they took, which comes across as irresponsible and selfish. It makes having any sympathy for this side impossible - all mine was for Susan and the wretched situation these people put her through.

So the introduction carries you over and you cannot let go until you are done reading. Ms. Tan is wonderfully talented writer with a story to tell that relates to any generation. Knowing that my husband would probably not read the book by his choice (book about four women and their daugthters, was not quite a good pitch), I rented a movie and had him see it. After seeing the movie which keeps very close to the plot in the book, my husband was finally ready to read the book himself.

I feel the same way for other novel-turned movies. Like John Grisham, Danielle Steel, to name a few. Joy Luck, I found was very enjoyable, entertaining, and heartfelt. Good job Amy Tan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and shallow","review":"My first Amy Tan book and probably my last. Joy Luck Club is mostly fluff. This book offers little to the reader.Writing style is not particularly good.No interesting insights into Chinese Americans.Nothing educational about China, the old country.Not particaularly well researched.There are lots of better books to read if you are interested in any of the above areas. Ha Jin, a Chinese American is an outstanding writer. You will learn a lot about China and be entertained. \\"Wild Swans\\" is an very educational non-fiction that reads like fiction. I recommend skipping this one and going for the better quality books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Buying","review":"I was about to buy this kindle book but the price was 44% higher than the paperback version.

I expected the second section of the novel (Scar), to be a continuation of the first part (The Joy Luck Club).

Sorry Amy, but that's the truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finer core novels.","review":"I was required to read this for my Honors English class freshman year. It was definitely interesting, but I found it hard to relate to on some levels because it is for such a female-oriented audience, and I wasn't able to identify with the foreign alienation that comes with being a Chinese immigrant.The story is brisk at some times, yet scathingly slow in a couple parts. Nevertheless, the characters are all interesting and provide something different for every reader, and for every time you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem I had with this novel is that...","review":"...it makes up stories about Asian culture. For instance, Tan describes how a women's worth is measured by the \\"loudness of her husband's belch.\\" Where in Chinese history or Chinese literature or Chinese culture do you have Chinese men measuring the worth of women by how well they feed them? Speaking of food, Tan describes a story about a duck that wants to be a swan [this is obviously the Ugly Duckling influence (a Western influence)]. Chinese people eat ducks. If you go around San Fran Chinatown and look through some of the restaurants, you'll notice cooked ducks on display for food. Swans signify romantic love because the Chinese admire how they mate for life. Sure, the novel is good (structurally) and it does help feminist causes and such, but why do it in spite of my culture? To me, it's not fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST BOOKS ever!!!","review":"THE best book on assimilation and one of the best books ever!These daughters struggle to find a place in both a new American culture and a native Chinese one.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Joy Luck Club, about the realtionships between 4 old-fashioned Chinese mothers and each of their Chinese-American daughters, despite a few snooze sections. The novel is broken up into 16 mini-stories, two for each mother, and two for each daughter. I was really interested in the way that each vignette's plot is intertwined in with the others, although the stories between each generation are somewhat similar. Generally, females might enjoy reading this book more than male readers, but that is just an opinion that my class decided upon. If you enjoy light but interesting reading, then try reading this novel.

This time around, I enjoyed it. It is hard to follow, but if you split the names up. And think what they did, it may help.The story is about mother's and daughter's relationships. Mostly, the asian mother's being able to relate to their daughter's which they did not seem to do well. The mother's did not understand them and the daughter's did not understand their mother. I would recommend this for anyone who has a book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Joy Luck Club-A Review","review":"The Joy Luck Club written by Amy Tan (also the author of The Hundred Secret Senses) is an entertaining novel of four Chinese mothers and four Chinese American daughters. All the mothers get together to play Mah-jongg and talk about their Chinese lives. While the daughters try and forget that they are Chinese. Only until each daughter experiences problems where only their mother can be the one to offer advice do they really appreciate their heritage.The Joy Luck Club's short stories fit together well and each one has a meaning to think about. I found myself actually thinking of what each story meant and how it could relate to my life. However, I do not know how authentic the novel represents the Chinese culture because I do not know very much about their culture. I gave this book a 4 because it is well written and has moral value, however it did drag on in parts. If you would like to read a book about mothers and daughters that has value I would suggest The Joy Luck Club."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Joy Luck Club- A Wonderful Book","review":"The Joy Luck Club, written by Amy Tan, was an absolutely amazing book. It tells the story of the past and present lives of four mothers, and their four daughters. The four mothers were the originators of the Joy Luck Club. Each mother was one of the \\"winds\\" at the mahjong table. The way Tan switched stories each chapter was quite interesting. The next chapter had no relation to the previous chapter, so it really had us focused on that story. My favorite story was the story about Suyuan Woo's life, and her unfinished business in China"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was caught by surprise....","review":"I had heard of this book many times since the movie came out. I avoided the movie because I felt that it would have nothing to do with me (So of course I avoided the book). This semester, for a college fiction class, I read it. I was expecting a bunch of dribble (sorry Amy) which wouldn't relate to me at all. I was caught off guard by how interested I became. Actually I was disappointed once I reached the end because I wanted it to continue.The writing style and symbolism is remarkable. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is considering reading it.Everything I ever wanted in a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't award writers for over-sensationalizing reality!","review":"I guess it's politically correct for me to say this since I am Chinese. Frankly, I think many ethnic writers, including Ms. Tan, sensationalize their cultural backgrounds to get themselves on the top-selling lists. Tan's portrayal of Chinese characters are real only to those with a vague understanding of Asian Americans, people whose sole judgement are based on stereotypes and who actually think that Chinese people speak in cheesy metaphors, such as \\"Tigers waiting in trees.\\" I do wonder how deep an understanding Ms. Tan has for Chinese culture herself..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Joyful","review":"I'm probably the only person in the world that feels this way, but I was not impressed with this book. Despite the stories being interrelated, they felt disjoined and random. There was no central plot that I could find to make the book a success in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fodder for those who crave sanitized Eastern Mysticism","review":"How true it is, when Jesus notes that the prophet is often rejected in his own hometown. However, sometimes this happens, not without good reason. As an Asian male raised in the Far East, I can assure you that my traditional Chinese grandparents did not speak in vague metaphors about \\"tigers waiting in the trees\\", which is, at best, laughable. The Asian male bashing is as unsubtle as one gets as Tan attempts to portray the downtrodden Asian females in a patriachal society (which it admittedly was) without anything positive to say about men in that context. This book does a fair amount of harm by perpetuating stereotypes about Chinese culture. Perhaps the only redeeming factor is the clever use of juxtaposition of the stories of the mothers and daughters to form a comprehensible whole.The Washington Post claims this book is \\"Powerful as Myth\\". I'd have to agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gosh, what can I say? . . . WOW!","review":"I am only half-way through this book and I have seen the movie four times.

A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Joyluck for the Chinaman","review":"The novel exhibits a one dimensional, Westernized perspective of the often complex Chinese social interactions in particular and East Asian in general. It overtly awashes in sentimenal values in place of balanced objectivity, insults the integrity of a proud tradition, and reinforced pervasive stereotypes of Asian men by dehumanizing them as abusively rigid, asexual misogynist. Conversely, the work generally depicts Chinese women as scheming, sexually submissive victims---a kind of yellow noble savage (ie, Madame Butterfly, Miss Saigon). Western audiences and Asian self-haters may praise it for the novel's allege cultural richness because it reinforces their long held prejudices of those \\"fresh off the boats.\\" However, most Asian male reviewers of this melodrama finds it repugnant and deeply offensive. A work of literary luminary? Think not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"This is the first book I ever remember having an emotional connection with.

I haven't read it in several years but will do so again soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow Read","review":"The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan was a very slow read and I had a very difficult time getting into the story. What was interesting to me was that the women were so rude to one another although there were glimpses of kindness. These women lived in difficult times, indured injustice and yet they didn't support one another with graciousness. Amy Tan reveals the Chinese culture and the difficult transition from China to America. This story begs the question \\"How well do you really know your mother?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Its about making life a part of us regardless of location","review":"Human emotions remain unchanged through time and its a given that different generations who believe that their perspective of life is different and unique usually always come to a point were they discover that they are only making an interpretation of minor varitions of the same tune.In this book most of the characters feel that the common element that define them as persons is their chinese ethnicity. However, as you read their stories a subtle veil starts to open and they perceive points of connection to their elders, other members of the family and the nation which is now theier country, which is by far wider that initially they ever imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Fan of Tan","review":"I have to admit I saw the movie before I read the book but I was so curious I just had to get my hands on it. The book is always better right? Well I have to say I think I enjoyed the movie just as much, if not more, than the book. I guess I'm just a sucker, but what heartache! I felt every betrayal, every lie, every hopeless decision these women had to make in their families lives. If you're a woman, of any race, these books should be a rite of passage. It's so heartwrenching to see what few options these women really had, and how they had to succumb to their husbands wishes in order to keep their families together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Joy Luck Club, by JY","review":"I read this book for a school project and am very pleased with the overall story. The stories for each character were intriguing and kept me reading to find out what happens next.Each daughter/mother pair has a different relationship that they are each trying to figure out. The mothers find that they have passed on their misfortunes to their daughters, while the daughters themselves are not aware of it, because of their need to rebel against their mothers. Growing up in an American society, with Chinese influences is hard for the girls, which is the reason why they do not understand their mothers' views.The novel was an excellent quality piece and I would recommend it to almost anyone. Even some of the male population should try it out, because they might be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was too boring and did not interest me at all.","review":"Amy did alright for this being her first book but she jumped around too much and I lost track of it.

However, \\"abridged\\" means just that: whole paragraphs and pages are left out! There are no warnings or any cues about when the narrator plans to skip ahead. By the time readers figure out what has happened, they have missed key ideas. My kids were so lost by the time we got to page 23, that we just quit. This recording might be fine for someone driving down the road just listening to get a taste of what the novel is about.

I would recommend this novel to almost anyone, but especially to mothers and daughters. You learn so much from this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful novel","review":"This novel caught me from the beginning with its unconventional and vibrant images, its poetic, yet honest language, and its shameless detailing of relationships and society. Though not Chinese, as the daughter of immigrant parents in America, I could easily relate to the experiences of the younger generation characters, and I drew many parallels between my mother and the members of the Joy Luck Club. It has the power to stun me and reduce me to tears. I have never known a truer novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journal #6 Joy Luck Club","review":"This book was great even though at points in the book it seemed confusing.I think if amy tan wrote the Daughters and mothers stories back to back it wouldn't be as confusing. she could of wrote one family at a time but i guess she might have had a reason for writing it that way. The book was very descriptive and sympathetic. at the beginning junes mother had to give up her too babies so she would not die next to them, because who would pick up two babies knowing that a ghost mother will follow them around.that was the best thing she could do because she did not think she could make it. The beginning just showed how much junes mother had to give up in china for a better life.All of the mothers gave up some part of their lives to better their childrens and families lives.

Amy Tan is so in tune with the makings of a mother-daughter relationship that it seems she has met not only my mother and me, but also all the mothers and daughter in the world, in every age.What is also fantastic about this book is that after you have finished reading it, but you have a bad day, you can always pick it up and read a chapter at random -- and STILL BE INSPIRED!This book should be given to every girl by every mother some time during her early adult life (because some of the issues and scenes are too graphic for young teens).

Joy Luck Club is just like the modified Chinese food, many people love it, but you think that is really what's happening in China and you can learn something about Chinese culture from this book, you are absolutely mislead by it.

The book is constantly changing storylines, but Tan makes the transitions so smoothly that they do not interupt the main line of thought.

When I read from the perspective of the daughters I felt like stomping my feet and screaming like a teenager over how their mothers treated them.

I thought it might have a nice story line, but I just couldn't keep up with the changing of characters and times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I was a bit disappointed in this book. Each chapter has a different narrator, and between 8 women, it is hard to remember which one was which. I found it a little difficult to keep up with who was who, even at the end. The stories didn't all come together like I was hoping. The book was good, but it wasn't something that I was anxious to get home to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Niche","review":"The Chinese characters in this book represent the niche that Amy Tan and her family occupy in a much larger Chinese population, and her niche is not a good one. Chinese people are diverse in their intellects, habits, believes, and political orientations. You can be more informed through the writings of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo or the art of Ai Weiwei."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Tan's Best- A True Masterpiece","review":"I read this book when I was far too young to understand the intricacies and the delicacies that are found throughout this novel. Having reread it recently , I came to a conclusion: The basic story is so simple, almost anyone could write a story of mothers and daughter, but I find it hard to believe that anyone could have written anything nearly as well as Amy Tan has. With stories about women who were strong, women who kept secrets, and even more, this book captures not only the relationships of the 8 women, but also of any mother and daughter. My mother recently payed me the same compliment that June's mother did to her. She told me that \\"my heart was best quality.\\" I sincerely thank Amy Tan for writing a story which has undoubtedly made mothers and daughters connect or reconnect to each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Enchantment!","review":"Wow, this is an amazing tale. I absolutely could not put it down. I stayed up until I finished it, even though I had to wake up early the next morning. I cannot recall reading such a story as this, I was definitely wooed. This is a simply written bittersweet saga of four Chinese women and their daughters.I was enchanted by these wonderful and courageous women of the East from the very beginning. I could see and hear everything that they told. Their pain was my pain. Their joy, my joy. Amy Tan has a wondrous way of opening your eyes, so that you can see into the souls of these women. Never has the hardships of such seemingly frail women affected me so. I became riveted with anticipation of more to come.I truly loved this tale of love and woe. All I can say, is if you have not read it, do so now. You will not regret it. In fact, I am positive, that you will never forget these enchanting people ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"deep","review":"I just read this book, and I loved it! It's about four Chinese mothers and their relationships with their Americanized daughters. There are chapters from everybody's point of view instead of just one narrator, and that really helps you get a better understanding and view of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very touching","review":"This book is terrific. It touched my heart in a great way. The book has a great story line about a group of four friends. How their lives were, their struggles in life, and how they try to make their daughters keep the Chinese traditions in their lives. Each woman led a pretty difficult life. But yet they still came out of it, stronger than before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy Luck Club: Journal #6","review":"Amy Tan cleverly explores the fragile relationship between mother and daughter in her novel, The Joy Luck Club. Each story is truly heartfelt and is connected intricatley with the others. Even with such a difficult subject, Tan is able to pull all the pieces together and make sense out of it. Thus, giving every woman a deeper understanding of her own mother and the hope of reconciling. Thank you, Amy Tan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great description of an Asian American's family lifestyle","review":"This book was enjoyable to read because the author used lots of simple dialogue to familiarize the reader, while ahe also used a lot of descriptive words to allow the reader to fully actually \\"see\\" the settings and scenes of the story. The novel had a lot of beautiful metaphors and at times also had a sort of poetic tone to it, but it also had simple dialogue to tone down the mood so the reader could relate to the different stories. Overall, I could relate to all the stories perfectly well as an Asian American myself, so I thought it was pretty accurate and it was beautifully and simply written. The only negative thing about the novel would be that sometimes you could get mixed up with all the different stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately I too think this book is boring","review":"I disagree with people who say reviews are unfair here. I find this book boring, but it does appeal to some other people. One side should not try to say the other side is unfair. The story is like a soap opera, to me. The writing style is just too bland for my taste, no where as poetic as Woman Warrior."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE ME A BREAK","review":"This book is soooooo sterotyped!!!!!! Normal Chinese are nowhere as weird and brain-dead as that. Ask any Chinese, they'll totally understand what I mean. By the way, isn't it sick how all Chinese women are portrayed as China Dolls?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best first books I've read","review":"Well, actually this is more like one of the best books I've read, period. Sometimes we find it so hard to understand our loved ones' point of view, just like the Chinese-thinking mothers and their Americanized daughters depicted here. I love every story in the book, but the ones I liked best were the ones about Waverly Jong and her childhood struggles with her upstart mother; An-Mei Hsu's mother, the Fourth Wife, and her final revenge against the man that ruined her life; and Suyuan Woo's life during the war, and her Long Cherished Wish. All the stories are enthralling and wistful, and the clash of the modern, urban lifestyle of the second generation against the first's more traditional one is amazingly, beautifully described. After you've read this book you'll be left craving more, so run and get the other books by Amy Tan, which are as excellent as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troop #891's review for The Joy Luck Club","review":"This story gave such an insight to the lives of the women who had to deal with the horrific struggles of China.

Neither had I, but now I know, in vivid detail.An epic novel that puts you emotionally in the middle of the Civil War. The descriptive detail Keneally delivers to those fortunate enough to read this book brings the war alive. The mid-19th century mind set and thought process is alive and understandable. It is all here, all you need to do is read. The author may be from Australia but there must be a reincarnation woven into his soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd book","review":"At times this book is pretty good, but at times it is border line trash. Every single female character in the book was ... . I had no idea nineteenth century women were so \\"easy.\\" The female characters in this book were lured into the sack by many different techniques. Common to all was that they never once said no, despite the fact that adultry was often involved. You really have to wonder if the author has issues with women."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's on Mr. Keneally's Mind?","review":"In the first hundred pages of this novel, which is lauded for its realistic portrayal of southeners during the Civil War, there are at least two dozen references to human excrement, and nearly that many to lice. The characters of this book squat behind bushes, discuss diarrhea, foul their water supply, have problems with what they step in, and pick lice. Sort of a scratch and squat version of the Civil War. A remarkable number of the characters are drunks, or thieves, or least liars. We are informed, repeatedly, that they smell bad. Spit dribbles down their chins. The women are loose, or mean. Get the picture? Reality equals ugliness, and this book is about reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull dull dull","review":"I have read this book (of course) but have also met the author in a proffessional context.May be I am a tad subjective but I found the book dull (not to the standard say of \\"Unto This Hour\\") and the author arrogant to the point of being downright offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading in the begining was fun","review":"I use it for a resource but I need to finish reading this book and it is difficult to read and understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy- high quality!!!","review":"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer. The size of this police van is the standard for Playmobil toys. It is so well made and durable- much more so than many toys in a lower price range. With Playmobil, you get what you pay for. This i something that my son treasures and plays with every day. He can be creative and loves acting out different scenarios with the policemen and their dog. I was very hesitant to spend the money initially but was assured by other parents who explained the quality and after making the leap I am a Playmobil convert! If you search around you should be abke to find this for less than $40. I also want to add that the men can get in through the doors when they are open with plenty of clearance but to put them in the front seats you do need to remove the roof (it comes off easily). The best part is that it does not have an annoying siren (the lights do flash)."},{"rating":"2","title":"7 year old loves it","review":"Doesn't make noise which is a plus for me-- the lights on top come on with a push of a button-- My son loves this toy and he is 7 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"$189.99","review":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?!I hope that price is incorrect.

The official \\"War of the Gargantuas\\" DVD is released in its full glory. (Widescreen,original japanese language w/english subtitles etc.)No more need to search for bootleg copies of this movie, which are sold at other collectors on the web. Unfortunately, \\"Rodan\\" did not receive the full treatment. Although its been remastered and shown with the original japanese language, the DVD release does not display it in 16:9 but rather full screen (4:3). Also, now that it has been restored, you can really see the cables in the background lifting Rodan as he attacks Tokoyo, which unfortunately spoil some of the realism of the movie. Other than this, the DVD pack is worth the money and you can now have the official \\"War of the Gargantuas\\" for your japanese monster DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"English Subtitles Don't Work","review":"I sometimes wonder when I see all these glowing reviews so soon after a new DVD comes out...I have gotten two copies of the set from Amazon so far and on both of them the English subtitles don't work; don't come on at all.

Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, well, the English subtitles don't work on my discs either.","review":"I see another viewer mentioning this but most are not.

I was willing to even give it a third try, but Amazon's return process didn't work correctly. It asked me to select a credit card (in case I didn't return the defect), but the link went nowhere.

I've taken a media class before and find the subject very interesting, but this book is over-simplified and reads like a book I would have had to read in junior high, not college.

However the copy I received when purchasing is not. I received an Examination Copy.For those that do not know what an examination Copy is... An Examination Copy is a book that's sent out from the publisher for free to teachers and other people in an attempt to sell the book. Upon sending this book out to potential customers, it is suppose to be on a basic level of understanding that the book will not be sold. The reason being is because it takes away from well deserved royalties that belong to the author and publisher. Someone profited from the book I purchased where the publisher/author has not.

It is poorly written, there are probably twice as many typos as any other textbook.

I wish my professor had used another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Have To Take A Class...","review":"I'm using this book in an online class on mass communication and I have to admit that I actually enjoy reading this book.It covers every area of the media and its a very simple and informative read. 'Simple' used in this context means that I don't have to re-read a paragraph two or three times, just to make sense of what the author is trying to convey.The chapters are pretty short, and the book has lots of nice, bright pictures (that's my inner child speaking). Each chapter begins with stories about a media personality and that's always interesting. I end up saying \\"I didn't know that,\\" a lot to myself.What I really like about the book is that its very up to the moment. It even mentions Janet Jackson's wardrobe malfunction.So, if you have to take a class, especially an online class, it's nice to have a textbook that's so user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is really, really bad for educationa purpose","review":"I am using the tenth edition of this book and let me tell you something: It's the worst textbook I've ever come across.

This book honestly feels like a coffee table conversation more than an educational piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earlier editions were better","review":"I started using an earlier version of this book three years ago for my college massmedia class. I decided it was time to update-a media text should be current. A big mistake. My students liked the 8th edition and so did I. The 9th edition is disjointed and needs a great deal of supplemental material. This has been a long academic year. I will pick another book for next semester."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbalanced and unreadable","review":"This book is utterly basic and not fit for even a community college class, more like a junior high or maybe a high school class. Presumably, it's written for people who don't know what the author is talking about and are completely stupid. The author never fails to bring his own viewpoints into supposedly writing an objective, educational book. My professor confessed that they wouldn't have used this book to teach the class, but that they were taking over the class for the first time from another professor who had used it.I was taking a mass communication class that used this book, but dropped the class in favor of spending more time working on the school paper.

He likes to sleep with the animals:-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't fit through tunnels","review":"My twins loved the circus trains they got for their birthday - until they discovered that the trains won't go through tunnels or covered bridges with the animals in them! If your child has a simple circle set, or a flat track layout without tunnels or bridges, he/she will love the circus train. Otherwise, he/she will be frustrated (as my kids are) each time the train approaches a tunnel or bridge, when he/she has to remove the animals to get the train through.

Stuck between the tasty extravaganza of Army of Lovers and the plastic characterlessness of BWO this is undoubtedly the peak of Alexander Bard's creativity. Combining nonsense scientific and religious lyrics, atmospheric electronica and Mattias Lindblom's soaring vocals, this is pop as it should be - full of floating melodies and visual stimuli. This music takes you places. The production values would verge on the edge of slickness had it not been for the sparse string arrangements that bring the much need sense of space.

It would be more fun if we had a larger space indoor during the winter snow season, but this is still easy to learn how to move the vehicle.

The only place we could get it up to a \\"normal\\" speed was in our tiny garage. Ironically, that is where this toy now sits, unused...in our garage.If you have access to a large, *very* smooth floor, than this toy is worth the outrageous price.

This is pre- Al Anderson 'Q, featuring the great Steve Ferguson on guitar, whose solo stuff you should search out IMMEDIATELY, and whose influence can be heard down the NRBQ guitar line, in both Big Al and Johnny Spampinato.NRBQ was only with Columbia for, like, one and a half albums (the \\"half\\" being \\"Boppin' The Blues,\\" which is half NRBQ, half NRBQ backing Carl Perkins, and all great; it's still available on CD.)

Diagnostic tools are extremely weak. The program prompts the user to take the tests in the subject area, but only provides the number correct and a percentage score as feedback. There is no way to determine which questions the user got wrong, consequently providing no way to focus the user's study efforts (i.e. the user may not need to study an entire subject area, but one sub-area). The sub-areas also have a diagnostic test that does provide the user with immediate right/wrong feedback (also allowing multiple guesses), but does not offer a correct solution to the math problem if the user selected a wrong answer first.

I bought one and found it to be the worst investment I have ever made. The radio's light wouldn't work. The rechargeable battery in the unit only works for a very short time after cranking. When I took a closer look at the material I found that it was made of a cheap plastic and the seams showed cheap manufacture. This radio's reception is not even as good as that of radios I've found that only cost five dollars. This radio looks like one of those that magazine companies give away with their subscription.

I was excited to find this one at a decent price, and with the added bonus of a cell phone emergency charger! The adapters fit most phones, and it's just good to know that wherever you are, you can make a phone call even with a dead phone battery. I read some reviews about a difficulty getting the battery case open, but I had absolutely no problem with it. Yes, it would be great if it came with an AC adapter (and I wouldn't have it without); I just rigged up my own with a Wal Mart universal power supply for $15.00. It takes 4.5 -5 volts. It runs for HOURS after charging it with an adapter. Reception has been good, not only in northern Wisconsin, but in Illinois as well. NPR is great! and who really needs the TV stations! (though I do get one once in a while).Anyway, I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good radio with a tropical weakness","review":"I noticed that both of the negative reviews were written by owners in Hawaii. I agree that there are problems with getting a long charge out here. When I first got the radio, I got about 45 minutes with two minutes of cranking; after six months, two minutes of cranking got six minutes of radio time. I suspect our tropical climate is more the problem than the radio's dynamo. I've put batteries in mine (rechargeable, of course) and have had great reception, even inside buildings that usually interfere with reception. I can also receive several TV stations with no problem, and the National Weather Service channel comes through loud and clear. I really like this radio, and it was my constant companion during the earthquake. I just need to make sure I'm proactive and keep the AA batteries charged up so it's ready in an emergency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book in terrible condition!","review":"I bought this book, along with another one, Noisy Day.

Valentine wins all encounters either by luck, lying, or killing. There is never the sense that he is really in any danger.Most disturbing is some of his actions.

But learning about a new culture is fascinating as always and the emotional turmoils that are much too realistic bring back the old memories.The hero of this story is a handsome teenage boy (with a girl friend) who finds himself helplessly falling in love with a cruel gang leader named Dai.This book is definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much violence, not enough love","review":"This may turn out to be a brilliant multi-volume story, but I'm not going to read past the first volume, because I found it too violent. I have a hard time relating to characters (like Dai) who treat the people they love like crap. And I have a hard time understanding how his man could fall for him, considering how badly Dai treated him. Just because he is good-looking, and leads a gang, that makes Dai hot somehow?

Do not while drilling,under any circumstance,engage the trigger lock or it will beat you like a rented mule.The only real drawback for this and all Milwakee drills is thereversing switch. It is right next to the trigger and engagedwith a light touch. I don't know how many times I'veinadvertantly done this to my great annoyance. They shouldstiffen it up or put it somewhere else. This has not deteredme from buying Milwaukee drills as they beat all competorshands down as does their whole line of equipment.

I am a part time remodeler. I have used this hammerdrill for 3 months. It has worked flawlessly for me. I have only used it so far to install tapcons in concrete slabs and in some precast concrete. I have only used it to drill up to 1/4\\" holes so far and it works great. Hammerdrill function is powerful and smooth. It is a little bulky in tight spots, but always seems to be able to maneuver it to work some how. This drill is longer than some and very powerful. I haven't used the drill function but I am sure it will be good. I have several different brands of tools and Milwaukee makes excellent products-particularly drills. Very strong and durable. A keyed chuck can be a pain, but is really the only way to go for a hammerdrill or any larger drill for boring 1/2\\" or bigger holes. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding-so far at least....","review":"Purchased this Model today locally and it did not dissapoint.

It's 14 years old - I expected a longer life, because I did not use it all that much. Some years barely any use.It would not allow me to go into reverse and it only had one speed - FULL. The controller switch is fried. It's a less than $25 part (+ freight) but when I opened it up, the motor is near toasted. The gears are very worn.......oh yeah the hammer feature never quite ever worked all that well.WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!! Made in Germany. I should trust my instincts - the whole case is made of plastic not like my pop's Milwaukee."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but bad handle","review":"I've had this drill for a few years and find the motor a bit weak, but adequate. The only real problem I've had is the handle that mounts on the gear case. The plastic gear case has three little indent to mate with indents in the plastic side handle. Tightening the side handle as much as I can I still can't keep it from slipping when drilling large (2.5\\") holes in fir joists. Once it starts to slip the plastic breaks and then you've had it. Unfortunately for me, the drill is fairly useless without the side handle. Hence only two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"Like his patron saint, Sebolt, who is credited with making ice burn, W.G. Sebald, in this extraordinary book, has succeeded in achieving a miracle, even if it is just in having penned yet another (see The Emigrants) utterly uncategorizable book. Memoir, Treatise, Breviary, Travelogue, Novel, Elegy, Dance of the Dead...there are elements of all of these in Sebald's work. To attempt to elaborate any further in a brief review would clearly be reductive -- this is an essential work, by an essential writer, and should, at all costs, be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece for the ages","review":"One of the great books of our time this is seemingly a random collection of thoughts, stories and rememberances, all written in Sebald's typical elliptical poetic almost hypnotic prose. Scratch under the surface however and you will find a deep philosophical meditation on memory and death and the beauty we can find in decay. In its own way this book reveals the sorry state of the novel by being simply a huge advance on that tired old form. It certainly doesnt feel like a novel but reads like a non fiction book but really it is beyond such defitnions of genre and rather it is a new catagory of literature upon which catchy names have yet to descend. This book along with Sebald's entire output will come to be seen as a key moment in the history of literature like that ushered by the publication of Ulysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sebald, the Last Great Writer of the Twentieth Century","review":"In his third work of prose fiction (the word 'novel' seems somehow too banal for what Sebald writes), the German-born writer long resident in England takes a solitary walking trip along the English coast from Norwich to Harwich. Upon this 'travel narrative' framework, Sebald embroiders a wide-ranging meditation on human cruelty and genocide and its possible connections to the amoral 'cruelty' of nature. As Sebald walks along this lonely, decaying stretch of North Sea coast, images suggestive of the Shoah and other 20th century atrocities seem to appear everywhere, until ultimately the book becomes a portrait of a mind haunted by the Holocaust--and by the possibility that cruelty seems to be everywhere because it really IS everywhere... This is a staggering achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, and worked great","review":"Set up my new sound system with ease.

I will never use bare wire again to run speakers. This is just too easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plugs too loose","review":"This type of plug is more difficult to wire and less secure than the compression type. These particular plugs were of uneven diameter, and some fit too loosely. This is not much of a problem at the speaker end, where gravity works in you favor. But when a loose plug is horizontal, it is prone to slippage. This is a problem at the amplifier (output) end, especially if you move the unit to add another component.There also was a shipping problem with this particular seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value for the price","review":"Great product but completely overpriced.

His mom is a librarian, and his dad is a teacher. They decide to go around the world, but they stop along the way. They travel by sea, and the boat always needs repairs.Then a storm came and took him and his dog. He ended up on an island in the Pacific and that is where he meets Kensuke.My favorite part of the book was when he ended up on the island. I like it because it is interesting what Kensuke does to help Michael survive things like jelly fish stings.I really like it because it relates to me what I do with the Boy Scouts. I would recommend it to my pep, because he likes this kind of book. I think this is a 5 star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!

It was the hardest review I ever had to do. When I was reading the start of the book it was really boring. But I thought all books are at the start. But I never thought it could last right till the end of the book.So a month later we handed in our reviews and the class came to a conclusion that the book was more for boys. Not one girl in the class enjoyed the book in the slightest. So our teacher decided to let the girls pick the next book and we decided on Holes.

It is so rife with errors as to be useless. This author would have you believe that all hormones, steroids, and chemicals used by the dairy and meat industry are safe. He would have you not to worry about any of the pesticides and that people are just worry over nothing. He also concludes that the organic industry is a waste of money, time, and effort, and that no proof exists that organic food is better than mass produced food.If an adult read this book, I would assume he/she would be able to read between the lines. However, an 8th grader (this book's audience) will not know that he/she is being fed industry propaganda.Please think twice about buying this book for your students unless you are prepared to undo much of the damage it incurs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories With My Grandmother","review":"Perry Mason was my grandmother's favorite show.

The entire Season 3 should be offered at this price or less. I refuse to be ripped off and I hope everyone else will join me in boycotting these tactics. Hamilton Burger virtually always lost, but this time the studio is the loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing - Only 12 Episodes","review":"This is just too sad that only 12 episodes are included in this set. Season 3 had a total of 25 and the decision to break the set into 2 volumes is just criminal. Although I had pre-ordered this set I've now cancelled the order to protest the price of $70.00 a season. I do love Perry Mason and only wish the studios will take heed. Even though $50 a season would be expensive it would most definitely be more in line.

The acting superb. The plots are rich in action and suspense. The dramatic tension real. Nowadays a show of this caliber would be over in a season or two or as soon as the cast started fighting over salaries. Not in the Perry Mason series - the cast clicked, got along, and supported each other's vital roles in the episodes. How else can you explain the success? I highly recommend the series.But I cannot plow the pockets of Paramount with profits because the studio has chosen to release the DVDs the way they have. I have instead followed the advice of others and purchased all 271 episodes in one DVD set.

The miniseries Centennial is coming out at the same time and it's 6 disks are the same price as this Perry Mason 3 disc set. This is just wrong.

They beat the episodes I recorded from Hallmark TV with 8 minutes cut-out from every episode. But, at this price, it is an easy no deal call. HBO is also infamous for over pricing their DVDs, but at least they are using some of the DVD revenues to offset the original production costs. For Perry Mason, revenues are all gravy.I have learned one thing about DVD pricing over the years, if you wait long enough, these over-priced sets are put on sale at the steepest discounts. I am waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perry, Innocent-Paramount, GUILTY as charged.","review":"As everyone else here has already noted, the release schedule on this, the most sophisticated of all 1950's television, has been slow and torturous. Most viewers who enjoyed this originally will be dead by the time they finish releasing this. If they finish releasing it.Look at the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart Shows, both widely accepted as two of the best comedies ever on commercial TV, both stalled from further releases at the fourth season mark.Of course the other side of boycotting, as has been suggested in more than a few reviews here, might just make it easier for Paramount to stop releasing them at all if no one's buying.There are certainly more important things in life to worry about, but it's a shame to see something of such high quality being so poorly handled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pason Mason, Season 3, Volume ONE ......... !!!!","review":"I have been waiting for years for Perry Mason to come to DVD and now I find that the company is asking outrageous prices.

The number of folks (i.e. with taste) that are interested in buying this series is not made up of idiots (and many are probably on a fixed budget) and will not be bullied into paying such a ridiculous price.

This can also become confusing at times when past and present, reality and tale are woven tightly together. Most memoralbe are the two sisters:Olivia and Kwan. Visualizing, through Tan's words, their developing relationship is a wonderful experience. Also the process of acculturation that each sister goes through, one in America and one on a trip back to China, is an interesting comparison that Tan makes.

I have not finnished it yet - only another 50 pages to go but I don't want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally satisfying","review":"I bought this book over a year ago, but just could not get into it. Both Kwan and Olivia were annoying to me, albeit in different ways. And the book seemed to be another Amy Tan rehash of the clash between first and second generation Chinese. I finally tried reading it again recently, and for some reason, I was swept away. You just have to get past the first 50 pages to be in sync with the story structure. This time, I loved the characters and their belief that loved ones don't die, they simply become part of another sensory world. As for Amy Tan writing the same old things again, I guess it's really not a fair criticism. John Grisham writes the same book over and over again. Sue Grafton only writes crime novels featuring the same character. So you can't very well expect Amy Tan to start writing science fiction, for example. Overall, then, it's a not a bad way to spend an evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stage setting","review":"The stories and plots about ghost and incarnation are quite common in both modern and classic chinese novels. This attempt to use the idea again into a more \\"International\\" manner is quite interesting. The memories of Kwan, Libbya's travel to China, the swing between present and previous life events give the author many opportunities to illustrate different contrasts: American/Chinese cultures, Christianity/Taoism, luxury/povelty. However, I think the description of chinese rituals and beliefs on funeral and afterlife should receive a more in-depth treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"the story creates a vivid picture","review":"Amy Tan did an exquiste job in writing this book. She explains the traditions and believes of her sister Kwan. Not only did she create a vivid picture but also the use of her chinese broken english incorportated in the story to give the reader a sense of how chinese people talk. I would reccomend this book, which is interesting and eliquently potrays the way Olivia ( the main character) views her sister and of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like her other gems~","review":"I have read all Amy Tan's other books and she is really my favorite author, but I could not get into this book at all. It was almost like someone else had written it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough character description","review":"I didn't think the characters were described very well and I never felt like I really knew them. I also didn't like that sometimes Olivia, the main character, did not believe her sister and sometimes she did. It also annoyed me that she wasn't able to communicate what she was really feeling about her husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost the sparkle somewhat","review":"I've never missed Amy's book. I'm finding her book rather palatable & heart warming. To me, this book seems to have lost the X factor that her previous works were able to produce. Could it be that Amy was compelled to obligate her contract to write another book for her publisher in such a short span of time? I'm convinced that Amy could have done better. There's nothing wrong for her to dwell on female characters as been criticised by some readers. Isn't it Chinese saying that we only do what we know best? Even though this is not her best book yet, I am still looking forward to read her next offering. USA is proud to have someone like her. Girl Power!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it was really boring","review":"i think that this book was real boring and it was real stupid because there wasn't any excitement. The plot really sucks.

She lets you know and makes you love her characters. This story will grab your heart and never let go. I won't soon forget this one. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tan's Best Work Yet","review":"Amy Tan once again crafts a beguiling web of past, present and future, as well as those other, virtually untapped dimensions of thought and existence.Once again, the theme is the Chinese-American culture clash, the merging of East and West; mothers, daughters, and sisters must relate to each other and to whom they once were.Each of Tan's novels is a masterful peek into the Chinese culture and its associated traditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"unforgettable novel of a Chinese-American living her life.","review":"I liked this book it was a different kind of reading from what Im used to reading. I liked how it was told from one points view (first person) about her life and how she lived through situations. Ive also read ��Joy Luck Club�� which was also a good book and comparing these two books gave away the idea that they are pretty similar except different stories which I think its a cool style"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth losing sleep for.....","review":"Amy Tan's book grabbed my attention from the moment I opened thecover. The story is so intricatly woven with numerous voices tellingpieces of an overall story. We only understand this larger story after having compiled its pieces in our minds. The reader's affection for the characters is well developed and as an american reader i felt myself identifying with Olivia as she struggled with her relationship with her sister. I read this book in a matter of days, moments smuggled between school and work and sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"too high on price","review":"I have to question why you can get a paperback copy of this for a dollar, but the Kindle version is 10 dollars? I hope Amazon will get with the program and start offering these previously published books at a lower price. I can often do better going to flea markets. I realize there's alot of classics for free and cheaper books for Kindle, so I hope the selection will continue to expand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it over and over and over.....","review":"I love this story! I've read it so many times now. I liked the Joy Luck Club and wanted to read more of Amy Tan, and read this one while waiting of a copy of the Kitchen God's Wife to be available. I loved it! It is her best! I rate this #1 by Tan, followed by Joy Luck. I LOVE KWAN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah, blah blah..","review":"that's all olivia, the main character, seemed to be saying. Olivia was cold, her husband made of cardboard, Kwan was annoying, and the way China was described definitely took it off my must-visit list. I won't waste your time with the details, but, as much as I like books that discuss the cultural aspects of a culture other than U.S.A., this book was far too long and seemed to be repeating itself. a three page short story, maybe, but a book? no.Final Verdict:I was glad when it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all the same!","review":"How many times can Amy Tan write the same story? I've read Joy Luck Club, The Kitchen God's Wife, and the beginning and end of this one. The themes are all the same: female Chinese Americans coming to terms with their identities through a female relative. It made for ONE interesting, well-written story, but it stretched pretty thin over three novels. Also, isn't anyone else concerned that all the characters grew up in San Francisco, but never encountered black or Latino people? Shouldn't it happen in at least one of the books? Never mind, make that one book."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing!!","review":"Usually I enjoy reading Amy Tan's books, but I wasn't to thrill with this one. I had to stop on page 79 and to remove it off my book list.I felt that this book didn't have a flow to it. It kept going from one scenario to another. IMO, I felt this story was disjointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that must be read!!!","review":"This novel is amazing. Never before had I been so astounded by such fascinating plot and characters; they captured my heart, my 'hundred secret senses', from the first moment on. Amy Tan's magical words linked together the past and the present, back and forth within different lifetimes. Tan surprised me with her powerful imagination and lured me into the mystical Chinese village of Changmien where Kwan and Olivia revealed secrets and fulfilled promises. The book took my thoughts and soul on a heart-stirring journey where I found joy, sorrow, and anger. Its energy is irrepressible. Don't wait! Experience it now for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Sometimes the story line was a little hard to follow, particularly at first. But once I got into this book, the story that unfolded before me was fascinating and left me wanting more in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"This is easily one of the best books I've ever read. I can say that \\"I laughed, I cried\\" and went through ever other emotion known to man. You don't have to be a first generation America to fall in love with this story. This is just a story about a woman discovering her heritage and the bonds of family and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...","review":"First 50 pages or so are bit hard to digest but as you start to get involved into the story, the whole experience of reading this book is quite satisfying. I think Amy has handled mysticism very well in this book as it blends in with the story even though it is not exactly clear whether Kwan was really seeing ghosts or lying about it. I would like to compare incompetent handling of mysticism in Hundred Years of Solitude that had left a bad taste in my mouth.Money well-spent, I must say! BTW, it is very funny too at times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"engaging","review":"Amy Tan's storytelling abilities draw you in, while her characterizations and dialogueare mildly underdeveloped, (I found some of the dialogue between Simon andOlivia weak).

I could not get into it. Tried twice. Maybe you'll have better luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book in Great Condition","review":"The book arrived quickly and was in great condition. It was worth buying the book used and I would buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Past and present lives, connected by yin eyes","review":"In The Hundred Secret Senses, the author delves into the realm of magic realism, explores the theme of reincarnation, and creates a wonderfully amicable character in Kwan. The best part of the novel is its humor--Kwan's struggle with the English language and her innocent nagging of her American-born sister Olivia. Her telling of the Christian missionaries' story and her connection to them in a past life turns out to be a focal part of the novel, but I eventually dreaded reading these sometimes boring accounts. I didn't enjoy Secret Senses as much as Tam's other novels (especially Kitchen God's Wife), but overall it was an interesting read. The author doesn't utilize magic realism quite as effectively as Garcia Marquez or Allende, but still creates a convincing spiritual connection between the generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"amy tan captures the moment through her writing","review":"Reading amy tan's the hundred secret senses opened my eyes to a whole new world...she captures the whole story through her writing, it seemed as almost i was right there watching what would happen in the story. She illustrates the way her sister kwan and olivia grow up together even though they bother come from different worlds. Kwan incorporating the broken english into her writing also makes it seem very real to the reader and allows the reader to get a sense of how it was as tan goes on to tell the story. i give it four stars....great come back after the joyluck club."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me reach inside myself and actually feel .","review":"Not only did I fall in love with the novel itself but I also felt for all of the characters as well. I believe Amy Tan is truly a divine author who makes the reader feel like they are inside the actual story . I found myself wanting to get to know olivia and Kwan more as if they were real people. I truly hope Amy Tan keeps up the good work ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't I read this before?","review":"I just finished \\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\". I thought it was fantastic. I read it in two days. I loved it. I went to get another Amy Tan book and chose this one. Seems like the same book. There is always one character who, for one contrived reason or the other, sometimes very contrived, speaks broken English (on the order of \\"no tickee, no shirtee\\"). There is always a middle-aged woman (45-50) married with no kids. We always go back in time to China and forward to the present. there is always a culture clash with the Americans.I loved all of these things in \\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" and would highly recommend that book, but I don't want to keep reading the same book over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go once again","review":"I borrowed this book from the library, and am glad I did. How many times can Tan write the same story? How many times can the same stereotypes be repeated over and over again? From reading her books, one certainly gets the impression that she has an intense dislike for Asian men. Surely out of several billion Asian men, there must be at least one decent one! Read the Joy Luck Club if you want to read Tan. It's her best and at least it's original--all the rest are just dull reruns of the same old same old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Recycle for the Next Book","review":"A public service announcement: if you are a well-read Eli curious about life in China, don't waste your time with this book. This is the same recycled mother-daughter-sister drivel she turns out every couple of years. If you are a middle-aged woman who doesn't go out much, do what you like. Amy Tan, in my opinion, is only good for one book (imagine Mitchell writing more than one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucked!","review":"There was no point to this book. I could not figure out what this story was about. It was boring, confusing, and pointless. Do not read this book if you don't have to!

It was perfect for exactly 1 halloween.A nice costume, Not great but nice. Made from stretchy material (assuming spandex-esque material) it runs like a cheap stocking. The ties are just smaller pieces of the same fabric. Picture doesn't really do service in that the size runs tight. This kid in the picture is wearing a costume that is at least 2 sizes bigger than he is"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Looking Costume","review":"This is a great costume. Fit's nicely. I purchased a 10/12 for my son, who's a stick, and it still fit him well. The only disappointment was the mask. It just didn't work very well.

Other than that, he really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy material","review":"It got dirty easily n material fringed at the ends. when i washed it wasnt that white anymore.

If you want the costume to fit baggy in the pants like in the picture, I suggest ordering one size bigger. I ended up buying a white lycra, so that my son could wear it under the white pants. Being brown skinned, you were able to see his underwear and legs through the ninja costume. He also wore a white tank top underneath the shirt. I also had to pin the bottom of the mask inside the collar of the shirt because it kept comming out. The material did not feel cheap. Overall it was a good buy. My son wore it since the day it arrived and almost everyday until Halloween. Being white, I had to wash it a few times and it never shrinked or lost the art. It shipped pretty fast too, it got here in less than 2 weeks and I live in Puerto Rico so it usually takes about 3 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Costume","review":"My son wore this costume twice and the fabric started tearing and unraveling easily.

Yeah, I know, most of us work with 3/4\\" stock +/- an 1/8\\". I just hope the engineers at Jet design a simple, cheap clamp system (like this one!!) that works from 1/2\\" up to 1\\".

The 1st attempt at attaching the the corner snapped the top plastic piece. I put the product back in the plastic case and call Amazon for a return.

I have a long flower bed along my back fence and use 2 Simple Soakers to water this area. Just place the stakes in the ground, cover the hose with mulch and you are set for a season of watering! The water presure at my house is not great enough to use the two connected, although they are designed to hook together. Still connecting the garden hose to two spots is better than standing out there for hours holding it! You can get them with or without a timer. I would recommend you get your first one with the timer (you can use the same timer for multiple ones at the same faucet). It is convenient to set it and forget it, because it shuts off on it's own! They also cover much better that traditional soaker hoses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great garden watering system","review":"I was tired of spending over an hour watering all my flower gardens. I could not find a system in the store so I was thrilled when I stumbled upon the Nelson Simple Soaker! I purchased the 4 faucet extender and attached the Simple Soaker to the extender. I bought 5 sets. I used 4 sets and am saving the last set for parts since I heard they were hard to come by. It is a very easy system to install and works great. I had two sprinkler heads that I could not get to work, but other than that...for the cost it is a great system."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best power screwdriver!","review":"The power is more than adequate - the high speed being just perfect and the low speed providing enough torque to undo all but the most stubborn of screws and bolts.The clutch is extremely handy because it prevents overtightening and breaking off screw heads.About my only complaint would be that battery management isn't what I'd like. Not quite enough battery life on a charge - and batteries seem to wear out (as in become unuseable and won't take a charge) relatively quickly. However that is just my personal view - Perhaps my expectations are unreasonable. Conside that my experience is that the B&D Versapak battery system isn't as long lasting as this.I do not recomend this as an all-day tool for someone who works on an assembly line, for example. But certainly it is a more than excellent device. Beautifully designed and built with real metal gears inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Not only does this book have some very nice patterns but it has wonderful detailed patterns for fun and different fringe.

So of course I couldn't wait to purchase this DVD, and yes, now I (unfortunately) own it. Somehow, this wasn't what I was expecting. I have a sense of humor just as much as the next person, but didn't expect Mr. Kimmel's work to be quite so perverted. I mean, you have an idea of what to expect hence the title, but give me a break! It was disappointing to hear Mr. Kimmel's music, not what I'd expect of him, you'd think he would have so much talent, but obviously song writing isn't his strong suit.

There is nothing in it about the spiritual aspects; all it talks about is how to dress for success at the office, how to impress your boss by wearing clothes you can't really afford, and how several of their anonymous \\"students\\" bought pig farms or invested in stocks because their spirit guides told them to. I know this book has been \\"updated for the new millenium;\\" this basically amounts to an introduction that tries to tie this old style mumbo jumbo stuff into the current pagan revival.I do think it deserves one star because it does have some historical value -- the \\"non-millenium\\" version was written 30 years ago so it shows you how far the Craft has come and how not all forms of witchcraft were intelligent and spiritual.

And them, and their School, which they call a \\"church\\" for no discernible reason.However, if you can't give over an entire room of your house to practice, and decorate said room with a permanent symbol drawn to specifications on the floor according to an exact ink recipe that includes your own blood, then \\"you can't do Wicca\\".

I tried to approach the book with an open mind....however....the title is as misleading as the \`words' inside.If some is looking for information about Modern Pagan Witchcraft they will not find it here....what they will find is ways to cheat hotels, get free air travel and other wise be a pain until someone gives you something.If that is your goal...by all means buy the book...however if you have a set of ethical standards higher then the slug (with apologies to any terrestrial, gastropd mollusks reading this) ...spend your money on something worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, The Financial Advice Isn't Bad","review":"My main interest in any Wiccan or Occult volume is its ideology, its link to the spiritual. I generally don't like books of spells that read like recipe books. But the Frosts go a step FURTHER....this book is much less about Wicca than it is advice on how to live life practically. Despite its seeming \\"for beginners\\" aura, this book kind of assumes the reader has already figured out how to channel his own supernatural powers so the Frosts can tell him what to do with them. Nowhere is there an explanation of where these powers might come from. This lends the book an air of complete unbelievability to the uninitiated--hardly the impression you'd want to make on someone just starting to discover their spiritual power.

I would normally never purposely damage a book, but this book was SO incredibly horrible that I burned mine. Yes, I literally set my copy on fire. I have never done anything like that before, but I have to admit that physically destroying this book felt extremely cleansing. Reading the book made me me filthy. I couldn't stand having it in my home and I couldn't give it away (no one should read this book...it gives Wicca a horrible name)so I chose to destroy it.I could not believe how immoral the Frosts were when writing this book! They flippantly told their readers not to hurt people and then used example after example about how you can use Wicca to have power over others, get revenge, manipulate other people into getting what you want, etc. It was disgusting.Do not buy this book.

All the bad things I have heard about the Frosts seem to have achieved fruition in this book.

Enough ranting.Blessings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and useless!","review":"When I bought this book I was expecting just what the title said - the magic power - this book is boring and useless.

This book is insulting. It is \\"rewritten\\", rehashed trash, marketed to modern day \\"Good Witches\\" and pawned off as something original. If, Gavin and Yvonne, you are so hard up for cash, open a lemonade stand or buy a 1*900 number like everyone else. Don't insult my intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!!!","review":"Interesting how these particular witches push the envelope on what constitutes \\"an it harm none\\". I enjoyed this book because it gives practical advice in the mundane world as well as many magical techniques and stories about how things can work out magically.The Frosts are a gift to the Craft society no matter what anyone else thinks. They are way different in their approach, sure, but still a blessing nonetheless.This is a good read for advanced and beginners. Their techniques are well written and easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the he*l is this stuff","review":"This is not Wicca becasue Wicca doesnt pormise that you will be able to control people through the use of \\" Your Magickal White Witchcraft Powers\\".

And do these poeple not teach that is something was going to posess your body it would be drawn back into it. Then how do they promise to teach you how to posess someone elses body. This is not reall Wicca or Witchcraft if you want real withcraft try: Wicca: A guide for the Solitary Practitioner or any of the Scott Cunninghams books.

The book presents a clear and helpful approach, focusing on how to translate your learning and insights about more effective thinking into actual practice -- really becoming a more effective thinker. An excellent focus for a thinking book. In my opinion, Peiffer ranks up there with Glickman, Norem, and Seligman as a writer of popular psychology books about effective thinking for general readers. So I am also looking forward to Peiffer's new Happiness book that is coming out this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go Girl!","review":"I read the book in one day because it spoke to my heart in many ways...I am young -- a mother and a survivor of breast cancer -- diagnosed at the age of twenty-two.

You could call it realistic and honest. I picked it up to read about 'what it means to be a young girl with cancer in a beauty-obsessed culture'. It's actually the story of what happens when the Perfect Life is tainted with cancer.There are too many references to that Perfect Life. The author is a name-dropper and talks about all the people she knows and how they contributed to her successful recovery. Barbara Walters sent her flowers. Everyone in the book that she encounters is helpful, supportive, complimentary (even when she's sick & bald from chemo), and lavish with their praise. She does the surgery, the treatment, and the recovery in her Perfect way. At times, it seems that she is more worried about losing her Perfect Husband & Dream Job than her health.This book might be good to give someone for a laugh or for support with cancer. But please warn them that it takes place in a Hollywood Perfect World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very New York!","review":"Once I remembered where I was emotionally at 27, I could then get into this woman's ballsy approach to facing breast cancer.

It gives me strength."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Purchase","review":"I had seen the movie of \\"Why I Wore Lipstick: To My Mastectomy\\" and wanted the book. You see, I had just had a mastectomy that year. I ordered the right item but was sent the wrong book because they said they no longer had the item that I wanted. No, I did not send it back because it would have cost more to send back than what I paid. I didn't complain because I thought why?

She has bared her soul as well as her breast, and imparts important information along the way. This is a must read for anyone who has breast cancer, who had breast cancer, who had a relative or friend with breast cancer, or who fears getting breast cancer which is to say, ALL OF US. It is also a primer for doctors as to how to approach patients. Just being smart isn't enough, as Ms. Lucas makes crystal clear. Although the main focus of the book is breast cancer, I think it has useful information for all current or former cancer patients , their families and friends, and their caregivers. Don't miss this one! Jane A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very surface","review":"Every young woman's experience with cancer is different so this account is useful from that perspective. But as a young survivor I found it very ego-centric and not at all relateable. Is it tragic that she got breast cancer - yes. Is it more tragic that she got breast cancer AND she's \\"pretty\\" and married to a doctor and knows people whose names we recognize - no. While I acknowledge that body image and issues of sexuality and attractiveness seem to be more acute the younger a woman is - this book never develops beyond the surface. Being someone that is not interested in \\"It\\" girls (or guys) to begin with - her \\"it\\" experience with breast cancer is also lack-luster for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as hell, much needed humor for BC survivors","review":"I loved this book.

Then the notion that they don't take the Bible seriously enough depends on what is meant. They may indeed only take its threat seriously when they are forced to by the depredations of dangerous religious enthusiasts. Should they take it seriously at other times? Why? It is a marvelous collection of nonsense indeed.The author is correct in doubting that biblical scholars will ever convince believers that the Bible isn't what they think it is. For almost four hundred years now, since at least Spinoza, we know the Bible is not God's word or anything like that, but believers still insist on their fairy stories and especially on The Blue Fairy of desire.This book doesn't do me any good. I don't know if someone else will find it useful, I suspect not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant, Silly Book","review":"There have been some excellent books recently on the subject of religion by the great evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, the brilliant philosopher Daniel Dennett, the writer/journalist Christopher Hitchens and Neuroscientist Sam Harris. This book is not in that class. The author arrogantly asserts that Non-believers MUST take religion seriously, without ever explaining why. Well, sorry. Religion is a vestige of humanity's primitive past which we would be much better without. If religion is allowed to hold sway, we may not make it out of the 21st century, as the religions nutcases will blow us all to smithereens. Furthermore, the author displays his bias when he says that he prefers that secularism always remain the minority view. Of course, this is likely, considering the preponderence of idiots on the planet, but we can hope that the mass of humanity can be enlightened through education."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't make any sense","review":"Why Nonbelievers Must Take Religion Seriously?

Remember: They are political and you are not.When the Analyst loses Integrity and Goes Political, then the process of honest intelligence production ceases. The War of Numbers shows so many who took the dishonest road.This book precisely demonstrates how, even while being pummeled by the suits, Mr Adams remains true to the Intelligence Analysis Profession.RIP Sam, we miss you and need you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but unsatisfactory","review":"Compare his last book, it has the same rapid fire narratives with an interesting, but \\"conventionally-styled,\\" climax. Unfortunately, the way the the story finishes has left readers with a sense that it is incomplete because the main female chracter's motivation, and the things she did, were not fully-explained unlike the last book. This can be easily accomplished by adding 10 or 20 more pages without compromising the flow.

Different, well developed characters, multiple plot lines but not to the point of being distracting. For the same reasons I enjoyed the Chairman, I disliked the Protege.

However, being such the understandable proposition -- tourists are unlikely to want to carry many guides -- this guidebook does a very nice job of putting it all together.There are very interesting historical section which are often deeper than what one would get from a local tourist guide. It covers all the major attractions (at least in the places I visited) and gives the tourist a good idea about the culture, history and socio-economic conditions of the places being visited.

There was no \\"I Wish I Had A Girl\\", \\"Hey Baby\\", or even a \\"Low Flying Man\\" to be found in this sorry collection of inexcusable songs.

Upon seeing it again on CD I ordered and listened to it. The story did not age well. The whole idea of an empire, ruled by a monarch and with entitled families just did not make sense. The \\"space navy\\" was anachronistic in the extreme in it's attitude to people, especially women .

Now that the Kindle edition is here, its easier.Yes, some of the characters are very cliche.Yes, women are not treated very well in the new world order.And, yes, the mediators who claim to not give orders do.But its a highly creative world, with interesting new technologies, a detailed history, and a unique alien culture. Its well written and a fun read.My advice is to buy it, and read it more than once. Do not, however, buy the rest of the series, which I found to be a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a team!","review":"A hell of a page-turner! Couldn't let it down! Niven and Pournelle at their VERY BEST! In a line: Poor Moties -- but not only them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pournelle and Niven = Perfect Balance","review":"I love both of these writers, but I think Niven often becomes a \\"'big ideas\\" guy and loses focus on telling a rousing story. As much as I enjoy \\"Ringworld\\" it doesn't exactly have a great deal of emotional resonance. However, when these two collaborate you get both a tremendous sense of awe at the sheer boldness of the premise, plus a characterful and elaborate action narrative. I have never been as horrified and page-flipping as when that one thing happens on the ship with those little things. I'd rather not say more. But there's stuff with helmets and spacesuits that flipped my old-timey wig upside down on my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Epitome of Alien Contact stories","review":"Set out to be the Epitome of Alien Contact stories and succeeded. This is SF as it should be and anyone who isn't enthralled must be suffering from a seriously deficient imagination and sense of wonder. This book is very different to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" but they have three things in common: (1) they restore faith in the survival of the story-teller's craft, (2) they are both long books, and, (3) the reader finishes them wishing they were a lot longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with well developed ideas.","review":"First let me say that the review is wrong. They aren't trapped in their solar system because of lack of a star drive. They are trapped because they lack the sheilding necessary to escape. Anyway, I won't give away anymore. I only occasionally enjoy Sci Fi and this one is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best aliens in a long time!","review":"Amazing! Human first contact with truly ALIEN aliens. Not hokey little green men or those stupid walking fetuses that are so popular these days. No way! The Moties are a work of absolute genius on Niven's part. They have their own solar sytem, described in vivid detail, their own complex evolutionary history (based on asymetry, rapid reproduction and extreme specialization) and a culture which is a logical outgrowth of their environment and genetic traits. Oh, and their civilization is VERY, very old. Human beings have been in space for 1000 years when this novel opens, but have not yet discovered other intelligent life. This fact alone makes me respect Niven. He doesn't create a bustling Star Trek cosmos where you bump into a new super-advanced alien every time you turn around. As if survival and civilization building were easy. He has a feel for the vastness of the universe---how unfriendly to life and civilization it can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book and read the sequel; \\"The Gripping Hand\\".","review":"Like a lot of Niven/Pournelle's work, the characters in these two stories are not miles deep; despite the fact that they can get INCREDIBLY talky at times.Nonetheless, the imaginative firepower required to create the beings, the culture and the civilization of the Moties is nothing short of awe-inspiring.If you buy \\"The Mote,\\" go ahead and order \\"The Gripping Hand\\" at the same time. You will not want to leave this fascinating universe any sooner than you have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work for me","review":"I am a fan of Larry Niven's work, but I did not like this book or it's sequel. I found the idea of a human future with a feudal system of hereditary royalty an annoying distraction. The characters felt flat and I did not get involved in the plot at all. It does have interesting concepts, which are the hallmark of Niven's writing, but I found the story line uninteresting. Niven's other collaborations, such as Lucifer's Hammer and Oath of Fealty, had more compelling characters and drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compel myself to turn another page","review":"Just couldn't keep going (which is rare for me). I got about 80% through and just didn't care what happened anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain silly","review":"I used to read Jerry Pournelle's computer column (in Byte magazine I think). That was a great column 15 years ago, he showed a very human side you didn't get from many other computer pieces. The column was long and winding, intermixing life and whatever computer toy he was playing with.So, recognizing his name I picked up this book. What a mistake. I'm sure there's a market for this branch of sci-fi, but it isn't me. This is space opera at it's worst, pure silliness. What Heinlein saw in this to give the endorsement on the cover of the edition I read, I'll never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stunning tour-de-crap","review":"The book's contrast between human and Motie society is little more than an excuse in sexism (Motie society is female dominated - and so doomed to fail) and racism (the whites rule Motie society and the brownies are slaves). Oh, but of course that's just white and brown fur, and so has nothing to do with our lives. Please, the book's racism and sexism are the only things to distract from pitifully wooden characterization and insipidly limp plotting. I've read Choose Your Own Adventure stories that were more engaging and intelligent. Do yourself a favor and read something by Philip K Dick instead of this pathetic drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Paranoid - A Terrible Book","review":"This book had all the makings of an interesting first contact book.

And if that wasn't bad enough, the Moties are even worse!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but entertaining","review":"Most engaging books do not take me long to read, and while I can't put my finger on why, this book took over a month for me to finish. The story was engaging, interesting, and vivid, but still slow to complete. I would recommend it to a friend who enjoys sci-fi, but not really to people who do not enjoy such tales of adventure...a counter example for my feelings about recommendations would be \\"A Game of Thrones\\"...that series I would recommend to anyone over 21...sci-fi or fantasy lover or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was hooked when I first read it...","review":"...and I'm glad I have it in my library.

Aside from the overt sexism, which is explained within the framework of the society, it has a very current style. Thought provoking, entertaining, and definitely a must-read for sci-fi fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Sci-Fi","review":"The Mote in God's Eye is a tale of the first meetings of life between humans and another intelligent life form (the Moties) in the year 3000.The greatest aspect of science fiction is the ability to show us ourselves in a new light. Beyond the methods used to setup first contact, and the endless debates about if the Moties are a threat to the Empire, is the misunderstandings and realizations about the humans by the Moties that are the most interesting. The book is a bit long on empire politics, but no where near the extent of the Dune series.You might like it if...You like science fiction (and not space operas).You are interested in sociology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun! Realistic as well.","review":"The human race has a lot against it. We pollute, we exterminate other races on Earth, we kill eachother, we fill the planet with our own offspring. We are cruel and suppressing. On the other hand: we are concerned too, loving and caring, curious, protecting, we like to clean things and we realise the problems at hand.We are Moties ourselves, in a lot of ways. And in the end, we have just been a bit luckier than them.I like the book. The story is well told. It is quite funny. It contains some nice plot twists. It contains scientifically rather possible goodies and almost no technobabble. The charactes develop nicely, even though most of them are clearly very tong-in-cheek. There are lessons to be learned from this book for now and for the future.So: read it! And I would certainly go to see it in cinema if a movie will be made of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Sci Fi at it's best.","review":"I read this one 20 years or so ago, and it was excellent then. Rereading it now, it is as fresh and current as ever. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I recently bought this book solely because of the rave reviews it received, and was taken aback at just how bad it is. Packed full of clich��d characters (reading Dr. Horvath's dialogue made me cringe, no scientist is THAT naive and stupid). The moties themselves are a bit meh as well, I was expecting to be blown away by the revelations about their social structure (as one reviewer assured me I would be). I was not.I enjoyed Niven's Ringworld much more, as at least the Ringworld itself was hugely impressive when described in the book. None of the elements here impressed me at all. I will not be recommending this book to anybody, and am contributing this review in the hope that I save someone's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much filler, hokey romance, and all that glorious, noble navy garbage made this one to return for a refund.","review":"Some reviewers say this starts slow. I would add it stays slow ~ all the way to the end. The only exciting scenes leave the main characters out. Too obviously setting up sequels and not enough meat here to bother with.And what is it with the choppy POV switching every paragraph? This is strictly amateur writing. The humans are all walking cliches spouting officious nonsense.Okay, now I know what bestselling SF is like, I'll return to reading the classics. Had enough filler? Want to try the real thing? Try Schmitz, Scheckley, Triptree and Vance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea, mediocre execution","review":"I like quite a bit of Pournelle's and Niven's other work, and this has an interesting concept, but it definitely drags. In addition, it has some irritating peculiarities with point of view, switching from character to character with little or no warning. The \\"big reveal\\" of the mystery is uninteresting, and the ending is unsatisfying. Heinlein's famous comment that this might be the best science fiction book he'd ever read is baffling; in my opinion, it's not even the best book that these two authors have written. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened","review":"This is a slow moving book that will test your resolve to keep reading it. Any action was few and far in between the tedious reading. Humans meeting a new species, the Moties, for the first time has a lot of exciting potential. However with the exception of those critters that could reengineer practically anything, kind of reminded me of replicators from SG1, the story line bogged down. The ending was also totally uninspiring. I know this is a classic just not sure why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mote in Gods Eye","review":"Where do I begin? This book had real potential...alas, it falls utterly flat. Lack of any character development WHATSOEVER along with a truly dated feel (the \\"pocket computers\\" that everyone carries around with them use circuit boards...this is a thousand years in the future, everyone should be walking around with quantum computers implanted in their teeth or something). My favorite character (Renner) is supposed to come off as some pompous arse, but is instead interpreted to be a knowledgeable patriot. Dr. Horvath is totally unrealistic...a scientist that is totally unwilling to change his beliefs even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. And the big Motie secret? BORING.I felt obligated rather than compelled to read this book, it was almost a chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed and disappointing","review":"Fans of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle should take a pass on this book.Many of the story's elements were impressive. Some of the book's chapters might have made good short stories, and a few of the characters were credible and interesting. Perhaps this accounts for the praise this book has received.As a whole, however, the book is unfocussed, dragging on endlessly before reaching its disappointing conclusion.The sequel to this book, The Gripping Hand, is also worth avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really convincing","review":"This book was at times quite interesting to read and there are some intriguing ideas, but somehow it can't really convince. As for being called a hard science book - how can an author describe a ferret as a catsized RODENT?? Jeeeeeez, that's like saying that an elefant is a primate. Another blunder is the space suit - it's described as being very thin and using body heat for thermoregulation and the best - it is permeable for perspiration!!! Helloooo? Doesn't anybody find that stupid? It should be called \\"crazy loonies certain death suit\\" ;-) was this a lousy attempt to \\"copy\\" Frank Herberts stillsuit? I don't know but, I know that it's not hard science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointing","review":"I rarely rate books here, but I have to leave my two cents on this one. Don't waste your time, this is a horrible book. For every good stretch that is interesting - which are few - there are long vast complicated stretches of either confusion or boredom.The complexity of the Motie species doesn't work well for the story. I love hard science fiction, but this is hard sci fi done wrong. Plus you have the stereotypical characters as many have mentioned. It is in many ways like reading a bad Star Trek episode.Worst is the self-approval stamp Heinlen put on this work. As one reviewer mentioned, he only allowed it if he could edit and fix the final manuscript himself, thus saying how great his own work is - shameless.When I finished this book, it went straight to the trash. For so much potential, it fails so miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Here is another of the so called \\"brilliant classics\\" of science fiction that everyone raves about. The book started out very well and was fairly gripping, then (as usual) it fizzled out.

Boy did I ever get the punishment I deserved.

Nuwere was not only present at the beginning in a sense, but also played in some very serious arenas. Many chapters have significant blacked-out text, an editorial conceit, but also one that makes it clear that this is a man who has had a great deal of interesting experience. He also writes in a strong voice. If we sometimes wonder how he can possibly tie together his interest in martial arts, his family's troubled life (his mother dies from AIDS), and his computing experiences, at the last we feel that he has done so and would not have had him leave anything out.

It's about growing from a mixed up, sometimes shallow, youth into a man, with all the adventures that entails. The reader can actually see the protagonist growing, step by step, hit or miss, toward honor and maturity. It's fascinating! Why does one person succeed while another fails?The title, \\"Hacker Cracker\\", is confusing however. Hacking is just a small part of Mr. Nuwere's adventures. And I do agree that the blacking out of text in one section is frustrating (They could have thought of some other way to get around the problem.)I still think the book is well worth reading. It's one of the most interesting books I've read this year, and I read alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun to remember but no substance","review":"Hacker Cracker. Just the name caught my eye and so I bought it thinking it would be a similar to Masters of Deception or Mitnick story, but it wasn't. The entire book is just Mr. Nuwere recounting his exploits from America Online to large corporations, throwing in a good bit about the mean streets of New York, and rounding out (literally) with some non-relevant martial arts. After reading it I was really let down. I was looking for something a little more definitive about computer security, the evolution of it from the time he was a kid to now, etc. Sad to say Masters of Deception was a better book than this but nothing will ever come close to the writing talent, intrigue, and plain storytelling than Cliff Stoll's book the Cuckoo's Egg. Maybe in twenty years if Mr. Nuwere wrote another book and explained what he's learned after spending some time OUT of the mean streets then perhaps it'd be a better book. Right now it's just a feel good made for TV movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended by Charles Washington","review":"A co-worker recommeded that I read this book, and, honestly, I did not have very high expectations.

It was encouraging to see that others agree with me, that this is a very boring story. I disliked these characters. I really did not care what happened to them. For someone as smart as Anna was supposed to be, she seemed incredibly stupid. I absolutely hated that Anna insisted on living with Daniel before she would consider marriage.

Check the sections for tightness after a hard cast as they tend to loosen up, particularly the front section. That is a common problem with multiple piece rods, however some are better at staying together than this rod. One guide is slightly out of alignment, but not enough to affect function. Well suited for it's intended purpose and with a few more attentions to detail from the manufacturer it would rate 5 stars.

This is my latest acquisition that I bought the old fashion way, through a bookstore, which gave me time to really preview the numerous books on this top selling software. The reason why I bought this book was because of the additional detail that you don't find in the other books. It's not just a 'what do the buttons do' software book. If you are only interested in building static web pages then another book may do, but if you are wanting to add dynamic pages, where the viewer inputs data into forms, then that's a whole other level of web building that most books don't cover. If your a novice and haven't had schooling in Web and Server applications (ASP,Coldfusion, etc)and database applications, this will help bring you up to speed.

This book has many flows, if you follow the code in the book, you get nowhere.If you just want to know the concept of web design, this book might be OK, but that's not something with Dreamweaver MX.

Another popular show that year was Mazinger Z (US Tranzor Z). Need I say more?Thank you Rhino for bringing this show to DVD and giving it it's just rewards.

Instead someone in marketing had the idea of squeezing even more money out of us clueless gamers- and so they did. I have maps. I have a monster manual.

Interesting and mind boggling, but chillingly possible. Aliens, mind control, and transplanting the human race. Food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Genius","review":"Ms.Butler's writting is creative, smooth and accesssible. Her characters are believable , the story is realistic and engaging. This woman stands out as one of the greats in Sci-Fi. The aliens are what we are more likely to find (if there is life out there) instead of the pseudo-humans one finds in most Fiction. No Science Fiction collection would be complete without ALL of her work. She is the Harlan Ellison of the 21st Century."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUTLER'S WORK IS OVERWHELMING, MESMERIZING","review":"Octavia Butler is a strange sort of author; try to explain the gist of her work to a new reader and you come off sounding foolish:\\" There's this woman who's been abducted by aliens with tentacle faces, except now she's supposed to repopulate Earth with the few remaining humans left after we've blown everything up in WWIII...\\" It sounds like atypical SF schlock... but Butler's honest dialogue and her knack for staying four to five steps ahead of the reader insure an astounding reading experience. Inevitably, when I read a book of Butler's, I spend the first sitting getting acclimated to the plot... the next sitting is a frenzied stopless race to the finish... Four novels equal four sleepless nights. I'm VERY excited to hear that DAWN is the first book in a series and I look forward to reading the rest as soon as possible... for those who haven't tried the Patternist stuff, look that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Butler uses her 248 pages exquisitely well...","review":"A short, enthralling, beautifully painless read. The author really knows how to tell her story, which is fascinating and new. Characters and plot are detailed, interesting and realistic. Human and alien characters (the Oankali) alike are very lifelike. The ideas behind the aliens are very fun and interesting : a species that can remix its own DNA, has three sexes and that acts as an interstellar DNA trader. A lot of thought went into creating the Oankali culture and biology. The pace of the book is brisk, details are given in the perfect amount, no overlong, self gratifying (for the author) descriptions... Octavia Butler has a thoroughly enjoyable writing style. I highly reccomend this book to any who cared enough to read these words. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of Butler's sensualist preoccupation","review":"Butler could write, no doubt about it, and it's a shame she died so young. Who knows what else she might have done? I've read a half dozen of her books and this is one of the few that qualifies as science fiction. Yet it also matches the sensualist preoccupation of many of the others. Although this time it's hard to imagine a sexual liaison with creatures that look and feel like shuffling collections of earthworms. I gave this a one-star not for quality but because the idea of a planet-devastating nuclear exchange between the US and Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union (the hook that lets the aliens take over) was trite, as well as unbelievable. And, then, the story was so strange, compelling at times but, in the end, too creepy for me to want to go on to the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"I'm not into Sci Fi but thought I would try this book based on the other reviews.

Aliens come and \\"rescue\\" the few survivors, place them in suspended animation, and prepare the survivors to re-inhabit the earth. Although the concepts of this book are interesting, I just never really cared for any of the characters. It isn't that the author's character development was lacking - only that the characters weren't all that likable. As the humans are \\"re-awakened\\" and begin their training to re-inhabit earth, they start to divide themselves into rival groups. At times I felt like I was watching the TV show \\"Survivor\\", and not much caring who won. Maybe if the characters were more likeable I would have enjoyed the book more. I think I'll pass one the other 2 books in this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing read.","review":"I sat down started reading and was drawn into the story immediately, before I realized it I was on the last page.

If you are into the concept of humanity destroying itself and having to give up part of itself to survive, this book is for you. This book uses metaphors to discuss complex subjects including the role of women, the role of science and genetic enginering, the contradiction that is humanity and learning how to start over when there is little trace of the past. Dawn is an easy read and will definitely cause you to read Adulthood Rites and Imago. A great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, fascinating and compelling","review":"Mr Dahl's work evoked a sense of the familiar in me even though our dream worlds couldn't be more opposite. The pieces are interesting in themselves and can be read as entertaining short stories but I think they will speak to the reader on a sub-conscious level in a much more powerful way. It's a wonderful book and I can only say that the stories made me laugh, contemplate and remember things in my life that were experienced consciously and in my dreams, some I hadn't thought of in over 30 years.

From the opening notes of 'Distraction' to the last booming effects of 'Learning to Stand' TJ proves that he has developed into a strong lyricist. The songs portray deep and raw emotion that any listener can feel an instant connection with. Though it's a strong, radio friendly CD, I feel that it's filled with a little too many extra noises and effects, and in some cases, making the emotion that's been to be given impossible to feel. But with two remastered old favorites 'Pretty New Things' and 'Don't Touch Me', LC expands on it's past and builds the foundation for a very long and promising future."},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept -- poorly made","review":"I have owned two of these items, both broke after a few weeks normal use.

Then when you need to press Y & B together, it frequently doesn't work or you end up pressing the black(clear) or white button accidentally because they are (1)placed in the old area on top vs. the bottom and (2) they are too close to the other buttons. When I took a punch from a fighter, it began to vibrate but wouldn't stop for about 20 seconds (stuck). The buttons are also too close to the right stick. I kept bumping it while pressing B or X.

The brad nailer broke on me 5 times and the finish nailer twice. Fortunately the HDepot carried them so I just returned them for a new one each time. Unfortunately, they no longer carry these items for reasons I can only guess might be that they were filling containers full of broken guns for return to Senco.If you aren't going to use these guns for your livelyhood, then by all means get one.

For almost 20 years I have loved Senco tools, but I do not consider expensive bread and butter tools to be throwaways. It also gave no warning whatsoever. Great one minute, dead the next. Anyone need batteries and a charger?Finally, I don't abuse tools, always kept it in its case, and used Senco nails. This tool has no excuse.A follow up:I called Senco and they agreed without fuss to fix the tool, which a local shop did quickly and for free. Now I am back to my air free addiction.

Auther tries to relate the story with contemporary events in the country but that has nothing to do in fact with the title and mean theme of the book. Goma in this novel is shown so wide and kind hearted, which of course doesn't represent the women from Nepal. Goma is a nepali women and nepali women can't act that way. The character of Malati is also not understandable. Readers can't get enough from her. Her actions in the story simply don't make any sense!However, there are some good things to get from this.

The second, a U lock, Seized up in similar fashion while trying to leave work. The lock was so weak, that when in frustration I wacked the lock on the bike rack, it broke in half.

Expecting the worst, I watched this DVD, and I tell you, it is amazing what I had forgotten. 7-Zark-7 was from a different anime, Casey Kasem was the voice of Mark, the hero. Some of the characters were annoying, but it was great!! Death, smoking, violence, all that are missing from today's children's entertainment, since were worried about scarring them. I loved every minute of it, and felt some of the old thrill I had when I was a child. And to top it off, the DVD had the original Ninja Science Team, Gatchaman episodes. And another Gatchaman Series, I hadn't known about.The only thing I didn't like, was these episodes focused too much on Mark, and that Volume 2 was released before volume 1.

There are so many black fruit teas that I love, such as Black Current, Peach Coconut and Pumpkin Spice to name a few. I would always reach for those before I would go for this tea. Luckily, I only had to purchase one tin so unlike many other teas on Amazon where the cost reflects 6 boxes, this time I took a chance and it did not pay off for me. I do wish this company and other companies would indicate whether the flavorings in their teas are natural or artificial. I have a feeling that if the flavoring in this tea is artificial that would negatively affect the flavor but I can't say that's the case because the tin doesn't make that clear.

Why? The hinge broke off after only a few months of use - and careful treatment. And, the lack of a headset jack and loud speaker makes your personal memos (\\"Call back doctor\\") into public announcements when you're doing playback. I covered the speaker with a bit of tape, which helped make it quiet, but also muffles the sound a bit. I *do* like the beep when you start/stop recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"What'd you say?","review":"I think this digital recorder is a great way to take notes or say your thoughts when you don't really have the time to write down anything. This way, you're allowed to speak and review later on to make sure that you didn't forget anything.The design of this recorder keeps the Palm Vx looking classy instead of making it look bulky and cheap. This is a great way to go to stay ahead of the game. What else do you really need to make sure that you have all the information you need when talking with people or maybe talking to yourself? =)The pretty low price for a digital voice recorder makes this accessory one to buy and use time and time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try - but a waste of money.","review":"The GoVox for Palm V seems like a nice idea - record a note while driving when your hands are not free to jot. But I found the design not robust. Sometimes it doesn't record even with carefully correct button sequences. It just seems dead. Other times it begins recording when stashed in my pocket and bumped. The buttons are not sufficiently recessed to prevent this. I replaced it once in case the first unit was simply a lemon. But the second unit behaved just the same. It turned out to be a waste of money and time for me. I'll go back to a slim hard case and work on my human memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just sits on the Palm","review":"This recorder is in now way integrated with the Palm, other than that it sticks to it.

This is a great futuristic flight shooter that has a decent story. What makes this game great is the huge battles where you definitely feel like you made a difference going against ships much much larger then you. Also what made this game great is the option to customize your fighter with different weapon systems. The Anime style cut scenes are like watching a movie sometimes which add to the fun.There really is no major downside to this game, difficulty level starts off normal but does get a lot more difficult closer to the end you get. The story line is just above average but still I watched and listened to it.Overall this is a lot of face paced fun and it definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly awful game","review":"This game is a mess (though it was made many moons ago). The graphics are okay (but you can't see a lot of the smaller enemies), the weapon system is good, the scale of battles is good, however...everything is poorly implemented especially the control scheme.Control is too touchy, battles are too hectic and too fixed (objective-wise), story is goofy, and the game is extremely repetitive.

Especially after reading Eric Blehm's Last Season. The writing was at best fair. I found myself either falling to sleep or skipping pages to see if something was eventually going to get better. I kept trying to figure out what the title had to do with the content. Fisher certainly knows A LOT about the building of dams or the flooding history of a particular area and on and on and on. Ocasionally there was a sentence or two that made me feel it was about to turn around but I realized that at more than 3/4 of the way through I was still hoping for that.

The subject has much promise but the execution is excruciating. There are a few good parts but the choppy storytelling and unrelated tangents left me unsatisfied. After the rendering of one incident regarding a missing woman, I actually wished I had never picked up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Potential","review":"In the introduction to his book Smith outlines an exciting career of Ranger Service around the country in National Parks and the like. This book, however, is not about that part of his career. This book contains short recollections, neither poignant nor amusing, of Ranger Service in a doomed recreation area (soon to be dammed). The book is more a history of the planned dam than anything else. Smith's fellow Rangers are portrayed as hopeless men who are simply putting in time before retirement or the building of the Dam. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Ponderous","review":"The book started with a bang and ended with a whimper. It was tedious reading by and large, as the Park System is viewed by kind of the Willie Loman of Rangers. He also, as is common in this day, blames all the world's ills on America's and particularly George Bush's failure to get with the program and turn America into a socialist paradise.He also spent twenty years with his co-workers, but has about as much insight, overt compassion, and intimacy with them as I have with the people with whom I wait for the bus.

It also does not cut thicker grass at all. One could look at that as a positive because the crab grass now sticks out above the rest of the grass and you can pull it. Creeping grasses (the kinds the grow sideways first) will not get cut at all. I guess that's where the \\"suction\\" of a high speed mower will pull these blades up to get wacked.

Shortly after he's charged with the care of abused, delinquent, epileptic ten-year-old Owen Kane (Hugh O'Connor), his own father dies. Both emotionally needy, the man and boy develop a fondness for each other that's clearly inappropriate, though not sexual.Feeling desperate, Lamb takes a loan on his pending inheritance and runs away with the boy across the sea to Wales and finally London, naively oblivious of the consequences. Because both were oppressed by the head of the school (Ian Bannen), you'll almost want to root for them getting away, but the film keeps skirting the edges of the inappropriateness of their relationship, with a shocking ending.There's good acting, music by Van Morrison, and the film might keep your interest mainly out of sympathy for the boy, hoping it will turn out ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"close but no cigar","review":"It's unfortunate that this, the only full-length Catwoman novel I know of, had to take place so shortly after the dismal Frank Miller Year One reboot.

The poems in this collection are \\"improved\\" versions of the original poems which can be found in other available editions. Moreover, the selections include most of ED's least interesting work. When ED died two people selected some of her poems and prepared them for publication by adding punctuation, altering words, and even omitting words, lines, and whole stanzas so that the polite readers of her day would find ED's poems more palatable and less offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emily Dickinson's Poetry is altered by the editor","review":"I am a big fan of Emily Dickinson, I love her poetry, but this edition is thoroughly rotten. It is not Emily Dickinson's poetry, but the edited version of her poetry, significantly changed by the same editor who rejected Dickinson's poems while she was alive. This edition is changed so much from the original poems that most of Dickinson's meaning is lost. If you want to read what Emily Dickinson really wrote, I reccomed the complete poetry of Emily Dickinson edited by Thomas H. Johnson, it is the complete and original poetry of Dickinson."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Higginson Thinking?","review":"I would like to know what Higginson was thinking when he obliterated Emily's poetry. He actaully had the arrogance to think that he knew what she 'intended' to write. This is an absolute farce of a book. Compare the hacked and pieced poems in this 'book' <and I use the term loosely> to the ones you find in 'The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson' edited by Thomas H. Johnson. That is the book to get. Johnson was part of the team that maticulously read her hand-written versions and published a word for word, dash for dash version. If you want to read what the genious Emily originally wrote seek the REAL works, not this attrocious adaptation! The print speaks for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"This book may be interesting to experts who want to see how the first \\"editors\\" Todd and Higginson, alterated Dickinson's poems, \\"by smoothing out the rhymes and meter, changing line arrangements, and rewriting the dialect of the local area\\", as the introduction plainly states.Is it naivety, stupidity or cold deliberation that this book is still sold under the innocent title of \\"collected poems\\", as if it presented the original texts? It should come with a warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"An anthology or a selection is not enough for Dickinson.","review":"It can be fairly said that Emily Dickinson is the most sensible American poet up to this date. Her themes range from love to death, but she prefers the latter; and her poetic artistry is far more musical than Baudelaire's, more vivid than Christina Rossetti's. In her way of writing her soul and senses in a poem, she can only be compared to Spanish Romantic, Gustavo A. Becquer; both in themes, and metaphorical pictures, although not in style. She is one true American classic. I am rating the book with nine points, not because the selection is poor or weak; rather because a selection is not enough when dealing with Dickinson. Her minor poems are her finest and, because each person has his own favorite, a title having the words \\"Complete Works\\" is more appropiate. However, it is a good start for a poetry lover, and Dickinson's Poems are esay to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the best poetry book I have read!","review":"Poems can express feelings that you normally can't. In this book Emily expresses Love, Life, Nature, and Time and Eternity. One of my favorite poems, in this book, is: I'm nobody! Who are you? Are you nobody too? Then there is a pair of us -- don't tell They'd banish us you know. How dreary to be somebody! How public, like a frog To tell your name the livelong day To an admiring bog. In this poem I think Emily is trying to say she is nobody. I mean, she is nobody important and if you think she is important she would like her privacy. If you think poetry is not for you, please give this book a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably beautiful","review":"Every fan of slide guitar, or the blues, or old-time gospel, should own this.

Combine it with the ..unknown woman.. vocal who accompanies him on most cuts, and you have a sound so sublime and pure that it is mindboggling.

If you're debating whether or not to get this CD, you probably already know a good deal about the blues. So...Blind Willie Johnson sings like Charlie Patton sometimes, and other times really softly, as in his unique \\"Dark was the Night...\\" His slide playing is great, and the female vocalist sounds great and adds intensity to his growling. He is completly different stylistically from Skip James, but you will probably like him if you like (early) James because I'd say that he is equally intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kristen Miraglia","review":"Once I picked up this book, I could not put it down.

Good job Joey Reynolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book","review":"As anyone who has heard him on radio knows, Joey Reynolds is a funny guy. So it is no surprise that this is a funny book. Joey's had his down times like the rest of us, and he puts that in the book too. I like the way he bounces back from those experiences. Joey's worked with a lot of people in show biz, so if you like radio and entertainment stories you'll like \\"Let A Smile be Your Umbrella.\\" I did and I recommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not real good","review":"Grew up outside Buffalo, New York. Listened to Joey every night and watched his Saturday dance show on tv. Book was easy read but a disappointment. No dates and not enough information....it seemed to jump around. (maybe like his life) I though would not have missed this book...brought back good memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps my interest!","review":"I had heard Joey on radio, and found his show to be upbeat, entertaining, and informative in a real and warm way. There doesn't seem to be any pretense about Joey. Then, in reading his book, I found even more of that same quality. A great book - a fun read - my highest recommendations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning portraits","review":"This coffee table book makes for stunning visual portraits of PNG natives in their tribal display.

I received them both quickly but this one was the wrong thing. It was pants instead. I emailed them and they responded quickly and said they would send the correct thing. I mailed the pants back which cost me as I had opened the package. They did send another sweatshirt but instead of a large adult I received a large youth. It was too late to return it and get another to my parents out of state so I kept it and gave it to my daughter. I am sure they would have corrected it again but I had no time to do get it done before Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"HTR22-2U is too noisy for Home Theatre use.","review":"If you are looking for a UPS/Power Conditioner for Home Theatre use, Do Not buy the HTR22-2U, unless you can place it in a totally soundproof room! I purchased it because its technical specs seemed outstanding. However, once I received it, placed it into my Home Theatre rack, and turned it on, I couldn't believe the noise levels put out by the cooling fan. I turned my TV volume up to 80 (out of 100) and could still hear the HTR22 over the TV. It was louder than the TV in the adjacent room, as well. And, the fan runs all the time.I checked with Tripp Lite and they confirmed that this unit is noisy. So unless you have a sonically isolated room for your equipment, the HTR22 is not suitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great","review":"Being a fan of gospel music i was a bit hesitant to give Crystal a listen.

Kelly and Bono (i think it's called \\"Lean on me\\"....not quite sure)....anyway, this cd is purely awesome.....her vocal capability just BLOOOOOOOOOOOOWS you away!....i've NEVER heard a voice like this....she has an AMAZING anointing....i particularly like \\"What A Fool I've Been\\"....the rap is hot and the bass drops \\"something serious\\" on this song! :) Anyway, may God bless and keep you and may His grace and peace be with you!!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her voice is fearless","review":"Fearless is a wonderful album. I am a devout fan and own all of them. No denying Crystal is the \\"Teena Marie\\" of Christian Music. Her voice is r&b and very soulful with a bit of rock flavor. My favorite tracks on this album is \\"Reach Out to you\\", \\"Satisfied\\" and \\"What A fool I've been.\\" Crystal Lewis has not failed me yet. She is a living legend in Gospel music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed...","review":"I was really going into buying this album thinking it would be the best she has ever done. It doesn't touch \\"Beauty For Ashes\\" and \\"Gold\\". I thought that the songs all sounded the same. There were a few songs that are good: \\"One Man\\", \\"Only Fools\\", \\"Satisfied\\", and \\"Trust Me\\" are the only ones that stood out and they are, in my opinion, the only good songs on this album. I love the vocals, they have a 8. The words have a 7, but the arrangement of the songs has a 1. Crystal, I liked this album, I guess, but the way everyone was talking....it was gonna be a smash hit...and it is anything but that! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless....","review":"I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!! It is in my opinion, the BEST CL ablum. Her vocals are very nice and the songs production has been kicked up a (few) notches since her last CD, Gold (which is also good.) A few highlights include, but are not limited to, 'I Still Believe'(w/Kirk Franklin SO AWESOME!!!), 'My Friend'(an AWESOME friendship song - better than Michael W Smiths!) , 'What a Fool...'(her vocals are top notch), 'I will Go' 'Only fools' 'change my heart' are great CL songs! I know its kinda old now, but i still love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FEARLESS AND FUNKY FOR YA!","review":"I really enjoy this album because Crystal is not afraid to strech out and experiment with different genres of music.The first track REACH OUT is a trip-hop, alternative sounding track and Crystal's voice gives it a really ethereal sound to it.The next track SATISFIED is very r&b and a little disco as well.You will definitely want to get up and move to it.The Kirk Franklin produced I STILL BELIEVE is really pleasant to listen to and has a kind of contemporary \\"anthem\\" sound to it.I always likened Lewis to being the \\"Teena Marie\\" of contemporary christian music because she has such a soulful and earthy quality to her voice.She is not trying to sound urban which some singers in this genre do sometimes and she keeps real and holy.This cd is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistitled and misleading","review":"I was looking for a guide on Glacier National Park. This book enticed me by its title. Insiders' guide to Glacier National Park, however it should be renamed: Insiders guide to the Flathead Valley and one chapter on Glacier National Park.

I have spent 2 months combing this book trying to find something to help plan our trip. I finally went out and bought Frommer's Guide to Montana and Wyoming and it gave me all the information I was looking for in 1 chapter. It answered all my questions with ease. This Insidier's Guide did not even have trail names listed. The Montana/Wyoming 2-state book with several national parks covered had all the trail names of GNP listed. This book should be taken off the shelves!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Relocating to Glacier","review":"This book provides a great review of the Glacier Area - if you are interested in Moving there. It even dedicates an entire chapter to relocation. It does provide an interesting list of area museums, curiosities and accomodations. The author includes narratives on local history and wildlife. However, there is no information on trails and hiking. This is a good overall book if you do not plan on leaving your car and are planning to see the area including numerous local towns. I returned this book and plan to purchase other guides with provide more practical information on what the park offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD! BAD!

Steve Hill not only measured up to his reputation as a great guitarist here but he also wrote some wonderful songs to back up his solos, taking the blues into multicolored soundscapes of his own. Highlights are \\"Top Forty\\", \\"You can trust me now\\" and \\"What a life\\" among others. His first eponymous record also offers plenteous time travel references and signature licks. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues As It Should Be!!","review":"Believe it or not, Steve Hill can play anything, from blues to rockabilly to surf.. and he does it in style!! On this, his second album, we hear a different Steve, a more confident Steve Hill. His guitar-playing is still spectacular, but he decides, with a little help from all his musicians, to mix it up on this album. To not only serve us hard-bearing blues, but also a bit of soul, rhythm & blues, and rock. A great album by a great performer. In my opinion, he just bumped Colin James down a few notches from his reign as Best Canadian Blues Artist and you should be seeing a lot more of Steve Hill in the following months and years!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trimmings Without Substance","review":"RAZZLE DAZZLE is essentially nothing more than a Mitzi Gaynor TV Specials SAMPLER. It features GLIMPSES of her shows as well as a few complete comedy sketches and song-and-dance numbers therefrom, but its entertainment value has been tremendously diluted by its documentary format. Predictable interviews with show-business professionals are nice, but inessential. I'd substitute every minute of RAZZLE DAZZLE's interview footage and commentary with more TV clips concentrating solely on Mitzi's comic brilliance or her truly \\"razzle-dazzle\\" dancing. Mitzi's management apparently pushed for--but incredibly failed to obtain--a DVD box-set release of her complete TV specials as originally aired. The loss is large. This single-disc revue is wanting; it is most unsatisfactory--it offers individual tiles, but no complete mosaics. One star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: documentary ABOUT the specials, not the actual specials","review":"I thought I was purchasing a DVD of Mitzi Gaynor TV specials. She made 9, so minus ads that's about 7 hours of content. Instead, I got a 2-hour documentary *about* the Mitzi Gaynor specials: brief glimpses of what I thought I was purchasing intercut with interviews with a late-life Gaynor and other participants and fans.The documentary was okay, but the price is quite expensive compared to other documentaries of comparable quality and length. Rereading the DVD box, I do find the word \\"documentary\\" buried on the back cover, but it does not appear on the front of the product - not even in small print!

This production includes interviews with her and Bob Macke which are very enjoyable. As a designer of clothing I enjoyed their discussions of costume design for the productions.

This is what I watch when I want to just be entertained, not get into a movie, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE'S NUMBER ONE!","review":"I've always known that Mitzi Gaynor reached a level of entertainment excellence that has never been surpassed by another musical performer. \\"Razzle-Dazzle\\" proves it. This woman's versatile and astounding talents are an absolute joy to watch. I hope someone will soon make all her t.v. shows available for purchase on DVD. I can't say it enough: Mitzi Gaynor's talents are extraordinary and an entertainment feast.

Nothing related to Da vinci's code is talked about in depth, as the narrator is constantly saying \\"without revealing too much\\" and will continue to talk about the building or city. Although there were a couple of interesting facts, I was very disappointed because it's very boring and the back round music put me to sleep twice, that's saying alot for me.To add to your collection for the few bucks it is - I say go ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great review book","review":"This book covered all of the information necessary to study for CISSP.

How is that relevant to SECURITY architecture designs? That's some seriously brainless copy & paste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy if you have a lot of spare time","review":"This book is overly detailed, and not a good crunch guide.

Even for a technically capable person like me (BS & MS EE, PHD candidate at a top engineering school) my brain would wonder and spin each time I attempted to read this book. It is so full of repetitive jargons and very \\"extended\\" sentences that make you lose track of the information the author is try to convey.

Although I liked the Harris book and it was very informative, my advice is that if you are only going to buy one exam guide, buy the (ISC)2 book.

Many of White's songs have a lyrical power that is the equal of any great bluesman (e.g., \\"Fixin' To Die Blues\\"), and his guitar playing is wonderful. If you like Robert Johnson, in other words, you'll also like White. Essential music for the blues nut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not new","review":"We were disappointed in this product when it arrived.

This set is smaller (and costs less), but it's a great starter set if you don't mind picking up additional pieces here and there, or if 90% of your display is a circus, and you just want a train to run around it.By the way, \\"small\\" is relative when you're discussing garden trains. The locomotive and tender (coal car) are about 30\\" long all by themselves.The train is pulled by the same upgraded 4-6-0 locomotive that pulls most of Bachmann's starter sets, so you will be pleased with the quality or durability of this set.Paul Race - editor, Family Garden Trains(tm)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect to buy a new brand","review":"I haven't had any problems with this filter *however* it is impossible to find replacement cartridges for the filter.

I usually read two to three books a week.The story starts off slow then picks up and then takes another dive. The dives take a lot away from the story. At one point in this love story she has Darnell say to Shemone do you want my arm to fall off in reference to Billy Dee Williams. But then the writer states Billy Dee said this in Mahogany.WRONG,WRONG,WRONG. Billy Dee said that line in Lady Sings The Blues. Then she has a character who gets shot and is practically brain dead and she allows him to live which was not at all realistic with the story line. Although this is fiction reading is about making it realistic. And last but not least Shemone and Darnell get married and even though it was only close friends and family Darnell's best friend who was one of the main character's throughout the book was not even at the wedding. This was definitely a sad,sad story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I thought it was great.

The storyline in general kept up the momentum, but barely. Too many times, I found myself slamming the book down in disbelief to outright disgust. Some of the situations were realistic enough but were so underdeveloped to the point of being unrealist, but hey, it's fiction, so what did I expect, a more realistic depiction of seemingly realistic situations? Goodness, no. The dialogue was, for the most part, corny; the narration was, at times, confusing, and the story just didn't flow like it should have. I love romance novels like the next person, I've just read better. I thinks Hayes is a promising novelist, but a little more research behind the fiction would make for a better read. That's just one person's opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKE IT STOP","review":"You know what? It doesn't get any better.I know, I know. You too were roped in by the awesomeness of The Golden Age and just HAD to see what came next, right? Sure, the first book started to drag a bit before it ended, but that was just because Wright had to fill some pages, right? The awesomeness would return in the middle book, just like the \\"Empire Strikes Back,\\" right?NO.This book is godawful, terrible bad. This would make Vernor Vinge cringe. It's epically, pompously, annoyingly horrendous. The action is so wordy that you can't follow it. The conversations sound like they were lifted from 1940s B noir. The most compelling plot points are buried in a sea of sloppily constructed speechifying.It gets two stars for being imaginative and for tying up some loose ends of the first book, but make no mistake that I am strongly urging you to avoid this hack job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the First!","review":"I found the first one slow moving and hard to get through, although that was admittedly because I was in school when I read it and concentrating more on other things. The Golden Age held my attention, however, enough for me to purchase the second book, which I read over Christmas vacation. I have to say that this one held my attention much more, and I found I could barely put it down. It was much more entertaining, I thought, than the first one. The only problem I had with it was Phaethon's condescending attitude. It added dimensionality to the character, but almost went so far as to make him un sympathetic. Daphne quite literally goes to the ends of the earth for him and he treats her like she's some kind of burden, always ignoring her when she's probably the smartest of the bunch. \\"No no no honey, space travel is for big strong men only, why don't you run along like a good little girl and clean the house\\" -- UGH! SO annoying. Other than that though it was a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chaotic Musical Venture","review":"This particular album was probably their most whacked out, chaotic, bizarre musical masterpiece out of their entire discography. At times a full blitzkrieg of insrtumental assault to the senses thanks largely to the part of the guitar genuis Vernon Reid, who I think should be considered a future Rock-n-Roll hall of famer. Not their most stable work, but I really liked the direction they were heading. Had Living Colour remained together, there would have been a totally different outlook at music today! It was terribly heart-breaking the day they broke up, but they certainly went out with the \\"take no prisoners\\" mentality with this one!! Get this album if your a fan of riveting and influential type music!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Following the trend of the Times","review":"I've got mixed feelings about this album because I felt it was forced. LC didn't have to appeal to the punk/aggression audience, with their original brand of music I think they touched a lot of different audiences successfully. This album has it's bright spots, but most of the creativity is covered by the darkness of the album's tone. You judge for yourself, I did, and I thought the album was alright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have you gone Living Colour?","review":"A fitting end to a short but brilliant career. Living Colour was the single best thing too come out of the eighties if you like rock and roll unfortunately they weren't mainstream enough for the mainstream and not alternative enough for alternative people. What nobody has ever understood about this band is that they were on their own wave, creating their own movement. Nowhere is this more evident than on Stain where the band began to truly make music that was truly their own. It's unfortunate that this would be their last album because it gives such a beautiful glimpse of what could have been. And for all the people who find the new rap core bands and their samples so interesting, check this albume out, Living Colour were using samples six years before Limp Bizkit not to mention while everybody else was still stuck on Nirvana and Pearl Jam, this album is a true original and a true classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"You might want to reconsider purchasing this book","review":"Recipes are very detailed and can take as much as 2 hours to prepare.

He is only 76. Most 76 year olds can walk a few steps on their own.This important fact demands full disclosure in all of Walford's books. Why has not Dr. Roy Walford revealed it so we can decide if we want to buy his book and his regimen? To hide this fact is at the very least unethical on his part, and on the part of his publisher. So Buyer Beware!I believe the scientific evidence is abundant that caloric restriction can retard aging and extend life. So obviously Dr. Walford has either not really been on it, or has not done it right!I for one am not interested in an anti-aging guru who grows old faster, more horribly, than normal people on a junk diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspirational and fun album.","review":"This is a really great record. i got it almost a year ago.

They are so... I don't know... exciting and snappy they just rock. And you can totally tell then John Reuben is a Christian artist, because he never says anything rude or crass and, though some of his music might lean towards a hint of self praise, he still rocks... in short I guess I'm trying to say he is the best Christian rapper in the business... and he could kick Eminem's butt anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am so thankful for this video","review":"My 7 yr. old son has recently been diagnosed with this syndrome.

I am very disappointed as my watch just died after about 15 mos. The watch was lightly used and basically pampered, appearing brand new. My emphasis is on the fact that the watch was in no way abused. I then sent the watch back to Invicta for repairs and they wanted $48 to fix it, including a rip-off price of $28 for S & H. The representative I dealt with, on top of it, was unyielding, blunt and unapologetic. They furthermore refused any type of extended warranty if I consented to fix the watch. There's no way I'm going to invest about half of the watch's purchase price to fix it just to have it die again after minimal use. I consider this watch and brand to be junk and think that if you want reliability, don't buy it. I've had better luck with so-called cheap brands like Guess and Casio.

I've read hunderds of them. This one, just might be the worst I've read in years. The story is just so shallow, the characters are so flat, and the ending totally predictable. I really can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story deserves a better writer","review":"I too followed this story when it broke, and then on Court-TV, and looked forward to the book that would surely result from this case. But this wasn't it. The book jacket says the author is a veteran journalist, but at times he writes like a high school student. I could hardly believe it when I read this (p. 58 of the hard cover edition): \\"Mark inserted the key into the ignition, put the car into reverse, then into drive as he crept across the smooth asphalt surface of the parking lot.\\" There's too much filler like this in the book. There's also way too much in this book about what Mark Hacking was supposedly thinking - and since the author didn't interview him, who knows what he was thinking? And the same goes for his actions immediately following the murder - who knows what he really did?I wish Ann Rule had written this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than the newspapers told us...","review":"I followed this case in the magazines and newspapers, and bought the book because it was such a sad and extraordinary case. As always in these types of books, there is new information that I didn't know before (especially the last paragraphs....) Mark Hacking is probably the dumbest of all criminals I have read about -- and I've read about a lot of them. The things he did are just beyond comprehension, not only the murder itself, but his alibi and cover-up were stupid. In any case, he is locked up forever, hopefully. Lori trusted an untrustworthy man, to say the least. But then, maybe that's why they call sociopaths the killer's next door -- they live among us, but no one suspects anything until it's too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply boring","review":"I don't know why most of the true crime books I've read lately have the feel of a remedial reader. This one offered little information of why someone would go to such lengths to make up a fake life, one that could easily be discovered. It's not worth the time especially if you don't have much to spare for reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad research!","review":"Well, I am a Roman Catholic who enjoys reading true crime books. Honestly, this book was such a waste of money. In fact I think there was no research done, I followed the case from Germany, reading newspaper articles online and well, I did not gather any new information about the case at all.There was no research done at all - the author simply put the information everyone could get from newspapers into the book and he talks and talks and talks - basically a lot of pages filled with no info at all.I don't think that the religion was a part of this case at all (there are psychos of every religion and without belonging to a church!) so it was annoying to read biased information about the Mormon church for pages and pages and pages.Real disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this book, A lot of lies","review":"This book should be sold as fiction. It is one of the worst written and most inaccurate books on the Mormon religion I have ever read. Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensational and salicious","review":"I threw the book in the trash after skimming it for about an hour. For some reason, the author believes that the Mormon faith played an integral role in Lori's murder...that if Mark Hacking were not a Mormon, he wouldn't have killed his wife (I wonder, if Mark had been a member of some other religion, would religion have even been mentioned in the book?). Major portions of the book are filled with lies and half-truths about the Mormon church used, I'm sure, to create an even more sensational story (the author himself, in the foreword, admits he gathered his information on the Mormon church from disaffected former members. So much for journalistic honesty). There was also the inclusion of very sacred ceremonies and symbols from the Mormon faith that served no purpose to the story whatever...except to create controversy. Sadly, I guess we all know controversy sells books, even poorly written books like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH BROTHER !","review":"THIS IS SINGULARLY THE WORST TRUE CRIME BOOK I'VE EVER READ. IT'S NOT EVEN A CRIME BOOK, IT'S AN ANTI-MORMON DIATRIBE AND IT'S JUST PLAIN SOPHOMORIC. AS A FORMER THERAPIST AND POLICE OFFICER I WILL SAY THIS, MARK HACKING WAS A TEXTBOOK PSYCHOPATH, BE HE LDS, BAPTIST, CATHOLIC OR DRUID AND RELIGION HAD NOT ONE IOTA TO DO WITH THE MURDER. THE AUTHOR EVEN ADMITS HIS BIAS. WAIT FOR SOMETHING BETTER TO COME OUT, THIS IS JUST JUNK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"I had to laugh when I saw the first two reviews..it was just too coincidental how they both were so upset about how they felt the Mormon church was being portrayed. I wonder if it's the same person who has made up two identities on Amazon?? Anyway I felt it was written well and I read ALOT of true crime. I never once felt like it was attacking the Mormon church in anyway and I would recommend it to any true crime reader. BTW, if the two reviewers want to get mad at something, they should check out the new HBO series \\"BIG LOVE\\"..now that is something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written - Would not recommend","review":"I agree with Sadie. This book was terribly written and I actually felt that this author should definitely be writing in a different arena or maybe even not at all. I noted several inconsistencies that made me go back and check to see if I had misread or missed something, so that was frustrating. I already knew most of the details that this author included from Court TV and the news reports. It did not seem that he had any inside knowledge or any inside connections whatsoever. The book is an excellent resource if you are looking to learn about the Mormon faith and the layout of Salt Lake City. As a long time true crime book fan, I was very disappointed by about page 37 and I would not recommended this book. OH, and about the \\"gripping\\" photos - not so gripping! The only photo of Lori was a picture of her missing person flyer. I thought that was cheesy. The only photo of Mark is his mugshot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst True Crime Book","review":"I only read true crime books and will never read another one written by Mr. Long. This was truly the most poorly written book I have ever read. Unfortunately I bought this book in hard cover so I really got taken. It was obviously thrown together for the author to make a quick buck which is a real shame to the families involved who deserve more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every's Woman's Nightmare","review":"I so wanted to like this book as I had a great interest in this case and it's Mormon perspective. Unfortunately many facts were glossed over and it seemed glib. There was no real character development. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are looking for a very fundamental view of this highly publicized murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Mormons not Mormans","review":"Just tell the story without all the made up religious storytelling.I know it makes for a more interesting read but when one has been a member over 45 years it becomes very distracting to read all the negative, fabricated, salacious and skewed details.

Other than that I didn't find any new details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I remember this case very well from several years ago, so I was very excited to read this book, as a true-crime buff. However, this book was basically a waste of time. I didn't learn anything new from this book that I couldn't have learned from googling the case. I was looking more of an Ann Rule-esque type of book, with more background on Lori and Mark. What I really wanted to learn more about was how Mark got away this his lies for so long and how Lori really felt when she found out (did she confide in any close friends when she found out he wasn't going to med school?), but the author didn't interview any close friends or family, save Lori's brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, so so book","review":"This book was written about the next case of a missing pregnant wife after Scott Peterson and the subject was interesting enough that I kept reading this book. It is a little simplistic as well as it seemed like the author was grasping for material. For example, there is a whole section about the Hacking's cat. Either way, it was an okay read. Feel very sorry for her whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"for lori hacking...","review":"not the page turner i was hoping for....i feel for lori and her family-and hope mark rots in hell for what he did to her/familybut this story--needs another writer to write it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same being a reporter than writing a book","review":"Albeit before reading this book you'll know who was the killer. The problem with SL is that he wrote the mistakes done by the killer in the first part of the book. So the only quasi thrilling part was how they found the body and even that part isn't such a thrilling part. I also agree with others reviewers that the Mormon explanation at every part of the book is just excessive and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time & Money","review":"While I was hoping for some insight into the murder of Lori Hacking, all I read was what Mark might have been thinking.

It is really a wonderful book that I cannot say enough about. If you want to know how this relates to all sorts of other things that we do, I suggest the truly amazing book called, \\"The Ever-Transcending Spirit\\" by Toru Sato.

I also like the spiritual aspect and the way it's presented.The most important thing to me was that Mr. Prather's approach actually worked! I bought the book because of the title and because I had just gotten out of a relationship that I was having trouble letting go of. I started trying some of the exercises and amazingly I found myself stopping all the endless thoughts about what I wish I'd said, etc.I definitely recommend this book because I also had the feeling that Mr. Prather actually believes this and practices it.

I didnt expect this series to be as funny as I expected. Well I have now seen both seasons and I think the second is truly funnier because the characters have grown and seem so real to you. These guys are comic geniuses, and much bolder than American comedy. My favorite characters are Mr. Mann \\"Im looking for a woman by the name of Linda Williams, \\"Oh so your looking for someone specific?\\"...no just any woman by the name of Linda Williams...\\" and Vicky Pollard \\"NO but, yeah but...OMG I can't believe you just said that?!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipping, great product!","review":"This product was shipped very quickly, received in great condition, and was exactly what I ordered.

Season Two is not for prudes or the \\"faint hearted\\". Matt Lucas and David Walliams are at their zanies and hysterical best. Writing and acting (all major roles; both male and female characterizations) in sketches that are extremely funny boarding on the obscene. I still found this show wildly amusing and would highly recommend to those that are amused with the outrageous.Once again some of the same zany characters are featured and again I still love Vicky Pollard, Marjorie Dawes, and Emily Howard. I also like some of the new characters especially Emily's new unsuccessful transvestite friend Florence with a moustache. This season I love the new character of Bubbles, the penny pinching fat rich dowager that won't pay her bills that thinks she can \\"barter' with her body. All in all, it is a most splendid second season. I look forward to more of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old characters","review":"I should start by saying that I enjoyed the first season, but even then it was too repetitive. I expected more of the same from the second season, but hoped they'd at least do it with more new characters than existing ones. I have to admit that Daffyd still cracks me up, but most of the original characters have long since grown tired.I did watch the first two episodes of this season in hysterics - the woman at the spa and the jam tasting are especially shocking and hilarious. But once it sunk in that it was going to be the same old stuff over and over again (AGAIN), I was disappointed.There are a few really great moments, and the guys are genuinely funny (Matt Lucas plays women better than any guy I know!) - but there's not nearly enough variety to keep this series fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"mind numbingly boring repetition","review":"After seeing the first series, I thought (hoped) that intelligence had started to find it's way back to humor. With the second series, I see that I was wrong. Horribly wrong. In the former, we were introduced to these characters, and with each new scene, a new quirk or tidbit was released to us. In the latter, there is no development at all. It is formulaic. The characters basically do the same thing, again and again, without even much of a change in scenery. Messrs. Walliams and Lucas do not challenge themselves to broaden these individuals in the least, which I find all the more egregious because they have an unerring eye for detail. Perhaps the grind of a series is too much for them. It certainly seems that they have stopped caring. If you like to \\"parrot\\" characters verbatim, play drinking games by shouting out what's coming next in a scene, or find that you've been attracted to Saturday Night Live post 1979, you might like this. I was acutely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"Maybe if you're a preteen, you'd find this stuff funny but, for the most part, what is presented as humor isn't.

Most were clipped to the point that it was not even fun to watch. The only thing to save the DVD was the fact that the DVD extras were FULL VERSION matches, unlike ALL other FMW DVDs, even the other one released with this one, The Judgement. These Bonus matches were very cool too: Shane Douglas vs Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title, and The Dudley Boyz vs Sabu and RVD in a great ECW Tag Title Match.Buy it for the Bonus Matches, and avoid all other FMW DVDs like I am, as they seem to be clipping everything except the main events of all their DVDs now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clips Killed the Rating","review":"All of the matches were clipped. They were extremely hardcore, especially the three way dance with Sabu, Yukihiro Kanemura, and the One Man Gang. Probably the sorriest matches were the 6-man tag matches. The announcing was good, except they keep on calling a tiger driver a powerbomb. My all time favorite match on this video is the match between Tajiri and Super Crazy. The funniest part(to me, at least) was when Super Crazy flipping off Tajiri and Tajiri did it right back with a mocking face. Overall, this video is worth what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I read the reviews before I bought this. I bought a size smaller, because everyone said it ran big. For me, a size smaller is too small. Wish I had ordered true to size because now I have to return it. The cost to return is $6.95. Which I'm NOT happy about. That's 23% of the cost to RETURN it! And I had already paid the $6.95 to ship it! So, I wasted $14 for something that didn't fit and I didn't like. So, my recommendation, pass on this outfit.There is NO stretch to this cloth, so there's no \\"give\\" for bending, etc. and if it shrinks at all when washed, that's a real problem. It wrinkled badly in the packaging, so I would be concerned about that, as well. No one likes walking around in wrinkled clothes.

Barrington's terrific, Terry's amazing, Ron Tyson broke new ground and polished his already near-flawless sound, and the group harmonies are tighter than anything they've released in a long time... putting them, of course, miles ahead of any other R&B or pop group today!

When she comfronts Dex about how she feels she learns of Dex's trouble past. But this does not change the way Anthia feels about him. It just makes her love him even more.I thought Anthia and Dex would never get it together because they were both keeping their feelings from each other.

Brenda has a skill for penning some great lyrics and she comes accross as a master storyteller with a sarcastic smirk that seems to cut both ways. i first bought this album on cassette after seeing her \\"Eggs On Drugs\\" video on some very small independent music video show years and years ago. eventually, i wore the tape out and was saddened to learn that this cd went out of print. thankfully, i got lucky when i found this in a used bin and i've been enjoying relistening back to these great songs full of love, life, wisdom and wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crunchy guitar, compelling vocals","review":"This is the Juliana Hatfield album that lives in my car. The guitar is crunchy, the vocals compelling, the lyrics brilliantly sarcastic.

Juliana's best song ever, Ten Foot Pole, ends the album with an extremely personal look at desire and self-image.

It sounds like Ry and Taj as junior hight school students hacking away in their garage. There is some good guitar work, but that's it. The production is terrible.

Like almost all Narada releases, Niya Yesh has superb sound and production. However, in some ways it seems like it is too lush, too smooth; sounding as though it has be produced and recorded with the New Age crowd in mind.

So many people dismiss her as \\"that unusual 80s artist,\\" but in truth, she's a remarkably versatile, incredibly talented singer and songwriter. \\"A Hat Full of Stars\\" really shows that to be true, with her credited as co-writer of every track.\\"Who Let in the Rain\\" is perhaps the highlight of the album, but \\"Sally's Pigeons\\" (co-written with Mary Chapin Carpenter) is a close second... A mellow ballad that Cyndi sings with incredible beauty and emotion. Also worthy of note is the title track, but end-to-end, this is an outstanding, very listenable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi shines on this album","review":"I think this is a pretty good album from Cyndi. It's really too bad that it didn't get the attention it deserved, but that's usually the way with music that doesn't quite fit the mainstream. Cyndi makes music, not for commercial success, but just for the joy of it, and that is something that true music fans can appreciate. In fact, the best music out there is not necessarily the stuff we hear on the radio. And with this album Cyndi also showcases her songwriting skills...I recommend this album not just to fans of Cyndi Lauper, but to those music fans who like to hear music other than the same old radio fare. 12 page booklet contains all the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi Lauper!?!?!?!?","review":"\\"Hat Full of Stars\\" is Cyndi Lauper's brilliance FINALLY showcased right! THose who know her as the girl who just wanted to have fun, will be pleasently surprised with the outcome of this album. Cyndi is a masterful songwriter and her voice is a powerful weapon. Ballads like \\"Who Let in the Rain?\\" and \\"Hat Full of Stars\\" are mixed with social conscious songs like \\"Dear John\\", \\"That's What I Think\\", and \\"Part of Hate\\"...I LOVE this album! Cyndi Lauper is one of the greatest, most underrated artists ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyndi in pensive, moody spirits","review":"Turns out Cyndi Lauper's true '90's colors were black & white(epitomized by this album's photography)and the music seems equally forlorn. She's cynical on the autobiographical \\"Product of Misery\\", sentimental on \\"Who Let in the Rain\\", frisky on \\"Feels Like Christmas\\" but reflective for the sad nostalgia of \\"Sally's Pigeons\\", angry on \\"Broken Glass\\", and finally world-conscious on \\"A Part Hate\\". It's a heady mix of emotions, mostly in dark shades, but the subtle hip-hop arrangements and influences keep it bubbling, and the production is first-rate. No real stand-out songs, but \\"Stars\\" works as a full-bodied piece(perhaps that's why there were no hit singles). As always, Cyndi gives her all. She's never half-hearted: she bleets, she bleeds, she's stormy, she's fiery, she's sad. She's anything but coy. Fans will love it. 'B+'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Min and Bill","review":"Min and Bill earns a 5 star rating with me because it is a very human story.Here we see greed, desire, shame, and maternal love on display. Min and Bill is a cinematic gem clerly toe to toe with Streetcar.This movie is a \\"must see\\" for lovers of gutsy, character driven tragi-comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Min and Bill","review":"When I got around to watching it I found out it was a terrible print. Many, many (dozens) frames stopped and had to be fast forwarded to restart film on many occasions; other wise you had to sit and wait for the movie to continue. The many distractions ruined the movie for me. Whatever process was used to copy this film was horrible. I would have returned it within 30 days had I checked it sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work as it should","review":"My TV is only 4 years old and this is not compatible with it. It renders pictures very fuzzy and red from both the DVD palyer and the VCR. It has a buzz in the sound, doesn't have a remote, and is a huge disappointment. I really regret buying it, as it has failed on every level"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Gift","review":"This was the perfect Christmas gift to give my daughter. She can now watch what she wants to, when she wants to. The picture is pretty sharp and the color is very good. The VCR works great.

I browsed through it and just had to have it! I took it to work (I teach at a Christian Dayschool) and we decided to use it as the theme of our Christmas program. Of course, we had to condense some of the history parts quite a bit (for 3-4 year olds) but the main theme is understandable for the kids. Our Christmas program is going to be held December 18... and I am so excited! I know the parents are just going to love it! Finally, a book about the true spirit of Christmas!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Special Place for Santa","review":"I loved this book!

The book is spectacular. It brought a tear to my eye and a it was perfect to read to our three children. I highly recommend for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great approach!","review":"This is a great way to get started learning to machine quilt. By working on one block at a time, instead of a whole quilt top, the quilting process becomes more manageable. Detailed instructions are given for 25 different blocks, 5 corner designs, and 3 types of sashings, that you can mix and match to make any size quilt you would like. Step-by-step and easy to follow cutting and piecing instructions are given, plus an 8-page gallery of quilts that are quite inspiring. But best of all are the excellent suggestions on how to quilt each block."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great on assembly, but less than three pages on Machine Quilting!","review":"I would like to give this book two separate ratings. As a basic how-to-make-quilts book, it deserves perhaps four stars. It's got nice, clear instructions on the basics of how to assemble a variety of simple quilt blocks.However.As a book on \\"New Techniques for Machine Quilting,\\" as the subtitle says, it barely deserves one star. There are precisely 2.75 pages devoted to how to quit your quilt, and most of that is devoted to stiching in the ditch. That's it! There's talk about how this book will help you quilt sections of the quilt before it's assembled, but the info on that part is sketchy, wordy, confusing, and short (3.25 pages) - I really need some pictures or summaries to make sense of it better. I bought this book for help on the quilting, not the patchwork, so I'm a bit disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I used this book to make my 1st quilt. I used blocks that I had already made and used the method in this book to finish the quilt. It was easy, of course I made mistakes, but it was the normal I am learning something new mistakes. I am very excited to try another quilt in this method. This time I will use on of the blocks in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm very pleased with this book and the ordering of it.","review":"I'm very pleased with the book and the promptness of the delivery.
