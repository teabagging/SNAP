This movie takes the ancient Chinese idea of qi, buddhist teachings and add the glow of someone exposed to nuclear waste and expects it to make a powerful movie.

The \\"insights\\" developed by the author are absolutely wonderful bits of... insight, and deserve the exposure they have received. Mr. Redfield should have not listened to his intuition (probably tainted by ego) but let professionals helm this movie. They would have smoothed out the naivté and just plain awfullness. The only reason I watched this movie through (although in two sittings, I couldn't take the whole thing at once, too bored and exasperated) was because I hoped that the strength of the \\"insights\\" would offer a bit of exhaltation or SOMETHING. Nope, only exasperation and frustration at the wasted opportunities for an uplifting film.

The '99' totally crapped out after 6 months of light use...very disappointing!! I'm taking a chance on the ZX6, hoping it will last longer. Sure, they have a 1 year warranty and I could have had the other one fixed, however, that requires mailing the entire system back to Sony!! The effort and expense was just not worth it.So far, so good with the ZX6 system. This baby does have some great sound and will pump out tunes at full volume with no discernable distortion (consider I'm old and have terrific tinitus). The system is a little slow when shuffling between CD's. The only thing I find lacking is a discrete equalizer. Yes, you can set a custom program for equalization, but, doing so is a PITA compared to an old fashioned equalizer with slide controls.Overall, this is a great system and worthy of the 5 star rating.

It is a love story about two extrordinarily sensitive and knowledgable outdoorspeople, and the compassion, courage and cooperative spirit each contributed to this five-month expedition to make it a success. Byron Ricks, who is well-versed in the history and geology of the region, writes with acute attention to the sights, sounds and smells of the Inside Passage. Maren Van Nostrand's whimsical sketches deftly embellish her husband's lyrical text. A MUST read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deft blend of adventure and lyrical voice","review":"Homelands is a wonderful book. While many adventure writers choose to go the He-man route of disaster, mishap and mayhem, Ricks sees fit to pay attention to the subtler events of this journey with his wife. Make no mistake, theres plenty of adventure; the narrative can be enthralling; the challenges of embarking on such an arduous journey in tandem are ever-present. Still, what I like most about this book is its fidelity to the landscape, to the seascape, to the people, to the history of the region. The voice is eloquent and full of verve. The story is tinged by a sense of community that drives home the notion of multiple \\"homelands\\" in a region still faced with the consequences of a frontier mentality. I hear echoes of Barry Lopez and another terrific writer of place, Wallace Stegner. This book is thoughtful and wise. I look forward to reading more from Ricks. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap in its purest form","review":"I have not heard anything this bad in my life. It is so desperate.

I even put it to work on pine wainscoting, cedar panelling and cherry furniture.

Are all moisturizers created equal? Personally, I think not. Therein lies the difference between mineral oil and Boos Block Mystery Oil. Yes, mineral oil by itself will work but it is very greasy. I use John Boos Mystery Oil Butcher Block Oil which has a combination of mineral oil, linseed oil and orange oil (all food safe) and leave it on through the night. After that gets absorbed into the wood, I put on a top coat of creamy Boos Block Cream. It is thick and rich and creamy and puts a nice coating on top of the block. You can apply it after the oil or wait a day. You'll find a regimen that works for you. I think both Boos Block products work in tandem beautifully to extend the life of your butcher block!If you want a link to the cream...BoosBlock Wood Cream - 5 oz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boos Block Oil","review":"Great compliment to Boos Block Wax, install over wax which it dissolves and help absorb into the wood.

Further below, the actual product description says the ingredients are mineral oil, linseed oil and orange oil. So which is it? But actually, it's only the mineral oil that is needed to treat the wood and you can buy mineral oil anywhere for dirt cheap. Linseed oil may contain petroleum products, a definite no-no for food surfaces and can go rancid. Walnut oil or a walnut oil/beeswax mix is best for treating butcher blocks. And to those in the previous reviews that are using this oil on stainless steel and other surfaces, are you kidding? Any surface looks better when you rub any type of oil on it but it only attacts dust and dirt. I guess it would be appropriate to rub oil on such surfaces if your home is on display, but for everyday living, it would be totally inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING ABOUT THIS OIL","review":"This oil contains linseed oil which can spontaneously combust. There is specific warnings on the back of the bottle about disposing of oil soaked cloths or paper towels. With so many oil products available for cutting boards that are safe, it makes no sense to buy one with a volatile oil in it that could combust simply by putting a hot pan on the treated cutting board or throwing away applicators that have the oil on them.

This is what I need to capture and keep the attention of a 10 year old student.This book has indeed shown the test of time, and would probably be of value to an older, disciplined drummer simply looking for exercise transcripts to develop independence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books out there","review":"This is a very difficult and outdated book. Even my drum instructor thinks it is too difficult. There are many other more modern books out there that will accomplish the same thing. I think the only classics of the \\"old school books\\" are Funky Primer, stick control, and syncopation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Improving Your Drumming","review":"This book serves it's purpose, as does it's title. There are tons of exercises, and the way you use them are pretty much up to you. The reason many have problems with this book is because it is very advanced and requires a lot of time, patience and practice. If you're serious about improving in your drumming, you will not be dissapointed and will value the outcome. Again, it's not a beginner book in the sense that it requires a lot of effort and many don't realize that (hence the few stars given by others) but even they admit the book will serve purpose for a serious drummer. As a side note, my student is 13 and she can do the exercises. The exercises themselves are not hard to read, it's the implementation and how good you want to execute them that makes it difficult. But in reality even a serious beginner would benefit greatly.Thinnest book in my collection...but the hardest."},{"rating":"2","title":"4-way coordination","review":"Who plays this book from beginning to the end, it takes maybe little more time expected, but who plays properly these exercises has certainly much much better coordination and control after. It doesn\`t have many musical exercises, but after this book you should be able to play musical songs in another level and with much better coordination."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good","review":"I checked it out at the library to see if I wanted to buy it and I Don't. But I gave it a four star... it's not that I didn't like it, it's just too basic for me. But, for some beginners it may be too hard still. You should already know how to draw well. But, the techniques are basic. I have alot of various colored pencil books, and so I'm covered. I just wanted to check it out to see what the techniques were like. The artwork is pretty good, so there are some good starter examples for others out there. I thought the flowers were a bit on the flat side, they looked like an amateur did it. Well, I hope my review helps you decide if you should buy it or not. If not, do what I did, check it out in the library first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Colored Pencil Artists","review":"I am very happy with this book. It came in a timely fashion, brand new and chock full of great demos. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"This preamp doesn't impart much tube character to a signal. The presets are kind of harsh and solid state sounding. I had to return this because the Vu meter wasn't working. Maybe whatever caused that also degraded the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful, but shoddy construction","review":"I bought this to help the sound of a Shure SM-57 mic. There were some improvements, and it more or less did what I expected of it, though nothing remarkable.However, I recently hooked it up to do some recording and found that it has become a serious noise source. I've never dropped it, just maybe shuffled it around a bit with some other equipment. It *looks* fine, but is now unusable because of the noise. (I traced the noise to the unit by trying different cables and inputs and amps.)Find something more solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for amateurs and general purposes","review":"Pros:Great product for those who requires amplify a dynamic mic.We use for vocals in a karaoke system with excellent results. It doesn't requires expensive microphones. With cheaper mics produces good sound.Cons: The preamp doesn't has a power on/off switch so you must to plug/unplug the DC adapter. It is a little expensive but works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great preamp for the price...","review":"I tried this preamp with a guitar and a bass guitar...I did not see much improve with the guitar, maybe a little warmer sound but nothing that you may not reach with some guitar pedals (reverb, chorus...). On the bass it sounded great because it gives you tighter and warmer tones. I still have not test it with vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is great but..","review":"When you try to switch the EQ knob sometimes it won't switch as fast, sometimes you have to do it again and it will switch. Overall I love this product and it does have a warm sound to it. I have the rhode NT-1a and wow I couldn't ask for more. Best product, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad little device.","review":"This device does a good job. Noticing that it uses such a low voltage, I feel that they could have utilized the 12AX7 tubes full potential by using a better power supply with a higher voltage knowing what this tube really needs to operate. Don't get me wrong it does a great job and has a very clean noise floor. For the budget minded this is a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Research and lack of Validation","review":"When an author writes based on research and not personal first-hand experience they MUST insure what they write is verified by more than ONE source or they end up printing total bovine excrement.Halberstadt has failed to even follow the basic rules when he wrote \\"War Stories of the Green Berets.\\"A basic background check by Halberstadt on Otis Hedges Ashley III, would have revealed the man is a total phony. He does NOT have two Silver Stars and he never was a POW. He never was recomemnded for the Medal of Honor and he has a very long record for forgery, deception and lying. The story Ashley tells in the book is total fiction.One can only assume Halberstadt placed a newspaper add asking for SpeciaL Forces men to publish their stories and those who responded were the phonies or self-aggrandizers.This book does NOT represent the true heroes of Special Forces and brings questionable doubt on Halberstadt's other \\"novels\\" he passes off as non-ficition."},{"rating":"1","title":"No information not easily found on the internet","review":"Don't waste your money. This book is mostly a hard copy of the information College Board has on their web site. No usefull information here.The software CD is nothing more than a link and search engine to their web site to locate scholarships that I think you can find anywhere else easily. Save the money and go right to the web site directly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda, Not History","review":"The problem with this book is that it buys into the terrorist stereotypes of the organizations it purports to examine. For most of the world outside the United States and Israel, these folks are freedom fighters. Alexander's book is an attempt to give a scholarly flavor to blatant anti-Arab, anti-Palestinian racism."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic rock!","review":"this is possibly you am i's best album. jams like \\"the applecross wing commander\\" are awesome, and go off live! singles, \\"cathy's clown\\", \\"purple sneakers\\" and \\"jewels & bullets\\" are great songs, and songs like \\"grey\\", \\"how much is enough?\\" are fantastic slowed-down rockers! this album shows off the raw talent of everyone in the band, and show off Tim Rogers songwriting skills nicely. easily a five star album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title will confuse you!","review":"This is not a greatest hits album, although based on other reviewers this collection embraces Sheena Easton's hard to find early b-sides and some rarities, so the proper name should be rarities and b-sides by Sheena Easton, \\"but\\" Gold Collection, is fair for a Sheena Easton fan, but if you want a Greatest Hits, The World Of Sheena Easton The Singles Collection would do you good, as for the songs included here, they sound awfully like demos, but if you're truly Easton's fan you definitely enjoy this!."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good' but not what I wouldt call a real gold collection","review":"When I first bought this collection I didn't really liked it, but now when I listen to it over and over again it's not really that bad. But it still wouldt have been nice if all of her best songs was on it, when I say this I especially means \\" Wind Beneath My Wings \\" don't you think so ? but anyway it still got some of her greatest songs on it, Morning Train (9-5), Modern Girl, Paradox, For Your Eyes Only, One Man Woman, Summer's Over and many more, but it still isn't what I wouldt call a real Gold collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"mellow sheen!","review":"this is a cd for anyone who likes sheenas' ballads (not really a u.s. hits collection- but it has some unheard by u.s. listeners cuts, which makes it interesting listening). it does have 3 big hits in \\"morning train\\", \\"modern girl\\",& \\"for your eyes only\\", plus 13 other cuts - best being - \\"calm before the storm\\", \\"so we say goodbye\\", the eerie \\"summers over\\", and \\"i don't need your word\\"....a great collection for any sheena fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellant cd","review":"great selection of songs,plus great sounds.If you like sheena,you will like this album. thanks steve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for others!","review":"This book was not for me. Elements may be useful for others, but I'm a Photoshop person, so I found this book unappealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No subtitles means no fun","review":"I'm a huge fan of The Buried Life, so I was initially excited to receive this DVD for Christmas. That excitement turned to disappointment when I realized there were no SDH: Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. In fact there are no subtitles whatsoever, nor any foreign language dubs. This may not seem like a big deal to the average viewer, but to the hard of hearing and non English-speaking fans of The Buried Life, it's a major letdown.I gave it a low rating because I didn't even bother to watch the DVD. If you're angered by this review, just imagine having to watch the whole thing on Mute. Judging by the other reviews, there's nothing else wrong with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love love","review":"Not only do I recommend this season of The Buried Life but I also recommend getting their book - What Do You Want To Do Before You Die? I felt so energized and compelled to reexamine the typical life I've been leading and really focus on what it is I do want to do with my life. Very inspirational and a whole lot of fun. These guys are a bit nuts but in the best kind of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Guys are too FUNNY!!! Bring them back!!!!","review":"I loved this reality series.....they guys were great, and they were also helping a lot of people, I'm upset that the series was cancelled!!! BRING them back PLEASE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Easily the best show that MTV has produced in recent years. The Buried Life guys challenge the limits and prove that nothing is impossible. It will make you laugh and cry and inspire you to make positive changes in your own life.Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"given as gift","review":"Transaction went well, as usual with Amazon and DVD worked properly. Amazon is my favorite place to shop for anything!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of Watsons Go to Birmingham","review":"The characters are so real and the story so well-written that I felt like I was walking right along with them. It's a wonderful book for children to get the feel of what it was like during the Civil Rights movement. I'm a middle school teacher, and I highly recommend this book for grades 4-8."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!! FIRST PERSON!!!!","review":"If you don't like first person, you will not enjoy this book, even if you enjoy Barbara Hazard. The previous review is correct. It's a great gothic if you enjoy gothic. I don't. I also don't enjoy \\"first person\\" writing. Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe stories are an exception. You get to know all the characters through the eyes of Archie. (If you want to stick with regency era, Joan Wolf also does great first person.) Not in this book. Barbara Hazard has always been a sure read for me. This book so disappointed me I was unable to get past page 10. I went through the book randomly trying to get the book to catch my interest since it's Barbara Hazard, I still couldn't. When I read the last 20 to 30 pages of the book randomly, I'm glad I didn't waste my time. As I said before, I enjoy Barbara Hazard, and if you usually enjoy Barbara Hazard, try the book with the above warnings in your mind. You might enjoy the book, but probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was readable","review":"I will start off by saying that the book did have some interesting elements and at times can be kind of spooky. I might have given the book 3 stars if it had not been marketed as a romance novel. As an avid reader of romance I expected the relationship between the two characters to be the main focus of the story. The story centered more on the ghosts and the relationship between the two siblings. Furthermore the romance between Kate and Luke wasn't really developed and it happened suddenly. I felt that it should have occurred more slowly and realistically. I also was not satisfied with the ending, it didn't provide a lot of closure in my opinion. Overally, I would say that the book is readable, but not as good as it could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Especially relevant in today's political climate","review":"The book of Second Kings may not be everyone's top choice for critical analysis or for a prolonged meditation on the relation between faith and politics, but Ellul beautifully accomplishes both. Looking at the major figures of the Hebrew chronicle, Ellul discusses their actions and effectiveness, noting the different ways that political leaders listen to and/or ignore the commands of God. He forcefully argues that to be faithful to God is to be politically impotent, and that even those kings who do God's will do not always do it according to God's ways. Given the current ties between conservative politics and conservative Christianity, these two points alone are worth exploring for their implications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible choice!!!!!! I'll try to return it!!!!","review":"One star is way too much for this book. I got the newest version three days ago and it was like getting a repair manual for a toy. I've got a Camry 91 with a v6 engine and this book had virtually nothing I could use. Not even a decent set of diagrams and instructions to replace the spark plugs...!!!! Forget about anything else like a CV boot replacement or a timing belt replacement. I hope the publisher sees my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL! Do not buy this book!!!!!!","review":"This must be the most useless book I have every seen on auto maintenance and repair. If you're looking for any info on your Camry, look elsewhere. Due to the nature of the book (13 years of camry), you will not find *ANY* specifics on your particular model. No part numbers listed anywhere in the manual. Diagrams are ambiguous at best. Instructions read like they were pulled from a high school auto shop manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent durable watch","review":"I had this watch before and looked all over for it when my old one finally gave up. I am very tough on watches and my last one lasted over 6 years! Previous ones I was lucky to get 2 years out of. If you are looking for a durable attractive watch, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned","review":"the band is much wider and of a lighter color than it appears online. and i have still not received credit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most captivating book I have read in a long time!","review":"This is truely one of the most heartwarming and captivating stories I have read in quite some time! The storyline was something very new and exciting. Unlike any book I have read. I found myself bursting into tears one minute, then biting my nails in suspense as Mary (Blaine) runs for her life! My husband even got a tad angry at me because I brought this book in the car and read on our way out to eat dinner...I could not put it down..I was so captivated. I believe you will not regret reading this wonderfully written book, it will touch your heart and make you take a look around your life as to what is REALLY important in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staying power through solid composition","review":"Copeland's music is still fresh after almost fifteen years. I recommend this album to anyone with a taste for the nearly frenetic but carefully composed pieces once heard in the CBS series The Equalizer.I think you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you could ask for.","review":"Elevator Action comes from Charlotte, NC, which if you don't know, is a city dominated by bank buildings, yuppies, and suburban boredom.Elevator Action is like a flower growing from a crack in the sidewalk. Or maybe a weed.Either way, the balls-out rock n roll of the band's debut shows it to be a much needed sign of life for the bleak Queen City music scene.Granted, dirty punk-inspired garage rock is not everybody's cup of tea, but for those in need of something exciting to escape the suburban doldrums, this record might just be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Locker Bag I've ever owned!","review":"I have owned two OGIO locker bags over the past twenty plus years. They are relatively expensive, but worth every penney! They wear very well and allow you to organize your \\"stuff.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Duffle Bag","review":"This bag was everything that I was looking for and then some. It is a hard case and more narrow (but taller) than other bags so it slips right into the locker easily. It has a lot of compartments that store all your personal items and stores shoes (even size 14's!!!!) Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 1 full year of everyday use","review":"I have taken this bag to the gym everyday for a year. I like it a lot and can say that many others that have seen it have bought one now too. It does everything it promises. Fits into a locker nicely and holds/organizes a lot of stuff. The zippers have all held up well and the pouch's that hold the bottles of liquid and soap all seem to be holding up. Although it has proven to be quite durable, the handle is beginning to show considerable cracking and wear. I wear a size 12 shoe and I doubt a bigger shoe would fit. Oddly, the toothbrush holder is not long enough to hold a standard sized toothbrush. As mentioned in another review...it tips easily which is really nothing more than a very minor annoyance. In general - a great product that I would recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Replacement Bag","review":"I bought this bag for my father-in-law to replace his broken down old gym bag. My mother-in-law is so pleased that she doesn't even mind that it is sitting in the middle of her great room. My father-in-law is thrilled that it fits in his locker at the gym and holds all of his stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" bag for active folks and travelers, too!!!","review":"This bag is simply amazing! I go to the gym 4 times per week and often go directly from work so I needed a bag that would hold everything I needed to workout and clean-up afterwards. The Ogio Locker Bag does it all: it's got a special compartment for my gym shoes and a shelf to separate them from my towel and workout gear. It fits perfectly in just about any gym's locker (I go to Bally's) and with its front-opening door, you can access everything you need while your bag is IN the locker! I love the fact that it comes with containers for my toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap) and also with a comb, brush, and mirror. To top it off, it's light-weight, sturdy, and even comes with a built-in vent so that your wet/sweaty clothes don't get too ripe! LOL! : ) I couldn't be happier with my purchase! GET THIS BAG!! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag but beware of heat","review":"This bag is very well designed - it is perfect for the gym locker, with handy compartments and the ventilated top. However, my huge running shoes barely fit in the shoe area (women's size 12.5, men's size 10.5)The only other negative is the frame of my bag warped when left in my hot car all day. I decided to go ahead and replace it for the winter because it is that great a bag, but need to come up with a solution for next summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"OGIO locker bag is awesome!","review":"This bag is made for gym lockers. I only wish it were taller to accomodate more things! It is all the product description is and more. I only wish I had bought another color than black - everyone who has one looks like mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Locker Bag","review":"Love the practicality of the bags....my shoes, towel, running gear fit in perfectly. The pockets are great to store my wallet, IPOD, magazines...and the bag fits in a locker.....Excellent design!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice bag","review":"I've been using this Ogio Locker bag for a few weeks now and I really like it. It's well thought out, functional and practical. It looks a bit odd next to the common sports bag but once you slide it into the locker it just makes so much sense. The other bags look silly to me now. I like the compartment for wet swimsuit at the back of the bag though I find the zipper a bit sticky. I also appreciate the vents in the rest of the bag - again, very well thought out. The bag is roomy - always been enough space for my gear and a towel. I also like that there is a brightly colored loop on the top front of the bag - a handy place to keep your lock and impossible to forget. Very nice. I think this bag will last me a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but could use some tweaks","review":"This bag is nice overall, but I prefer the glo bag, which I also purchased. This bag does not have the room I need for toiletries, and I can't fit enough stuff in it. The handle on top doesn't look very sturdy, and I don't like the way it swings and hits me when I walk with it if I am using the long strap. I prefer backpacks. I also would like it if they put the venting system down where the shoes are instead of at the top of the bag. They also need an easier zipping system, like double zippers. It's kind of awkward. It also really needs a place for a water bottle and small items on the outside of the bag. The big pocket outside is nice for a racquet or something, but a spot for smaller stuff would be great. I am going to give this bag to my husband for Christmas. He uses an old duffle, so this will be an improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"OGIO LOCKER BAG","review":"I recently bought the OGIO Locker Bag for my husband's birthday because his other OGIO Locker Bag finally wore out (7 years). He shopped for several months for another bag and just wasn't happy with any other. He was really surprised and extremely happy! He works out 5-6 days a week and can't say enough good things about that locker bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gym bag","review":"After years of carrying a big bag that barely fits in a locker, this one has it all. Its compact, fits the shoes separately, toilet products, towel, and spares. It is great for gym, not for sports like tennis, soccer, or the likes where your gear wont fit in. Also, there's no wheels on the bag in case you expect this. So far its been sturdy and nothing has broken after 2 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad locker bag","review":"This is a great bag to have. I have been waiting to purchase one for a few years. There is only one issue I have with the bag. The front zipper feels cheap beacuse the manufacturer uses plastic instead of metal. It works but if you are not careful, the zipper will not fully close the front. That is the only reason I gave it four instead of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag and great experience","review":"I recently purchaced the Ogio Locker Bag and the bag arrived and it is such good quality it will spoil me!! Very fast shipping and better than advertised. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Locker Bag","review":"I purchased this product because it was a replacement of a 17 year old OGIO locker bag. If a product like this can last this long - I had to buy another one. This was and is a great long lasting product. I would recommend this to everyone and have recommended this product to a friend who purchased it based on my recommendation. Way to go OGIO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass!","review":"Just get a normal gym bag! This is too narrow for high top sneakers, too small for multiple shirts, can NEVER fit a basketball in it and is really cumbersome to carry.

This is the 3rd Ogio that I have owned. It keeps everything so well organized and fits perfectly in my gym locker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Bigfoot!","review":"My wife has had one of these for years and loved it. So I ordered one--and returned it immediately. If you have big feet, there's no fitting a pair of sneakers in it. I wear size 12's, and they stuck out about 3 inches when I tried to fit them in. They might go in if I ignored the parcel shelf down the middle and just stuffed them in vertically--but then they take up the whole gym bag. And I'm not talking basketball shoes here, just regular New Balance sneakers. My guess is that if you wear larger than a men's size 9, you'll have trouble. I also echo another reviewer's comment that the main compartment needs a double zipper, it is awkward to try to get the one zipper around the bottom of the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ogio Locker Bag","review":"I was so excited to find this item on line!!! We had a \\"very used\\" Ogio Locker Bag we had been using for approximately 19 years that needed replacing.

I guess, I was half expecting to have Arthur and Company speaking french or spanish, or have some type of extra feature.Except for getting a particular show on DVD, without having to Fast Forward or going through the entire program like you would on a tape, there wasn't much difference between DVD's and Tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"tropicalfete.com review","review":"Tropicalfete.com overall rating of the CD Reggae Gold is The Fire. Traditional reggae music has always been of a spiritual nature. This CD takes the spiritualness of the reggae music to the next level by adding a strong Christian influence. Every Track on the CD has something to do with the Christian lifestyle. Hardcore Reggae is the norm in talking about reggae music today but it is very refreshing to see a CD produced with Christian Reggae. Playing the CD and singing along with it is a great way to praise the Almighty Father. Tropicalfete's favorite pick on the CD is Mr. Gody Goddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cross Pen","review":"I got what I deserved when I bought this product. For $80 I thought it was going to be amazing, but it turned out to be a piece of plastic with no name plate and a really bad pen. I was so unhappy with this product that I sold it on ebay for ($20) and got a cheap pen holder made by bluestone for ($40) which is twice as good and has a really good pen. The only reason I gave it two stars was because I like the cross company and did not want to make them sound totally bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers everything with simplicity","review":"I really enjoy this book because of the many, many aspects of using InDesign that are covered in this book. It quickly addresses nearly every desired thing to do in InDesign with enough info to give you a much more polished document with very little work. It covers the basic - like drawing basic shapes and text frames - to the fairly complex, such as modifying your plug-in preferences and InBooklet imposition. Each topic is summed up in about 2 pages, so you don't have to work your way through a dreary chapter or more to just get the basic How-to for what you want to do. I'll keep this one around for quick reference on things I don't do very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child's Play","review":"Don't buy any of these video's.

A good portion of the videos is Luke running his mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"anutha weak Luke video","review":"Let me start off by saying this video is much better than the first.But it still stinks.The best part of it is when that big girl was giving blow jobs that was freaky! But after that it just cooled right off . If u havent seen this one save your cash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspirational novel for and about Southern women","review":"An interesting story set during a critical time in the evolution of the modern Southern woman. The characters reflect how the female role has changed from the 50's era over the recent decades and how these women were affected by the transition. The characters deal with personal issues against the backdrop of emerging feminism and the discrimination thereof. This allusion, however, is subtle and most of the book captivates with earthy imagery. The book is also good because it encourages women to nuture the bonds of friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whose money is it anyway?","review":"If you thought you had to have a stadium and you had to pay for it, read this before you vote. Wonderfully documented and thouroughly researched. I knew we all were getting screwed but until I read this book I didn't know how bad it could hurt. A good primer on the language of stadium larceny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-researched & well-written; dirt on pols & media, too.","review":"I like sports a lot and thought I wouldn't enjoy this book. Before reading Field of Schemes, I thought it would bore me with trivial facts and numbers and I thought corporate welfare to the sports industry was the least of America's worries. I was very wrong. The authors have exposed some of the deepest current urban conspiracies between newspaper owners, local politicians and real estate developers.I know a lot about politics, economics, urban development and corporate welfare, but I was amazed at what I learned from Field of Schemes. And everything is irrefutably documented.This is one of the last books the \\"powers that be\\" want people to read. Read it. Every concerned citizen or activist in the US needs to know what is in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Wanting to take my game from BB to A and feeling like I had the skillset, but lacked the smarts to do it, I was awaiting my order for this book eagerly. What a let down. Possibly 1) the author doesn't really know VB strategy as he claims, 2) does know it but has no business writing for lack of skill in that area, or 3) the strategy side of volleyball is 2% to the the 98% skills and ability. I have a feeling it's a blend of 1 and 2. The description is effectively a lie: 3 pictures (2 \\"no's\\", 1 \\"yes\\") on defensive posture. There are absolutely no drills. No blocking strategies. No ways to id weaknesses, just how to exploit them. About 50 pages of large type.

Knowing his jazz artistry, I wanted to experience his classical works as well. While the performances were not awful, they were by no means perfect. Technical mistakes on Goodman's part are spotted several times throughout the concerto. However, the quintet is beautifully played. While this is not the definitive recording of the two pieces, I will have to admit that Goodman plays with quite a charming style. The orchestra and the string quartet were also quite capable and nicely balanced. I would recommend this CD to Goodman fans; it shows the less familiar side of Benny Goodman. However, students studying these pieces should consider recordings by different clarinetists (Robert Marcellus and David Shifrin come immediately to mind)."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful'n'lousy","review":"With all due respect to BG's jazz work, this is one of the [worst] recorded interpretations of Mozart's clarinet concerto.Get Robert Marcellus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arthur's DVD not appropriate for little children","review":"We thought this would be a cute DVD to watch with our 3&4 yr. old.

It's a good example of how parental involvement in education, and not just sending the kids to school, can help the kids immensely.There's a good amount of instructional math in the book for those who would like to learn a little about the base knowledge she had to learn to work with cryptography.

It feeds off the pain/fears of adoptive parents of attachment disordered children, suggesting in the sensationalist story that tradional psychologists/ therapists are at best inept or witless, and their treatment is ineffective, while THEIR approach is \\"highly effective\\".

It should take its place alongside Magda Denes' In Necessity and Sorrow as a leading exhibit of the macabre, crimson world of American abortion. That was surely not its writer's intention, but the combination of her amoral framework and energetic enthusiasm to present uncloaked her feminist vision of procreative liberty reveals a perverse valuation of human life that will shock and deeply disturb. An ocean of blood runs through the abortion center Simonds approvingly studied. You don't know anything about what abortion actually, truly, is until you've read Simonds' interviewees descriptions of bloodied, dismembered pre-born human beings, and the profound self-delusion of everyone who participates in this slaughter of the innocents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost classic","review":"VH-1 justifiably calls \\"Green Light\\" a \\"lost classic.\\" If this record were released today it would have sold millions.

She sings with such good control over Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis' over the top production and music. Even her songs rival Janet Jackson's 1986 Control album hits in terms of quality. My favorites include Artificial Heart, I Didn't Mean To Turn You On (which Robert Palmer had a No.1 hit with), Affair, Saturday Love, Never Knew Love Like This, the funk-filled You Look Good to Me and others.

With the chuck it, I can throw a tennis ball across the entire dog park with a flick of the wrist. After the dog brings the ball back and drops it the tennis ball pushes back in to the chuck it and my hands never have to touch the ball.It takes very little practice to learn how to use the chuck it and get the ball as far or as short as you want it to go.

It also throws the ball a lot farther than I can throw or kick, with a lot less effort. Fits standard sized tennis balls snugly. My dog loves to run and this ball thrower definitely gets her running far.The chuck-it can also throw at closer distances, though it needs some quick force to get the ball out. I usually aim it down a bit so that it bounces if there is less space for throwing far. The aim is pretty good (and gets better with practice), though I wouldn't aim it too close to a person or dog at long distances (maybe that's just my poor aim talking). The handle is pretty comfortable and it's a lightweight object.Thanks for the handy, fun toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to play fetch!","review":"I can easily throw the ball up to 10 times farther than without this thing, which makes my dog very happy.

When she was younger, I would take my Shepherd for daily 5 mile walks that would barely begin to drain her energy. This is the only thing I've found that would truly tire her out (without knocking myself out in the process). And even now at 7, she's like a puppy again every time she sees the Chuck-it come out. I had surgery on both hands this year and had a hard time throwing balls at all, never mind far enough for them to get any exercise. With this, I could still play ball with them, despite limited use of my hands. Best of all, as most other reviewers have already stated, you'll never have to touch a slimy grass-covered ball again. Kudos to the genius who created this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ChuckIt ball is not very sturdy","review":"I was very excited about receiving this toy for my German shorthair pointer (age 9 months) as he loves to retrieve. We usually play with tennis balls but I just can't throw them far enough. So I thought this toy would be great for him. Unfortunately, within 24 hours of receiving the toy, he had broken the ball in half. Just by chewing on it as he brought it back to me. He wasn't even sitting there chewing on it for long periods of time - it was just in the time that he took him to bring the ball back to me, and he would chew up and down on the ball. Well, this ball is very flimsy and did not hold up for very long.

She seeks to destroy the human infestation on earth in order to save herself. Through Carlin, a major character in Evil Seed, her close friends and other spiritual supporters, Gaia wages a surreal battle with the Evil One, Rypan, a psychic vampire who feeds on human-generated negative energy. This epic struggle is replete with ritual cleansing ceremonies, and telepathic visualizations that grip the reader in an exciting journey, while infusing in the reader a spirit of awe and need for action to change the course of human destruction.

The songs are introspective slices of life that offer insight and humor.

The songs are stripped down to guitar, piano, and banjo; toss in the occasional fiddle or harmonica.

If you don't own this, you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful songwriting from the Brothers","review":"I bought this EP for \\"If It's the Beaches\\", my favorite song on the CD, and one of the first Avett Brothers songs I ever heard. Interestingly, though it's a wonderful song, I don't think it's typical of their sound, and since this CD does not include Bob Crawford, the stand-up bass player, the whole recording is a little different than their others. The songs are slow, more focused on the words. (But that's a good thing.)

Boy was i right.The yodeling scene drove me absolutely bonkers watching it, i was comtemplating turning it off, never to watch it again. When i watched the therapy session play near the start of the film, (When Richard Pryor came to meet George for the first time.) i really wanted to turn it off. The acting in that scene made me think how bad and WEIRD the acting is. The therapist in that scene should be commited too, he looked like he should be a patient himself.

The script is so bad that Wilder and Pryor look like they're embarrassed to be acting in it. As the movie went on, I held on to what little hope I had that the movie would improve. It didn't. When I thought things couldn't get any worse, the yodeling scene came on. At that point, I too became embarrassed for having witnessed this.I am only giving this film one star because Amazon has not allowed reviewers to give negative stars yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Pryor and Wilder comedy","review":"I got this movie in a three pack with other Pryror and Wilder movies.

They did three other films together,1976's SILVER STREAK with Jill Clayburgh,1980's STIR CRAZY and 1989's SEE NO EVIL HEAR NO EVIL. In this film Pryor is a conman who befriends Wilder. Wilder's character does a great deal of lying(he plays a dual role). Great support from Stephen Lang and Mercedes Ruehl. Ruehl is Elaine,the wife of Wilder's character. Memorable scenes include Wilder's character being scared by Frankenstein in a haunted mansion,also faking a corpse at a funeral(he thanks those who attended). Vanessa Williams is Gloria,who Pryor's character takes romantic interest in. In the final scene,Pryor,Wilder,Ruehl and Williams are on vacation in Hawaii. Pryor and Wilder have a picture taken with them both holding a sign that reads \\"Partners Forever\\".

I was hoping it would be somewhat of a secure fit, but no - my big expensive lens bounces around inside this thing - even with the hood on it. Consequently, this case is HUGE. Annoyingly so.The materials used on this case feel very cheap. Extremely cheap, actually. The zipper isn't smooth at all.It does have a belt clip.

It also focus more on the dog show plot then the kid. There are also homosexual overtones between the 2 bullies. I mainly dislike how everyone mistakes the monster for a dog.

The scene is set when a timid scion of a New York Mafia dynasty takes refuge from his murderous brother-in-law inside a gay bathhouse. Of course, this gives rise to lots of very funny jokes. Rita Moreno received an Academy Award nomination for her role as Googie Gomez. Her performance was based on the early career of Bette Midler, who started off as a chanteuse in a gay bath house called The Everard.Rita Moreno is one of the very few people who have won an Oscar (film), a Tony (stage), an Emmy (TV) and a Grammy (music) award. There are only nine such stellar performers. John Gielgud and Mel Brooks are two of those greats.

Rita Morena is reprising her Tony Award-winning role as the talentless Googie Gomez, a flawless performance.....and sideslitting one as well. Jerry Stiller manages to grab a few great lines as the insane brother-in-law after Weston. And, my personal favorite, F. Murray Abraham as the flamboyantly gay Chris.

For the most part, the girls look good, while a few (especially the sister who \\"performs\\" with Luke's friend on stage for $1,000) look nasty. But things really get disturbing at times. For example, it's clear in some parts that these girls who are performing \\"acts\\" on these guys in public are doing so against their will in a few scenes while surrounded by crowds of fellas. This gives the viewer a creepy feeling and makes you feel like scum after watching it.

It is also probably the least-heard Kinks album, and that is a true shame.Davies laments the loss of innocent, simpler times, of picnics and blue skies and family outings, photographed for posterity. The title song projects that sentiment perfectly, and \\"Picture Book\\" reminisces about old family photo albums in a very catchy way. There is much variety on this album (though no songs that sound anything like \\"You Really Got Me\\"). This is guaranteed to grow on you and become one of your favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"ooh ray!","review":"the kinks shared a nostalgic, sweet streak with the beatles (mostly mcartney, think \\"penny lane\\").

Too often, the really golden Kinks doesn't make it out into the popular world. Maybe all the better though...more for us! This album, one of my first as a hand-me-down LP, is true Klassic Kinks. Simply, no Kinks fan or person interested in joining the bandwagon should pass this one up. It's definitely one for the ages. Despite the silly lyrics of \\"Animal Farm,\\" it might be the most musically strong on the whole album. The rest, of course, are superb. It seems as though Ray likes to be nostalgic and sentimental...don't get me wrong...but albums from \\"Schoolboys in Disgrace\\" to \\"Everybody's in Show-Biz\\" to this one carry a seemingly unifying, central theme for each. But that makes it kinda nice, I think. I think it gives the songs more meaning on top of being musically outstanding pieces. God Save The Davieses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic Sixties Brit-Pop at its Best","review":"If you're like me, this album will very likely change your image of what The Kinks are all about. The music they weave transports you to the distant but familiar British soundscape of the Sixties, where brilliant melodies seem to flow like wine. For me, it somehow conjures up images of laughing English schoolchildren -- kids I never really got to know, but vaguely remember having seen on TV, or perhaps in fondly remembered dreams. This album deserves many, many listenings...and our hats off to the Kinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This album condenses peaceful, happy rock music with some pretty beautiful lyrics (full of symbolism, too). Listening to this album can be compared to laying in the soft grass and looking up at the sky, watching the clouds go by on a beautiful sunny day. It's kind of transcendent."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest kinks album!","review":"absoulutely beautiful! i love every song, worth every penny! my first kinks cd i bought was ultimate kinks (best of cd) and then i got this. i reccommend both. ray davies is a gobsmacking genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Check it out, you won't be disappointed!","review":"It was 1968, and the Rock-and-Roll world was breaking free. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band had come out only a year before, and a fresh wind was blowing. The Kinks' contribution was the concept album, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. It's a wonderful collection of great Kinks tunes, from the title track to the final one - People Take Pictures Of Each Other.When Rolling Stone created their \\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" list, this album clocked in at 255, which put it in with some prestigious company. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Village Green Preservation Society","review":"Is it just me or does the guitar work throughout \\"Picture Book\\" sound very similar to the ... Green Day song \\"Warning.\\" I dont know, i just sort of wanted to let everybody know that. Besides that tidbit of useless and inane information I have to say that this cd is amazing. It is my first Kinks cd, but I hope to expand my cd since I am now enthralled at the lyrical proficiency of Mr. Davies. Definitely an under rated cd and group. Judging by the lyrical context though perhaps they did not want to become the huge stars that the Beatles or Rolling Stones were. Better for the rest of us who are now able to discover these cd's that have been left unheard by the masses. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"There is a time for genius to be recognized and with all due repect to the Ray Davies fans out there, it is time for his work to finally receive the universal praise that is a long time coming. \\"Village Green\\" is one of those albums that gets better with age. Largly ignored when released, it is from Ray's \\"settled down\\" period, when he brilliantly told those little tales of life in suburbia. The songs here, each of which stand on its own as a classic, are gathered together and tell the story of the hero's less than triumphant return to his home town that he has long missed. There are certain Kinks' albums in my collection which frequently get revisited. Along with \\"Muswell Hillbillies\\" and \\"Something Else\\", \\"Village Green\\" is the one that has appeared on my various stereo components over the many years since its release, be it on record, tape or disk. It is as wonderful today as it was 35 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't get this version","review":"I'm still giving it 5 stars for content but don't buy this Reprise version. It sounds horrible and has not been remastered. It also contains the second-rate stereo versions. Instead get either the recent deluxe importVillage Green Preservation Society (Dlx)or if you want something cheaper the still-great-sounding 1998 importVillage Green Preservation Society. They feature the original, powerful mono mixes which is the way this album should be heard. For comparison, both releases also contain the badly-mixed stereo versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society","review":"A good collection of songs by The Kinks. There is a general theme but at times the music can be a little slow."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not really fair to compare the Kinks to the Beatles","review":"because I mean after all, the Kinks have talent! Ya, I liked the Beatles---with all their pretension---and all that, until I heard the Brothers D and then I realized that there is one man who figured it ALL out 30 years ago. I mean the reason rock intellectuals describe Ray Davies as a genius is beacuse he is!... The back to basics production and beautiful melodies make the Village Green essential listening! I just wish they'd make this album in closed caption, because then we'd all have world peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry lads - too whimsical","review":"I am a huge fan of the Kinks, both their early stuff and late stuff. In fact, it is really this album that lets them down. Maybe it just reminds me too much of the irritating Sgt. Pepper. But it might be because there are only three songs on the album that are worth listening to - the title track, that I love, and then \\"Big Sky\\" and \\"Starstruck\\". The rest of them would never stand up for themselves when not supported by the concept. It is a statement of Ray Davies' writing ethos, and so has become to be the Kinks' definitive album. But there's nothing as good as the late 60s singles here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Ripoff.","review":"Buyer beware. This is not the triple disk set- They ship an old Reprise non-remastered single disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE FABS","review":"THE OTHER MUSIC REVIEWERS HERE HAVE RATED THIS LP AS GOOD AS THE BEATLES SARGENT PEPPERS OR STONES SATANIC MAJESTIES LPS,ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THESE TWO CLASSICS OR AS GOOD AS ANY STONES OR BEATLES 60S LPS.THE VOCALS ON VILLAGE GREEN ARE WITHOUT FEELING OR TONE,THE LP HAS WEAK MELODIES.HOWEVER THE LYRICS ARE AMUSING.ITS AN OKAY RELAXING ALBUM OF LIGHTWEIGHT PROPORTIONS.LETS FACE IT,IF THIS IS THE BEST KINKS LP AS SOME WOULD SUGGEST,TO COMPARE THEM TO THE STONES OR BEATLES IS ABSURD.THIS IS NOWHERE CLOSE TO THE EXCELLENCE OF THE BEATLES RUBBER SOUL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book and read it once a year.","review":"Buechner's novel on the paradoxical coexistence of grace and depravity in humans is the finest work on the subject I know of short of Romans, Chapter 7. The language Buechner uses is a mirror of the subject -- gritty and rough-hewn but colorful and lyrical at the same time. It paints a refreshingly clear picture of God's grace in the midst of man's sinfulness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both irreverant and reverant","review":"I was struck first by the creativity of Buechner. Godric was a historic figure, but Buechner's fleshing him out and delving into his soul were much more fascinating than the interesting historic facts. Secondly I was stuck by how well the story is crafted, in style and character development and progression of the story. There are scattered gems of commentary on human nature and theology. As other reviewers have pointed out, while part of us is appalled at some of Godric's thoughts and deeds, another part of us recognizes these dark shortcomings in ourselves. A book about humanity, sin and grace. Strangely, though a book that is at times raunchy and violent and appalling, it is also an honest book that can strengthen faith. Godric will be hard to forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Godric is a historical novel based on the life of a real person. What makes this book unusual as historical fiction is its written as if Godric himself wrote it 1000 years ago, as if we are reading a historical document, including period grammer and sentence structure (although not scholarly or difficult for the modern reader to read and understand). This made Buechner's job difficult considering nothing of this type of literary work exists from the period, thus it is fundamentally anachronistic. Further, while we know broad brushstrokes of Godrics life, Buechner filled in many details from the period we simply dont know about.If you can see past the obvious anachronisms (which I had trouble) there are some valuable descriptions, such as a blood libel, that are imaginative and help to better understand the Middle Ages and how people thought and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book; great source of inspiration","review":"I vastly enjoyed this book. I have to agree that knowledge of Delta Green adds a lot to the book, as characters from other Delta Green books make appearances. That said, if you run Delta Green games you really should read this. If I could run a game that was half as exciting and well- paced as this book, I'd be a very happy Game Master, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and dismayed","review":"I am a fan of both Cthulhu and conspiracy, and I really like Tynes' game books. However, I am also a fan of good fiction and terse prose, and I do not believe that this book is either of those. The dialogue was hokey, the horror was much more disgusting than it was scary, and if something was supposed to be really intense or significant, a couple of f-bombs screamed by one of the Delta Green ops drove the point home. I applaud Pagan and Armitage for creating Mythos fiction set in the modern times and written for mature audiences; I just wish it read nothing like this. Ultimately, the quality of this book does not match the quality of the Delta Green supplements on which it is based.(I read the book on a flight to the west coast, and the only reason I finished it was because I believe that John is a stand-up guy and because the in-flight magazine looked like it was chewed on by a rabid dog.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought and under-edited","review":"I'm a huge fan of the mythos, of Delta Green, and of other DG fiction--the short story collections are truly amazing. So I finally got this novel expecting another fantastic romp, and was dismayed to find that it's a limp, formless concoction that reads like a transcription of the author's last roleplaying campaign. The dialogue is false, the plotting dull and aimless, and the descriptive prose borders in many places on high purple. It's not worth your money or time--buy Alien Intelligence or Dark Theaters (or the Delta Green sourcebook) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start; very promising","review":"I didn't like either the beginning or the end of this book, but I loved the middle part (everything except the first two or three pages up until the last two or three pages). I look forward to reading the later books, I'm sure they will be very good. It has all the elements of a good conspiracy: aliens, government, underground reporters, and enough \\"real life\\" facts to make impressionable readers even more paranoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good warm socks!","review":"I bought these to wear to the office.

His novels are wonderfully written works of fiction that use the murder mystery genre merely as the tread.

I liked the book just fine and particularly liked the romance between Rye Pomona and D.C. Bowler. I liked the characters of the others also. I skipped a lot as it seemed to be wordy. The reason I give this one star is I felt the author did not play fair with the reader. I do not expect to invest my emotions in characters to be whacked at the end with no warning. I will not read any other books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"An intriguing mystery ruined by a disappointing conclusion","review":"This is the first Daziel/Pascoe mystery I've read in awhile and I was impressed by how quickly I was captivated by it. A clever set up, a short story contest that is used by a serial killer to create a poetic version of the murders that follow, leads into an interesting series of investigations. Pascoe's preoccupation with and old foe, Daziel's bulldogging his way to an answer and the intriguing suspects all point to a solid mystery. Too bad it is spoiled by the ending. The far-fetched nature of the killer's motivation takes away from much of the enjoyment of this mystery for me; an outcome better suited to a B-film noir than a police procedural. Without giving too much away, let's just say it is for the hoariest of psychological reasons, a mostly invalid concept that really doesn't seem to belong here. It's a shame because prior to that I really liked this one but the ending just wrecked it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story takes far too long to tell.","review":"I have enjoyed several other Dalziel & Pascoe mysteries, but this one seemed to just drag on and on, and got downright boring.

I'm so tired of buying cheaply made crap made in China and this is a great example of shoddy workmanship. This thing beeps at you constantly and there are no directions that show you how to program it not to beep or how to shut off the section you don't want a temperature reading from. In fact, I don't even think I received instructions in English. It seems very flakey and I did not get a correct temp read when I probed it with my trusty old meat thermometer.

I loved the features and initially the calibration was pretty much dead-on. But in a little over a year it turned to complete and useless junk. The timer still works if you can manage to set it without going absolutely mad (it is difficult to set at best with no way to back up if you overshoot the value you want) but the thermometer suddenly started reading 20-30 degrees F high on both readouts so the electronics simply failed. The higher-mass oven temperature probe in tandem with the food probe is really a great idea but it just didn't hold up. The sad part is I bought this to replace another one that failed only after a year's service that actually bore a very reputable brand name in thermal instruments. If you want something reliable and even vaguely durable you just have to bite the bullet and purchase a commercial grade instrument for ten times the price. This was clearly junk and I got far less than what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid product - goes haywire after only a few months of use","review":"Can I give it no stars? This probe worked great for 3 months. Tonight, I went to use it, and it's telling me that my pork tenderloin, which has only been in the oven for 10 minutes, and is still red, is 250 degrees... or maybe 170... or maybe 300... it can't decide. I changed the battery, no luck. Checked other reviews here... voila... common problem. Well, damn. I didn't buy it from Amazon, but I'll be perusing the site for other, better reviewed products asap. I rely on this kind of temperature probe for ALL my oven and grill meat cooking. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost the perfect product","review":"I purchased several of these units because they were the perfect product for smoking (aka barbecue). Based on the information provided they would allow me to monitor the internal temperature of the meat in the pit AND allow me to keep tabs on the ambient air around the meat inside the pit. What more could a serious barbecue enthusiast ask, right?Of the ones I purchased, only one reads the correct temperature after a single cook. Just one. Did I mention that I purchased six of them? In speaking with Polder customer service I was told that this unit was not designed for the application I describe. Instead, it is designed to take an instant reading in the meat while in the oven, and then remove the probe from the oven. WHAT? Why have the additional sensor? Why not just buy a temperature fork?Based on my experience with this product and the customer support, I cannot recommend this product. Honestly, I think the new probe units with the dual sensors might be defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I must apologize to anyone who bought this product as a result of my review.After only having the thermometer for two or three months, the thing has taken a vacation. Now when I plug in the sensor probe, the thing goes crazy. I get oven temperature readings that climb into the three hundreds, and the food temperature does the same. This is while the thing is still at room temperature. No amount of fiddling will fix this.I apologize again to anyone who bought one based on my reccommendation. To anyone else reading this, don't bother with it. Go to a chain store and buy a digital thermometer for a lot less money, and that way if it craps out on you, you won't mind so much.I was taken, don't let yourself be."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's quit working - Unreliable","review":"This thing worked for a while but now it is acting very strangely. I tried to get information from Polder online and found no supporting documentation. My guess is that the probe is the problem, but a replacement probe is $20 and a new complete unit is $25. I guess I will fall back on the old reliable analog manual stick-in-the-meat thermometer and trash the Polder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money.","review":"I purchased this for use with my smoker, right out of the box, it worked great. The controls are intuitive and well designed. Worked like a charm until the second time around when it started registering inaccurate temperatures. I was extremely careful with the probe, not getting it wet or crushing it. I've tested many thermometers and this is by far the worse. It now registers about 50-80 degrees too hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea...bad implementation","review":"This thermometer would be great if it actually worked as all of the chefs who recommended it suggest. As written in another review, the tech support people at Polder say it should be used as an instant read thermometer, and then removed from the food. If that is the case, why would you have an alarm that sounded when the food reached a specific temperature?In addition, the temperature readings can be off significantly. I keep 3 extra probes on hand, in case one doesn't read properly.On the other hand, I sent the original one back to Polder and they replaced it without question.I don't think I would buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective out of the box!","review":"Even though I read the reveiws here before purchasing I hoped the complaints were due to improper use/abuse.

There's a newer Polder model that has received excellent reviews and seems to be a much better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great until it breaks","review":"Fresh off the shelf, when it still works, this does exactly what you would want it to. Stick it in a turkey or rib roast and cook till the moment of perfection.Unfortunately you'll be lucky to get a few meals out of it before the probe breaks. After that it shows 90 degrees Fahrenheit at room temperature and flashes 500 at the first sign of actual heat. Replacement probes cost almost as much as the entire unit.I'll admit I'm dumb enough to have gone through three of these things. Save yourself the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good news, it can come back to life","review":"After sitting a while, I discovered that the unit is reporting normal temperatures again.

However, the Polder Oven/Meat Thermo-timer I would not recommend. The controls only allow to raise your desired tempurature. Miss you mark, and its a long way to 500 degress and back to the tempurature you want. My older Polder has buttons to raise or lower the desired temp. After about one month, the tempurature gage just went nuts. It read barely (not roiling) boiling water as 260 degrees. No, I was not touching the container etc. So for $30 I got a fancy timer.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT unless you can see if the sensors work and if they don't take it back right away.In fairness to Poulder, they usually have a top notch thermometer and have traditionally been my favorite. They have just botched this one BIG TIME.If Poulder reads these for product feed back, here's an idea that would sell like hot-cakes. Fix this rig so it works. That's step one. Step two: make one that transmits a signal to a receiver that can be read in another room.

The probe wire is incredibly sensitive and is destroyed by the slightest kink, water drop, or improper storage. I'm certainly not talking about heavy use -- I used mine three times and then it went haywire with readings all over the place before I had even stuck the probe into the food. I think mine was destroyed when I used a sponge to clean the probe and a few drops of water dripped onto the probe wire (it was never immersed in water, so this is all I could think of.) From what I've read elsewhere, the replacement probe is just as defective so buying them is a waste.Why Polder doesn't just construct a decent probe wire, I don't know.

It seemed to go bad after using it on the weber grill. My guess is the probe is of a poor quality manufacture and is prone to damage by physical or temperature shock. Be exta careful with the probe and maybe all will be well.I have now been using three probes for about three years now. I alternate use of the probes and use mainly on the weber kettle. every so often I get some weird readings on the probes. Still like it even though I give it one star because the design of the probe to handle temperature shock is incorrect for the application marketed. You just can't find decent probes for use in the barbecue and the metal sheathing and wire material polder has still does hold up. You just need to check the probe before use and have spares on hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR THE BALONEY GOOD REVIEWS!","review":"My adult sister bought this for me for Christmas.

So why, then, make the middle rod three separate pieces that need to be screwed together, as opposed to just one piece? Not so great.

Until then, I hope Amazon will accept this 'unrecognizable' DualDisc for return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best T-Heads Album Made","review":"Hands down, this is the best T-Heads album ever made. The most psychedlic, the most rhythmic, the tightest production, and the most musically sophisticated album they ever put out. When someone tells me they \\"never liked the Talking Heads\\", \\"David Byrne is too 'whiney'\\", or that \\"the T-Heads are a band for girls\\" (which I still don't get, Rick Karr from NPR), I slip this disc into the rotation, and, believe me, someone is choking on their words.

Like another reviewer said, there are some gems, like Drunk History and some lines in Space Baby (just the fact that Fred Willard did a scene with a baby is value), but for the most part FoD is just inane. (The second star is for these bits.) The gag in the \\"Snakes\\" bit and \\"Sleeping with Celebrities\\"--where one shot goes on and on for too long--was mastered by Seth McFarlane in Family Guy and FoD just took it and made it painful. I made it through 1 1/2 episodes before I asked myself why am I wasting my time watching this when I could be doing something productive like clipping my toenails or vacuuming my hallway. Maybe it got better later in the DVD but I didn't have the patience. Spend your time more wisely and watch those Family Guy or South Park reruns for the seventh time; you'll get more laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asking For Trouble","review":"Why call it 'Funny or Die'? Thats a kiss of death. Actually, 'Kiss of Death' would have been better. FoD is an awful, awful title. I nearly avoided it on the strength of that alone... sounds like desperation. Unfortunately, some of it looks like desperation too. There are sketches on here so bad that they'd look amateurish on Youtube. If you knew the people who'd uploaded them you'd feel embarrassed for them. But, there is some sublime weirdness. The Carpet Brothers is a wonderful Wes Andersonesque 70s pastiche. It doesnt keep the thing afloat by itself but it saves it from sinking like a stone.The 60's salesman doing the links is pretty good too... but that title... yuch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess you have to go with \\"Die\\" because this isn't Funny at all.","review":"Wow. Just wow. This is probably the most unfunny DVD ever. I love comedy and I love the concept of more off the wall skits, but this just sucks. Even the scarce few parts that are funny are quickly ruined by bad timing or excessive repetition. An example would be the two dudes with the ridiculous snakes meeting. It was funny when they stood there saying \\"snakes\\" back and forth 5 times, it was all lost when they proceeded to say snakes for 2 more minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"FYI","review":"I don't understand the last reveiw, because it clearly states in product details that this notebook weighs under 2 pounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZON--HOW MUCH DOES IT WEIGH?","review":"A priority reason for buying a subnotebook or mini-laptop is its weight---but nowhere on the Amazon Ad, remarkably, is the weight given.

I am rating it 4 stars, because it's not as good as private lessons for learning things like frame and lead/follow technique, but as far as videos go, it does an excellent job of giving you footwork, patterns, club etiquette, and everything you need to know to have a really good time dancing.This is a good video for both men and women. In fact, I think it's a great thing for couples to do together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Lame DVD","review":"I bought this for my son who wants to learn how to dance, but decided against giving it to him becuase I don't want him to learn this style of dancing. If you have never danced before I guess you can get something out of the DVD lessons. A couple of warnings: first, the instructor is teaching an \\"On 1\\" style, not \\"On 2\\" (NYC style salsa dancing). This is a major style difference. Most annoying is the slow pace of the DVD -- largely becuase this guys talks too much! At the end of disc 1 all you have learned is a very basic turn that he calls a \\"salsa pattern\\". There are much better products on the market -- beware of the stuff from the west coast -- it seems a little too basic for a beginner (sounds strange doesn't it?), and definitely too basic for someone who wants to improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salsa for Beginners Review","review":"I ordered this DVD because I wanted to learn basic Salsa dance steps. Unfortunately, the quality of the filming in this video is TERRIBLE. The demonstrating instructors are wearing black and doing their demo in a dimly lit room against a black background. You can't see what they're doing. It's as simple as that. Don't waste your money on this DVD. The cover of the DVD is attractive and might tempt you into thinking this is professionally-produced lessons series, and it might be if you could actually see the movements of the dance instructors. Don't be fooled by the cover...this DVD is practically worthless because of the way it was filmed. Honestly, how difficult would it have been for them to have a light backdrop so you could see the instructors, or dress the instructors in light clothing and shoes and put more light into the room? What a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a good Salsa DVD for beginners","review":"I have bought a few of these DVDs and I have to say that this is the best one I have seen so far. I really like the caption box that shows the foot maneuvers from a different angle in a picture-within-a-picture.Things start nice and slow and the guy in the video is easy to follow. Also, I think he has a dance style that looks really good without trying to be unrealistically flashy for beginners. Its pretty much the way I want to look when I salsa dance. The woman has some great styling that my girlfriend really likes.Also, it seems to have a lot more on it than some of the other DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely a DVD every salsa fan should have","review":"Salsa is not complicating as it seems to be. True the steps and the movements look confusing but once you get the hang of it...you don't wana stop dancing. This DVD makes salsa so easy and interesting. Its definitely one of the best videos I've ever watched. Congratulations on such a great job!! It looks great and I think having the videos is a great idea. Keep up the good work. Well good luck and look forward to seeing more of some more wonderful DVD's. Definitely a DVD worth buying...if you're into Salsa."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE DANCE DVD, DO NOT BUY!!!!","review":"Very unprofessional instructional DVD by a pair of very untalented people trying to unethically make money on a dance DVD. The couple in the video are obviously not dance professionals and are simply looking to rip people off by making a poor video with a beautiful cover picture. They didn't use their own pictures on the cover because they are two untalented people who are not professional dancers. Just a pair of business people who found a way to rip off consumers with good advertising and poor production. I wanted to return the video the moment I saw it but unfortunately, amazon doesn't allow returns on opened DVDs. It is now obvious to me why there is no trailer for the DVD. If I had seen a trailer I would have known how horrible the filming and instructional quality of the film was.

It's a great fat burning workout with a great background to boot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Medium/High Impact Workout","review":"Though it's dated, this video really is worth your time. For beginners, it'll take you a little time to get all of the steps & arm movements. For those who have more experience, it has some unique arm movements that will be new & different for you.The warmup is pretty short & doesn't really stretch out your arms, so you might want to do that ahead of time. The first two segments of aerobics are pretty basic. The second two are medium-high impact & move very quickly. The cooldown/streching is quick. Finally, the ab section doesn't do much for the obliques or lower abs, but isn't all bad.Overall, it works your heart & has a few twists that'll be new for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great album then and now","review":"The Kinks were a great band, period.

And this specific album is matched only by Who's Next - there isn't a weak track on the entire album and brother Dave kicks in two stellar tracks with Strangers and Rats. Ray Davies is without peer when it comes to seeing the world as it really is and translating all of that grasping conceit into music. He takes the throwaway, the mundane, and skewers it without mercy. The world would be a far drearier place without him.

The lead character, Sam Bowen, brings the excitement of John Carter, Tarzan, and James Bond into a fictional setting of San Cibola in search of an old family curse which has decimated his family. This fun blend of not so suave action hero and all phases of the unknown/unseen world of mystecism, set in the back drop of China Town pulls the reader along. A real page turner.

What is he omitting? Is this a definitive account or a self-justification?I always have a problem with self-indulgent writing and over-long childhood recounting. This book has both, not to mention italicized asides that add nothing to the narrative. Certain passages of the book are fascinating (the underground, Days of Rage), but the rest is mostly dull. Ayers rhapsodizes about those things he is passionate about, mostly his hope for a North Vietnamese victory, his hatred of American arrogance and oppression (as he sees it), and getting laid. I found his style ponderous, and his sketchy recounting of events frustrating. He had an opportunity to breathe life in an important and fascinating period of our country, and, perhaps because he was too close to the action, didn't quite deliver.

How do we know that Ayers and Dohrn aren't waiting for their next destructive opportunities, and certainly use their positions of trust to do further damage to society?The University of Illinois and Northwestern University should reexamine their standards for those who can corrupt the minds of our young people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's send Bill back underground","review":"There's a certain fascination to this book, but its not the one that the posturing ninny who wrote it was aiming at. Ayers is a moral idiot, incapable of shame or embarrassment. He says here that he has no regrets about planting bombs, and that he cannot rule out the possibility that he will do so again. Here's a fun question to think about: do we, as Ayers' potential victims, have the right to make a pre-emptive strike against him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little thin","review":"I picked up \\"Fugitive Days\\" hoping to get an insider's account of life as a fugitive and an explanation of those days. Maybe Ayers' own admission that memory is shaky and not entirely trustworthy should have been a hint to me. I found little of what I was looking for. I find the title misleading. Only about one-third of the book is about his days as a fugitive and the description of that time is vague. He doesn't even describe how they finally turned themselves in. I didn't get a clear idea of who the other members of the Weathermen were and how they interacted with each other. He and Diana Oughton loved each other, but I don't get a sense of that love. He uses the book mostly to expound upon the ideas of that time and his ideas now. Definitely not a straight autobiography; more of a philosophical rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD be in jail. . .","review":"This guy has no business breathing free air. He should be in jail.

Of course Bill claims he isn't a terrorist as he and his collegues were merely targeting symbols and not people. Gee, Bill, does this make a bomb less dangerous or destructive?This book is only worth reading as evidence that Ayers is a delusional fool. For more evidence of Bill and Bernadine stuck in a time warp, I recommend renting \\"The Weather Underground\\" DVD where one is treated to a commentary by Ayers and Dohrn. Among other things they advocate prison breaks, and the release of their former comrade-in-arms, David Gilbert, convicted for the murder of two police officers during the botched Brinks robbery in the early 1980's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Young bomber, not dreamer","review":"Sanctimonious piece of garbage from from the [name] of his day...no, he was worse, he wanted to kill his own...and now he wants us to see what a martyr he and his ilk were and make money off it to boot. ... this book, then burn it.

He quoted Marshall Petain (and agree with him), who after the disaster in 1940 maintained that one of the reasons of the collapse were \\"too few allies\\".

The last 10-15 minutes (somewhere in there) of 'Angels and Demons' is about 10 seconds or so out of sync between the audio and video. Other than that, this is a great series. I always make a point to watch this on A&E, but now I don't have to. This is a wonderful series chronicling children/young adults (aged 8 to 19) who have or believe they have psychic abilities. I do believe things such as this are possible, but I will admit it is remotely possible it is faked. I will say that all these young people do seem genuine, and I do believe they have the abilities they say they have. It is a very well done series; whether you believe this or not, check this out.

The care and understanding is so positive and helpful to the children involved. The DVD I received had one flaw, but it may have just been this one disk. I think it was the bonus episode or possibly the last program on the disk, that maybe within the last ten minutes of it, the sound was badly out of sync, not just a second or two, maybe more like a minute. Makes me think they are rushing these things out as soon as possible and not being very careful of any flaws. Again, it could just be this one disk, and its not enough of a problem to return it, but it was annoying.

It is a very deep and chilling episode that takes place in a deserted German concentration camp, where a man who had tortured and killed people decided to revisit it. He is met there by a ghost of a person who was killed there, as well as seeing images in his mind. Although the man goes to the camp in his right mind, he leaves it as being totally insane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical twilight zone","review":"This is an anti-western.

A guy from 1890 was overly critical of the things of his day. He was angry because of inflation, government spending and the lack of civility. A ridiculous helmet transports him to 1962. After a brief experience in 1962, he goes back to 1890 a changed man.The difference between the vision of 1890 and the street scene of 1962 (actual shot in 1961) seems less than the difference between 1962 and today. The comparison of 1962 to today, not the intention of the Twilight Zone writers, makes this episode especially relevent for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray arrived without shrink wrap...","review":"I received my Season Three Blu Ray this afternoon, and I was disappointed to see that the Blu-Ray had no plastic wrap on it.

For Fifty bucks I don't think I should be getting a second hand set, even if it is in good condition. I think i will be returning this set and see what they send in it's place. Very disappointed....

The pages are thick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was told this would be the book where Feynman laid the foundations for quantum computing. In actuality, most of it is a rather haphazard tour of selected topics from basic computer science, using the old-fashioned bottom-up approach (starting with gates and flip-flops). There are your basic bits about Turing machines and information theory, and some weird stuff about reversible logic which supposedly leads on to the quantum computing. Then there is a reprint of an article about quantum computing which rehashes the latter bits and goes a bit farther, but unfortunately my training in quantum physics did not allow me to follow it. If you want to read good Feynman, try things like Q.E.D., which is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ginger chews","review":"I must concur that these little ginger chews are addictive! I have not had any problem, thus far, with weird crumbly texture as another reviewer related; on the contrary, they are quite chewy, almost as chewy as the little red penny candies from the old days, if you are old enough to remember that! If you are a ginger fan, go for them. I buy them in 2 oz boxes at Target, for $1.09 a box..a deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG! I can't get enough of these things!","review":"The texture reminds me somewhat of Turkish Delight (a bit chewier), sans nuts, and obviously not at all delicate in flavor. These little evil chewy bites pack a nice, hot, gingery punch that I'm addicted to.I'm not sure if it's the flavor, the texture or a bit of both that propelled this candy to the top of my 'favorites' list, but they're there to stay!I will add that these are also great if you've got a bit of an upset tummy, too. I wish I had these when I was pregnant with both of my children.At least now I can enjoy them without needing a reason to! :P(I'd be in deep trouble if they made these things in cinnamon!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ginger explosion!","review":"Great product!The only wish I have is that there wouldn't be so much packaging.I would like to buy these in BULK because they are so good!It's almost time to re-order - I never want to be without themin the car on long trips, my commute to work and at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great after-dinner snack.","review":"Ginger is a miracle herb in terms of calming a nauseous stomach.

George Thorogood redid this song years later and did the Horse proud.Another rocker \\"Dirty , Dirty\\" and \\"Downtown\\" show that this band can kick. Sounds a little like The Grease Band. And then , out of left field , comes \\"I Don't Want To Talk About It\\" , one of the most achingly beautiful heartbreak songs I've ever heard. Aside from the aforementioned Rod Stewart remake , the Indigo Girls also cut a credible version. Ry Cooder shines throughout. Nils weighs in with \\"Beggars Day\\" and \\"Dance,Dance,Dance\\" is a reworked \\"Love Is A Rose\\" or perhaps an earlier incarnation. Simply marvelous throughout , this is the reason Neil has stuck with this band through thick and thin. This is the American Gothic of rock 'n' roll.

My knee and ankle pain gradually went away as I got used to the high impact moves. Most importantly, I have trimmed down and my clothes fit better. The cuing is excellent and there are no hard to follow dance steps. The music is upbeat and suited to the workout. I think this workout IS fun, now that I am used to it. I look forward to doing this workout several days a week. Gilad's Fat Burning Workout has me in much better shape with increased stamina, and I am dripping with perspiration by the end. My other workouts are almost too easy for me now.

There were brief moments toward the beginning of the book where I was almost interested, but I had lost any interest by the time Roz and Edwin separated. The characters were so thinly portrayed that I didn't care what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that ending???!!","review":"I felt like some of the other reviewers in that I was left at the end of each chapter wanting more and then having to struggle through another chapter of the same. Too many questions left unanswered, and the author should have had fewer characters that were developed further. I liked Adele, but all of a sudden she was dead. I liked Roz's friend but she was out after about 4 chapters. Miranda's relationships would just get interesting and then she would be 1 year older with no mention of the guy again. What really happened with Edwin? etc...etc...The ending was really stupid and abrupt. It was like the author herself was getting bored and didn't know where else to go and just decided to stop. I only finished this book because it was the last in my library stack, and it was a Sunday, and I didn't feel like driving all the way to Borders! Sorry, Thisbe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, I guess.","review":"I liked reading bits of this book, which seemed to work fine because the novel was put together in bits. Nissen uses way, way, WAY too many adjectives (and particularly adverbs) to describe the most simple objects and actions, so in that's she's definitely showing off, character's voice or not. I wasn't convinced by how each of the characters fit together and, in the end, I felt no sympathy or empathy for any of them. Typically, I enjoy any novel that describes NYC street for street: it's one of the most relaxed, warm feelings I have, imagining I'm in Manhattan. Nissen did okay with that. What she didn't do so well with was the time period: I felt like she was making fun of the 70s (or was it the 60s?) retro fashions instead of putting us there firsthand. Overall, okay. Don't expect to feel as though you've accomplished anything reading this book, but it can be fun if you pick it up at random."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, writing lacking","review":"Nissen does a good job of fleshing out the characters in this book, and they are \\"good people\\" who you enjoy following on their journey. The writing lacked any luster, though, and by the second half I was skimming in parts, more interested in what would happen to these characters than in the writing. Nissen often resorts to cliches and her dialogue can be a bit too studied. Having lived in NYC, I was hoping the city would be more of a character in the book. Although Nissen captured the \\"growing up fast\\" that happens to kids raised in New York, it could have been any urban setting. I'd hesitate to recommend this book. It wasn't horrible, but there wasn't much to make it stand out."},{"rating":"1","title":"CANT TELL A BOOK BY ITS COVER!","review":"This book is so bad. The first two chapters are good,But each page gets worse and worse after that. The only reason i finished the book was because i was waiting for it to get better. I live in new york.

I have not had Thisbe Nissan as a teacher and I have not even seen her around except just at a reading. But this is what I think. Good People of NYC is a novel of adolescence. The character's are well formed, but they are characters that no one would want to ever know. They are childish and it shows just how little this writer knows about the real world.

At times the book intoduced topics which were difficult to comprehend, but in the end I felt I understood exactly what the author was trying to get across. My wife, who happens to be a 4th year medical student, was skeptical at first. However, after seeing me lose an average of 3 lbs a week for the first four weeks I was in the zone, she read the book and now she's hooked. We both now have a tremendous amount of energy we didn't have before and we have just recently put our three children in The Zone so they can up with us.

Most positive energy, least feeling of deprivation. I want to shout it from the rooftops: Try This One! I tend towards hypoglycemia and have the Hidden Addiction (see review on that book), have ADD and get light-headed when hungry.

I felt like I was going to die the first week because I thought I wasn't getting enough calories or sugar. But then I got used to it, and I got rid of the sugar addiction. I work out a lot and adding extra fat (as is suggested for athletes) helped too. The recipes are pretty good. Lots of one pot meals. The only draw back is that they require about an hour to make start to finish because of all the vegetable chopping.

My goal was to see if weight could be lost and if I could increase my energy with a busy schedule... just like my patients. It WORKED! This is now the only \\"healthy lifestyle\\" way of eating that I recommend to my patients. You may lose weight with other plans, but statistically you won't keep it off.

Only one downside on this book, the recipes can be pretty bland and sometimes diet-y tasting. If you try them, you will really want to add more spices to make the food taste good.

The first is that it focused more on stock photography prices and not how to decide how much a photography assignment should pay or be negotiated. Second, look at the date, and look at the date of these other reviews. The digital photography revolution has changed everything, especially stock photography. There's doubts whether anyone will be able to make money from stock unless they are super-specialized, turn themselves into a stock photography factory, i.e., getting a group of photographers to photograph every conceivable office scene and product--and if you turn photography into an assembly line, you may as well do something else. Additionally, photography continues to change at light speed as photoshop wizards six years ago, around 2002, were making six figure salaries, and are now charging $10 per image because of the oversupply of trained people.

I always thought that perhaps someone should re-write the story and make the sisters not so evil. Just people looking for love as Cinderella was. This story \\"almost\\" does that. Perhaps leaving room for another tale after this one that would have a love interest for the sister. A funny tale rather than the typical \\"romance\\" story.The music ofcourse isn't as good as the original; but in these follow-up movies they seldom are.

It has a stronger feminist message. I also love how the ending uplifts the idea of wanting a man to love someone for who she truly is as well. It has a stronge feminist message as a result which i fully appreciate.

We really get to see Anastacia rise above being a rather spoiled self centered person that she was raised to be, She really did want love, not really revenge.BTW rather than other disney sequels (such as fox and the hound 2) this was rather congluent to the original movie.

Unfortunately, Disney hasn't told a good animated story since Tarzan. Pixar does it well, but Disney insists on recycling their old classics in the way of straight to DVD movies. Cinderella III is just another sophomoric recycling of a Disney classic. The plot was unbelievable and silly (how could the Fairy Godmother be so careless?), the characters sound like every other animated character, the songs were generic Broadway and all sound the same, and why do the stepsisters have such beautiful singing voices? In the original Cinderella, they couldn't carry a tune to save their lives. Did their tone-deafness all of a sudden disappear? If you have children, this may amuse them, although this no where near captures the spirit of the original. The quality of this is no greater than a Saturday morning cartoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 5 year old cried when watching this one","review":"My 5 year old watched this movie, as it was rented for her. She loved the first one, she thought the second one was OK, but she really did not like this one. Mostly because it was a negative tone, they didn't get married, have the happily ever after, etc, etc...She started crying after awhile, and told me she didn't want to watch it anymore, and we sent it back to Blockbuster after about just 35 minutes watched or so. I put on the original one (which we own), and she was OK again, but she most certainly did not like this one.If you have really young girls who are into the princess thing, they may not like this, since it somewhat ruins or at a minimum brings down what little girls have in their heads as fantasy from Princess Land. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was junk!","review":"I ordered the movie Cinderella 3 used.

Only two blue birds and Jacque and Gus gus appear (forget about any of the other characters they never appear), and Anestasia gets a conscious? Are you kidding me?

The songs were short but very sweet, and I instantly fell in love with all of them. The soundtrack is amazing and very much like the original. The movie created the same magical, romantic feeling that so many people felt while watching the original. All in all this was an amazing movie, and don't let anybody tell you otherwise.And by the way Cinderella 3 is set one year after the wedding, when Cinderella 2 took place after.

The mice are hysterical, Cinderellie turns out to have a lot of spunk and a good sense of humor, the stepmother's eerily creepy, and the stepsister turns out to be a good egg. It has a lot of sight gags, and the writing's good - plenty to laugh at and get carried along by.

Cinderella's stepmother gets the Fairy god Mother's magic wand after Anastasia steals it, and goes back in time. The animation was very good and the story was delightful.

The film centres around that fateful day on Mar. 10, 1981, when President Reagan was shot by an insane assassin and the fallout within the Reagan administration, as Haig is in a power struggle with the Cap Weinberger, Ed Casey and the other members of the cabinet. There are no special features or trailers, but that alone did not prevent the film from being captivating to watch.

I love my DS, and around 5 years ago, this would have been a decent mobile browser. But today even the most minor websites have lots of data and images to load, all of which will bring your surfing experience to a near standstill. I don't think this is the result of too-high expectations, either. After all, the very first page that you'll see when starting the browser lists Nintendo's home page as a suggested link; but that site is almost completely unusable using this platform, something I think is a little embarrassing for Opera and Nintendo.Bottom line, the only practical use for this is checking e-mail and perhaps a few blogs, and that's really all there is. The next DS should be a bit more powerful and hopefully that'll bring a truly great mobile net surfing experience to the masses. Wait till then."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole lot more than expected","review":"I will make this review a short one. This is because I am writting it from the very product I review (actually, I am even using the stylus to write).I just bought my DS browser yesterday and I can say it is a very cool thing. I genuinely love this this thing! It is simple enough to use and is rather functional. Now, I must confess that it does have its flaws, but they are far outweighted by the positive aspects of it.I have been able to read news, check my e-mail, browse amazon.com, and surf quite a few others things with great ease.I must accept, though, that this browser has some limitations: no audio, no video, no flash and some heavier-than-usual load times (although they are not as bad as some might say).Having said all of the above, I do recommend getting this great product, as it certainly delivers what one expects and is great fun to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Way To Surf","review":"As long as you don't have astronomically high expectations of this little browser, you may be pleasantly surprised. No, it doesn't support Flash. No, it won't play videos. However, you can access most popular sites and have them work well. I can get on my photo sharing site easily. I can also do some online banking. Some image heavy sites do take several minutes to fully load. As long as you know that going in, you might still be surprised how well it works. The dual screens add an interesting dimension to web surfing that reminds me a little of the new iPhones. Specifically, one of the screens can magnify the web page while you navigate using the other.

Remember 56Kbps dialup modems via phone landlines? Well, the internet is different today; pages are much more complex.Anyway, remember 56Kbps and how slow that was? I swear this seems about a quarter of that speed.

You're still not able to access video (streaming or otherwise), there's no javascript support or flash media. Even with images disabled the load times are horrendus and the browser is prone to lock up quite often over the simplest of task.

Every page loads painfully slowly, with a counter telling you just how many images are left to load. You never realize how many buttons and icons and pictures are on the average web page until you try viewing them with the DS Browser. Forget about YouTube. Forget about video of any kind. I thought the DS Browser would be a great way to read e-mail or do some basic surfing without turning on my real computer, but in the time it takes the DS Browser to load one page, you can start your PC and have viewed 10 pages.

As far as web browsers go, you're not going to want to use this over the browser on your desktop or laptop. Still, the DS is lighter in your hands, than is a laptop, which makes it quite the advantage, if you really want to browse the web in a precarious position, say, on the toilet. You won't at all feel the overwhelming preference to drink gasoline, rather than use this product. You won't even be tempted. Really.Because the DS has, even with the included SLOT-2 memory expansion device, so little RAM, this web browser is very slow. This can be frustrating, but it can also be lived with. Text-rich and picture-poor sites are probably the best to visit with this device, which is fine, because sites like Wikipedia are probably the most useful on a portable device.In summary: A convenience away from your computer, but not a replacement for a smart phone. Better than drinking gasoline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo slooow","review":"I eagerly awaited the release of the Opera browser for the DS. My girlfriend tried to talk me out of buying it, but I had faith in Opera after using the top notch Wii browser. Now, I have buyer's remorse. Before I bought it, I had already come to terms with it's lack of Flash. After I started using it, though, I realized there were bigger problems. It takes minutes upon minutes to load anything. Loading a single Facebook page takes on average 2-3 minutes with images disabled. This application is basically useless to me. I could see it being of some use if you're stranded on a deserted island with only your DS, assuming the deserted island has wifi, and you have many hours of time to kill whilst awaiting your rescue.I'm already eager for the next gen of the DS so that Opera can put out a real browser. Only buy this as an emergency browser, since everyday usage is pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great implementation. DS falls short.","review":"The software is stupendous, and would earn 5 stars on its own. Unfortunately for today's internet the DS just doesn't have the power you need. No flash is liveable, but the render times are crippling.If all you want to do is read the news and check your email this may be worth it. I switched my nytimes subscription to weekends only, and just read the weekday news on the ds now. Unfortunately that's about the limit of this device's usefulness. It's simply not practical for regular web surfing or reading link-ridden blogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"Yeah, it works...

I didn't think I would be able to view large web pages but have not had any problems. Some sites are unavailable but many are still accessable. It takes some getting used to the way it rearranges the layouts but not something that you can't get used to. I can easily view my personal website and was able to play around with Google maps.Overall, worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for this day and age.","review":"This browser would be wonderful... if it was made for the internet five years ago. There is just so much content that we use on the internet that is Flash-based and such that the DS browser just can't handle it efficiently. I only needed it to get on my Webmail for college (which didn't work) and even though there are tons of access spots here, it could barely pick up any.Overall, this product is fine for if you are just going to text-only or mobile versions of sites, then this is fine. If you do heavy browsing, then another mobile device will work better for you, please don't waste your money.

It doesn't support Flash so a lot of content is unviewable. I have Verizon FIOS at home and it took me almost a week to find out the proper settings for my WEP key. Nitendo wanted me to try to slow my home system down to try and get it to work at first. I hung up on him.

It's easy and fairly intuitive to use. That's why I gave the product two stars instead of one.The overall experience is so hampered by the slow speed and lack of features that you expect (in many cases need) that I gave up trying to use it.

It is no wonder that we will need more sophisticated hardware for doing so.Humans never produce energy, they collect it. They collect those energies which are most concentrated and most easy to reach first and than focus on those of lower concentration and quality or on those at greater depths.

At the end of the book there is a chance the world could be destroyed.

It has no plot, the characters are all completely un-developed (especially Rosemary), and every unimportant detail in the book is described painfully and boringly. I swear to God there were sentences I had to read 2-3 times just to understand what he was trying to say. And I don't think that's because I'm stupid.

It isn't funny, it isn't scary and its attempts at biting social commentary couldn't be more inept.

The most exciting part of the book takes place on page 288, and really is not worth waiting for.It winds down in an extremely weak, vague ending. Where upon if you have lasted for this long, you lay it aside with a sigh of relief, and a feeling of being totally cheated by Mr. Levin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Ira Levin lost his magic touch?","review":"The Ira Levin books, all six of them, are astonishing, gripping reads delivered in cool razor-sharp prose which gradually tightens the reader's attention right up to - in all cases - a knockout twist. Suddenly, he writes a seventh book, and it seems the magic is sadly lost. The premise is ripe with possibility - the Antichrist born in 'Rosemary's Baby' grows up and fulfills his legacy - but it was always going to be tough, trying to build on the disturbing ambiguity of that novel's conclusion. This sequel is bereft of the trademark wit which Levin usually enjoys slipping into his story like icy daggers, and short of a nifty little skit involving an elaborate murder at a department store, the plot meanders along inconsequently towards a risible, hackneyed resolution which just looks drab and appalling alongside his other brilliant breathless conclusions, and leaves the reader feeling cheated. Levin Lovers everywhere will be enormously disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book I've read....","review":"Astonishingly bad....there were even sentences that were unintelligible. The characters were flat, the dialogue awkward. The ending was utterly bogus. I could tell that the book was a loser from the start but read on in perverse hope. My perserverance was NOT rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is Horror-able!","review":"As with all sequells, this is a huge disapointment.I may be less intelligent having read this book. The premise is hard to buy. The original book had a great potential for a sequel- one that is not realized here. The end is not at all satisfing. The mysterious anagram that supposedly will tie every thing together is a crushing disapointment(I spent an hour on a scrabble board working it out). Now thats scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes sequels are better left unsaid.","review":"The author tries......but just doesn't cut it. First of all, Rosemary awakens from a 27 year coma to find her son a world famous \\"leader\\" of sorts, and when she confronts him with his past, he gives her a two second explanation of how he has totally ignored his Satanic upbringing and is now working for the good of mankind and she readily accepts this. It gets worse from there. As the reader is swept along in an entirely unreal environment, the atmosphere becomes more and more predictable. Though Ira Levin offered a nice twist at the end, it flopped miserably and reminded me very much of the Wizard of Oz. The characters in the story don't even behave as humans would given their circumstances, and often the dialogue is disjointed and thoughts come out of nowhere. My best advice - if you must read this book, borrow it, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Zero Stars Should Be an Option","review":"Place this one at the top of the list of sequels that never should have been written. The plot is ridiculous and the writing abysmal, coming nowhere near the brilliance of the original book, which Levin ultimately dismisses with an unexpected plot twist that leaves the reader dumbfounded and angry. Furthermore, his failure to reveal the anagram of ROAST MULES, which he continually touts as a key element of the story, is frustrating and inexcusable. What a tragic way to end what was an otherwise noteworthy writing career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I have to agree with the reviewers who were disappointed in this book. I have to admit that I discounted their reviews and took the book out of the library anyway-it was free, and I enjoyed \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" so much I figured I had nothing to lose. And I didn't; I mean it was somewhat amusing, but nowhere near as much so as the first one. Ira Levin is very talented at producing good page-turners but this book could have been a lot more interesting.Rosemary's Baby had a kind of dry, dark humor and was quite riveting-I have no idea where he was planning on going with this book though. I kind of liked the idea that maybe Rosemary had some free will to begin with and was exploring the consequences of her life choices in this book and ultimately perhaps had a chance at redemption, but Levin was so cryptic and this book so ambiguous that it is hard to know what to read into it. Mysteries are fun; complete confusion isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrifying book","review":"It's not just that Ira Levin seemed sloppy and lazy in writing this book. It's worse than that - he seemed to write the story with contempt for the subject. I was horrified as I read it, not because of the \\"horror\\" of the subject matter or plot line, but because I couldn't believe how much contempt was pouring out of the author of the original classic. It's as though he was laughing at everyone who enjoyed the original story and was saying, \\"you want a sequel - how about THIS, sucka!\\"Don't buy, don't borrow, don't bother. I've never read anything worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God","review":"Well, it might be overkill, but I feel compelled to add criticism to the ocean that this book has already received. I feel almost bad for Levin and his complete breakdown of creativity, until I think that if this novel had been submitted by someone with little or no credentials it probably would be mounted on a wall in some editor's office as an example of the worst piece of writing ever submitted. Someone actually published this and I feel like they literally reached into my wallet and took out the money. I kept hoping while reading this novel that I was missing a joke, or that the whole thing would be revealed as a parody. No, I think Levin was serious the whole way through.

The gods of publishing are the only ones who know.

By the time I finished reading this book, I had to re-read the cover, to make sure that it really WAS Ira Levin's name I had seen there. What a disappointment this book was. I felt that Levin cheapened the original Rosemary's Baby by writing such a hurried, weakly-plotted book. I felt absolutely no empathy for Rosemary at all; in fact, by the end of the book I was kind of hoping she WOULD be destroyed by Satan, or by her son. Those incest-wannabe scenes more or less creeped me out, and there were so many loose ends and so many outright boring passages that I lost interest quickly.

Somewhere toward the middle, I started turning pages to leapfrog to the end, never a good sign.

I would feel cheated if somebody had paid me to read it.This next paragraph could possibly spoil the ending, so read no further if I and the majority of the other reviewers haven't scared you away from the book.The winner among the utterly ridiculous sub-plots and literary devices in the book has to be how Levin so disasterously resolves his story. Let's just say that if you were disappointed by how they brought back Bobby Ewing on Dallas, you'll be prone to violence when you finish Son of Rosemary.Also, could somebody please explain why, oh, why Andy's sexual attraction to his mother was a plotline? Where did that come from?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending was an easy way out","review":"I found the original more believable. This was more social satire. Andy's following should have been smaller and Roesmary's suspicions greater. I kept putting the book down thinking to myself, \\"It should be titled 'The Further Misadventures of the Village Idiot'.\\" The ending was an easy-way out that requires a minimal amount of imagination. There are times when one can get away with this kind of ending. I have seen it done very well on television several times, but I expect more from a book than I do from my television. It takes me a longer amount of time to read a boom than it does to watch a TV show or a movie. So I expect a little more substance. I did enjoy this book though. But it was NO classic wheras the original was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe expectations were too high.","review":"But nothing the other readers who panned this said is an exaggeration. As a writer, I know the temptation of a stiff advance, but I would at least try to do the sequel justice.For a really diabolical read, try Thomas Montleone's BLOOD THE THE LAMB. You won't feel like you wasted money and, worse, time on that one.If you must read SON OF ROSEMARY just to see if it's THAT bad, get it from the library. Better yet, don't read it. Think of Ira Levin fondly instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosemary lays an egg.","review":"I must admit, Son of Rosemary held my interest during the opening chapters. But, things slowed down fairly quickly. Then, finally a murder takes place (now we're getting somewhere). But, that ending! (GROAN!) Not only does Son of Rosemary end with a cop-out, but the wonderful Rosemary's Baby does, too! Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible let down","review":"After I finished this book, I was so disappointed I threw my copy in the trash (and a hardcover at that) Aside from sloppy writing and non exsistent characterization, Ira Levin has forever ruined Rosemary's Baby for me with his horrid cop out ending. Why didn't he just entitle the book \\"Only Writing this For The Money?\\" Its blatantly obvious and a betrayal to all who read and loved the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"It is a major disappointment to find this novel to be so total a failure. The author of the seminal horror novel 'Rosemary's Baby' and the wonderfully surprising \\"A Kiss before Dying' seems to have given up caring about his characters or his readers. There is not a moment of suspense, mystery, or suprise in the book. The 'surprise' ending is a shopworn cliche, which betrays the original book and those of us who so admire it. I wish that the author hadn't bothered writing this terrible waste of his time and mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this most anticipated book became a chore.","review":"I was really excited about reading the sequel to \\"Rosemary's Baby\\". I knew that the sequel wouldn't be as good but, I didn't really think it would be this bad. Character development was nonexistent. Every character seemed \\"diluted\\". The whole book seemed rushed, as if Mr. Levin wrote it under a weekly deadline. The \\"incestuous\\" feelings did not work. The book read like a Reader's Digest Condensed version of a really bad book. Now I know why it took Mr. Levin so long to write a sequel. He really didn't want to and his heart wasn't in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - Save your money and do not buy this book.","review":"This book was an absolute chore to read. I had very high expectations, and they simply did not come close to being satisfied. The ending [which I will not ruin] is, in my opinion, a cop out. This book does not have any of the magic or suspense of its predecessor. UGH! I wish I could get my money back from the bookstore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diabolically dreadful","review":"At this point, most of the other \\"one star\\" reviewers have \\"said it all\\", and I fully agree.

It was terrible! I mean, all she has to say is 'He's my son' and the whole world believes him.. Definitly not worth your time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Lame\\" effort not up to Levin's usual high standards","review":"I have read -- and thoroughly enjoyed -- many of Levin's books, including Rosemary's Baby, This Perfect Day, and my favorite, The Boys From Brazil. Levin's plot twists, and especially his rare talent for unusual and thought-provoking endings have made each of these books real page-turners. Some sequels actually improve on their originals; Son of Rosemary is a lame effort that only reinforces the opinion that even talented authors like Levin should leave wildly successful stories uncontinued. If you are a \\"Dallas\\" fan and bought the \\"Pam's dream\\" explanation for Bobby's resurrection after the scriptwriters killed him off, you'll love this book. Otherwise, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"it could have been slightly worse.","review":"granted, i would not label this a \\"good\\" book; in fact, it is quite possibly the worst book i have ever read. the original novel worked because it takes a very ordinary premise (a woman having a baby) and frighteningly proposes the impossible (could the baby be the son of satan?). this one fails because it takes a ridiculous premise (the son of satan has gotten the whole world to worship him by simply saying \\"love ya\\" a couple of times) and then proposes the utterly obvious (could the antichrist be up to no good?). but let's face it, any sequel to rosemary's baby was bound to fail, because the twist has already been taken . . . and as bad as this sequel is, it is ten times better than the DREADFUL 1975 made-for-tv-movie sequel, Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby . . . at least in this version, the coven isn't referred to as \\"the tribe\\" . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Green, have your copy recycled.","review":"Don't read unless your out to tarnish your opinion of Rosemary's Baby.This book is nothing more than a quick cash in on an American Classic, and don't let the \\"you just have to get it\\" reviews fool you because there's nothing here to get. Ira doesn't even tell you what the anagram referred to many times throughout the book (Roast Mules) even means because it's just meaningless.To sum it up... the book is basically just silly, boring rambling with a terribly weak plot that doesn't match up well with the original.Nothing mysterious about it, the ending is just silly and even insulting to the reader... it's just weak.It's like ordering a double vodka and you realize you've been served a club soda.I actually question whether Ira Levin even wrote this because it's such a drastic drop in quality from the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid setup leading to incredibly sophmoric punchline","review":"I could tell from the first paragraph that this tome was a loser-but i let it live in the john for a few days-it lived down to my worst expectations-after 100 pages- nothing happens!the worst part is he alomost hooks u with an anagram-that he never reveals the answer to! (i solved it with a web anagram solver-for those unfortunates who waded thru this poorly written dreck \\"roasted mules\\" means \\"somersaults\\" The amazing thing is the solution has absolutely nothin to do with the story-a fouler red herring I have never followed!Avoid at all costs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up to a classic","review":"I finally got around to reading Rosemary's Baby and checked out this one at the same time. After finishing Baby I couldn't wait to start on Son. I wish I had waited, and also wish I'd never done it. It was terrible. The characters in Rosemary's Baby were so developed and complex and wonderful whereas the characters in Son of Rosemary were dull and one-dimensional. I loved Rosemary in Baby but there was nothing intriguing about her at all in Son. Please, please, stop after reading the original. The sequel is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ira Should've Quit While He Was Ahead...","review":"When Mr. Levin sold his soul, he should have made more than just one good book part of the bargain. Rosemary's Baby is brilliant. Son of Rosemary is garbage..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't worth $1","review":"I bought the hardcover version of this book at a Dollar store, and realized I got ripped off. Although it was an easy read, the whole thing was unbelievable (at least the original made a great movie). I guess the author was trying to cash in on the millenium madness, as well as his former much better works. The ending was garbage, and made me realize that I would have been better off spending my time doing something useful, like taking a nap.Roast mules was at least somewhat amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I started this book with eager anticipation remembering the sleepless nights I experienced after reading \\"Rosemary's Baby\\". Well I slept like a baby after this one. The fact that it is not a horror book, though, is not the failing of this book. Ira Levin who so beautifully brought to life the characters of his first book, fails to make us care at all about any of these 2 dimentional characters, the worst of whom is Rosemary. I can only assume that Mr. Levin threw this together for the huge advance he undoubtedly received. I wonder if the money was worth the damage to his reputation as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"IDIOTIC","review":"I could not wait to read Ira Levin's sequel to his own Rosemary's Baby, which begs for a sequel, unlike so many other books that are best left alone. He should have left THIS one alone -- this book is so slap-dash and silly that it reads as if it were literally thrown together. The story, what there is of one, does nothing with the grand premise left by the first book, and actually ruins the entire first novel as well. It is like a cruel, amateurish joke on the reader -- I wonder why Levin chose to dedicate this book to Mia Farrow, who best not sign up for the film version anytime soon. It is like a mean-spirited, badly executed practical joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of Rosemary","review":"I did enjoy the book at first, but then it started to get a bit bizarre. Such as when Andy would come on to his mother, her reponse was puzzling, but maybe she didn't expect anything other than that type of behavior since his father was satan. I was also confused about the ending. Was everything a dream or some sort of foresight of the future of her and Guy. I also still have no idea what \\"Roast Mules\\" is suppose to mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book best left unwritten","review":"This pitiful excuse for a book (a sequel no less to one of the best modern horror novels) is mindboggling in its badness. Anyone expecting even a hint of the grounded-in-reality creepiness of ROSEMARY'S BABY will be sorely disappointed. The ending is not so much of a surprise as it is shocking (in its triteness)...it negates not only this book but the original as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If anyone else had written it, Levin would sue...","review":"Appalling sequel to his own mega-bestseller \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" has celebrated author and playwright Ira Levin plumbing new depths. He has the germ of an interesting idea here, but gets all fouled up on where to take his characters, and he doesn't seem to know his leading lady anymore. The climactic bouts of violence are heavy-handed, with an eye on the movie action-market(dream on), and the final chapter is sad, sad desperation. What went wrong? I think Levin is a writer of his time, and should continue writing as if it were 1965(there's nothing wrong with that). Being modern and up-to-date isn't in him, just as being kinky or salacious wouldn't suit any buttoned-down writer of his generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"it wasn't just me","review":"I finished the book last night and I had to check out the reviews just to make sure that it wasn't just me. I thought maybe I missing something that everyone else got. But after seeing over 50 negative reviews, I know it was the book, not me. Thank goodness I only borrowed it from the library.I feel bad after reading all of the criticisms against such a respected author, but it really was bad. You have to wonder how a publishing house would even agree to let this book bear it's name. It was a LONG read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initially promising, ultimately unsatisfying.","review":"Having read (and loved) Ira Levin's horror classic when I was still in high school, I was thrilled to see that there was a sequel. The book started out OK (if a bit far-fetched), but in the end was very disappointing.In the essence of time, I will keep this review short and pointed. If you have read the original, you will be disappointed by the plot devices at play here. Also, those who haven't will probably find the book a bit silly. Anyway, I would only recommend this to someone who has some spare weekend moments and can't find anything on the telly -- it is essentially trash, so if you must read it, don't waste too much time on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yea, electrical info it's in there...","review":"tell you what if you wanna learn about electricity not just automotive but electricity in general this is your book.

The fact that the author chose to use the Pinto as his subject should be warning enough as it, like this book, leaves MUCH to be desired. Wiring diagrams are small, cluttered, and incomplete. Following (or trying to follow) these diagrams will assure you of one of two things; A Fire or a car that won't start.

David Jacobs Strain plays, writes and sings like his soul already topped the one hundred thousand mile mark. Guitar Player magazine dubbed him as one of the up and coming players in the business. His vocals have an appealing weather beaten quality to them and his songs show a maturity beyond his short years. I just don't know if this will appeal to blues purists or not. It's a blues album when he's covering songs by Fred McDowell, Blind Willie Johnson and Sleepy John Estes. His own stuff tends to have a more singer-songwriter sound in the vein of a John Hiatt. You know, blues tinged but aiming for radio airplay. Don't take that as a slam. Just take it as a possible sign that DJS may be thinking of joining the mainstream just as Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepard have.

Even extreme anthropological Marxists like Ferguson and Harris - whose ideas Tierney uses - have distanced themselves from this work. The book contains consistent rewritings of other writers' work and deceptive misquotings (used in one situation by one author, and then trimmed and applied to another situation). The allegations that scientists and the anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon used a bad measles vaccine to experiment on the Yanomamo was dismissed by an expert on vaccines in minutes. The only interesting question concerning this book is why Norton published it, and why they continue to sell it. Astonishing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous Book","review":"I viewed the film \\"Ax Fight\\" in college. I was anxious to read the book Darkness in El Dorado when I heard it was to be published. I commend Mr. Tierney for his courageous profile of western-influence gone very wrong in the rainforest. The most facinating portion of the book was the telling investigation of how western anthropologists used the Yanomamo Indians to 'prove' their preconceived notions of human behavior.I have been amused by the vitriolic reviews from the outraged scientific community regarding this book. I do agree Tierney seems to have given a 'pass' to the equally destructive religious missionaries in the rainforest and that needed to be pointed out by the critics. But to say the book is way off the mark because he dares to criticize one of their own scientists seems self-serving to me. I believe this story needed to be told."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Journalists Try their hand at Anthropology!","review":"I am currently an Anthropology Student at Wilfrid Laurier University, and for a Term Paper for a Classics in Ethnography course, I decided to look at this recent uproar over Chagnon and Tierney.I decided to buy Darkness In El Dorado so I could read it on my own pace, and not be rushed like many University Students are. When i finally completed it I was not sure what to make of this so called \\"Non Fiction\\" book.What I read was nothing more than an attack on Neel and Chagnon, with have truth evidence, and the twisting of quotes from experts. If one was to do the research I was intailed to do, then I beleive that you would all come to the conclusion that this book was nothing more than journalistic sensationalism, and not a true documentation of meticulous research as it is being praised to be.

It is rather riveting reading and you start to work up an indignation about evil researchers. The only problem is that there is no evidence. The author himself noted that he has no smoking gun evidence at all. Instead, after the publication, the accusations have all been scrutinised by several outsiders. Not a single accusation has withstood the external scrutiny.

I was also disappointed that it didn't have a feature that I love: You set the temp and turn on auto and then it stays on being either a fan or heater depending on the temp in the room. I have that on another heater and love it. It stays on -- you don't get that off and on clicking. It's a nice \\"white noise\\" for sleep. For some reason, while reading the reviews and description, I was lead to believe that this had that feature and that is why I bought it.If you want a little heater that heats fast and is nice looking, you'll be pleased. If it being slightly loud bothers you, you won't.If you want it to just be a fan, it will. Just be a heater, it will. But if you want a continual sound to sleep by, as a heater it won't make you happy as it will be clicking off and on. Not many heaters do what I was hoping this one would, so it's more MY fault for misreading than the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good heater, terrible thermostat","review":"This product works fine as a space heater, but what I want you to be aware of is the thermostat.

I doubt if it has enough \\"umph\\" to warm a room in a northern climate unless you leave it running constantly at max and then it would help but not be enough, but it does just fine down here. It seems fairly well built, it has two wattages and a couple of fan speeds. It has a small \\"footprint\\" and can be placed almost anywhere in an open area and is fairly stable (as in it doesn't seem easily knocked over). It seems reliable too.

One suggestion is to close the door to the actual toilet if your bathroom has a separate toilet area. This reduces the amount of room the heater has to heat and makes it more efficient. I turn it off before I run my hairdryer, but aside from that we've had no issues with its power draw or performance. You can also adjust the strength of the blowing power and the heat.

There was nothing here that made me feel like the balance ball was necessary or that this was a unique kind of workout.

Well, not only did I have to wait all the extra time to get the item, but for $30 I should have known better and get something at a regular store.

When I did read that review I thought, well they didn't add enough coffee, so the next day I made another cup of coffee, I made sure to put more coffee grounds in the filter. Well, to my dismay, blah - hot water again, but with just a hint of flavor. For the amount of coffee you have to put in the filter to just get a good cup of coffee is not worth the cost of this coffee maker.

I had this for a year now and works great. Easy to use and quick (1 button in front which lights up and turns off when finished). The thermal mug is the only true problem it really does not keep your java warm for to long. So invest in a good thermal cup. It comes with a nylon/plastic filter and a little scoop that measures 1 scoop = 1 cup (2 scoops for the mug).P.S. If you use this machine often (like me 4 times a day) then I recommend you clean this unit once a month to keep it in optimal performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little coffee maker","review":"I've had this Toastess for a little over a month and I'm very satisfied. I don't know if there is a new batch available now with better QC, but I've not experienced any of the issues described in the other negative reviews. The coffe is hot (in fact, a little too hot to drink right away), the brewing takes only a minute or so, the unit shuts off after making a cup of coffee, and the switch works perfectly. The only comment with which I agree is the use of a paper filter. Not only is the nylon filter a little bit of a pain to clean, but the coffee comes out a little weak since some of the hot water flows out the sides of the nylon filter and not through the grounds. So just buy a box of the smallest filters and you'll be set.Finally, great coffee at work, one cup at time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one use","review":"I loved the design of this small/travel coffe maker and had high hopes of getting a good cup of coffee on my upcoming trip.

However it faulters on the fact that it creates new myths after having discarded the Bible. Since the Bible is just 'story' it relies on archeology. But archeology only tells us that 'yes people did live here' it doesnt tell us how many there were or what they thought or how they worhsiped. For instance it cannot account for nomads or semi-nomads, an important part of the Middle East even today. Thus it cannot tell us much about the overalll picture, it can only tell us what it had found. What it has found is inconclusive and relies mostly on the theories of archeologists.So this book weaves together theories and then turns them into a new beleif system, one equally improbable as the source it seeks to debunk, the Bible.Less than credible.

I'm heating a bedroom-sized office which would normally be around 50-60 degrees. When I leave the room and come back in, I easily notice that the office is much warmer. This takes about 10 minutes to make a noticeable temperature change and ~15-20 minutes to reach final desired temp, which is pretty good if you're familiar with radiators. It doesn't make any strange noises or smell bad, so I'm very glad I purchased this instead of a noisy fan-heater.On the negative, the knob controls are a little antiquated though (eg. the programmable timer still has those little flip-switches for each 15-min integral which you want the unit to stay on/off, and the thermostat knob is a little odd), but those are not a significant problem as they do still work as expected.

Mine is set to 23 and I love it... now I must replace it - accidentally left it running overnight and it was always on for up to 16-17 hours daily.I ordered from Amazon and from the DeLonghi Store, the TRN0812T and the total 5 separate orders were all returned... the radiator cut off after 10 minutes - each and every one. I'm trying to find someone who can repair 1015T, but I don't think it can be repaired.DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$ on the TRN0812T.. maybe the 5 I got were all duds, but I was on the phone with a DeLonghi customer service person and she heard the heater click off 3 times in a row, after being on for only about 2 minutes and it was set to the max time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!

Other reviews talk about how this does not work in large open areas and I was concerned because my bath area has an open door into the bedroom, but it heats the area just fine. Not going to get over-heated or hot, but no chill in the air which is what I wanted. My floors are all tile and it keeps the floors room temperature too. I would purchase this heater again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disarmingly unfavorable quality. Discourteous costumer service.","review":"I received this heater as a replacement of another Delonghi heater which was higher-performing with more heat output in watts. This is how Delonghi treats you with its cocky 1-year limited warranty. You might as well get an inferior, cheaper product as Delonghi mistreats its customers to do itself a favor. The service location to deliver the broken heater was far, and Delonghi took more than a month to provide me with this cheaper heater.Besides, both my original heater and the replacement (this heater that the review is about) broke in less than a year. I had to change through 3 heaters in less than a year due to Delonghi's rock bottom product quality.Do NOT buy from Delonghi to bear this poor product quality and customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timer Works Well, Heat is good","review":"Got this to heat my master bath in the morning.

I own two other DeLonghi heaters for over five years and they are great and still working. I like the programmable feature that you set once and it comes on without you thinking about it. I bought this one as a Christmas present for a relative. How embarrassing to have to substitute another gift at the last moment. Very disappointed and will not order another one. Someone at the Quality testing desk fell asleep on the job!Stan"},{"rating":"2","title":"DeLonghi TRN0812T Portable Oil-Filled Radiator with Programmable Timer","review":"This heater has worked well for over two years. We wanted a heater to keep the bathroom toasty for baths, showers, etc. and yet be water safe. This product does all that and fits into the bathroom closet when storage is needed. Very good product and I could not find anything like this in other stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"This is the second one we have purchased. We had one in our son's room and wanted a second with the arrival of our daughter. We have the thermostat programmed very low at night, but wanted a way to keep our children warm. The DeLonghi works great.We can change the temperature very easily. You can adjust the wattage to Low, Medium & High, as well as adjust the temperature range. The auto on/off feature is great. We can adjust to each child's sleep pattern and naps.The one drawback is the lack of a temp gauge. You have to go \\"by feel\\" rather than adjust to a specific temp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to change this review","review":"This little radiator is perfect for the bathroom, on those cold mornings/nights when taking a shower is an experience you're not looking forward to. It fits nicely in a corner when not in use, and takes the chill off the average bathroom in about 15 minutes. I haven't used the timer yet, but just from looking at it and reading the instructions, I can definitely see how some other reviewers have found it a bit difficult to navigate. But all in all, this heater does exactly what I need it to do... warms up my bathroom.UPDATE: This heater broke down shortly after my initial review, after relatively few uses. It took months of arguing, but the company finally did replace it. The replacement stopped working after about a month, having been used for about 4 hours a week. RUN, DON'T WALK, away from this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a champ!!","review":"Works just as advertised.

It gives added heat to a room, but it doesn't last very long at all. We've had it for about three years and only used in maybe 20 or 30 times and it doesn't even turn on anymore. It's sitting in my cellar in my junk pile after only 20-30 uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"This heater is small and compact. It seems well built with nice easy to use features.

It's small but powerful, and did a great job of heating - so good, in fact, that the next year we bought another one for one of our bedrooms.That's the good news. The bad news is that the first one died shortly after we bought the second one, and the second one died just over a year after we bought it, as well. Note that the second one was never used in the bathroom or moist area, so that wasn't the cause.It's a shame, because up until the point that they died we loved these heaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"has strong smell when I turn it to max heat","review":"On the second day we used it, we turned it on to max heat since that day was cold. It was put in my baby's bedroom. Then after half an hour we heard that he cries. When we got in, there was very strong smell coming from the heater, the smell is like that some plastic material is burned. Horrible! Don't know whether it's toxic or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This product was generally very disappointing, for three reasons:- For about 3 months after purchase, it is emitted a putrid smell of oil.- The thermostat leaves much to be desired - the room is either boiling hot or freezing cold.- 5 months after buying it, it just stopped working - $75 down the drain.Not recommended in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, compact size...too bad they don't last","review":"I purchased this at the end of 2007 because I needed a safe, small compact heater. I bought this at Bed, Bath, and Beyond, paying a little less than 60 with a 20% coupon. It was a wonderful heater and did its job really well that I bought a second one a couple of months later. Don't expect this to heat a large room, it's only designed for small rooms. The GFI plug is a nice safety feature. I would have given this a 5 star if I wrote a review then. Almost a year later one of them broke. I thought that was just a lemon, but then the second one broke shortly therafter (warranty was only for a year). It's a shame because I really liked this heater, but I wish the durability was better. It's really unfortunate because there are not many oil-based heaters in this size to choose from and price was not a major criteria for me(I would gladly pay more for a quality heater that would last)."},{"rating":"2","title":"works, just a tad bit noisy","review":"works well, puts out good heat and doesnt get too hot for kids touching it with the larger surface area of the fins. only problem is on med or high, the heating element creaks as the metal in the unit expands and contracts while the element turns on and then turns off. whatever metal they used in there, it changes size to easily with temperature so in themiddle of the night, click... tick tick tick tick tick as the element heats up, then click, element goes off and tick tick tick... as the element cools down. the larger version of this didnt have the problem, you cant tell, hardly, when the heater is switching on and off, you just get nice heat coming off it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKE A WEEK AFTER THE YEAR WARRANTEE","review":"Worked great but a week after a year went buy it broke, no power (yes I checked the GFI breaker on the cord)Bummer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Luck","review":"Purchased this over a month ago, had it 3 days and it stopped working.

Our apartment gas heater was out of order until today, but we haven't really missed it with this heater and our older > 20 year old DeLonghi heater. The ability to use it in the bathroom is a real plus. It's lightweight and easy to carry around if necessary.Some of the problems mentioned by other reviewers included: turns off by itself (fix is to change the timer settings) and smell when turned off in highest setting (we didn't turn it to the highest for over a month but when we did we didn't notice a strong smell).Overall, very happy with this little heater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeb Oil Heater","review":"DeLonghi TRN0812T Oil-Filled RadiatorI am very pleased with it.

If you leave it on MAX all day it'll wear itself out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unsatisfactory","review":"To be blunt: it sucks. VERY inefficient, as in, slow to heat even a small-ish bedroom.

Boo, hiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective and no help from Delonghi","review":"It's a great looking heater. The size is right too. And, it gets good and hot fairly rapidly. However, within one week of opening the box the thermostat stopped working. I had the heater in my kids' room set to warm to about 66 degrees. When I came into the room the next morning it was in the 80s and the heater was hot as a pistol. I soon figured out the thermostat was not working. I tried numerous times to get Delonghi to at least talk to me about the problem without success. So now I have a heater I have to watch very carefully and rarely use. I would have returned but by the time I opened the box I was well out of the return period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy for baby's room","review":"This heater makes rather loud clicks at seemingly random times. Not sure if it has or will wake up baby, but I'm not about to take any chances, he is not a good sleeper as it is. Plus, the clicks get amplified over our monitor and wake us up. I think I will try the \\"eco-heater\\" next.Addendum: Well, we kept this heater for the baby's room. The loud clicking has subsided for the most part, and it does work well, and is compact. When it does click or creak, it does not seem to wake him up. Also, it seems to be more stable than the taller versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot llike other space heater","review":"I have multiple space heaters, this one i bought for tunr on at a specific timing and the configurations are complicated and then there is no overiding remote that i was thinking would be available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisey","review":"Hello, this product was poorly designed and after one day of use popping noises began to be very noticeable .

There was a odor when I first ran it. I thought it would go away, but unfortunately it never did. I would run it for varying periods of time, but the smell just never dissapated. I can't be sure what the smell was, but I wondered if perhaps the manufacturer didn't use a high heat paint. With all of the media coverage of items made in China with substandard or toxic materials, I wondered if this was the case! I did exchange it for another, and sadly the second heater smelled as well. The heater itself was a great size and worked well, but I just could not get past the awful smell.If you can get past the smell, I would recommend the heater, but if the odor is a point of concern, then you may want to bypass it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last much beyond the warranty","review":"When our landlord started charging for gas but not for electricity, we bought three oil-filled DeLonghi heaters (TRN1015T). They were delightful for the first two weeks, then became increasingly noisy (one developed an annoying humming, vibrating sound, another an annoying clicking in the timer, and the third one had both sound effects). They all limped along past the 12 month warranty, but another 6 months of intermittent use later, two of them are dead. I'll stay away from DeLonghi from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed :(","review":"I was very hopeful buying this item, and I must say thanks to those two weeks I was using it, my gas bill was lowered by about $50, however the problem is: IT ONLY WORKED TWO WEEKS!!!

I'd suggest RECALL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange odor during operation; stopped working after 1 month","review":"I bought this heater at 50% off, but it was supposed to be a new heater. It came with a large dent in one of the metal panels and the paint was chipped off. I called, and the company gave me a choice of returning the heater for replacement or a $15 credit (since the damage was only cosmetic). I took the $15 on the reassurance that the damage would not affect the performance of the heater. I also asked about the funny smell when the heater was operating, and they said that would go away eventually. However, the heater stopped working after less than 1 month. For the net price I paid, it's hardly worth trying to return the heater, but the whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. (And a funny smell in my nose -- the smell didn't go away after using the heater for a month!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heat output just isn't that much","review":"This heater works fine and is compact, but it just doesn't do the job heating. I have it in a small room (10 X 12), and if I close it off and leave it on high for several hours, it will warm the room up some, but maybe only to about 67-68F according to the indoor thermometer I have on the wall. It is warm right over it, but how much time do you spend over a heater in your home like you would over a campfire in the woods? I will say it is quiet compared to a heater fan of course, so if you want to be cold and in peace and quiet, it will work. I would say this is product is only for a small, enclosed space such as a bathroom or small bedroom that is closed off, well insulated and has no windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed!!","review":"This product worked well for the first few days and then would not turn on at all.

Whisper quiet, they are able to heat an average size room to the point of discomfort within a short period of time. Great price, solid construction, durable and quiet.

As a diabetic with no real feeling in my feet anymore, this heater is ideal, because the fins are encased in a plastic polymer that doesn't allow my toes to come in direct contact, so I don't worry about accidental burns. The ground-interrupt plug is another plus, although the cord would benefit from a stout flex-lead at the plug.The timer feature is great--it allows programming for the requisite warm-up time common to oil-filled heaters. This heater will keep a 20' by 20' room warm. I recommend it, unless your need is instantaneous heating. Also ideal and safe for a warm bathroom in the winter mornings."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY DELONGHI!!

I think it was the style in which it was written, it just never flowed easily for me with its \\"Elizabethan cadence\\" and the quoted poetry. And I really couldn't like the hero; regardless of how remorseful he was for how he treated the heroine it just wasn't enough considering all he put her through. I liked the heroine a bit better, although she, too, wore on me as the book went along. Yet aficionadas of medieval romance fiction will enjoy it for its historical depth and florid style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Satisfying Read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was not a typical rote-romance; the characters are believable and unique and the historical detail is impressive. The plot is unpredictable and engaging - I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps is the time period that I do not enjoy?!?","review":"... I found the dialogue to be rude and the period primative. I should probably stay away from 'mouse-like' heroine from now on because I just did not like Nora at all. She seems so spinless to me. Chirstian is no better - jumping to all the wrong conclusions without even investigating any of the possibilities. I was totally disgusted by the way he treated Nora espcially with other women. I have a real dislike for that type of childlish behavior. The story has a pretty simple plot with mouse-spy daring to save the kingdom and misunderstood by lover-husband as traitor. The way that Christian had to climb back to grace was touching, but I think that is too little, too late after what he put Nora through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, sad, romantic and wonderful!","review":"I have ready this book four or five times and it keeps getting better and better. I cry everytime that Christian rejects Nora. The language is wonderful and the use of poems and songs adds to the atmosphere. The story is set in Elizabethan England and the author describes this era delightfully, from bear baiting, to Queen Elizabeth's ladies in waiting. This book is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone with and interest in Elizabethan England."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk with a capital J","review":"Maybe I'm just unlucky, but I don't think so.

The descriptions are incomplete,(e.g. there is directions on how to go in one direction but not how to return). The only good thing about this book was the adventures that evolved while we were lost looking for the trails described. Italy appears to have a well mapped national trail system, however due to our lack of Italian and the inability to decipher when the National Park offices were open, we were unable to acquire the maps and corresponding documentation. I would suggest that this information be included rather than the chaotic and hit or miss selections included in the book.The book was pretty worthless.

The writing was hip and oh ever so groovy (I always thought Marc Bolan was closer to Donovan than to Bob Dylan in singing style anyway) and defined the experience of the 60's generation for the glam-rockers to come.

At times his story is downright compelling, but the minutiae of exactly which elector voted on exactly which issue becomes demoralizing to the reader as he doubts he will ever come to the end of the book. Mr. Holt begins in his preface to point out that he originally wanted to focus on the election of 1844. That section of the book is truly well-written. Similarly, there are other sections of the book when Mr. Holt does warm to his subject, but the rest of it is rather boring and scattered.

This book was lousy. It was poorly written, and filled with mindless ramblings. There was no real arch of progression, and the diction seemed straight out of the likes of teenage romance books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible help in finding peace in life","review":"I'm not sure why I picked this book up at the used book store the other day. I have never watched a Chuck Norris movie or show and knew nothing about him. It wasn't him at all I was interested in. It was the subject. I thumbed through the book and became excited at the depth of what I was reading. So, I bought it.I won't go into detail as the book is old and there are many other reviews. I'll only say it's one of the finest, most helpful books I've read on using the ki, the power within. If you read it with an open mind, you'll learn to garner your inner power and raise yourself to whatever heights you wish to conquer.It's truly an extremely well-written and powerful book --- far deeper and intellectual than you might expect.Highly recommended.-- Susanna K. Hutcheson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"I read this book from front to back within a matter of days and it was the most uplifting book I've ever read. After lending it to a friend who lost it, I had to re-order it but it was well worth paying for it again. Even my husband couldn't put the book down! Chuck Norris is the most inspirational person I know of in real life as well as on TV. His show deals with his own morals and philosophies that he practices in real life. If I hadn't read this book, I'd never have known he lost a brother in Vietnam. I was fortunate to see the Vietnam Veterans Moving Wall when it came to my home town last November. I found Weiland's name on the Wall. Just knowing it was Chuck's brother and having read the heartbreak he went through (and still goes through from the loss of his brother), it was a very moving experience for me. This book should be mandatory in every school in America! Chuck Norris is the epitome of heroism and what all of mankind should be. He would make a great President!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Round lids","review":"These lids are white, round and fit my six quart containers perfectly with a good seal.

Season 1 was very good and enjoyable to watch. Season 2-3 is nothing like season 1. The stories are poorly written and really do not even have that signature \\"Twilight Zone\\" touch to them that you find in the original series or even season 1. I can honestly say that there only a handful of stories (3 or 4 at most) that are worth watching in this set. For the most part, you will just find yourself fast-forwarding or just skipping through most of the set.As a fan of the original Twilight Zone and season 1, I found myself quite disappointed and it's a shame Season 2-3 wasn't worth it.Read the customer reviews and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works for us but not anymore","review":"I read other reviews that say dust get in the fan and stops it. This is true but all you have to do is use a vacuum (the more powerful the better) or do what I do and use compressed air to blow it out. I take it off the wall and unplug it before I do anything. I usually have to do this around once a year. If I don't the unit will turn on but shut itself off after the sensor inside sees that it is getting to hot with the fan not working. I owned mine for about 4 years now and it still works.I do agree that they should have put a bigger fan in it and they also should have put spacers that you can stick on ether side on the back so it will fit snug to the wall. I used pads for wall spacers. These pads normally go under furniture to keep the furniture from markup the wood floors. These pads seems to work very good as wall spacers for me.

OK, the movie features two very good-looking characters, played by Tapping and Adrian \\"Highlander\\" Paul, but \\"The Void\\" feels more like 90 hours than 90 minutes long.

When she does so she sets in motion an acient Egyptian prophecy.

I found the book about 5 or 6 years ago and have read it numerous times since. Unlike many books, this one did not lose any of it's appeal in repeated readings. The first time I read it, I was so captivated by the story and character development, that I actually dreamed about the characters several times! Cash's extensive research is obvious in her careful depictions and explanations of various schools of esoteric ideology and practices. Her characters and descriptions are well thought out and quite believable. As a child I lived through horrors similar to those young Cody is subjected to, and I found Spellman's descriptions of Cody's plight to be chillingly realistic. If you have any interest in this genre of book, you are unlikely to be disappointed with \\"Bless the Child\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"do not judge this book by the movie!","review":"I discovered this book three years ago and I loved it! The book is gripping and fascinating, unlike the movie adapatation. Please, please, please do not jduge this book by the the recent movie release, which drops basically the entire plot of the Isis Messenger, the use of Peter, Ellie, and other major characters, and pretty much destroys the entire plot!

I thought I could tackle the task at hand easily by scanning 12 slides at a time. Well, just about every slide I scanned comes out extremely soft and way out of focus.I'm not sure if it's a driver thing or what but the scans came out a little better on a PC than they do on my Mac G4 running OS X 10.4. Each slide required extensive sharpening--to the point where they all look over sharpened. Prescans looked acceptable, but final scans looked horrible. I also tried to scan a few prints, but they look pretty rough as well.I've spent countless hours adjusting the settings in hopes to find a combination that worked well for me, but I just couldn't seem to get it right.

This makes the scanner useless.BE AWARE that the Microtek scanner that you buy today may not be usable when you upgrade your OS and find out that there is no driver available for your scanner model. It seems they would rather you buy a new scanner than keep drivers available for all operating systems. In addition when I contacted support it took them [7] days to reply to tell me \\"This scanner will not be supported\\". These things cost too much to have to throw them away for such a simple issue.

I can also scan 12 slides at the same time or 24 frames of 35mm film.

This scanner is so slow that the person I hired to do the work BOUGHT A DIFFERENT SCANNER AT HIS OWN EXPENSE TO AVOID USING THIS ONE!!!! EVERY time you start a scan this machine recalibrates itself and that alone takes about 90 seconds. This is true EVEN if you are scanning a series of images that are all the same size, format, type, etc. The scan tech said that he can do 4-5 scans on the EPSON he bought in the same time it takes this one to do ONE! And...over the course of a day of scanning the recalibration, BY ITSELF, adds about an hour to the scanning time. I'd sell my soul to be able to return this thing.When I asked about ways to speed up operation or avoid the recalibration, this is the entire message I got back from Microtek tech support:\\"Unfortunately, this is the way the scanner scans.

We bought this scanner for its negative/slide/photo scanning capabilities. It did all of those things well until the warranty ran out. Then without warning it just stopped functioning. I can turn it on and it sits and makes a high-pitched squealing noise and that's about it. It did great quality scans, but for the price I'd expect a bit more life out of it.As far as actual use goes it has quite a few issues. Its really large and takes up a whole lot of space. The cover doesn't stay up on its own, this is only a problem because a)its really large and b)sometimes you need two hands for setting up the stuff you want to scan. It is very slow. I assumed that that was just what it took to get a high-quality scan, but it is really a pain if you're doing multiple scans.

The downloads are the same instructions included in the box with the scanner when purchased. At the moment all I want to do is to use the scanner as a copier.

We watch him wander from place to place while he spouts his shock and contempt, but it's all very unconvincing. He's not very articulate, apparently had a research budget of about $22.00, and doesn't seem very knowledgeable (at least by BBC standards).

Even if Bendis didn't get his history it shouldn't be held against him. Golden age was my personal favorite Daredevil arc. Buy it. You will not be dissapointed.

The first one I received I pushed the button in to set the time and the button became stuck. I was never able to try it, so after sending it back and receiving another clock I did not have any trouble with the buttons. But soon learned the display does not have a light. So it is a great clock during daylight hours but at night the display is dark. So if you want to see what time it is during the night hours, keep a flash light by it! I will be returning it again for that reason. I was disappointed. Other than those reason the clock was clear and was useful with all of it's information on the display."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Reception","review":"We get no radio control signal with this clock anywhere in our home.

I tried at the office and at home, both inside and outside, but nothing. I live in suburban Detroit, and I have no problems with radio reception whether AM or FM. This clock was close to want I wanted, but without the atomic time feature, I'm returning it and continuing to search."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very cool clock/instrument!","review":"The display is very clear with large characters, and the content is very useful (especially the temperature display).Note that I was only able to get a synchronization radio signal if I put the clock near a window -- I couldn't receive the signal in the location I wanted to put the clock. So I first put the clock near a window for a few minutes to set it, and then moved it to the other location (not near a window, where it could not receive the signal). Interestingly enough, after a couple days at the new location, the clock somehow acquired the signal (you can tell, via the OK indication on the clock). So now everything is working great.

It definitely requires some adult supervision especially for the baking and the rock candy. My son had the most fun making the fizzy drinks and learning how to make soda. Although the recipe for the soda doesn't taste that great it was a lot of fun to make and he did learn all about acids and bases.

There are no descriptions in the instructions that teach about the reactions or chemical processes that are taking place.

No character is thin without being gaunt. No decision is met head on, rather each character is treated like a potential Hamlet, full of indecision and totally overwrought.

All of the books are wonderfully written. World War I was horrific and she brings that home to you as well as politics of the period. Yet the mystery, the Peacemaker, the contrasts between home and the war front are beautifully integrated.

Can a chaplain fire a weapon to save his life, or the lives of others? Should one obey orders if it means certain death and destruction to your men? Do you owe more loyality to your family, your war comrades than you do to the finite rules of the military? The struggles of the characters are vivid and the war becomes a reality as you read.

I must have been crazy but I love anything to do with Whitey Bulger) I decided to finish it. I should not have wasted my time, as well as my money. This guy is not only ridiculous, he's pathetic. Trying to prove his manhood in every line. All he proves is that he got out of prison too soon. The book is poorly written, as dumb as the writer. And I'm feeling just as dumb since I paid good money for this piece of junk. Take my advice and save youself the money. I know too much of the Bulger story to believe this guy had anything to do with Whitey. Whitey was too smart to spend a minute with this jerk. Something is wrong with a big time publisher that would want its name on this lousy book. Shame on you, HarperCollins. This is the last time I'll trust your judgement on a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bottom of the barrel for \\"Southie\\" books","review":"I agree with most of the complaints of the other reviewers here. The constant macho posturing. Not really much info about Bulger in here. Its mostly about the author. I've read many books on this subject and this guy is never mentioned. The first four pages are telling, I think. Bulger has long been rumored to be gay or at least bi-sexual. I suspect the opening of this book may be related to this guy maybe being talked about as one of Whitey's punches. It would explain a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shea contributes to code of cowardice","review":"Kids are dying in Southie to this day, from the city's highest drug overdose rate as well as from suicides. This, no doubt ,is connected to years of trauma and a deadly code of silence. And Shea dares to promote the idea of silence as an honorable way? Mark Wahlberg is as dumb as a bag of hammers, but he should know better than to endorse trash like this. How can Wahlberg claim to work for kids in his youth foundation and at the same time endorse someone who thinks it is manly to keep your mouth shut and watch people die?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corrupt egomaniac rants","review":"I bought this book to learn about the criminal underworld in Boston. This book is just a rant about one guys sleazy life and his twisted loyalties, not to mention, it is very poorly written.

Stick to a more factual book like Carr's for some real info."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Honorable As the Devil","review":"Buying this book supports violence and drug dealing. It's like buying a shirt made by child slaves. Why would anyone want to give him money after what he did to children and families in Southie? We're just telling these guys that crime does pay and that we'll pay for it.I heard a long interview with him talking about how he didn't \\"rat\\" anyone out. What's our definition of rat?

True Mackenzie was touph. In reading Shea's book, one would think he was superman? But in realty, Shea weighed about 140, is about 5'8\\" and skinny. After reading his book, I am convinced he is truly a \\"legend in his own mind.\\" An absolute joke! Howie Carr and Mackenzie have them all beat. Carr's book gives good historical backround while Mackenzie's Street Soldier book, takes you right into the world. Weeks, well let's just say \\" Whitey's [...].\\" In ending, my thought on Shea is he's a stand up idoit for doing 12 years while everybody else enjoyed freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga rocks!!!","review":"Loved the DVD already; mine had gotten tangled in the VCR(that tells you how long I'd had it!!!), and the service was fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Beginners","review":"Although this DVD is marketed to beginners and is included in Gaiam's \\"All Day Yoga for Beginners,\\" this is NOT a beginner's workout. This 20 minute workout moves quickly from pose to pose, using the Yoga name rather than a descriptivephrase, i.e. \\"Begin in mountain pose\\" rather than \\"begin by standing erect.\\" forcing the student to constantly refer to the screen.Many of the poses require more balance and flexibility than a beginner possesses and no intermediate or substitute poses are given. Instructor Suzanne Deason's only concession to beginners is the use of a block to lessen the stretch of some of the poses.I would NOT recommend this to a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content but packaging was a bit misleading","review":"The actual yoga practice on this DVD is beneficial but entirely too brief, in my opinion. the actual practice is only 20 minutes. The cover notes say there is a total of 1 hour and 5 minutes of content. The rest is an interview with Susan Deason and a \\"how to\\" section for using yoga props. This is a very mild practice and using the props is very easy and really doesn't require any extra help. I couldn't care less about an interview with Susan Deason.The \\"special edition\\" DVD I bought was also supposed to include a 60 minute pilates workout with three 45 minute variations. If those on on this DVD, they didn't include a selection button on the DVD menu. A bit disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids beg me to do this with them!","review":"This little gem has made bedtimes easier for the kids, and life a little less hectic for me. I see some of the ratings are a little low, saying it is boring... well, the speaker is calm... so if you're in it for a work-out, look elsewhere. If you want to get yourself in a calm, relaxed mood, this is the one for you.Recently, a family member of mine was murdered. Nights before days in court, I couldn't sleep. This really helped me ease the stress of the day, and calmed me to where I wasn't so stressed out about facing the murderer in court & his family. I know most of you won't have that sort of stress going on in your life. But if it worked for a worry-wart like me, I am sure it'll work for you :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Stress Relief Practice","review":"This yoga practice is perfect to do after you wind down for the day or before heading off to work (I would suggest maybe starting with a few sun salutations to warm up the body before beginning in order to get a good stretch). The cueing is great and even though the practice is only 20 minutes you go through a lot of different poses: Triangle, forward bend, warrior I, downward dog, side stretch. I would reccomend this video to anyone who wants to unwind and relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"I always recommend this practice as a good place for beginners to start","review":"I have had this DVD for years and used it religiously for quite a while when I was first beginning yoga. I always recommend it for beginners who want to try yoga because the poses she uses are not too difficult, and she uses a brick and a strap (good for those who are not very flexible).I still enjoy doing this DVD now, from time to time, and feel very relaxed and refreshed - although I find it is not challenging enough for me anymore. But if you are looking for a good introduction to yoga, I recommend this DVD highly. Another good DVD for beginners is AM/PM yoga with Rodney Yee and Patricia Waldon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Mystic and a treasure of a book","review":"This was one of the most eye opening books I ever read.

My interest was easily maintained throughout; and this is not a small book.Initially, descriptions of the Depression and who handled it and how, are very well described. Roosevelt comes out shining of course.Thence the later years when he introduced measures to handle the massive unemployment, ending in the denouement of the Second World War and a vindication of his policies, really make some aspects of the book read like a thriller.A relatively light read and well worth looking into for the average guy who likes to know 'what went on' in them thar years.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A monumental historical work.","review":"Professor Kennedy has given us a monumental work on a critical period in the history of the United states and the world. Kennedy displays an intuitve understanding of the causes of the great depression. He gives us a new and positive inter- pretation of Herbert Hoover. In Kennedy's view the ''Great Engineer'' is a closet liberal who paved the way for the new deal. Kennedy clearly is an admirer of Franklin Roosevelt,but is not blind to his hero's shortcomings. The author frankly admits that the new deal did not end the depression and that during WWII Roosevelt was decieved by Joseph Stalin. Kennedy gives a superb account of the political radicalism of the thirties complete with unforgetable portraits of Huey Long and Father Coughlin. The account of the second world war also rises to the occassion. I found this book to be a fascinating read and I highly reccomend it. Thank you Professor Kennedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable view-from-a-distance.","review":"The first section on the Depression was for me a long-needed uncombing of all the New Deal efforts to mitigate the trauma the country was experiencing. It also provided a good summary of the background of the event itself. I was only a boy at the time (aged 4 to 14) so my memories have always been a bit confused. My recollection of the War is far more distinct - I was in the Aleutians on V-J Day - so that part of the book was less revealing. The book has also made the individuals involved much more three-dimensional to me. I was especially interested in the sympathy shown Herbert Hoover. It is clear his actions reflected the conventional thinking of the time: a) If you're in trouble it's your own fault, and b) if necessary, private charities, not the government, will see you through. He hadn't a clue. (To quote an old Navy buddy in another connection, \\"It was like pissing up a fire hose,\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book on the depression","review":"This is a wonderfully written history of the Depression and WWII. It is especially good on the Depression with multiple new insights into the US (many applicable to the current credit crisis). The WWII section treads on more well known history.

Roosevelt the mental lightweight causes the Great Depression before he becomes president, is responsible for World War II with his weak foreign policy, and blunders through economic recovery with the New Deal. The hero is the misunderstood economic genius Herbert Hoover, whose policies later adopted by Roosevelt ultimately saves our nation. All of this wonderfully supported by the commentaries of Roosevelt's political enemies. This book is laughable and hopefully will not be taken seriously by anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly narrow","review":"After reading David Walker Howe's excellent \\"What God Has Wrought: The Transformation of America, 18-15-1848\\" I begin looking at the other books in the Oxford History of the United States series. I saw David Kennedy's \\"Freedom from Fear\\" and assumed that it would be as well-written, broad and interesting as Howe's book. Big mistake!In spite of its subtitle \\"The American People in Depression and War: 1929-1945\\" Kennedy's book is mainly a history of the Roosevelt administration, its policies, and politics and a military history of World War II. As far as a history of the American people, there is very little of the social or cultural history that made Howe's book so interesting.As far as the political and military history of the Roosevelt administration, the writing is tedious, although I really don't find Kennedy to be overly biased one way or another.Overall a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too negative on Roosevelt and the \\"New Deal\\"","review":"I know it is chic to resite the non-accomplishments of past or current world leaders, but this is too much. For 362 pages we read that Roosevelt did nothing right, that he careened from crisis to crisis, never did anything than had any effect on the economic problems of the times, did nothing for Labor or Farming, attacked Business on every possible occation, destroyed the Military, lied to the American People to win re-election in 1936, tried to destroy the Supreme Court, etc. It is hard to find anything that the author thinks Roosevelt did right!We then read 18 pages on how great and meaningful the results of the New Deal were and how they not only changed the country, but saved democracy as we know it!I can't wait to find out how Roosevelt lost the Second World War.

I have worked in death and dying for 27 years, and this album is now my favorite for beautifully expressing grief. Composing these works after the loss of her dearly beloved husband, as well as her own battle with cancer, Ms. Chapman poignantly captured the depths of loss, memories, the struggle to go on, and the hope of meeting again. When my best friend died last year, I put on this album whenever I needed a good cry. And oh, how it worked. Capturing all these incredibly intimate emotions without falling into a maudlin or self-pitying trench is truly a magnificent feat. I am grateful to the artist for sharing her journey and recommend the purchase of this CD whole-heartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"At her best","review":"I can always count on liking some of the cuts on any of her albums, but this one is a jewel all the way.

Special mention to the sparse beauty of NO ONE KNOWS BUT YOU and the sweeping simplicity of the emotional SAY GOODNIGHT. HAPPY GIRL and HEADSUP FOR THE WRECKING BALL while decent up-tempo tunes seem out of place.Chapman is a superb songwriter and possesses a clear, passionate voice and the fact that many reviewers have found this album therapeutic attests to her musical impact.

I called the local NBC affiliate and could get no information. When the episode aired again last night, I found other ER junkies online and they identified Beth Neilsen Chapman for me. I especially love her tender ballads; they remind me of another favorite artist, Mary Chapin Carpenter. The title track, Sand and Water, speaks for my heart since I have lost my mother to cancer, my husband to AIDS and my baby daughter to meningitis and myocarditis.

James Levine, Libor Pesek, Neeme Jarvi, and Charles Mackerras have turned in good performances of \\"Ma Vlast\\" as well that are worth checking out.The audio quality, however, is excellent. This recording has also been released as a hybrid SACD. I imagine that sound is unbelievable in surround sound.This is a good overall interpretation and performance, but it wouldn't be my first choice for this piece.

This LSO Live release of Smetana's Ma Vlast features a genial, often energized reading from Sir Colin Davis, one of his most buoyant recent efforts. But it's the great sonics that are the star. Even without surround sound SACD, this CD has great impact, and the marvelous oloists of the LSO are caught close up for maximum color and panache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not even good enough for SACD?","review":"In fact, there IS an SACD disc of this performance (currently listed as No.82 by Amazon for some unknown reason), and the many beauties of this wonderful performance deserves nothing less.Do give it a try.

Toddlerese, and the Fast Food Rule have worked well for gaining the attention of my tantruming 28 month old. In my opinion, the book is too repetitive. The video and CD are far more clearly to the point and very helpful in teaching more effective communication skills. For a compatible book with hundreds of additional quick read discipline suggestions for parents of toddlers and preschoolers, I highly recommend THE POCKET PARENT by Gail Reichlin.

The stories by Barbara Johnson, Therese Szymanski, and Julia Watts were romantic and erotic and everything I hoped they would be. I'm not big on the butch/femme match up, I find it to be cliche, so I wasn't sure if I'd like \\"A Butch in Fairy Tale Land,\\" by Therese Szymanski, but I did. It wasn't my favorite, though. I think my favorite was Barbara Johnson's \\"Charlotte of Hessen,\\" with a close second being Julia Watts' \\"La Belle Rose.\\" The only story I didn't like was the final one, Karin Kallmaker's \\"A Fish Out of Water.\\" I found it to be almost scary it was so depressing. No romance happened until the final pages of the story and the sex scenes were not sexy but weird.

I believe that they have done more for the field of landscape design than anyone for decades previously. Their extensive and creative use of ornamental grasses and perennials has transformed garden design in this country. Their gardens in and around Washington DC area are like no others. This is really contemporary design with an emphasis on the year round beauty of all plants. The book is by far the BEST GARDEN BOOK YOU WILL EVER OWN. The photography is also the best of any garden book I have ever seen (see also Ken Druse). I cannot say enough about these two landscape architect or the remarkable book.

If you're interested in more than armchair theory and the Typhonian current appeals to you, get this book and put it into practice. You will be greatly rewarded for your effort.

It's not thermostat controlled on low (low is noisy enough, but on high it's much worse), the DVR/TV remote changes the temperature and the timer settings whenever the DVR/TV remote is used & the display light goes off within seconds so it impossible to tell what the heater is doing.

However, it DID NOT prevent itself from overheating and melted its front panel face, meaning its buttons got fused to the face and became non-pressable.

As a complete beginner who will soon spend a year in semi-rural Tamil Nadu, I want a book that will get me up to speed as soon as possible. Hart's book is very good for learning to read. Unfortunately, a lot of the basic vocabulary (like \\"how are you?\\") is used only by Brahmins. It wouldn't be a problem if Hart specifically noted this, and also gave alternate phrases, but she doesn't. Although I'm a Brahmin, I want to be able to communicate with all types of people without giving offense. So, I ultimately decided to go with the Asher books. And, unlike the reviewer of Asher's CDs who found that the speakers spoke too fast, I think they are very good at approximating native speech patterns. However, the Asher book and CD should be used in conjunction -- which is not clear from the Amazon page.

I normally use Medela or Lansinoh, but these were all that I could find in a pinch, and I had a coupon. They are definately not worth the money, even with the coupon.

For the first few months they seemed to work great, but the last 2 boxes I bought leak when they are thawed. I'm not sure if Gerber changed the bags or what, but I'd recommend spending more for Lansinoh bags which also have a zip lock closure (that is much easier to open) and seem much less flimsy. It's definitely worth the money to avoid wasting even one bag of milk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lansinoh Bags Are Better","review":"I normally buy the Lansinoh brand storage bags. I decided to try the Gerber ones because they were cheaper. Its really hard to right on them with a ball point pen. You're not supposed to write on it with a sharpie because there's a chance of contamination. The ziploc seal on two of the twenty five bags was not connected on one side. I also found them harder to pour milk out of. I like the Lansinoh ones because they have two ziploc seals to insure that no milk gets out. They are easier to write on, AND the part you write on is above the seals. I have never had a dysfunctional bag with the Lansinoh ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping they won't leak now","review":"I bought a box of these last week; so far 2 out of 5 bags broke when I tried to open them! To open the bags it says to pull gently below the zipper - the zipper part detached from the plastic bag; on the other the plastic tore.

I'm looking for another brand now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bags","review":"I used these bags for my first baby 2 years ago and will do it again for my new little girl. I am a physician-in-training therefore had to go back to work when the baby was only 4 weeks old. I had to work many 36 hour shifts therefore I essentially lived on pumping. I froze lots of these bags for one whole year and never had any problems. I did not directly write on the bags, but rather I put the same day's milk in a large freezer bag and labeled it. They are just right for my budget and the fastest/easiest for my busy schedule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"From the start, I had to express my milk. When I started to freeze the milk for future use, I tried these because they were a little cheaper then the Medela storage bags. Now that I've started to use my frozen milk, the bags have a hole and has caused my milk to leak out. Of course, I had to throw the whole bag out because I didn't want to take a chance of something being in my milk & then passing it on to my son. To say the least, we didn't really want to start formula until April 04 and as of the end of Jan, he is on part formula so I can conserve the rest of the milk that I have. Don't make the same mistake that I have especially if you had to work as hard as I did to give my son the best. Hope this helps you out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the bag... hated the writting space","review":"It would have received a 5 star but I hate the spot where you write the name, date and time. There is nothing to write on except the plastic. Trying to get a pen to even leave a mark is hard. Everytime I go to mark the bag I am afraid that I am going to poke thru and destroy that bag. Overall, if you are not going to be worrying about marking it with the date and time then don't worry about it.

I am very disappointed as I have worked hard every day in order to pump milk. I read similar reviews regarding the leaking but figured it couldn't happen with every bag, however sadly I am wrong.

Thanks Polder....This is a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted","review":"I had used my mother in-law's Polder 2 step ladder before. The design on this one had been updated a little. This ladder is light weight because of the aluminum extrusion used for its construction, you can haul it around with just one hand.

I've met drummers who've been playing drums for 10 or more years, and have yet bothered to learn how to sight read. As a result, they've either struggled playing in a big band or have simply quit playing all together. To play in such a band or in a studio (for that matter), knowing how to read a chart and not knowing can mean the difference between getting paid to play, or NOT.Although this is an advanced book, it is essential in familiarizing yourself with odd time groupings - as it is quite common with 20th Century music. The Reading in 4/4 Time book is a prerequisite and should be worked with before attempting this one. Also, a metronome that has 3+2, 2+3, 4+3, etc., groupings is recommended. If there is anything that I've learned in my so-few years of experience, is that it is not about how long you've been playing, but how much you've put into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"A brilliant television series, unfortunately currently the only season available on DVD.

It points out the flaws in a system where entities that have specific mutual interest in a particular case don't always communicate well and don't listen to their \\"gut\\" feelings about a case. The book underplays the role of the California Department of Insurance Fraud Bureau and the hard work of the Assistant District Attorney, Al MacKenzie. It shows how vulnerable an overburdened system is to abuse and fraud. But for the checks and balances of the public and private sector, this crime would not only have been unsolved, but would never have been discovered in the first place. By the way, since the book was written, all three suspects in the murder for insurance money have been captured, tried and convicted. Two of them received life without parole, while the third received 25 to life.

Like the rest of you, I have thoroughly enjoyed the previous books in this serie about the worlds toughest scimitar-slinger and his gang of monster-bashing avengers.However, this book is progressing so slowly that now I have given up! I have been trying to finish it for as long as I can remember, because I really want to get on to the next RAS book.

While Drizzt's adventures are usually fast-moving and hopeful, Wulfgar's travels are an unending moral and emotional strain.Wulfgar has lost his wits, his friends, and his warhammer. He is an accused murderer, a highwayman, and a violent drunk. In all, the barbarian's tale is much more mature than most of Salvatore's Forgotten Realms work. For anyone who wants to see Wulfgar transform from a powerful-but-generic fighter to a deep, emotional character, this is a great read. Wulfgar, by the end, has nearly as deep a character as the famous dark elf who trained him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it!","review":"I like Salvatore stories, so I ran and bought this piece of romantic crap. Ok, the psicological problems of Wulfgar is a very interesting plot, but the romantic crap of lord Auckney is sooooo boring and the plot is soooooo slow. The good thing, Wulfgar loses Aegis-fang, the bad thing the stupid pink novel that salvatore wanted to share!!!. Better to save your money and ask for borrow it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"Salvatore writes a more believable character! It's basically the story of Wulfgar's redemption... and Spine starts out kind of slowly, but picks up eventually. The story's conclusion is better than expected, and sets up the next installment nicely. Wulfgar's transformation in this story is so well-written that the reader can easily relate to his turmoil, unlike Drizzt's character that has become almost condescending in his soap-box diary entries. If Salvatore can't come up with any more ways to develop the dark elf, then it's time to get rid of the character before he becomes as stale and one-dimensional as Cattie-brie has always been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"A story without Drizzt. Less than half of the book on Wulfgar. The other half on some love-struck no-name prince we don't want to read about. I'm glad I didn't buy it and just borrowed it from a friend. Even free reading, it wasn't that worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok What happend to Salvatore and who wrote this trash","review":"This is bar none the worst book that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. I was a huge fan of all of the other books in this series but in this one he falls Waaaaay short. If I had to compare this book to a movie it would be plan 9 from outer space but even that dismal bomb of a movie does not quite express how I feel about this title, which should have been burned before it was ever published. This book was bad bad bad my only regret about this review is that I can not give this book a rating any lower than 1 star. And for the ending I all I can say is Bob you need to put that pipe down.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice read","review":"Not all foes can be vanquished with his mighty Aegis-Fang. This truth Wulfgar learns the hard way. Our favorite barbarian falls to new lows as he goes from hero to barfly. Still trying to recover from his ordeal at the hands of Errtu, Wulfgar hides behind the bottle rather than face his problems.Wulfgar finds solace in the bed of Delly, a barmaid who falls for the tormented big guy. Though it does make things interesting in the future when Wulfgar and Cattie-brie meet again in the future.A good book, though this should not be a surprise from the likes of Salvatore. A bit drawn out at parts but still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Awaited Story","review":"Salvatore finally writes a story on a character more interesting than the now predictable Drizzt. If you're a big Wulfgar fan, who is sick of hearing about Drizzt, this book is for you. It is a great story told in the classic Salvatore style that made the Icewind Dale heroes perhaps the most popular characters in the Forgotten Realms saga. Spine of the World gives more life, and emotion to the character Salvatore initially intended to be his main hero in the Icewind Dale Trilogy, and once you read the book you will almost wonder why he changed his mind. I for one can't wait for Salvatores next installment in the story of the Icewind Dale heroes (most especially Wulfgar, and Morik)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good one...","review":"This book is really good, one his better ones I'd say. This story focuses on Wulfgar and (seperatly) a girl named Meralda. Drizzt and co. are not in it, save Drizzt's essays. I noticed mixed reviews on this book which is understandable. This is a very different book for Salvatore and I for one loved it, especially the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I thought that it was a pretty good read. This is definitely different than other RAS books within the series. It had a slow start; but that is probably due to the fact that I am too accustomed to the fast paced starts of Drizzt and pals. The ending was pretty good. Left a nice opening for sequels. And like everyone esle who reads RAS, I can't wait for the next book in line. I hope RAS writes it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salvatore falls as far as Wulfgar","review":"Salvatore has fallen to a point I thought he never could. After reading The Spine of the World the 1ST! day it came out, I couldn't believe I had even read it at all. Wulfgar is a sorry excuse for a man and he somehow gets ALL better in the end. The tie-in between the two stories is completely lame! None of it has anything in common, it's as if he took two completely different storie, and had 5 minutes to tie tie them togeher. I was completely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salvatore falls in his latest book.","review":"I can't believe what Salvatore has done, The Spine of the World lacked everything that all of Salvatore's other books have.. character! There is no depth in the stories. He somehow combines two completely different stories together, with an ending that makes you say...Huh! This is the only book in which Salvatore lacks that wonderful depth of character that he puts in all his others books. Please Salvatore, bring back Drizzt and the others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"What a dissapointment. I have read EVERYTHING Mr. Salvatore has written and was always happy. Until now.

I kept wishing that Wulfgar would just die (again). And half the book is about a love triangle between 2 peasants and a petty lord. What a waste of time. Unlike Salvatore's other magnificent novels I couldn't wait for this one to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someday","review":"Again Salvatore gives us an average Drizzt type book. The deveolpment of Wulfgar is excellent however way too much effort and time was spent on the peasant girl and her struggles. I personally cared not at all what happened to her, one way or the other. Salvatore needs to put more drama and hardship in his Drizzt type novels in order make the good times seem better. He succeeded in doing this in his Demon Wars series, but I feel, has not done it in this series since the Legacy. Overall a good read if you like Salvatore, but he can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next installment please.","review":"Good book...Now Wulfgar has a reason to stop drinking and get on with his life.

Being a forgotten releams fan, i went ahead and brought the book. Didn't regret it one little bit. Although the first several pages are immersed in self pity by wulfgar, the story picks up and the climactic finish is good.

Seriously, I know a few people who hated this book and recommend not reading it at all. Having read everything before it, I felt I had to make up my own mind and I ignored my friends and read it anyway.I'm glad I did. I understand why some people are turned off by this book. It's about Wulfgar, it has a love story, there's no Drizzt. But if you continue reading the series, I feel what you learn about Wulfgar in this book is important, not to mention the characters that are introduced here that are seen later.Oh, and Morik the Rogue is worth the price of admission himself!-Ed Caggiani, Translator ofTracks and Horizons: 26 Countries on a Motorcycle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite one so far","review":"In my opinion, this is the best Salvatore book i've read so far. I've been going through his whole Forgotten Realms series, and I enjoyed reading this one the most. Although Drizzt Do'Urden is a great character, his adventures were starting to get tired. I was a little unsure of how interesting a story could be being based around Wulfgar. I usually found him pretty boring, he just didn't appeal to me at all. Don't be fooled if you felt the same way. He's gone through alot of changes and this story tells the tale of how he survives the city of Luskan (and other locations) as a bar bouncer. I really feel this is the most intelligent Salvatore book that I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"Fantasy serves a unique purpose in the realm of fiction. They allow the reader to experience mind numbing action while being able to keep our day jobs. This novel was a 300 page sob fest by Wulfgar. Personally this book was so bad that only 100 pages into it I was forced to begin skipping the parts about the random peasant girl. If you are in any way a fan of drittz novels skip this one. If you do not it will be a 25$ dollar mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":".......","review":"Even though Wulfgar isn't my most favorite character, but I know he is written a little more differently then any other Barbarian I've ever read before. But still, I do get a little bored when I do read about him. Don't get me wrong, he does have that intense level that I really will get into reading more, but then he quickly becomes flat for me. There were two reasons for me to buy this book (1)I wanted to give this character more of a chance since he has been seperated from his friends & (2)Heck I don't want to break up a set of a fantastic series ever.But to sum how I really felt about this book it was just a big snore for me.Sorry to any Wulfgar fans but he is best in his pack of friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"Salvatore Fans - SKIP THIS ONE","review":"Having read the whole Drizzt saga, and enjoyed it, I can safely say this book is a complete waste of time. Wulfgar was never a favorite of mine, so a whole book dedicated to this boring fellow was a real snore.It is pretty clear that Mr. Salvatore is trying to spin him off into his own series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A romantic crap","review":"I am a great fan of Salvatore.I mean,he is the guy who created Drizzt Do Urden and the writer of many of my favorite novels.So i ran and bought Spine of the World the same day it got out.Howevwer i was totally dissapointed by this foolish book.It has absolutely no action,the half of it being a silly romantic story(the poor girl who loves the poor boy but has to marry the rich nobleman) and the other half a thorough description of Wulfgar and his psychologic problems.I definetely don's recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Spine of the World is a waste of money & time","review":"I'm a loyal fan of this series, but was greatly disappointed with this book. A whole novel on romance, and Wulgar's boring problems. Come on!!! I just hope that Salvatore writes a better book than this one, cause I ready to never ready one of his novels again. I was so bored, that I almost gave up half way through the novel. Basically, you should avoid this novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best....","review":"This book is great... this one is more serious then the others books of the series. it's more like the \\"Demon\\" series then the forgotten realm. This book is more for adult and surely not for children. I think it's why some peoples give bad review. If you love great story with surprising ending you will love it. But if you are the kind to like only action (\\"à la\\" Executionner) and you think that story is just a think to slow down the action stay far from Spine of the World because the strong side of Spine of the world is his great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Was Terrible!","review":"I love Drizzit's books but this was horrible. It's only about a drunken hagard Wulfgar! Were is Drizzit and the rest of the gang! What about the Christal Shard and Jarxale come on. I like Salvatore but he can do better than this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of time","review":"The author must of been in a hurry to finish this one, or needed to buy another home somewhere-- This book is suppose to be about Wulfgar and the inner trails he faces. Did we really learn anything new about this then from the previous book? Did he come to a self-relazation? He just decided to stop drinking one day, and poof, all better. What was the story of the peasent girl about? That was the lamest tie-in at the end I have read. It was like he didn't have enough interesting things to say about Wulfgar and made up another story that really had nothing to do with anything, and then tied it together at the very end of the book. I am hoping that there will be some more time spent on the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid Love Story","review":"I am a big fan of Salvatore and have enjoyed almost every Dark Elf book as well as the Cleric and Dragon's Dagger series. However, I was none too enthused with this book and it took me a great deal of time to read. I barely glossed over anything having to do with Jaka and I was disappointed with the absence of Drizzt, I kept expected him to pop up especially since exerpts from his journal were used. I also found Wulfgar's struggles with alcoholism, flashbacks and wavering moral fortitude somewhat forced and his continuing escapes from \\"justice\\" with no gratitude for those who helped him tiring. I will not read this book again and if anyone wants to buy it I'll sell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Wulfgar a chance....","review":"I am so sick of hearing \\"Kill off Wulfgar.\\" This book has proven to me that Salvatore can write a story about a hero who is not perfect. I have loved all of his books to this date - and have read all of them.Of course none of you want to hear about Wulfgar. His character development from the start has always been very shallow. Now, finally, we have a deep personality to give to him. He has been the tag-along to Drizzt for his whole life and now we get to read stories about him and what makes him tick. As much as I love Drizzt he has not suffered near as much as Wulfgar in life. Have some sympathy for the poor guy. Salvatore - keep up the great work! Can't wait to hear more about Wulfgar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy sh**! What's this book for!","review":"What a dissapointment. I knew things would go downhill after Wulfgar returned from the dead, a really crappy idea. I think, if Errtu so desperately needed a prisoner, it should have been Zaknafain. At least that guy was cool. Drizzt was missing a lot. And Salvatore, with this new Wulfgar, SO breaks character. ANYWAY, just skip this book, people. Unless you like sappy romance crap, don't do this to yourselves. I'm sorry I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just wait","review":"The beginning of this book is painful, expecially if you didn't like Wulfgar before. But don't give up on it. The last part of the book is simply amazing and will make your heart sing. You just have to push through the parts where you just want to smack Wulfgar across the face. Believe me, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drizzt was not missed as much as I thought he would be.","review":"This book is a great work for Salvatore. I've read all of the other dark elf books. This too is a great read!!! Don't pass it up because Drizzt is not in it!!! Wulfgar struggles with his friends' influences throughout and the side story paints a true picture of medievel social classes. Morik is wonderful! He could be compared to Jarlaxle as a great character. New characters are a reprieve for the author and the reader. And for those love story addicts like myself, Wulfgar finally admits to himself that Cattibrie belongs to Drizzt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to it R.A.!","review":"This book gets 5 stars and the joy of knowing that the next book will feature that dynamic duo of villians: Entreri and Jarlaxle!

This is a great book all the way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always, Salvatore can't write a bad one in this series.","review":"I find Drizzts journals one of the most enjoyable parts of the stories so I will try not to lament his absence. Also I feel Catti-brie enhances Drizzts persona. It is how he relates to her and the other characters that make him one of fictions greatest spiritual and emotional heroes. Salvatores knowledge of a variety of subjects and delightful outlook on human(and elven)nature make the series a serendipity among main stream entertainment. There is a book for almost any mood and will get you through the worst and best of times. The fight scenes are superbly choreographed, but are the most fun brought to life by the fighter and friend we see mirrored in ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad all in all a good book","review":"Well I was a bit annoyed that Drizzt wasn't in this book but after seeing what Wulfgar had to go through it made the book a lot more interesting. The peasent girl story was an interesting distraction from what was becoming the typical Wulfgar getting drunk and fighting. All in all it was a good book and a great addition to the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broad attempt, mediocre delivery","review":"Intial chapters on the history of writing as a techonlogy were captivating.

We bought all the DVDs that were available a few years ago, so we were really excited to see more episodes available! Our son loves it, and our daughter is almost 7 and still loves it. It's so much better than some of the stuff that's on TV for kids now--Disney, especially. And the best part is that we actually get a kick out of it, too, so it's not a horrible thing to deal with like some kids' shows are.

I only have two complaints: 1. he includes the typical baseless conjecture about the ministry of women in the early Church and 2. once the book gets out of the early Church, the author focuses almost exclusively on the West; the only time the East is mentioned after about AD 400 is in its relationship with the West. Outside of those two relatively minor complaints, though, this book was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Church History","review":"The Story of Christianity is a very readable account of the events and developments that shaped the Christian Church.It is concise and full of extremely interesting history from writers throughout the ages who have played a vital part in the development of the early Church.

However enough is related to make the history of the Church sit within the framework of the political and social events of the time.I would certainly recommend this book for those who have little or no knowledge in Church history.

This book is a must have if you want to know the foundation of the Christian church. I recommend this book to lay leaders and pastors alike.

The plot was lame and the acting even more so. Except for Micheal York who died ten minutes into the film anyhow. What a bummer.Unless overused jokes tickle your funny bone, I don't think this one is up your alley.

The first time was about 6 months in the ownship. Belkin replace it with a new one and postal cost out of my own pocket. The 2nd time was last week (warrany expired), the same old problem.

I followed every step in the setup and I'm sure I didn't do anything wrong. Definitely do not choose this if you need it for home office, because it is extremely unreliable.

The included software repeatedly failed to properly configure the router. The manual was poorly written and Belkin's website was of no use for my particular problems. I will acknowledge that the Belkin technial support representative was knowledgeable and helpful. The day after I had the router set up and running it died on me. After contacting Belkin technical support again and running some diagnostic tests, the tech support representative came to the conclusion that the device was not functioning properly and I should return it to Belkin for a replacement. Instead, I returned the device to the store and purchased a slightly more expensive router from Linksys (model BEFSR41). That router was a snap to set up - no need to contact technical support. In sum, the Belkin router was a disappointment - I can't recommend it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the market bar none","review":"I have a belkin router here at my home and needed another router for a family member and with out a doubt in my mind i chose Belkin.

The program is pithy enough for musicians, and accessible enough for music lovers. A very intelligent and entertaining piece of work; beautifully filmed and edited.As a bonus, we get full performance versions of excerpts from \\"The Firebird\\" (beautifully played!) as well as the complete \\"Rite of Spring\\". The performance is very exciting; I am familiar with at least 4 other recordings of this piece, and sections here are taken faster than I've heard before-but never sound too fast. The energy and joy of the the conducting brings out the best of this incredible piece. This performance has become my favorite. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding - simply outstanding.","review":"Michael Tilson Thomas does a great job in describing the background of the piece, the history of its creation, and the cultural movements going on at the time. Then there is an extended section where he dissects the piece (with help from members of his orchestra), highlighting key phrases and sections, in some cases illustrating with piano the structure and organization -- but never too technical (only mentions chords or notes by name about a half-dozen times).The performance of a portion of the Firebird is a nice addition to warm you up for the main course: The Rite of Spring. The sound is great...the percussion particularly comes alive and it's not too brassy.The camera work during the performance is interesting too. There are an awful lot of cuts from performer to performer, but it fits the piece. It might be just me, but it seems that there are a couple of problems with picture-to-sound sync, but nothing too terrible.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Score: Revolutions in Music - Stravinsky's Rite Of Spring","review":"What can I say this DVD is absolutely remarkable.

Don't get me wrong, I am even a fan of techno and electronica, but these variations are loud and too industrial for my tastes. I admit I bought this single without hearing the originals, but it's really the first Depeche disc I've been so unhappy about.

Thomas Bernhard sets his self-consciously Kafkaesque fantasy with the journeying of a father-physician and his son as they encounter a number of grotesque patients throughout the wooded terrain. The main section (or Gargoyle if you life), involves an extended monologue with a Prince who is losing his dynasty and his mind. The book revolves around these passages, and yet they are infuriatingly repetitive (not in the deepening way Bernhard normally employs). For all its oddities, this novel is a lesser achievement from a remarkable prose stylist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising Story of John Paul Jones","review":"All too often we only have a romantizied version of historical figures who usually are much more complicated.

This means there are only 60 doses in the bottle making it twice as expensive.I missed the fine print under \\"Product Features\\" and only read the Ingredients which does not specify that it takes 2 Softgels to get the listed EPA 720mg and DHA 480mg.

Other tracks include \\"Appreciation\\", \\"My Guy\\", \\"Just Can't Stay Away\\" and \\"Don't Do Me This Way\\".The only complaint I have about this round of Universal reissues is that many of them, including this title, were mastered from a vinly source!

What I wanted was stories about guiding sports through days of fishing. There is only brief mentions of this activity. The bulk of what is discussed is just his sad excuse for living. It's a lonely business and one in which he makes dumb decision after dumb decision. As it was, there was just not enough fishing to make me love this one.

There is also a brief history of her life which I found interesting to read, including her first husband (which is how she got the name Benetar), and the fact her monther was an opera singer.The other thing I took away from this album is a much greater appreciation for her talent.

Even today it's so great to hear \\"We Belong\\", \\"Shadows Of The Night\\", \\"Hell Is For Children\\", and \\"We Live For Love\\". And now they all sound even better.

He sings beautifully live(unlike many singers today), exudes confidence and sensuality on stage and has a very down to earth personality. Women were going crazy(I was leading the pack) and men were busy taking mental notes on the finer points to romancing a woman. Eric's voice captivated all of us.

His lyrics are real and endearing. Anyone looking for some true R&B; music thats creative, funky and real, I suggest you pick it up!

I love this one! The classics Femininity, Spiritual Thang, I'll Be There, and Let's Stay Together remain unmatched to this day.

This is amateurish muzak dressed up with undeserved hype. The center-stage guitar-playing woman sat like she was dead, or maybe we were supposed to think she was concentrating artistically on her cozmic music. I doubt it. The long, tall dude with 1970's hippy hair chortled morbidly about the band as if there was something phenomenal going on - if there was, it was just in his head.The \\"psychedelic\\" touches like the deeply processed sax blowing was just shtick, there was no real finesse in the playing.A very, very unpleasant experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"Please stop calling Espers a folk band.

Not a lot of faith there if you ask me...As for the adventure part : she gets kidnapped, almost killed, travels the desert (sometimes by foot) with this perfect stranger, all of this because of a amulet, a curse and buried treasure. The hero is like a bad penny. He always turns up even in the most unlikely situations.I appreciate that the christian message of putting your life in God's hands was the mission of the book. Fine.

It had the range to tighten the caliper bolts to the wheel lug nuts. I have never owned a torque wrench before, so had no base to compare it to, but it did all that I wanted it to. The minus 1 star is for the documentation showing a different graduation scale than is actually on the wrench. Also, it is a little tight, when adjusting it up around the 100# region. I suspect that it should tighten up somewhat, since you are putting quite a force on the interior workings at this setting. I would have rated it 4.5, but 4 or 5 is all you get. I think Amazon should have a comment line, next to the start ratings, so people can suggest their desired rating, even if the X.Y rating does not show in the overall average.The wrench is very sturdy, and when torque is reached, the click is very distinct.

Thats why I bought this album. His other solo albums are great, but \\"Yin Yang\\", I listened to it twice, and hid it away for ever. If your looking for the funky sound of the Flecktones, check out \\"Live Art,\\" this isn't worth your money. I was only disappointed when I heard it. It's clear his talent is there but the music didn't fit my taste. He even trys to dub his daughter's voice into a song to making it sound like she raps.

The fact is they are all black African women. Page after page of lush color images of these strikingly beautiful women posing in landscapes that would be incredible images even without them in the shot, and in various stages of undress, is almost a sensory overload! To say Mr. Ommer knows beauty when he sees it is completely accurate. He not only knows beauty, he has the ability to photograph it in such a way as to bring it out so that you know you are looking at something very special.

While this album does not quite capture the intensity of a live Thunderlip show, it is an excellent rock album - not afraid to be loud and daring.

Ironing those lovely linen napkins needn't trouble you. Make it part of the rituals. Iron on rainy days while you listen to lovely music. No problem! An added bonus is the suggestion for spending hours in bed while you drink tea, write letters and read.

It is useful as a very basic beginning to understanding Kung Fu. The Horse Stance shown on page 39 looks too wide for comfort. Most other texts on the subject recommend a horse stance \\"slightly wider than shoulder width.\\" I don't recommend not reading this book, but I prefer David Chow's \\"Kung Fu\\" and Dr. Jwing-Ming's \\"Shaolin Long Fist Kung Fu\\". Personally, I'm a student of Ed Parker's Kenpo Karate, which is derived from the ancient Martial Art of Kung Fu. This is a great way to buy books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Movie and Series","review":"I watched this whole series. Was totally engrossed in the story as well as the characters. What a great performance by Yi Fei. Also her lover. The film itself was good, with nothing bad sticking out in terms of CGI or disc errors. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes Kung Fu as well as romantic love stories. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"Very disappointed. There was no options for English sub-titles in spite of product discription saying there was. The first Disc was defective would not play in any of my DVD players. The other Disc played but did not offer a set up option. Could not enjoy it since I don't understand Cantonese. Thought of sending it back, but not worth the time effort or aggrevation. So I just threw it in the garbage.

This fact doesn't in any way stop me from learning and applying the great life and career skills from a woman who obviously has much to say, the bodacious attitude to deliver the message and the credentials to back it all up.I am impressed with Mary Foley and her voice of clarity in the core of a strong empowering message. Women would be wise to listen. Bodacious! provides new meaning and a refreshing context for life and career. Men would also be wise to take note and embrace the message for themselves and the women in their lives. I know I will share this with all the important ones in my life and career.

Helping women to continue taking a stand, being in charge of their lives, is what Mary really is successful in relaying. Mary's enery is contagious in this book. I gave it to my daughter when she started in the business world and would highly recommendothers follow suit. Living the color of your nail polish can only be a good thing! BODACIOUS is catching!

The measurements listed are precise so you may want to be sure you take that into consideration before purchasing. I find it a bit heavy and bulky even when empty. If youre planning on using it to travel a lot it may be a bit cumbersome. The great thing about this product is that it has plenty of room for your items to include your makeup brushes and other larger items. There are 3 separate sliding trays inside that are very roomy however it forces the Cosmetic Train to tilt when fully extended. Overall this item fits my specific needs so I am pretty happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More B2B, Less DOD","review":"As mentioned in another review, this book is very heavily oriented toward the government sector. The basic concepts of course apply to B2B suppliers as well, but it is difficult and frustrating to constantly have to stretch to relate the concepts and techniques to the private sector. My biggest complaint is the author's constant use of abbreviations and acronyms. I found myself having to keep a running glossary of his terms (MTBF, EPR, LSC, to mention a few) just to understand what he was talking about. In general, it is a good book for gaining a basic understanding of supplier warranties, but don't expect it to give you a lot of insight into developing your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible reception","review":"This phone is cheap, and you get what you pay for.

Do you really want your kid to read this one?","review":"The first half of this book is a prolonged, super-negative anti-baby tirade. Sure, we as adults can see the reality behind Shirley's jealous rants, but can most small children, who are theoretically the target audience here? I think this book indulges in dark, negative emotions, and the resolution is dramatically weak, so the message is unlikely to get through to the kids who need it. I would NOT recommend this book as a tool to work through sibling rivalries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cussler, watch out. You have a rival.","review":"This thoroughly entertaining book is very much in the Dirk Pitt mold. Complete with a sidekick and underwater exploring, not to mention women! Of course, as a Cussler fan, that's a formula that works for me. Well written, a fast read, and highly enjoyable.The Kindle formatting was excellent, as was the price.I'm along for the ride with this series. Give me more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"I bought this book based on the good reviews it received. I wasted my time and money. The primise is good, which is what convinced me to buy the book. Boy was I disappointed (and a little ticked). I hate to write a negative review, because I know how hard it is to write a book. But this should have been marketed to 12 year old boys, not adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many typos to ignore","review":"It's one thing to watch a B move and another to read it, particularly when there are so many errors (typos) that jar one out of the story and back to the reality of reading a poorly edited book. These are not always misspellings, but the wrong words that pass spell checkers but make no sense in context. This could have been a better read but for the fact that no editor did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the drawing board","review":"While the author clearly offers some interesting channels of thought, the whole picture needs to be shaped up quite a bit to justify more than a 2-star rating.While the storyline has some interesting ideas to offer, the characters are flat and see no development throughout the story. The language is rather coarse at times, and the book features so many typos that it can be considered a miracle in itself given these modern days of automatic spellchecking.With regards to the progression of the story, many areas are opened up and left unexplained. Likewise, large gaps occur in the timeline."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ADVENTURE WITH THE LOT","review":"How would you rate this book, well I gave it four as you can see. Books don't have to be earth shattering to be good, books need to make you comfortable happy, suprised and on a learning curve, be it historical, or humorous, or even scientific, you need to have something to keep the mind sharpened and focusedc on the tail your enjoying.This book has all of the above, I won't pen the story line, why spoil it. The characters are great, the destinations amazing, and the story plausible to a point in reality. As for the fiction side of it, that must be realistic enough to be enjoyable and to keep you wanting to turn pages.So if you like a well written yarn (well written being the objective with a four star) you like adventure, and you delve into history, then jump on board and enjoy this book - it is truly a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK IT WAS A GREAT READ.

The on-off switch is inside and there is no way to turn it off to work in the garden. It will continue all day long. Not sure how people are faving success. I have a large garden with a serious deer problem. I just ordered the Scarecrow. I think this thing would do best as a closet radio light for when you are looking for another shirt.

I adjusted the sensetivity and nothing I did would get the units to sense motion of my 6' body more than 10 ft; the documentation says 25 feet and that ain't so.These units have very poor quality control... if any. It would have been very simple do duplicate my issue with the first one by putting 3 D cell batteries in it and turn the sensitivity to high and test it. Obviously, that was not done so I waste new D cell batteries and time dealing with customer support... it took 5 minutes to explain to them what was wrong with it.

I had recently lost my grandmother and had inherited her Kimono robe and as I watched the movie I realized the robe Lindsey Wagner wears (a kimono robe) in this movie was the same one I had just inherited.

I'm also a big fan of Lindsay Wagner. For years I have been looking for a VHS tape of this title. So you can imagine my amazement when I found it at a zshop as a DVD. I know that many DVD titles are produced overseas and not released here. So I thought I had struck gold. $39.99 was expensive but some of the VHS's advertized are nearly that much. I was quite disappointed upon receiving it to see that it was obviously a amature DVD copy of a VHS tape. No menu or chapters just the movie. Hey I'm happy to have the copy. It's as good as a tape, but just a word of warning, if you can get it cheaper as a tape buy it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"an old favorite","review":"I first saw this as a TV-movie on Halloween years ago and was really taken by it. Of course, I was ten at the time, but even at thirty-five, I still really like this somewhat cornball but wonderfully spooky and heartfelt time-travel romance.

I really liked the theme of sad people finding each other and bringing comfort to each other through new love, as well as the time-travel theme. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite time travel movies.

This thing is still trucking after 2 years of very intense use. It performed excellently. The two batteries easily kept the tool powered for an entire day of work. It is tough, heavy enough to be stable yet light enough to wield all day. The action is smooth and the torque control is very consistent.The tool still looks almost and works just as smoothly as when I first took it out of the box.I highly recommend this tool, and Amazon has a terrific price on it.

However, I noticed that his drill chuck wobbled when operated indicating that the shaft was bent. I thought he had done this; maybe he dropped it. I purchased this product the next day and found, when I got it to my shop, that it too had a bent shaft. This caused it to wobble to the point that the tip would \\"walk\\" out of the screw. I returned the drill and purchased another, it too had a bent shaft. I really like the design and power but this defect is intolerable. DeWalt needs to recall this product. When they fix this drill I would give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best purchase!","review":"Got this cordless screwdriver a few days after we got our new shed knowing that I would be making a ramp, loft & shelving for it. I couldn't have done all three with ease & enjoyment doing it without this wonderful screw driver. The early problem with the chuck being sensitive in releasing the bit is gone, not once it came out accidentally. Torque adjustment is a breeze & intuitive, ergonomics is just right with the length of the screwdriver just right when you need your other hand for extra support/grip. Battery power is adequate (hard to estimate because of pre-drilling). The hard case is very nice, keeps everything really organized. I am so pleased with this product I'm telling my friends about it. To avoid strain because of high torque & weight, I do recommend using your non-dominant hand once in a while to avoid strain & let the screwdriver do all the work for you.

So what it can driver a 3\\" deck screw. I can do that better with a cordless drill or impactdriver. This dewalt is still too big for a small screwdriver. The Milwaukee is over priced a little but it does the one thing better. Being a cordless driver. Its much smaller like a screwdriver. And you can drive a screw and then twist it like a manual screwdriver to check thightness of the screw. And dont have to worry a lot playing with the clutch so you dont strip out screws. Or like installing plastic electric plates, you can screw in then turn screw just a little manually so you dont crack the plate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bit release","review":"Needs the bit release that their impact driver has . Their impact driver's release has to be pushed forward to remove the bit. This screwdriver release merely needs to be pulled back to remove the bit. However, you bump the release often when using the screwdriver and ZING there goes your bit. I contacted DeWalt but they seemed a bit arrogant so I cannot recommend the screwdriver.

The smaller 12v Litheon drivers are much lighter, smaller, and at least as powerful as the DW, and the clutch mechanism is much more 'refined' The batteries also last considerably longer.

I ordered a second battery thinking that it only came with one. Now I've got plenty of spares. Speaking of batteries they do seem to have a long use. I've used this tool at different times for over a week without needing to recharge the battery.

Sending it back for a replacement, and hopefully this was just a rare QA failure. I remain a strong DeWalt fan--but I suppose I had to get one lemon out of the dozens of DeWalt power tools I have purchased over the years. Have to add that I love Amazon's return process.

I use it with a set of drill bits with hexagon quick change tips to drill pilot holes, then quickly switch to the driver of choice and adjust the clutch to drive in the fastener in place.I am glad DeWalt still makes this driver. When my Dad asked what kind of power screwdriver he should get I immediately knew what to get him for Christmas and was glad to find after all these years it was still available.Bottom line... if I you are looking for a comfortable, versatile, well built screw driver with the ability to do light drilling work this it the tool I would highly recommend.

The motor has tons of power! There is a Dewalt service center near me and I was super lucky to buy a HUGE set of bits and drill bits that fit this screwdriver for next to nothing. I drill 1/4\\" holes with it with no problems. The battery life is also very respectable. I can usually do about three or four moderate projects around the house before I have to change the battery. The bit/chuck quick release system is universal so you can use bits for other manufacturers with no problems.I lost one of my batteries and I was thinking about buying 2 more batteries. I did the math and I decided to buy a second Dewalt screwdriver instead. Two new batteries will cost about $60. Currently this screwdriver sells for $78.99. So for an $18.99 I get a 1-hour quick charger, a new case, and the screwdriver itself! Don't buy extra batteries, buy extra screwdrivers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New and Improved","review":"This seems a little boxy but once you start to use it you will love it. My old craftsman had a rocker switch and a high and low speed switch. This unit uses a variable speed trigger which works much more smoothly. It took a little getting used to the direction selection which is located just below the pivot but that was more of a \\"Getting used to it\\" type of thing. Great power and comes with two batteries which charte in an hour so chances of you running out of power are low. The unit may be a little heavy for some but when you are running 7.2 volts there has to be batteries somewhere. I also like that the motor is enclosed in metal. The only con I can muster is I wish it would pivot closer to 90 degrees for comfort but that may be personal too. Over all if you want power and convienence this is an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guscaralarm","review":"I took the liberty of buying this tool based on the positive reviews this tool has and their all trueHighly recommend this tool and any dewalt device"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wobble Wobble","review":"So I rarely leave bad reviews because I usually only buy products that have a history off good reviews.

I read a few reviews that said this, but that it was just the chuck. Well I put in a long 3 inch screw bit and the wobbling was obvious. Did I just get a defective one?

Why not make him have wings and a turbo engine so by the time the other horses break from the gate he's already been around the track and beat them by a mile and a fourth. I'm being sarcastic. What I think the writer should have done is give Glory some competition so the reader doesn't get bored. But the best idea by far would be to have put Shining in the Classic and had her beat Glory.

Nothing has been done to hbave the readers bond with him or, in any other way, think of him as a over-all good horse. He just appeared out of no where and started beating top-class horses!

Too much of Glory, too much of Cindy, too much of Cindy and Glory winning. Fictional, yes. Enjoyable? Absolutely not.

The plot itself is interesting up until before the end. The big \\"twist\\" I was expecting was somewhat of a letdown.The best parts of this movie are probably in the middle. The dance club scene manages to bring out this film's biggest strength, the chemistry between Manuel and Caro. The actress that portrays Caro is the biggest acting talent seen in this story, Ezequiel who portrays Manuel has his acting up and downs but it seems he was cast here to pull off the James Dean look which he surprisingly manages in quite a few scenes.If you happen to stumble into an opportunity to catch this movie go ahead and watch it, but don't go out of your way to get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too wordy...","review":"Too wordy, never straight to the point.

Having already been a big fan of the gorgeous Jean Marc Barr, star of the 1988 movie The Big Blue, I was intrigued to find the fanastic Frenchman playing the title role of St.Ives, a captain of the french army captured by the British in the Napoleonic wars. Starring a cast of the best actors Britain has to offer - Miranda Richardson (Blackadder), Richard E Grant (Withnail & I) and Anna Friel (Mad Cows) just to name a few, a witty and occasionally hillarious script, and a passionate and heart-warming love story, how could anyone not be entertained by this film. If you thought all British period dramas were stuffy affairs, all breetches and corsets, think again. St. Ives has everything from duelling brothers to an English Channel crossing hot-air balloon flight. A film that has a little bit of everything for the whole family to enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too silly","review":"Among the few things this flick has going for it are pretty filming locales, lush costumes, warm saturated colors, and golden summer afternoon light. A romp it is, but one that provides neither enough comic relief to be sufficiently entertaining, nor (lighthearted) substance to be engaging or even remotely memorable. \\"St. Ives\\" is buffoonery galore. Hints of period piece parody and sprinkles of mild witticisms simply aren't enough to elevate the movie above plain silliness. It isn't an absolute bore per se but too incomplete and predictable to be valued and enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay I guess","review":"This movie was pretty slow moving to me.

Do remember that we in the UK have had the Greatest Hits LP since 1958 which included titles which were not hits in the UK - no complaints- -because you have one of the world's truly GREAT singers to enjoy.

We had a short but wide crack in the top of the shower that had been there since we initially installed the shower . . . hit the corner against a 2x4. Anyway, we are preparing to sell the house and wanted to fix the crack. This product worked very well to fill the crack. It smoothed out well. The only problem, is that we could not get the color to match our beige shower, no matter how hard we tried. The color mixture always ended up looking too peachy. So we went ahead and filled the crack with the peachy mixture, then covered the peachy patch with beige fiberglass shower touch-up paint.

The information is dated, the concept is dated, and frankly we have seen it all before in the movies. There was nothing concrete or usable. When it really got boring they would throw in a celebrity or two as Colin Powell or William Shatner to spice it up a tad. I know this presentation is really an attempted biography but still falls short of its purpose.Basically it went from the possibility of improving man then machine then eventually building the ultimate man/machine as in the film \\"Over Sexed Rugsuckers from Mars\\" (1989).I did like looking at the old-time computers and bygone personalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Legend in His Own Mind","review":"This is a film about a clever man who looks in the mirror and believes he sees God. As God, he is of course able to answer all the great philosophical questions. What is death? (a whole bunch of sad empty rooms). What is consciousness? (something that machines will acquire in 25 years). But God, as usual, appears to need money and so he travels around the country shaving his tired old face in dreary hotel rooms and dragging his rickety carcass to any gathering of people willing to pay his speaking fees.

There is many topics of current research where the outcome can be speculated and thus it is a fun film to watch and think about. Great minds alas are not perfect minds and so it is with Ray I believe because he is unable to see the forest through the trees. His singular focus on the human missus the development of other forms of matter and the interconnectedness of it all. We did not develop in isolation and we cannot sigularly develop ourselves in isolation. The evolution of matter organizing has no preference for a particular form. Ray has also boxed himself into a belief system that sadly chooses to focus on the dying light. How perpetually anxious ones life must be when so much energy (and pills)are used in an attempt to arrest a process that got him and his consciousness here in the first place. That said I believe he is right concerning the eventual intelligence of machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Cool","review":"Being a sci-tech fan, I was already a fan of Ray, but ahd yet to see his film.

In my experience with him as a graduate student, he viewed everything through a filter that ignored contrary evidence and accepted only information that placed socialism in a good light. Clever, he was not profound. In seminar, getting him to agree with silly, but pro-socialist, propositions was a sport. Several Jewish graduate students described him then as a self-hating Jew. This book seems consistent with his ideological bent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rationalization of antisemitism","review":"This book is a catalog of what anti-semites regard as the crimes of the Jews. A similar list can be drawn up for many groups. (Imagine the list of American crimes drawn up by Al-Qaida.) The irrational leap inherent in anti-semitism is that these alleged crimes spring from the nature of \\"the Jew, \\" or from the character of Jewish culture. Anti-semites do not see individuals but only representatives of an inherently evil race or religion. There is nothing rational or \\"plausible\\" about that.PS Even the title is offensive: Esau was deprived of his birthright by Jacob-- by implication the Jews' first crime against the gentiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"This is one of those discs that you just can't seem to get out of your CD player. It is refreshingly different from so many of today's popular music offerings. It is hard to put a label on what they have done - It has the musicianship and daringness of jazz, with many of the tracks being instumental. At the same time it has an accessablity and pop-sensibility, with hooks that leave you humming them. The production is outstanding in its subtleness. The works that most closely resembles the feel of this album are the later albums by Swell \\"Well?\\" and \\"Too Many Days Without Thinking\\" (also highly recommended). There is tremendous clairity and a hidden elegance, all while maintaing an organic and slightly edgy feel. I can't wait for the next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Booh-yah!

I have no complaints about the books themselves. They are the nice hardback volumes I expected. Of course, the books themselves are also a wonderful collection of stories that I highly recommend to anyone who likes magical tales. My complaint is with the box itself. It is made of cardboard and plastic. It will take quite a bit of care to keep it looking nice for any length of time. If this is purchased for any but the most fastidious child to keep in his/her room, I would expect the box to be in tatters within a few months.

False advertising I would say.If I had not waited so long (the promise date was originally at the end of August and was extended to October)for this book set I would return with out a second thought.

Each book costs only about $17. It is indeed a good deal.But... the cardboard... I'm sorry, but I believe the publisher has already made enough money off from the HP's readers, can't they sell something decent instead of putting everything in a cardboard box? such a shortfall of high expectation. Unless publisher stated ahead of time about the cheap material of the trunk, then I guess there shouldnt be any complains from us.So, it's a 5-star for the price for the books, but a nil-star rating for the deceptive marketing trick.

The corners of this \\"trunk\\" look like your average file box, and they are already tearing. All I've done is take the plastic off the books! Seriously, people who have purchased this set deserve an apology, and a sturdy replacement box, free of charge.

I wasn't expecting wood for the price I bought it for, but the trunk could have made of another material that would be more sturdy and stand up to some amount of time, wear, and tear. Now I have two sets of hardbound books, and can't decide whether to just throw the trunk away, the reason I made this purchase, or just be bummed every time I see it sitting there.

Not the case. I would have been more than happy to pay more for a nicely done box even if it were just a sturdier cardboard made well that looked better. The box looks great if you neglect the corners all together and don't plan on using the handles at all. It should have been covered with some sort of edging and made a bit better.

Wow! Talk about efficient!!), but could be returned at my inconvenience.I love the HP collection, and had it hit and miss, so I do like having all 7 volumes in a set. But I could make a better box.

Two of the hardback books did not have the covers on them and the box that the books were to be in, didn't come either. This was a set the was listed at being in \\"very Good Condition\\".

Rowling, shown through her references throughout the series. If you are a history buff, you will have noticed that names, spells and other aspects of these stories are woven with the tales of Arthur and Merlin, science, cultural history and many other subjects.This is not to say however that it is merely a blending of other stories. Her own creations are just adorned with the literary usage of these pieces of history. Think of it not even as the icing on the cake, but the cute sprinkles that are on the icing of the cake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Books! Who came up with the packaging?!?","review":"The chest was a really great idea; but thank God Amazon had the set for cheaper than retail. I would have truly been irritated if I'd paid anything more than what the books could be purchased for individually. The chest is really cute, but not very good quality. Had a FANTASTIC time reading all the books though. I am 35 years old, work a \\"full-time\\" job, and still managed to read all 7 books in 3 weeks. I had to! I have 4 nephews and a niece who were bound to let the ending slip. Super stories, sad to see the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Paperback Box = A++","review":"My books came in perfect condition and within a short amount of time.

The box was pretty heavy. The treasure case is cardboard and a clever idea but was never intended to be more than a clever box for the books It is not very sturdy. Don't be fooled like many others thinking it is a wooden box. Think about the price. It is ridiculous people thought they were getting a sturdy box at this price. I bought the set for a birthday present for my granddaughter. She loves the books. I actually Iike the box it came in. It made me want to look for a real box one day to house the books. The entire set came very well packed. It was in excellent condition and all seven books cost $118.00 with shipping. A bargain price to be sure. A cute box idea that was better than the typical book sleeve. I am happy with the purchase. I am smart enough to know you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS!!!","review":"SO much better than I thought it was going to be after reading some of the other reviews!

I give the low rating to the Package or boxset. The books are all hardbacks like the ones previously available and are finely made. The chest is a cardbaord box with a junky plastic clasp that is really hard to close, and heavy string for handles.We had higher expectations than just a colored cardbaord box. We expected a CHEST! Not a cardboard box, but a CHEST, a TRUNK, a FOOTLOCKER, or SOMETHING! The box is only slightly nicer than the brown one it came in. I feel ripped off. We are thinking about returning it.

She had barely got to chapter 2 before the pages started coming lose from the binding. I appreciate that kids can be rough on books but I assumed these would withstand at least a few years of good reading, as the previous copies we owned did. Very disappointed with this set as it just will not last the distance in this family of avid readers. The covers are flimsy and the binding is just too inferior to cope with books with these numbers of pages. Santa made a poor choice this time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great journey- Harry Potter series","review":"This book was briliantly thought out.

Rarely one gets to re-capture the magic of childhood and still be enthralled by wonderfully entertaining characters exhalting the values we all want in our lives - friendship, integrity, sacrifice, success, teamwork. I just love the reader, Jim Dale's, ability to give each character their own individuality and with such precision over time. It's a LOT of characters to develop and remember. He is truly an artist. A series where each book grows in it's depth and character development and have been some of my all time audiobooks. Treat yourself to the series and share them with any one needing to remember the magic of childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Driving","review":"I loved the books and decided to by the CD set to listen to on my long drives to and from work. The reader, Jim Dale, is wonderful! He has a different voice for each character so you never have to wonder who is speaking, and each character voice is perfectly suited to the character. Jim Dale is very talented in this aspect. I am curious at how long he had to practice and how long it actually took to make the recordings! Wonderful buy! Quick and easy delivery! I love Amazon!CnLMyers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bollix","review":"Like many others, I clearly recall the pre-order advertisement stating that this was a wooden box. Obviously, it is not. It is cheap cardboard not worthy of starting a decent fire. I had the books in hardcover long before this atrocity arrived at my door and had I known that the company would switch the promised product with this rubbish, obviously I would never have ordered it. What truly infuriates me is that this was supposed to be a birthday present for a beloved friend of mine.

I saw this set in Borders (thankfully I hadn't bought it). The chest really is flimsy, folded cardboard that won't hold up to being handled much, or to holding the heavy books enclosed in it. I lifted the set in the store and the chest seams bowed open! The picture on Amazon is much better than real life. I'm not expecting wood, but this could have been made of hardened, bonded leather. If you just want a set of HP hardcover books, this might be worth it but I'd check the individual hardcover prices to be sure you're getting the best deal.The books, of course, are phenomenal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy cardboard box a dissapointment","review":"Like the many other reviewers, I eagerly awaited this special set, only to be disappointed by the flimsy cheap looking box.

What fun.I had heard that Jim Dale is a most gifted reader. That's an understatement. Frankly, I think he's a Wizard.

Easily 5 out of 5. But I gave it a 4 because of the Hardcover edition.

I would have spent 200.00 if the container the books came in were like a real chest but no way!I got the books on Amazon separately and it was still cheaper to do it this way.

Harry Potter was what first got me into reading anything. I had bought all the books as they came to shelves. Unfortunatly i lost them all sometime after I moved from my parents house. So i decided to buy this box set. Let me start by saying that I was fully aware when I purchaced this from reading other reviews that they would be ariving in a cardboard box. Personaly, I am not impressed with the box but that is not why I bought this. I bought these books to read them. So if your looking for a collectors item, this isnt it.

In college I suffered from dreadful insomnia and my doctor recommended listening to books on tape as I was trying to sleep. He said they tend to be monotone and soothing. I of course selected Harry Potter. Jim Dale does a wonderful job of reading these books and they were anything but monotone. I've always found that reading Harry Potter, the descriptions, the story was so vivid that it was almost more like watching a movie. Dale really brings the characters to life! As my audiobooks get older a bit more used I had been looking for a new set. I purchased this and the price was beyond incredible. I bought it on sale for $250 for the set, that is barely $36/book. Half of what it usually costs to buy individually. Great deal, great books, great voice! Seriously, buy the set!

The publisher really dropped the ball on that as it is one of those times that two versions of the series would have been best. I think they should have put out a cheap version of the box (this one) for those that just want to pick up the books together and a quality box for those that want the whole package. I know I would have gladly paid more for a good display box. Another fact to note is that those looking for first editions will find that Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix is a second edition. Overall though, it is a convenient way to pick up all 7 books and usually cheaper this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I was leary to purchse this with the poor reviews and I do agree with the fact that the trunk is very cheap for the books, but I do like having all 7 books in hardback and the case is nice to keep them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supremely disappointed......","review":"I've been a major fan of the HP series for many years, and never acquired any of the books in hopes that they would release all of the hardcovers in a set. When I saw back in July that this set was being released I was thrilled. I just received it today, and have already filled out the return form to Amazon. I am HIGHLY disappointed. I am in the Graphics industry, and we would NEVER package something as precious as the novels themselves in something as shoddy as this faux woodgrain file box. Maybe if the publisher receives enough of these back (at $120 each), they'll get the hint. Just watch, six months from now they'll produce a REAL wooden box.... Avoid this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real trunk!","review":"Same books as the $40 set but they come in a CHEAP carboard trunk. The handles are thin rope, not sturdy as the ad claims. The privacy lock is cheap plastic. They make the box look like it is a quality velvet lined wood trunk (and for an extra $80 you would think thats what your getting)and I fell for it, please don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: FLIMSY CARDBOARD BOX !!! NOT VERY PREMIUM!","review":"Like everyone here, I believed the books are great. But I felt dupped by the fact that this set came in a cheap cardboard box. The shipping box it came in, which even identified the contents with a prominent Harry Potter Logo as the full boxed set, was far sturdier than the actual box the books came in! When I reserved this set, I too thought the box pictured would be a hard, sturdy wooden box with felt interior. Boy, was I wrong! You need to handle it gently otherwise you might tear the box or yank out the weak rope attached to it's side. I am still going to enjoy the books though. I'm just going to store them on my bookshelf or find a real steamer trunk to put them in, instead of that flimsy box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jared","review":"While the books themselves are fine the collectors case and \\"lock\\" they describe are cheaply made, and, as everyone else mentions, made of cardboard.

HaHa! It is a cardboard box made to look like wood, one of the strings on the side is broken, and the catch on the front that you close and open it with is about a 2-minute break for a child that is not very careful about opening. I am totally disappointed with it for that much money. The books inside the box are fine, however.

Sadly, the final \\"box\\" looked nowhere close to the original advertized item. The only silver lining here was that I landed up getting a good deal on the books. My final price came out be $111.14. I had preordered this book about a month ago on Amazon. However, when I checked out the site on October 7, 2007, it said that orders placed at that time would have an additional 5% discount. So, I canceled my previous order and preordered it again to get the discount.

This box is no more than a low quality cardboard, extremely cheap looking, and tearing on the edges already when I picked it from the UPS box. I won't mind paying extra money for a decent looking collector's version. I just don't understand whether the publisher has their marketing department, or quality control division, after they got so much money from the huge success of Harry Porter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"As I am new to the wonderful world of Harry Potter, I did not have any of the books. Once I was hooked I knew I wanted my own set. I began pricing all of the books in hardcover form. When I saw this set I quickly realized it was the best deal around. And in a wooden box to boot!! When it arrived today, I really had to hide my disgust and disappointment at the cheap and flimsy cardboard box. After reading the reviews I realized that I was duped, along with everyone else. This box arrived with a tear at the corner from shipping and I have no confidence it will hold up to normal use. My only consolation is that I received an Amazon Reward Certificate for $25.00 that I applied to this purchase, thus spending under $100.00. Sadly, I wasted a perfectly lovely Amazon Reward Certificate on a falsely advertised book set.This travesty really deserves a free replacement box or a partial refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL. UGLY. CHEAP. not at all boxing these classic books deserve","review":"UNBELIEVABLY BAD BOX for such a collectible set of books. I never ever imagined the pictured box would be a mere cardboard trunk.

I feel like I have been robbed, just plain robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Missed Opportunity","review":"I was really looking forward to this box set as it looks great visually, which is still the case...however, it is a look and don't touch product. I, and probably a lot of other people, would have paid more money to buy something that was better quality. High quality is what you expect from Harry Potter and the people behind this travisty of a cardboard container, have certainly spoilt that aspect of it, as well as missing out on something that could have been better for everybody. The books as you expect are great, but most collectors already have them - people bought this box set for the container and it wasn't worth it, which is a shame, as it was such a good idea that was spoilt to save money or effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I purchased the Harry Potter boxed set for my brother in-law for Christmas, not only did he love it, but my daughter and daughter in-law both want one.

The truth is, the box, although thick and sturdy looking, is not sturdy enough for the weight of the books. The side 'handles' can NOT be used to pick up the box when the books are in it.

Yes, the books are amazing, but the \\"pretty box\\" is junk with a cheep plastic latch. I saw this here months ago and was just miserable because I was too broke to buy it. It looked so cool in the picture that I almost went ahead and put it on my credit card. Boy am I glad I didn't! The other day I saw they had it at Borders so I had to go and see and...CARDBOARD?!Like other people I didn't expect it to be stained hardwood, but did it have to be this chintzy, flimsy cardboard?

What a downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This review is for the BOX part of \\"boxed set\\", not the books","review":"The books are fabulous, but since this is a Collector's edition Boxed Set, I am very disapointed in the box itself, which looks fabulous in the picture but is just plain cardboard and has a faded look (not brightly colored as in the picture). I already have the books, I wanted to have this as a display unit. Very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously!!!","review":"The way my package came wrapped in a large box, with 2 folded cardboard supports, I would have expected a special, quality trunk (even if made of cardboard). The online picture is deceiving, the trunk really looked colorful and attractive; but I am sad to say, it is neither attractive or colorful. The publisher should have just mailed the books directly in the \\"trunk\\" (which is nothing more than a glorified cardboard shipping box) and saved the planet from more overpackaging!!!!! The books, of course, are fabulous! I also hope the publisher will send out a replacement trunk worthy of such an important set of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly inferior to Stephen Fry's reading","review":"I am a very big Jim Dale fan, from Pete's Dragon to Barnum and everything in between, but his reading of these books is tired and gimmicky. He may have won a world record for number of voices but his narration is stale, flat and has no connection to the dialogue. It's as if he recorded the voices and then just read the dialogue in between with no contextual connection.Stephen Fry's readings are exciting, eloquent and dynamic. His voices are equally as entertaining as Dale's with the added bonus of a narration that keeps you engaged throughout. There's no comparison. Buy the Fry reading if you can get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"#NAME?","review":"At first my order never got here, I had to email them to let them know and they did send me another book set.

But really folks...if you seriously thought it would be that you should have questioned the price. Wood and metal and handcraftmanship are significanly more in the money department.It's cardboard, it comes with stickers instead of a puppy, but most important of all: The Books Are Hardbacks. Finding any of the Harry Potter books in hardback, in good condition, is nigh-impossible once they've gone paperback. And when you consider Amazon's discounted price, you are getting a mega-screaming deal.And you know what? I like the cardboard trunk. It looks good on my coffee table's shelf.

The books are shrink wrapped, and the whole package came in a fairly good protective shipping box. The display box was nothing more then a dissappointment though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective books","review":"I originally gave this 5 stars for the price, in spite of the cheap cardboard trunk, but due to the publisher's and Amazon's poor quality control, I must give this a lower rating. Book 4 has a section of duplicate pages where missing pages should be, and Book 7 has creased pages with blurred print. Amazon will not replace individual books within the set, so I must take all 18 lbs to UPS and make arrangements to be home for another UPS delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Expected","review":"We actually found this box set in the store (the mega super chain we all love to hate, yet continue to shop there ... you know the one.)The \\"trunk\\" is average grade cardboard and the \\"lock\\" is flimsy decorative plastic. The box, on a whole, is kinda shabby. One accidental drop and this trunk is going to be permanently damaged.While it's really fantastic that they've put together an entire box set of the books, I think people would have been willing to pay the price for a better quality set. I would have. I'm really glad I'm not the one who paid $100+ for it. I hope that when they finish all the movies and put them into a box set it's of better quality than the book set. If you're a mega fan, grab it while you can. If you're not that crazy about owning all the Potter goodies, skip this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter","review":"I read them all, and saw all the movies, what can I say, they were great stories; it is nice to have a boxed set as a trophy for all the reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great box set price","review":"I purchased these as text books for my son's Fantasy Literature as Religion class.

That's why I made the investment to purchase this book set.

I'm not sure why though, lol. But whatever encourages today's youths to read instead of playing video games I try to promote. I saw this exact book series at Barnes & Noble for $85. I couldn't believe it was so much cheaper. Love Amazon. The print is large for older people to read. Also, each individual book is a large number of pages, so my son feels that added satisfaction of reading a book that is over 300 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price and cute box","review":"The books in the box are beautiful and there's also a sticker pack, which I didn't know came with it, but which I highly enjoyed.The box itself is cute and yes it's cardboard. but with the amazing price, I didn't expect more. It's a little beat up around the edges and the clasp was broken when I received it (easily reparable). It's really not a horrid packaging at all and its quite sturdy.I'm extremely pleased with my order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with purchase....","review":"I'm surprised at the negative reviews on this boxset. I think it was a great purchase. The books are hardcover and look great. The box may be cardboard and the latch plastic but overall the presentation is lovely, and it makes a nice talking point on the bookshelf. The coloured stickers fancy up the trunk (box) to your own liking. It looses a point because the latch is fiddly and took me a little bit to actually work out how to open. Overall I really like it and think it is a nice way to keep the books together."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product did not arrive at all","review":"It was actually a gift for christmas, But I had to give something else because this did not arrive at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"It has been over a month and I still have not received my purchase - will review once I receive the item. - Hopefully soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Fantastic product, any HP collector's dream.The packaging was fantastic and ensured that the \\"chest\\" and all books were in mint condition.

Love Harry Potter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Treasure Chest","review":"Having all 7 books in a treasure chest is a great idea. Unlatching the hasp, lifting the lid, and finding handsomely bound books added to the drama of opening the package that Grammy sent.

Great idea, great gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip in one cover","review":"This item arrived as described and was nicely packaged. The books were also sealed in plastic inside the collector box. The only problem with this item is that the paper cover of the second book has a slit/rip in it. In order to get a replacement cover I would have to ship the whole set back. I ordered this book collection from amazon to avoid minor problems like this and was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"We originally recieved the item after 4 days (express postage) to Australia.the first one we got, had a duplicate of the 2nd book in the series \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" and was missing the 1st \\"Sorcerers Stone\\"i alerted Amazon, and they shipped out a replacement in under a week, free of charge.Great service :D:D:D"},{"rating":"2","title":"great collection","review":"Very happy with the books and the pricing was excellent in comparison to a book store. My son is 10 years old and loves the series!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Boxses","review":"This is a great value. You get all seven hardcover jacketed books for $122.00 that's only $17.50 each. The box is a nice touch and the stickers let you customized. My only complaint is the box isn't well made. However, it looks good and as long as it's only used for display, it should last. If you're a Harry Potter fan, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best books ever","review":"This box set is so beautiful, I almost feel bad reading the books.

A review on the story content has received enough coverage so I will only focus on the quality of the box and book quality. The box overall is sturdy enough and acceptable (even though there was a little dent at one corner but that's a delivery issue). However, I am disappointed by the quality of the paper and the small font size, which is surprising for a set targeted at children.I compared the quality of this set to that of a borrowed book that was published by Bloomsbury and the latter was much better on both paper quality and font size so I would recommend that set instead, which I think has a similar cost in Amazon UK. I lived outside US so I am not going to bother returning this set but if I would have if I reside there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Boxset Books","review":"Excellent product, prompt delivery during Christmas season. What more could you ask for. I would certainly buy from this vendor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cardboard packaging is just fine!","review":"The chest that these books came in is actually very nice quality. All the bad reviews about it are overly exaggerated. In fact, it's quite fun and looks like a wizard's trunk! All it's being used for is storage, so it serves its purpose just fine. Besides, I'm paying for the books, not the packaging it comes in. I didn't want to spend a fortune, and I'm sure it would have raised the price much higher if they had done something more elaborate. This chest will look so nice on my shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"This is clearly not a review for the books as they are fantastic. This is for the cheap cardboard box they arrived in. I read many reviews that lash out on customers who \\"expected too much\\" and I guess I am one of them. What the 5 star reviewers don't understand is that this box set was represented as a collector's item and many people who bought this item bought it for this reason and not necessarily for the books that they/we already have. For someone who does not own any of the books I agree that this is a very good deal but for the rest of the people who are interested in a collection item this is simply the worst purchase you will make (or already did).Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hosed","review":"Like the others, I know for a fact that the pre release description was a WOODEN box. As I bought the books as gift, the receipient will not share my disappointment and will love the books and probably throw the box away in the other Christmas wrapping trash. This is the first time I recall a deceptive description from Amazon, and I am very disappointed by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Books great, box not so great.","review":"I was going to get this as a gift to me so I could have a full set of the Harry Potter books kept nicely tucked away. However, I had the chance to examine this box set at the local bookstore and I was definitely disappointed. I would rather spend a little more money, and actually get something of value instead of a cardboard box.I also agree with a previous reviewer, if the point of getting a box set is to have a perserved set of books - why put the additional items inside the shrink wrapping.I am going to hold off and not get this set. I am hoping that perhaps the poor reviews will be heard and the company will put out a \\"delux\\" version with a decent box that is worth the money and a suitable home for these awesome books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"When I ordered this it very specifically said a wood case. This is cardboard. I am going to ask for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending it back","review":"I too was disappointed in my set.

Some collections contained duplicated CDs with others missing.

This was no fault of either Amazon or the bookseller i purchased it from but rather the publisher who packaged the set as it was shrink wrapped when I opened it! Now I have to go through the hassle of finding a volume one from this edition, to complete the set as it was supposed to be a collectible! Quite a lot of work ahead of me for a Christmas present which was anticlimactic to say the least!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Use with kid gloves!","review":"Though the price is nice, the packaging is not. Very flimsy and low quality. Plastic latch will break easily if not careful. The books themselves are wrapped, but the box will deteriorate after time if it is not treated well.

The hardcover Books, and the story they contain is world famous. The Wal-Mart level cardboard & plastic carry case is worthy of a collection of Bevis & Butthead, not Harry Potter. The last time a series of fictional stories was this Huge and Successful was a hundred years ago when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave the world Sherlock Holmes. A case made from western red cedar, or oak with brass hardware would have been worth whatever it cost to create, and a collection worthy of posterity, and the incomparable tale of Harry Potter.

It is very heavy for him to carry however I think he feels that makes it more substantial! He loved the box it came in and has covered it with all the Hogwarts stickers which were included - even the Slytherin ones! The book jackets are really cute and just perfect for little kids and I'm sure it is something my son will look after and cherish for many years. It was admittedly a very expensive gift as I also had to pay courier fees from the U.S. to Australia to get here in time for Christmas but I think it is well worth the expense if it encourages children to read. I think that if it had included H.P. bookmarks then that would have been just the ultimate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Great books, great story, great price!

I knew the box was going to be cheap and it's just made out of cardboard and like others have in their reviews it has unfinished edges. But I really don't mind (it'll help protect the books better than if they were out in the open or on a bookshelf), I thought it was cute and it was on sale and I wanted my own set of Harry Potter books since we just have a family set and once I'm on my own I didn't want to have to fight over them. The stickers are nice, not sure what I'm going to do with them yet, I don't want to put them on the box.

I pulled the set out of the shipping box and just stared at the lame cardboard packaging. Seriously, what were they thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for...","review":"The only reason this product deserves even its one star is simply for containing seven completely and enchantingly amazing books. As for the boxset itself, it is a thrown together hunk of plastic-coated cardboard that can't be worth 10 cents, plus a few decorative stickers. If you want an attractive, durable, and lasting container for your Harry Potter books, buy one separately because this ripoff doesn't meet any of those qualifications. The only thing I can say for it is that it will cover them from dust, and I could vouch the same for a paper grocery bag or a sheet of plastic wrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I know the box was going to be this cheap!!!","review":"I could have bought the books for $30 less and had them this summer...

I've already printed my return label to use when my box arrives on Monday. All I've been waiting to get since the 5th book is a set of all seven books in a nice slipcase.

Maybe I'll see what the British publisher has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in packaging","review":"I advance ordered the book set when I first learned of its offering during the late Spring. This was for my daughter who is an avid Potter fan (she had previously purchased all the books first as paperbacks and then later as hard cover versions). I wanted to give her a special collector's complete set from the publisher and thought when ordering that it was to come in a substantial wooden packaging. I gave it to her for her birthday unopened. When she opened it, I was disappointed to find that the special packaging was merely printed cardboard folded into a double-thick box. I was expecting more myself, but my daughter was happy to have a complete set of new books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know Why You Want It","review":"Before you buy this set, know why you want it.

It is about *this* set.I was disappointed. For the price, I didn't really expect more than cardboard, but I DID expect better cardboard and hardware that was not plastic.

It was a very good deal on the books themselves: I had bought my set one at a time for about $30 each, so this was less than half that price. She was a little disoppointed that the chest was so flimsy, but mostly that several of the dustcovers were wrinkled and torn. We are bibliophiles in my family, and we treat books with careful respect, and we have books that are decades old that are in better shape than these came new.

The supplier was condescending when communicating about the issues. So I would say the supplier is sub-standard in my opinion. Books were supposed to be used in very good condition. They weren't. They were a gift for my stepson, so I have to give them to him and let him decide if I purchase another set from somewhere else. I may, but I have leaned a valuable lesson.

Thanks. - Dom"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Bad One","review":"I bought this CD, and after hearing how bad the sound quality was on this live recording, I got rid of it. The argument about this being a live recording is paltry at best. Just because a band records a live album does not mean they should release bad sound quality. Anyone who knows anything about music knows that live recording is about the band performance, recording mix, and the final mastering done in the studio. I've heard audience recordings sound better than this mess released by Maiden. To coincide with Bruce Dickinson's final tour with Iron Maiden, the band issued two live recordings, A REAL LIVE DEAD ONE, and A REAL DEAD ONE. In fact, the two \\"Dead One\\" live releases have the worst sound quality of any released live recording by any band, and this is from a band that released \\"Maiden Japan\\" and \\"Live After Death.\\" The band doesn't sound as inspired as it does on its previous live collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason why this band's appeal is limited to a cult following...","review":".....they're just not that good. Don't get me wrong, I'd have a blast banging my head with Eddie if I ever got the chance. Clearly, this CD does NOT represent the band at its best. But it does demonstrate that worthwhile IM songs are few and far between....I rather enjoyed the one time I saw them live (alas, it was on videotape), but I must say, once was enough. I certainly won't be spending any time listening to this poorly mixed live set full of sub-par material. Doesn't do it for me at all.P.S. - as I'm sure this review is guaranteed to tee off dedicated Maidenheads, allow me to point out that I actually love the band that features Bruce Dickinson's brother Rob on lead vocals - Catherine Wheel. As far as I'm concerned, they're one of the best bands ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this entirely!!","review":"Why are you even looking at this page? Trust me, you do NOT want to even consider buying this for one second! Steve Harris thought he was good enough to produce this, and failed miserably. He was going for a \\"quality bootleg\\" kind of vibe, but ended up recording mostly audience with some sort of semi-musical noise in the background. And to make it even worse (is that possible?), Bruce's voice is absolutely shot. His faltering screech which opens \\"Be Quick or Be Dead\\" is cringe-worthy, and a taste of things to come throughout the recording. And Janick's blaspheming of Adrian's classic solos deserves his immediate execution.Not a pleasant listening experience, no matter how \\"hardcore\\" you consider your fanaticism toward Maiden to be. It's a shame, too, because the song list on Dead One was actually interesting. It would have been nice to really \\"hear\\" Where Eagles Dare, but unfortunately it's just a bunch of noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY??","review":"Why would I bother to buy an Maiden album featuring one of the worst phases of their career, recorded during the last tour with Bruce Dickinson, where he sang without any passion. Also, to handle Janick Gers guitar playing is something very difficult. The worst guitarrist ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"STOP PANNING THIS ALBUM!!!!","review":"Okay, I'm going to make this short and sweet. No, this is not Maiden's best live recording. No, this is definitely not Dickenson's best performance. But you know what? They have so many friggin' live cds, it's hard to be the best and this still sounds good enough for me. Why would you give a 1 star to a maiden album with all their classics just because it's not perfect? This is just dumb to review it at that. With all this said, this is a great recording but probably is only for die-hard maiden fans like myself. If you really only want 1 live Maiden album, I would go to the Donnington CD. You can't go wrong there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good show.","review":"This is a very entertaining show.With the lovable Andrew zimmern.He is a one of a kind guy.He has my dream job of traveling the world eating food.While doing that he also a journalist for boston magazine.Very nice guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice.","review":"I used this with my first and it was very awkward.

It has an excellent bounce, for not being a bouncy ball.Not much really to say, except that if I didn't have this item I would be in a lot of trouble. Sometimes I squeeze it, sometimes I toss it between my hands, but mostly I bounce it between my hands and my desk. I do this constantly, when I am not typing, and it keeps me focused and the mind working. As a writer, this is important. When I am struggling with a word or phrase, I grab this ball, play with it a bit, and it helps unlock my creativity. Keeping the body active keeps the mind sharp, and if you're sitting there in front of a computer, you're not really moving otherwise.

My main disappointment was what I thought was a real \\"gloss over\\" of the period when Virgin was just starting its rise. It seemed to me that within a page or two, Branson's life jumped from being hounded by creditors to being a millionaire. There didn't seem to be sufficient focus on that crucial time.There are some strong points--I found the balloon episode quite fascinating, and there are many other details about Virgin's later rise to financial success and power that seemed sufficiently detailed.

He then analyzes his data with mathematical approachs drawn from a wide range of fields, and when necessary calls upon economics and game theory to further understand the data. He is widely published. He can also be said to write well for a lay audience, though his arguments sometimes requires repeated readings to fully understand.These are just a few of the questions that Huberman answers (more thoroughly in some cases than others) and his approach to them is always based on a variety of useful insights.

It is so hard to find a cordless phone with caller ID and a speakerphone without having to buy one with an answering machine also. So, I was glad to find this one. I am sorry to say that it has not been satisfactory. The speakerphone works fine, but when I use the handset, it sounds \\"tinny\\" and the voices are muffled, even after changing channels. The people I am talking to say I sound garbled and they can hardly hear me, which is the same probem I have talking to others. I have also tried it with a headset, with no success.

I called Coby Electronics to ask for replacement handsets, which they acknowledged were defective. However since their miserly 90 day warranty period has expired they are charging me $31.00 for the handsets which is only two more dollars than I paid for the entire phone in the first place. To add insult to injury, payment must be made by money order. Money orders are costly and involve a trip to the bank. In sum, due to the hassle and large expense, I can only assume that Coby is trying it's best to discourage anyone from obtaining replacements. I am not the only person who feels this way.

I used ceramic coating decking screws with this instead of nails to frame the walls and had all four walls assembled and erected the same day working by myself except for lifting them of course. They were so rigid from the studs being screwed together that they didn't flex without crossbracing and they were 9' walls.

But like most sequels, the plot, acting and writing took a downturn. It really only amped up the bloody scenes but were a tad gratuitous for my taste. I'm all for gore, but they were too obvious in the attempts at shocking the audience. The plot was completely unoriginal and predictable. The editing made for it being a little choppy and didn't flow well. The writing lost some consistency when the lead (Nick Stahl) asked the same question multiple times when it had been answered already. It was amusing enough I suppose, but I would have rather not spent money on it. Save your $$ and watch the original with Kiefer Sutherland instead.

It's no more a masterpiece than a double cheeseburger is haute cuisine, but it's no less satisfying for that. The structure of the book works very well. I love the play on the cut-up technique: first the chopped up fragments of cliched romantic fiction, then the literally torn minds and chopped bodies of the second story. Finally, the 'overwhelming ecstasy' of shared feeling bringing two people in different worlds together. Always, though, Welsh balanced the drunken, drugged moments of ecstatic joy, against the inescapable and banal facts of life and love. The dim-witted, vicious thug of the second story - duped into self-destructive love - is nicely contrasted with the amiable dope-head of the third, constantly mistaken for a notorious child-molester with a similar name. Humm. Maybe I was wrong: not a double cheeseburger, more like a really well-cooked curry - spicy and subtle at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After Trainspotting, which was one of the best books I had read in a couple of years, Ecstacy was a letdown. The great thing about Trainspotting is how the characters all come to life through their distinctive voices. Unfortunately Ecstacy misses it. The first two stories especially. The dialogues are flat, the characters are stock characters, the plots themselves are stale. Kind of like a bad tv detective show where they throw some kinky sex and drugs on top of tired cliche, so it seems \\"hip\\". The last story was a little better. LLoyd was OK. At least he had some life in him. But over all, not really worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three novellas - one drug","review":"I am a big fan of Irvine Welsh so I was anxious to get my hands on ECSTASY: THREE TALES OF CHEMICAL ROMANCE. Sadly, I was left disappointed. The premise of each novella as described on the back of the book is excellent, but Welsh's execution was very poor. For example, in the first story, \\"Lorraine Goes to Livingston\\", Welsh was not consistent in his use of Scottish dialect for the main character which was more than distracting. Also, the idea of a mortuary worker having free sex with the corpses in full knowledge of everyone in the hospital is a little too far fetched, even for Irvine Welsh. I will not bother to continue with the shortcomings of the other two stories.Although I was disappointed in ECSTASY, I will not give up on Welsh as I still believe he has an amazing talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"All About E","review":"Three novellas, composed of disjointed storylines that all tie together in a complex web.All about lives revolving in and out of one another, under the influence of Ecstasy, Prozac, booze, downers, hypothetical corporate monster-drugs, chocolate, love, and desire.Exhilarating and daring. The first story is utterly brilliant and DELICIOUSLY funny, the second one still very good. In the last one, I could only follow one character's storyline with interest (Heather's), but enjoyed that part immensely.Irvine Welsh is one ridiculously talented writer. And surprisingly sweet and perceptive, while he's being vicious towards his characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original love stories","review":"When one envisions a happy ending, it wouldn't be such as Irvine Welsh has written in the three short stories contained in \\"Ecstasy\\". The first story, \\"Lorraine goes to Livingston\\", tells about a bed-ridden romance author who plans to get revenge on her unfaithful husband with the help of her nurse Lorraine. In \\"Fortune's Always Hiding\\", a soccer thug falls in love with a paraplegic girl who tries to find the man who marketed the drug that rendered her crippled all her life. Finally, in \\"The Undefeated\\", it tells the stories of Lloyd, a raver, and Heather, a \\"yuppie\\", and their pursuits of growth. My favorite is \\"Lorraine goes to Livingston\\". The stories are filled with a biting humor and new ideas that are refreshing. A warning, though: this is not for the easily offended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step backwards for Welsh","review":"It is hard to believe that this book was written by the same man who was able to come up with the ideas, characters, plots and extremely interessting scenarios for \\"Trainspotting\\" and \\"Marabou Stork Nightmares\\". \\"Ecstasy\\" consists of 3 different stories, the first story is somewhat controversial (typical Welsh) with the whole idea of necrophilia, and has a humerous ending with an ironic twist. The second story should have been written into an entire novel. The characters weren't developed enough. The story did have an extremely funny part involving the whole \\"Melon\\" situation however. The third, final and longest story was boring and uninteressting. So I give this book one star for its mildly amusing parts, and one star for a cool cover, but is an absolute joke compared to his other work. I got the impression that \\"Irvine\\" rushed through this one, especially considering every chapter was only one or two pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate short stories","review":"Although each story in this book is around 75 pages in lengh, they are not long enough to enjoy.

Of an attempt to cash in on the stellar success of the 'Trainspotting' movie no doubt.'Ecstacy' consists merely of three lazy, half-arsed 'ideas' that would struggle to get into the far superior 'Acid House' collection of short stories. Irvine obviously didn't know how to tell his publisher to wait a few months until he could come up with a proper book. Fortunately the follow up to this ,'Filth', finds him back on form so perhaps this book should be seen as a 'mere blip in an otherwise upwards trajectory'. As Sick-boy almost once said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ecstacy is anything but.","review":"When I read \\"Trainspotting\\", by all accounts a much stronger book, I was struck by the flatness of Welsh's prose when not smothered in Scottish dialect. \\"Ecstacy\\" is not written in dialect. The book consists of three novellas, which are arranged in descending order of quality. The first kept me reading, the second wore out its welcome before it was over; I didn't finish the third. \\"Ecstacy\\" underscores Welsh's weaknesses as a writer, sporting flat dialogue and a strained narrative voice.

I've used them for that purpose and haven't had any problems at all. The handles are comfortable, and the base is secure enough to allow for standard push-ups.

If you are serious about trying different push-up forms, then you might want to spend more to get weightier bars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay for what I use them for","review":"I'm not a push-up maniac. I don't drop and knock out sets of push-ups in bunches (although once upon a time I did). So, I don't need the utmost in top quality. That being said, I feel that these are pretty good for my needs. The bars are lighter than I expected but still feel sturdy enough for my workouts. The two-piece plastic top and bottom pieces come apart. I haven't had any problems with them separating during use. So far, I've used them on carpeted surfaces only. They work fine on carpet with no rollover or tipping so far while doing wide and normal push-ups. The cushioning is light but I haven't experienced any pressure-related aches or pains. I don't know about those who do hundreds of push-ups on end but I will definitely tire first before feeling any pain from lengthy sessions. For the money, not a bad set of push-up bars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Uncomfortable To Use","review":"I was very disappointed with this product.

I also own the Perfect Pushup V2 bars and have used those for over 6 months without a problem. The Perfect Pushup V2 are well built, stable and comfortable. These Harbinger bars are overly lightweight, poorly manufactured and unstable. Not a combination you want to have when the safety of your wrists is at stake. I suppose for somebody who is lightweight and doesn't work out too often these might suffice, but for a big guy like me who likes to work out every day, these just don't cut it. In the end, I cannot recommend these. If you're looking for decent push-up bars, spending a little more on higher quality is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made, Not Sturdy - Inferior Bars That Slide","review":"I'm disappointed with these push-up bars. From the picture, you can't tell they're cheaply made - lightweight plastic. I used them on a hardwood floor and once was enough. The bottom of each one has rubber pads to keep you from sliding, but they are poorly set and feel flimsy. They're positioned to stick out slightly to provide some traction but once you put your weight on them, they get compressed and become one with the bars. As a result, they can't keep you locked in place. I used them once and already I was concerned they would slip out from under me.

What I can say is that these Harbinger padded handle bars are pretty comfortable to use when placed on a hard surface. There are 3 rubber \\"stoppers\\" on the bottom of each bar that keeps them from slipping. They do not work well on carpeting. The bars are are made of lightweight plastic, but I haven't had any problems with them supporting my weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please try to stay away from these!!!!!","review":"I bought these to give me greater range of motion on pushups. While they work alrite for normal pushups they are an absolute failure on almost any other type of pushup modification. Using it for wide stance you risk breaking your wrists because the flimsy design easily causes them to roll over. Close grip pushups lead to the same result. The plastic material is extremely flimsy and the handle itself seems like it can break at any time.Though i havent tested them the tko bars seem better because they seem to have more balance. DOn't be fooled and lured in by the price because these handles aren't worth it.

I am disappointed with them in two areas. One, they are not nearly as comfortable as I would have thought. When using them they dig into the heal of my hand. These are the first push-up bars I've ever used, so maybe this is normal, but the handle is not completely round and so has a corner (all be it not a sharp one) that can dig into one's palm. Two, when using them in a wide push-up position, they have rolled on me. The base is not wide enough to adequately stabilize wide push-ups. I don't use them for this particular exercise any more. However, I do use them for standard and military push-ups. It is still nicer to use these than to use the floor. More range of motion and not nearly as much stress on my wrists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stressed my wrists","review":"I do a lot of push-ups so I thought these bars would be good to use as preventative maintenance for my wrists. Unfortunately, straight out of the box and few push-ups later, I could tell they were doing the opposite. I felt more pressure and stress on my wrists instead of less.

However opening the box my first impression was that1) this plastic is flimsy2) There is not suction or grip.For regular push-ups I've not had a problem. However as I wrote the plastic is flimsy and for a big person (I weigh a little over 200 lbs give or take) I question if they would hold.If you do jerky push-ups (up down fast) you could lift the bars right off the ground, I did.The sponge grip does feel nice. But my wrists feel it more than regular push-ups.Reverse push-ups I did not care for them at all. I almost rolled a few times as the bars did not grip the ground well and I was on my side holding the bar.The only good thing I can say is for someone who travels, wants to do push-ups in their room and not get your hands dirty.Other than that I would be very careful with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product @ this price range","review":"This is a fantastic product! I have used over 10 different push-up bars over the years, including \\"the perfect push-up\\", and i would have to say that for quality, comfort, and durability, it ranks in my top 3 bars Ive ever used. When it comes to over all product, i would say that it is probably my favorite, simply because of the cost. The ONLY downside to this product is that is is very low to the ground...which is actually a good thing for most people, however, i like to be elevated to get more moment with the push-up. So overall i would give this product and company a 9 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of expectations. . .","review":"Not the bargain it's cracked up to be. I'm using them, and they'll suffice for now, but I really wish I would have coughed up for the Beachbody Power Stands. These push up bars are small, the incline is very subtle and unfortunately they are not very stable. If your hand/wrists waver slightly, they flip over which is very dangerous and painful. When you're really working hard at a push up, you need more stability than these provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheap - Low Quality","review":"I was excited to see the great price, and was hoping to see a halfway descent product. Unfortunately the padding around the handles is paper thin and the handles themselves are rectangular, not round. Thus creating a very non-ergonomic, awkward, and painful grip. Additionally, they provide virtually no height benefit as they barely raise you above the floor. The base is very narrow, prohibiting you from safely doing a wide stance push-up. I regret this purchase and will be returning for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as adverstised","review":"This is the best pushup stand I've used. I'm in the Army and have used many before.

It was poorly packaged, having been rolled then bent to fit in the box. As I removed the flimsy material, I first thought that maybe this was a protective backing for the actual liner and that the seller had left out the actual liner! But, no. The flimsy parchment-paper like material IS the liner. The way it was packaged is keeping it from staying flat in the bottom of the oven.

I should be able to select weather I want to print in color or black. They couldn't explain why, in fact I am responsible for using the printer and so I am at fault.

Lehder operated a \\"Dr. No\\" style island in the Bahamas, which could have made for a fascinating book, which makes the book even more disappointing.

Buy it and be surprised at what the book will do for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of age within the Hasidic Jewish culture","review":"This memorable book tells the story of Rachel, and what it's like to come of age within the confines of an ultraconservative Jewish sect. She is surrounded by mainstream America, she is required to follow the strict rules of a culture dating from the Jewish ghettos of 18th century Poland. Rachel wants to fit into the streets of New York kids of the 60s, a desire that nearly makes her rabbi father, dutiful mother, and indeed her entire community, come undone with shock. To readers, Rachel sneaking into the public library to read classical literature is endearing; to her family, it's akin to sacrilege."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I really liked this book. It is a very provacative look into the life of a young girl who wants to be something other than what she is.The only things I wasn't sure of were the daydream sequences. I also had a hard time with the passage of time (there was no warning between now and four years later). And I wasn't exactly sure how the book actually ended.I loved the languange and the structure of the book. I also loved the subtle movements and actions of their everyday lives.

From the first page Iwas drawn into a world so different from my own that Iwanted to be a part of the story, not a detached observer.I couldn't help but wonder how much of author PearlAbraham is in Rachel (or possibly her younger sister Leah).This story is for women of all ages and is one whichcelebrates not only the differences between the Hasidicand the gentile, but also between the different \\"sects\\" ofHasidic/Orthodox Jews, and finally, the differences betweenmen and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel became a friend and I wonder what life held for her .","review":"I wish I could use one of the online people finders to locateRachel, my now long-lost friend. Pearl Abraham has breathed lifeinto her character and her portrait of Rachel's coming ofage opens our eyes to a range of issues. The tensions of livinga religious life in a secular world are illuminated through theeyes of Rachel, who's coming of age is traced over several yearsduring the course of the story. Finishing this book, I was leftpondering women's roles in orthodox or fundamentalist religiouscommunities and the rules which protect and bind them. The authordeftly balances the issues of community cohesion and individual expressionand growth. I'd like to know how life turned out for Rachel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm hasidic","review":"Being one of the hassidim, I must say that I had no joy reading this book. It hurted \\"me\\" because I know most of the characters in the so called novel. I know that she never felt the love of the religion, might be because there is no good book to explain the love of it. This is something which is supposed to go from parents to their children, and many times \\"they\\" arn't the good messengers for many reasons - which one was probably the cause here, too. - reading thru the book I was looking for a cause; I thought of many, but I came to the conclusion that she skipped a lot of information.Her situation as described wasn't so exceptional from others I advised, and guess what they married and are so happy, fitting into a novel named The Romance finder. A Hassidic Councler"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual perspective, but trite coming-of-age novel..","review":"After perusing some of the other reviews as well as thinking over this book, I find I have more reason to give it only two stars. \\"The Romance Reader\\" attempts to show us the closed world of the Chasid, but it really is a delayed screed against the Orthodox traditions of Judaism, as well as a fairly dull coming-of-age novel that reads very juvenilly. Now, the novel follows Rachel Benjamin, who we know is much like the author, who at the start of the novel is at bat mitsvah age(12), and she is starting to question her parent's traditions. She grows into a fairly modern Jew, who loathes matchmaking and loves the ways of the \\"Goyishe\\". The father is a hopeless dreamer, a rebbe without a following, who is constanly put down by his wife, who does a very drastic thing at about page 100. As ohter reviews have said, Abraham uses some of the real names for fictional situtations which is a big no-no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating insight into the Hasidic world...but...","review":"I was so much into Rachel's life and feelings throughout most of the book...grasping onto every work- picturing every scene in my head and trying to visualize myself in Rachel's life. However- all of a sudden I had the feeling that Pearl decided she wanted to be done with the book- and tried to end it much too quickly and without any sensitivity to the reader. Ms. Abraham, if you are reading this- I would love you to perhaps e-mail me?? I really did enjoy your story and hope to hear more from you in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incongruous","review":"I am a Yeshiva educated reader who rebelled and left Judaism so I identified with the protagonist, but the character made no sense to me. She is portrayed as being so ignorant of the traditions and lifestyle of her own family that she didn't realize what taboos she was breaking or why her parents were so angry at her. I find this quite bizarre. I didn't expect her to be learned, but she should certainly have been more savvy about her culture with the upbringing that she had, and she should have been cleverer about her rebellion."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately disappointing","review":"I agree with the reader that calls this a \\"so-called novel\\". Ms. Abraham did not even bother to change the names of the fictitious characters that were in fact real people. Her anger at her parents is probably at the root of her disillusionment with the religion and it's way of life. Coming from an Orthodox and Chasidic background, one can choose to reject some of the restrictions without feeling that the entire religion is restrictive. Some of the customs that she attributes to Chasidism were actually just the upbringing and closemindedness of her own particular family. It is unfortunate that her anger does not allow her to appreciate the beauty and peace that Judaism, and Chassidism have to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star because the drop-down menu wouldn't let me give it any less!","review":"This book was so bad, I actually threw it out after I finished it. While that's sacreligious to me, I was just so annoyed that I had wasted my time with this tripe! The characters are not redeeming in any way. The person you were supposed to identify with was (to me) a selfish, annoying brat who wound up doing something really hurtful. While this was supposed to be an act of her liberation, it made me feel worse for the \\"victim\\" than the supposed heroine. If you want good, Jewish chick-lit fiction, pick up \\"Jane Austen in Boca\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm surprised I finished","review":"I have to admit that this book was a gift and that is probably the real reason I finished reading it. The writing wasn't bad -- for fifth grade level. However, there is way too much talk and too many fantasies about sex for a fifth grader. And her opportunity too \\"escape her marriage\\" was too convenient. I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read with a disappointing ending","review":"I was enthralled while reading the book, and then incredibly disappointed by the abrupt ending. I would love to read more about Rachel and her family. It was a very well woven story. I, too, felt the story was at heart probably an autobiography of sorts. Maybe that's why the ending left my throat dry, needing to be quenched with more about Rachel and her life. I hope to see more from the author in the future? Perhaps a much needed sequel???"},{"rating":"2","title":"'Romance' worth reading !","review":"You do not have to be religious to enjoy and relate to this book !Dealing with the rules of her parents and strict religious law, which she challenges at every turn, Rachel seeks outlets for her curiosity of secular life by reading Romance paperbacks. She \\"finds herself\\" at last, via the surprise ending that comes through an arranged marriage.Pearl Abraham has written a lovely, easy-to-read, and alluring work.I cared about, Rachel. I could relate to her struggles, since they are similar to those all young people experience going through the teens, struggling with parental control, societal and religious expectations.I recommend this book VERY highly for religious and NON-religious interests! Great first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Voyage to Nowhere","review":"Beginning as a promising voyage into the land of Hasidism, The Romance Reader fails to make good on its promises. Told in a writing style that is reminiscient of popular women's fiction, the first person narrator gives the reader glimpses of a world filled with two dimensional characters lacking any depth.The Romance Reader does, however, entertain its audience members even if it fails to move them to any specific emotional responses. Simply put, it tells the story of Rachel, a young girl struggling to break free of the ties that bind her (similar to Naomi Ragen's Jephte's Daughter but without Ms. Ragen's depth of character). Just when the reader reaches the pinnacle point in Rachel's life, hoping against hope for catharsis, he is again disappointed.If you are looking for easy, leisurely reading on the plane or bus, then you may want to pick up a copy of this novel at the library. However, if you seek fiction in the truest sense of the word, you need to search elsewhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting film with an academic theme","review":"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.The Browning Version is the story of a school teacher who is beginning to feel that he is flunking life.

I've never used the HPTs that came with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price, but hard to read","review":"I would recommend the ClearBlue digital ovulation predictors over these.

VERY easy to use and worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and effective","review":"Both the ovulation and pregnancy test strips were easy to use and easy to read. Great bargain, and it arrived quickly. Also very accurate -- we got pregnant the first time we used the ovulation predictor!

Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap for a reason","review":"Good: Order arrived VERY quickly, was well packaged and no issues w/ order.Bad: This brand of OPKs are extremely streaky. The control line and the test line have varying levels of dye within the line. So some parts of the line could be darker than the control, other parts are lighter. A positive should show as dark or darker than the control line but how am I supposed to tell when it's so streaky and varied? I will not buy again.

They didnt. At the same time, I was using another test which showed the surge. These sticks did not. The same thing happened with the pregnancy tests. I used them for 10 days and got nothing. Then I finally took a real test from a drugstore to use at the same time as my last test strip and it was very clear that I was pregnant, but these strips still said no! I would not rely on these for much. Sure the cost is okay, but when the result is nothing, there is no reward.

It handles everything extremely well - from the smallest bit to the largest panel cutter. It is relatively quiet, and never bogs down with the electronic speed control. Soft start is excellent, although I don't use mine out of the table much. The depth settings are easily accomplished, repeatable, and accurate. The speed control is a bit of a stretch under the table, but otherwise I can find no fault with this router. It is one of the best tools in my shop. If you want a powerful router with finess, that does just about everything, this is it. A quality 5-star tool in all respects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Plunger for a Router Table","review":"This is an excellent plunge router with a single exception, the plunge release lever is very difficult to operate with your left thumb, I simply cannot push the lever down far enough to fully disengage the plunge lock without shifting my natural grip on the handle. Other than that, the plunge is smooth, the router feels comfortable in my hands with a minimum of vibration. I was surprised by the lightness and balance of such a powerful router.The mechanism used to defeat the plunge spring works flawlessly and is very easy to both engage and disengage if you read the instructions carefully. This feature is what sold me on the router in the first place, as it will spend most of its time in the router table. No need to buy a ... router lift accessory with this machine! It came with a fine adjust extension and can be easily micro-adjusted while under the table. I was also delighted to find a dust pick-up attachment in the package, I did not expect that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent router","review":"Three years ago I had an impromptu manicure on one finger from a router, and since then I've been more than a bit reluctant to go near another router.I've been feeling braver recently, and after considerable research I purchased the Bosch 1619 along with a Veritas router table. Virtually all of the 3HP+ routers have more than enough power to do any work so the decision criteria had to be based on something other than sheer power.

One thing I did notice is that the plunge spring release mechanism was difficult to figure out. I still haven't. I installed the router in the table I bought with it. Installing it into the table calls for disengaging the plunge spring. I messed with it and messed with it trying to figure it out. The directions were not adequate in my opinion. I finally disengaged the spring but I'm not sure what I did. Anyhow, it's disengaged now and it's installed in the table.

The reason I quote this is because one thing would happen and then four chapters later something else would finally happen. For example, you would find out that Samantha Sanders, the main character would talk long walks, but you wouldn't find out until later why she took them.

For one thing, the sentence structure is poor, using too many commas, just so the sentences can be stretched out, longer and longer, melting the brain of whoever reads them, to the point of sending the reader, screaming, yelling, from the room. For another thing, it doesn't draw to a satisfying close. I was waiting for Theodore Taylor to say WHY the guy kills Alvin, but he never does. The story is almost too predictable, making it blatantly obvious who is the murderer early on. Sam and Chip are the only characters who are even remotely interesting.The Weirdo becomes confusing in the middle, when it jumps around with almost no indication of where it is.Please, do not waste your time on this awful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll regret it!!","review":"I personally would not recommend this book to anyone unless you like humongous challenges. I got very confused while reading this book for multiple reasons. One being that the author jumps around so for example he's setting up the plot of the story and then jumps to seven years later. This next comment is in a way connected to what I just said but, right when something gets interesting he changes the subject. Another reason is because you have to read 150 pages into the book before things start to make sense. The last reason is that the author leaves a lot of unknown questions at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very suspenseful didn't know what was going to happen next","review":"I couldn't put the book down!

I also must say that I will never pick it up again. The book is about these two teenagers, Sam and Chip, who are defending themsleves for the bears. The beginning was ok, but then in the middle the book kept switching off from Chip to Sam and it got really boring. The one good thing is that Chip learns to stand up for himself about his image, and Sam stands up for herself against her father.

Though not to the full extent - i find some great relevant and personal similarities with me about the kid in this book (sic).

I built it the first day I got it and I thought it was pretty cool at first but it kept on breaking. It cant turn at all. It also only uses one wheel to drive and has the two fake on it to stabalize it. This means it wobbles a lot. It also doesn't run very well on carpet. Actually, it doesn't really run on any surface that good. Out of all the rc cars I have bought(to many to count)this is the worst of all. Please don't buy this. It is a rip off. It is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much gristle and not enough meat","review":"While there is a lot of philosophy floating around in this book and talk about bird-people stances and what they mean, couple with meaningless promotions and xenocide, this book just never felt like it got on its feet. It was too busy explaining the not terribly interesting parts of a conflict and glossing over things like pacing and character development. It reminded me of a painfully dull episode of Babylon 5, which interestingly enough, this book is compared to on the back cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 'space navy' type novel.","review":"Although the alien mysticism is a bit odd, it isn't overpowering. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see movie","review":"Provocative film making. Amazing cinematography taking you back in a forgotten time. Acting was top notch and as a filipina, I felt more connected to my past. Jose Rizal is an Abe Lincoln of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful tropical action thriller","review":"This book is a great beach read, wherever... as the other reviewers noted I could not put it down, even got a little sunburn! our strong and resourceful heroine is well portraied, and having spent a bit of time in the Bahams, the book capture better, than any I can remeber the mix of romance, mystery, decay, and appearances that shift like the proverbial beach sands. Above all Mr. Hall knows how to write an action thriller, it struck me that this would make a fun movie! Highly recommended, as are his other books on Amazon. PS apropos the previous reviewer who did not like some of the literary license: lighten up! I am also a fisherman, and eat small barracuda; ciguetera toxin is more common in very large reef fish, better to watch for the amberjack on the menu next time you go to the islands. All in all a delightful read! Hope for more soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bits","review":"These bits seem to get hot quickly and then break if you apply the least little bit of lateral pressure while using them. Won't buy them again unless all other bits I find perform the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the Ultimate Fly Fishing Book for the Beginner/Advanced","review":"Certainly a lot of thought went into this book. It so easy to read and follow. I would highly recommend it for anyone that is going to look into fly fishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall fly fishing reference","review":"Just starting to fly fish and this really fits the bill for my need to understand the terms and trade offs for this not-so-simple sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the beginner","review":"This book is much larger and includes a lot more information than anticipated - which is great. I bought it as a beginner and found it to be the perfect choice. It covers everything from knots, casting, what to look for in streams, and how to land the fish. The illustrations are great and the writing is very clear, with rare bits of humor tossed in. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.","review":"The complexities of grief are individual to their owners. McFarland does a good job examining each character's response to a life-shattering experience. The lesson of this book is that no two people are alike and therefore do not react alike but that eventually you find your way back on your own terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"\\"Singing Boy\\" is written with poetic sensibility and a master's touch. Beautifully depicting the pain and heartbreak that takes place when a spouse is violently murdered, and the sorrowful aftermath. The police have no leads, and the widow and her young son are left to wonder why...and to try to pick up the pieces of their lives and go on. Dennis McFarland handles this topic with grace and insight, giving us a wonderful novel. I recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely stunning.","review":"I had to put this book aside several times before finishing...to be perfectly honest, it tore me to pieces. As someone who has experienced grief too often, reading such a vivid, genuine narration was a bit difficult, but completely engrossing. I kept thinking, \\"Yes, this is it exactly\\", and then had to take a break.I'm sorry to see so few reviews for McFarland's books. He's one of my absolute favorite authors, one of the most sincere and evocative writers I've ever read. No, these are not \\"page turners\\" or pop-fiction airport bookstore reads. They are thoughtful, contemplative novels that mirror the life I know and the world around us (if you're willing to look). Truly beautiful stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts strong, then weakens","review":"I loved the first few chapters of this book. Mid-novel, both the plot and the prose became more mundane and the characters more one-dimensional. To top it off, I hated the ending, especially an inexplicable plot development involving the supernatural(!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha-? Wake me up!","review":"A man unexpectedly dies, leaving his loved ones to struggle with their grief--a story that has been written probably thousands of times over the years. Assuming the characters are well drawn, this storyline will not bore. But if the characters are a disagreeable, two-dimensional lot, well, the result will be uninspirational. And, ultimately, this book did not inspire me. Rarely do I put aside a book in which I'm over halfway invested, but I made an exception in this case. I just didn't care what would happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEAUTIFULLY RENDERED AND PENSIVE NOVEL!","review":"SINGING BOY is a heart-wrenching look at unexplained violence and its aftermath. With poetric prose, McFarland illuminates the different faces of grief using the characters of the widow, the best friend, and the child. How each character deals with (and avoids dealing with) the fact of their loss is compelling. For anyone who has ever lost someone dear to them, or thought about the horrors of losing a loved one, this book can teach you a lot about our unique human reactions to grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"A jumble of disconnected stuff...","review":"This book tries to cover slightly different ground than \\"how to start using Zope to develop web sites.\\" If you're looking for a good general introduction to Zope, I'd look at either Beehive's The Book of Zope, or the Zope Book (the online edition at zope.org; the printed version is quite out-of-date).This book is basically a walkthrough of several products for Zope (the CMF, ZPatterns, ZUBB, etc.) I doubt you'll find that you've learned much about how to use Zope or how to develop for it, rather than a thin bit about how to apply these products.I also found that this book felt rather hastily put-together, without much continuity between chapters.The only reason I'd recommend this book is if you're looking to learn about ZPatterns, and chances are, you aren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, lots of examples","review":"I was fortunate to be invited to act as technical reviewer on this book. It is aimed at Zope site developers who have to get full featured sites up quickly.This book fills a real need in Zope Documentation. It's well written, well researched and practical. Highly recommended for all Zopistas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not you, Uther and Merlin!","review":"There is no alternative but to give this book \\"1 star\\". I wish I could give it \\"minus 5\\".I must disagree with every one who reviewed this book before I did. This book is horrible! The worst Arthurian tale I have ever read. Uther and Merlin are despicable. And Arthur, so proper and critical, so full of self guilt, and to make matters even worse, a religious fanatic.Don't waste your time. This book is not worth the short time you spend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent shape","review":"And I Was There : Breaking the Secrets - Pearl Harbor and Midway by Rear Admiral Edwin T.
