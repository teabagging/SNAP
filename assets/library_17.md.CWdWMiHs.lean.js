The problem I'm having after about 2 weeks of considerate DS usage with the filters is the scratches in the touch screen protector are more noticeable than any scratches I've accumulated on my DS touch screen over the last year. (I do realize that any existing DS touch screen scratches would not be eliminated by the filter and I've taken that into consideration.) I'm not dissatisfied with the filters but right now I feel like I'll end up spending about the same amount on filters as I would on a new DS every one and a half years if I were to keep replacing them as they wear out. I'll keep buying screen protectors but I'm not loyal to this brand by any means, that said user comments about competing products are much less favorable than this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good screen protectors that also work on DS Lite","review":"I have a Ds Lite.

It's about a boy named Barney that spends a vacation at a beach cottage. There's nothing to do until some weird neighbors move in. The neighbors are obsessed by a strange game called Interstellar Pig. What is really the link between the game and real life. What mysterious thing does the piggy actually do. Find out, when you read Interstellar Pig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interstellar Pig","review":"In this book Interstellar Pig by William Stealor it is about a boy named Barney who has to spend the summer on the boring beach. When he learns the thrilling history of his house and weird things start to happen. He also learns of his new neighbors. Their names are Zena, Manny, and Joe and they are weirdly interested in Barney's house. He decides to join them in their favorite board game Interstellar Pig which rival aliens stop at nothing to destroy every other creature in the universe. Barney starts to become suspicious.This book has a lot of science fiction and fantasy ideas in it. I didn't like it because I don't like science fiction and it wasn't on my top list. Any person or kid who is interested in these types of books would love this book because of its unique story that unfolds with every chapter. In conclusion Interstellar Pig is a good book and I think a lot of people would like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Pig Stinks","review":"This book isn't bad. But it isn't good. There are waaaaaayyyy better books out there. The only somewhat good parts of the book is when the game is actually being played--the rest is boring filler--and these moments are way too few. Then things keep getting weirder and weirder, and less and less believable. The ending is poor. This book may be appropriate for someone under eleven years-old.I enjoy games, and this game was indeed interesting, however, i think Sleator should have designed the game, not the book. I actually found the moments when the game was just a game better than the preposterous final part of the book.I hated all the characters--didn't love to hate them, just hated them--they really were quite dull and annoying. Barney's 'insanity' was really unconvincing. All attempts at suspense and thrill were void to me.Thank you, Sleator, now I know what kind of book I don't want to end up writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This book is a story of one child's encounter with the new next door neighbors. What begins as an ordinary game turns suspicious. Are they robbers, are thy con-men? What are they up to? This book is for sci-fi buffs only! If you don't like sci-fi you probably wouldn't like this book. I for one did not like this book. It is a difficult book to read. You have to be able to \`connect the dots' to understand this book. I would recommend this book for sci-fi buffs, but others may not enjoy it as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALISTICALLY CHALLENGED","review":"Okay, I'm no big sci-fi fan, but I don't think that matters. I think the book was quite obnoxious. No offense to anyone who likes it, or Sleator, but it was so incredibly fake, I know that's part of sci-fi, but this was so unbelievable I just sat there and wondered \\"WHY????\\" WHY would you want to read this???? WHY did the author think about things like that???? WHY do people think about things that are so unbelievably fake and obnoxious, that it makes you want to scream??? I just don't get it. Well, fine if you like it, but this book just wasn't my kind of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space VS. Us","review":"I read Interstellar Pig thinking I wasn't gonna like it, but when I read it I couldn't put it down! My favorite part was... the whole book was evenly good?

It features him playing a new game called........with a group of new neighbors.This book had me hooked from page one. The imagery, interwoven with dynamic text and the character's own feelings, made for a very riveting read.It left me guessing at several points. I wasn't quite sure who the villain was at many parts of the book. There was enough of a mystery to keep the pages turning to the very last sentence.I really think that Mr. Sleator has written a masterpiece here, and hope that he will continue writing books like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interstellar Pig: Science Fiction at it's Best","review":"Teenage independence-seeking Barney is off on a beachtrip with his parents, when he meets some strange characters who show him their obsession: a board game called Interstellar Pig. He is strangely allured, and soon the game turns into something on a cosmic scale.This is a very good sci/fi book by William Sleator. The detail and originality only add to the brilliant plot and vivid characters.

For some reason, the people next door are very intrigued by Barney's vacation house. Barney figures out they are obsessed by their game, called Interstellar Pig. The point is to get and keep the Piggy on your planet; the planets that don't have it get blown up. He starts to think if the game is actually real. The book was a great book, although at times it was really confusing and hard to understand. It was still a really great book that was a book of adventure and valiant fun. This book will be a great book for kids who are into space and adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"my 12 yr old son likes this book. He is not much into sci-fi, but says this is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating history","review":"Major R. Raven-Hart was quite a character. He was fluent in several languages, a serious historian, and travelled the world, mostly by canoe, and wrote informative and hilarious books about his trips. This book, however, is more of a history of Ceylon, modern day Sri Lanka, where Raven-Hart lived for many years. Informative, but not one of those dull history tomes that feels forced. As in his travel books, Raven-Hart uses humor, along with perceptive observations, to keep the reader interested. I've never been to Sri Lanka, but after reading this novel I'm intrigued and would like to visit one day. I found a copy, still in print, that is published by the Lake House Bookshop in Colombo, Sri Lanka."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Ending, New Beginnings","review":"There is something intensely personal in the reading of a book. Your mind shapes the characters, views their reactions, and reacts to their tribulations. It is quite different from seeing a movie, because there is always this filter there, between you and the story. Yet when you are reading you can feel the characters' pain and joy, until you make it your own. The Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies are just such books. The reader feels familiar with these characters, and soon realizes that you want to go back, see them again. They start to feel like old friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic conclusion to a fantastic series!","review":"After reading Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series, I felt certain no other tale would rival it anytime soon -- I was wrong. Hobb's Tawny Man trilogy pulls you in and never lets go, leaving you wanting more even after the very satisfying conclusion. I can't wait to read Hobb's other books now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumphant finale?","review":"What can you say about the finale of a work of art which has spanned nine large volumes chock full of wonderfully detailed and passionate characters, whose actions and interactions are governed by their own agendas and concerns, but which is woven into a complete tapestry of love, hate, revenge, repression, honor, service, loyalty and betrayal? If you haven't read the Farseer series, you owe it to yourself to experience it at least once in your life. You will be richer for the experience.Now if only we can get Ms. Hobb to write: \\"I looked back over my draggled writing with something akin to surprise, for this is the first time I was aware that I had veered from a factual recounting of the history of the Six Duchies into fiction. My own wants and desires, so long repressed, must have bubbled forth from the depths of my weary soul. Perhaps it was only the elfbark's depression, but I surely wanted a happy life with Molly. Alas, it was not to be...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A well deserved rest","review":"A truely excellent finish to a very fine series. Hobb masterfully weaves together both major an minor points from all of her previous books to deliver a satisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I couldn't read this book fast enough, but it is impossible to read this book quickly. This is not an action book. It is a character driven novel, but that does not mean that it lacks action. Robin Hobb develops characters like few others. I found myself alternatively furious with Fitz and then cheering him on. I'm not a big fan of First Person narrative since it limits exposure to other characters, but this book couldn't have been written any other way.This was an extemely satisfying ending to three very good series. All the characters evolve and grow as the pages turn and each one is satisfyingly complete when the book is done.Before starting the book, my expecations for FitzChivalry's and the Fool's relationship were sky high. As I read, I felt a little let down by that devolpment, but when I wrapped up the entire book, I felt a real since of satisfaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why doesn't the world know Robin Hobb's name?","review":"Robin Hobb is, simply put, the best fantasy writer I have read in a long time. She manages to create an utterly original series in a genre known for its cliche plotlines, and the the Fitz and the Fool are two of the best characters ever created. Whenever I try to explain why I have such a passionate love affair with these books, I end up in in a muddle of nonsensical explanations. Hobb is a writer that has to be experienced to be fully appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fantasy book","review":"Good writing, somethimes a little bit too long and comlicated, but not bad.Clasic medieval fantasy.Intresting life and humanity ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A top read","review":"Incredibly fascinating saga.This series of novels is extremely well written. Robin Hobb has given all her characters depth and realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lousy End to a Great Series","review":"I was excited to hear that Robin Hobb was bringing Fitz and the whole troop back for another series and the first two books did not fail to entertain.However the final book really left me disappointed. The whole thing with the prince and the dragon to win the heart of this tribal girl really fell flat. They had zero chemistry when together and the Out Islanders really were not very interesting as a people.Plus I don't think Fitz got the ending he deserves. I won't say one way or the other what that means, but suffice to say, he is not given his just rewards here.It would have been better to toss the whole idea for the trilogy than let it end this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying ending and the whole trilogy is a big let down","review":"Overall impression is one big disappointment.The whole trilogy left a feeling of the bloated fourth volume of The Farseer Trilogy where all loose ends are being tied up. Although, it is done very ungratefully.!!!WARNING!!! SPOILERSFitz & Molly reunion plus 7 kids bonus is very artificial and out of context. 16 Years is not 16 months. They would be totally different people regardless of what happened within this period. Let alone vast life experience that affected both of them.Fool...my personal disappointment here. I hoped that Fitz is going to realise that Fool is a woman and They Live Happily Ever After with a sense of wonder about each other and respect and exciting life...On top of this the usual numerous repetitions of what happened only a hundred pages before.The Tawny Man trilogy is a big let down.Hobb was at the top 5 of my favourite writers since 2002, it is very sad to lose her now."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have made it this far","review":"These books, after reading the 5 previously of course, for me have more than made a good story, but introduced me to someone I will undoubtedly remember my entire life. Fitz is more than a character in a book, you are in his mind, share his good luck, bad, happy times and sad ones. You feel emotions as if you are the one experiencing everything, I wish I could find more books with the same type of in depth character relationships... I don't know if i will. If you are someone thinking about picking up assassin's apprentice. Do it, you will thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A note about the conclusion","review":"**Spoiler alert**This amazing series was flawed by its conclusion. At the end the main character (the Fool) believes the one he loves the most (Fitz) to be dead. From this the reader will come to the conclusion that the Fool will be unhappy for the rest of his very long life. Some reward for saving the world! In the epilogue Fitz explains that he is not happy with the resolution either. Why then, dear reader, should you be expected to be happy? Also, a few important things are left unresolved. What is the significance of Others Island and what are the monsters hiding in the forest there? Also what happens to the other stone dragon on Aslevjal Island, the dragon that holds captive so many forged ones' spirits? Perhaps the author should be the one to say \\"I have never been wise\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough Robin Hobb","review":"I don't read a lot of fantasy these days, but somehow I picked up Robin Hobb one day and I'm extremely grateful. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, so I'll just say that this was a great book, and that it was just as satisfying as all the rest of her novels. The only regret I have is that there are no more for me to read, and I can't find any other fantasy author that I like nearly as well.If you're new to Hobb, you shouldn't start with Fool's fate. Begin with Assassin's apprentice and read the her other books first. And if anyone knows of another author as good as Hobb, let me know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent combination of fantasy and interpersonal dynamics","review":"This series does a great job of avoiding the traps of common fantasy; not typical at all, lots of surprising twists in the series.

An absolute artwork! Robin Hobb is the bomb! The whole story was amazing! Filled with sad tales, love stories and the breaking of a strong bond. All coming down to the perfect ending! I loved it!

If you haven't read this already you HAVE to get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"Short and to the point: An excellent read. Buy this Book. Heck, buy the entire series. Six books in all for Fitz Farseer. I dont normally like first person novels but I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these. Hobb is a masterful storyteller who weaves a beautiful tale of a bastard prince and the Six Duchies. Please just read these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ending to a must read series!","review":"Fool's Fate is awesome! The series main plot really climaxes and ends spectacularly! I read it in less than a week staying up late every night. The only thing I don't like is the ending to the secondary plot with characters.

I read the reviews on the site and a few were not so good...thus, I was a little leary on whether I should buy the movie vs. rent. To my surprise... the movie came on that same night on a movie channel. I couldn't turn away from the tv. The movie was very touching. The cast of charachters couldn't have been any better. Jason Alexander, was the biggest surprise of the film. He did an amazing job. I will admit at first, I too was a lil leary about the flim within the first 15 minutes or so...b/c it wasn't as clear as it should have been. However, after the plot thickened so did the movie. This movie is a totally divine movie and a must watch for all alike. Absolutely, I will buy this one for sure and can't to watch again and again. BUY THIS FILM!

I laughed and cried and thought it was a work of art. At first when I realized it was a movie about gay men I thought, \\"Oh no not another movie about AIDS\\",and indeed Aids was there but it only really hovered in the background for most of the film. The characters were quite believable and I laughed and cried and fell in love with this brave and intelligent film. The movie which comes to mind when I try to find a comparrison is, \\"Smoke signals\\" which is not about gays or aids or anything but life love and relationships and co-incidentally American Indians. I will buy this movie so I can see it again and I recommend it to anyone with a heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, poignant","review":"I thought this film was outstanding. I put it in a class with the film \\"It's My Party\\". It's a wonderful character study, and I only wish that I could be part of a group of friends (as described by the narrator, \\"like a family\\") like this. Of course, some of the characters could be described as stereotypical, but they're certainly not one-dimensional. This story is splendidly cast, and beautifully filmed. It's touching, sometimes funny, sometimes painful, sometimes campy, but very realistic.

Almost as unlikeable as the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches from the word go","review":"This film adaptation of Terrance McNally's play is full of stereotypes and cliches. Following the gatherings of 8 gay men and their vacations together at a lake house, the film claims to examine how they struggle with such issues as AIDS and loss. Instead we get Buzz, a stereotyped gay man with a limp wrist and a fixation for show tunes - his camp act clearly aimed at getting laughs from a straight audience.Then there is a completely insipid sub plot about two twins that is so contrived it is painful to watch. Such a pity when gay themed movies end up perpetuating gay stereotypes and cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"One of the worst movies in recent years. The actors try their best, but can't overcome the phoney, pretentious and mawkish screenplay. If the play is ANYTHING like this stereotype-laden, melodramatic misfire, than I'm amazed at the acclaim and honor that has been bestowed upon it. Atrocious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"I was unable to decide if I was more offended by the stereotypical (I would say homophobic except that it is written by a gay man)humor or by the sentimental and manipulating drama in this film. There was not a single character who was endearing; there was not a single relationship in the group that seemed to express love; and there were very few conversations that were interesting or plausibly motivated. Jason Alexander played his part as if he were doing a politically incorrect skit for Fox TV. And the story about the twin brothers with completely different personalities was stupid, a symbolic ploy that may have won praise if written by a junior high school student.The only positive element of this film is that it made me appreciate the fast forward button on the remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated everyone of these characters!","review":"I thank heaven that I do not have friends like these because if I did, I would run off to a desert island. I never saw such a bunch of new age-sensitive-getting in touch with our inner children-wimpy guys in my life! Everyone is so self-absorbed, so-o-o sensitive, so-o-o rich and self indulgent- who could stand to be in a relationship with any of them?? These are the kind of guys who should all be working as therapists or social workers - that way, the only people who would have to listen to them would be desperately lonely people who would welcome any human contact. If I was ever at a dinner that included one of the conversations in this movie, I would pretend that my beeper had just gone off so that I could get the heck out of there on some false pretense!!

I'm training for a marathon and mainly needed a legging where the seams would not come apart in the inner thigh area. When you're running long distances, as most runners know, if you have rips in that area you can get very bad chafing which is very painful. The seams in the leggings came apart in less than a month. As a result I had to adjust my stride to ease the pain, which hurt my back, feet and made running seem at least twice as hard. Since I switched to pants that don't have rips in the seams running is starting to feel normal again. I even got chafing from these leggings before the seams started to rip - something about the way it's sewn together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"The Danskin legging is the best quality available.

I left eleven (11) detailed voice mail messages with In the Mood Intimates over the next three days, with no response. Finally, another nine (9) days later, I received an e-Mail asserting that they no longer had the bra in stock, and refusing to accept a return of the panty (even though its packaging is unopened) owing to the nature of the item.Meanwhile, they have charged me for shipping and taken away the $10 discount.These people are dishonest.

It's a good concept to have the kids be able to feel different textures, but there has to be some sort of plot line, or at least a sentence. The classic 'Pat the Bunny' does a good job of introducing textures and activities to kids. Wish I had a better review to write, but I just can't think of anything nice to say about it.

The hero is engaging, the set up is intriguing, and the younger brother's rage rings true.Then I spotted no fewer than three separate, blatant, egregious errors, one of them on the *first page*, that could have been avoided by ten minutes' research in a costume book. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy, and it really makes me wonder just what else the author didn't take the time to get right.I may finish this, but really, why? If the author doesn't care enough to know that a respectable woman in this time period NEVER went out in public bareheaded...or that decoration on gowns in that time period was detachable trim...or that the heroine could not possibly tuck her earnings into her bodice *because women's clothing didn't HAVE bodices until almost two hundred years later*...then why should I care enough to finish the book?Very, very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it except for the ending","review":"I won't bother writing a synopsis since other reviewers have done an excellent job of that. Rhy's patience in helping Joan overcome her trauma was very lovely and touching. However, once Joan's background as a lady is revealed, their love is depicted as impossible because of different stations in life and all the implications of that in 14th century England. Yet, in the last chapter, Joan is back with Rhys permanently with no satisfying explanation of how the barriers were overcome. It left me scratching my head a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Romance!","review":"Madeline Hunter is currently one of my favorite authors. She brings the reader to a different place and time.

In fact, \\"The Power of Belief\\" is an outline of transformation. It illustrates why most humans believe they \\"are not\\" and reveals the path to realizing \\"they are\\". The book begins with keys to recapturing the attention and goes on to explain the significance of our beliefs and finally how they can be changed. And speaking of tools, there is a whole section dedicated to them!

I sat through the whole thing just to see if it would improve - it didn't. I kept wondering whether this was a radio play that someone had decided to film. The dialogue is wooden, the plot is pathetic, the whole set-up is unconvincing. It looks like something the actors did in a couple of days due to contractual obligations of some sort or maybe to cash in on the whole \\"Vegas\\" craze - which ranges from CSI to \\"The Cooler\\". (Incidentally, \\"The Cooler\\" is another one to avoid.)I would give this zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Eight - Hard to watch","review":"This movie gets one star simply because a lesser value wasn't available. The plot, if one can really be found, along with the script is certainly not up to the standards of the actors in this movie.

Maybe next time, but I can't recommend actually buying this one unless you want a complete Anderson collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The debut of a masterful director","review":"Along with Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese, Paul Thomas Anderson is one of the greatest current film makers of modern cinema. His debut film, \\"Hard Eight\\" does more than prove that. Philip Baker Hall stars as Sydney who is a former gambler who knows all the tricks. He finds a broke John C. Reilly out front of a diner one day and then volunteers to teach him his former trade. Hall's performance is really something to see in this film. His character is acted out with such brilliance that it sends chills down your spine. Gyneth Paltrow plays a cocktail waitress who does some hooking on the side. Samuel L. Jackson also appears and is as great as always. P.T. Anderson would become better recognized for \\"Boogie Nights\\" but his debut is quite a film to see as are \\"Boogie Nights\\" and his latest film, \\"Magnolia\\". Anyone who is a film of good cinema should appreciate this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it so much, I might start gambling","review":"Finally, a starring lead role for one of my favorite actors John C. Reilly (check out \\"State of Grace\\" and \\"Magnolia\\") and he doesn't disappoint. Philip Baker Hall (i.e. Mr. Bookman from \\"Seinfeld\\") is solid as well. Did any one spot Philip Seymour Hoffman? I havn't seen the film in a while but I think he played a loud mouth gambler. The wonderfully talented P.T. Anderson even uses the same music that he used in \\"Boogie Nights\\" (the slow church bell tune - you know, the one in which Dirk Diggler gets jumped). Same sort of style too (he loves to follow actors walking) and it really works. Terrific film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very tight movie","review":"Hard Eight is excellent. It is at the same time very similar to and very different than Boogie Nights. The plot overall is much tighter and not as sprawling (not to say it's better though).All the performances are excellent. The movie doesn't move as fast as Boogie Nights, it has a kind of slower pace. It is not very violent, although there are a couple of violent scenes. The plot is very tight and self-contained, as I said before. Overall, Hard Eight is a great movie, just not as good as Boogie Nights I guess. It also moves kind of slow in parts.Oh, and one more thing: Go see Magnolia. Now. It is unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors Galore!","review":"The book is easy to follow, but it does not follow Cubase SX 3.0. Perhaps the book was written with a beta version of Cubase.

This includes the totally false technology, business leaders with poor judgment, government officials that give people's personal data to telephone callers, a medical student with the intelligence of a 12 year old, and the way the tax system works. The only realistic part was the few minutes of Phyllis Logan being a competent woman business executive. In her case this probably was not acting, as she is a pretty competent woman to start with. Her part is the only reason my copy has not found its way to the trashcan.

The book takes the reader to five million years, one hundred million years and two hundred million years to show how life on Earth may evolve through climatic changes and vast time changes.Although other reviewers may not agree with some of the proposed evolutionary suggestions, one must remember that all of the proposed evolutionary changes are based on speculation. There is no way to know what life will look like in five million years time; science bases those evolutionary theories on what we currently know about evolution and how life has evolved to its current day forms.Will squids eventually be the 'new intelligence' of the future?

Not only does it have large, splendid full-color pictures of all the animals from the documentary's episodes, but it explains in-depth the evolution of each creature: what it looks like, what its lifestyle is, and why. Dougal Dixon is quite good at predicting based on science what life will be like millions of years in the future. After all, billions of years ago, who would have guessed that humans would have evolved, or any of the other amazing creatures of today? When you consider some of the weird animals the crawl the earth right now as we speak, this book seems much more credible than you might originally think. There are definite scientific reasons behind these predictions; they're not the work of crazy science fiction authors who are just trying to be as \\"far out\\" as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.....","review":"While I loved Dixon's \\"After Man: A Zoology of the Future\\" with a lot of passion, \\"The Future is Wild\\" was the biggest disappointment in my quest for the studies of future evolution.

Maybe the waters, but never the Earth. Another thing that got me angry was this mess about the extinction of mammals. Well, if history has any bearing, major classes never die out, they become something else, like when dinosaurs evolved into modern birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscientific","review":"Lots of pretty pictures, but there is no evidence that any of these creatures will exist in the future.

The bonus was an almost complete collection of the authours other short works complete with introductions by the authour. His range is wide and you can see his style develop over the years.

The tunes are all memorable- I find myself humming them all the time and my kids, ages 6 and 10, know most of the words. Is this a profound album? Hardly. But it never pretends to be anything more than it is- good music. If you get to see The Kennedys in performance, you'll run to buy their stuff.

What made it so special for me was that her personal story was interspersed with educational information about manic depression and illnesses that are either related or that it gets mistaken for. I gave it to a dear friend whose son was just diagnosed with manic depression. She said she not only learned from it, but it gave her hope for her son. She says she may give it to him to read.

Co-authoring with a medical writer was a *brilliant* idea. We read Patty's story, then we read the medical side of the story. The only thing I found disturbing was, like Dr Kay Jamison, Patty claims a Lithium a day does the trick. This can be misleading when many bipolars have to have meds assessed and re-assessed many many times. This gives the reader the undertone that if you're not a Lithium-responder, you're not quite right. Otherwise, an excellent book on the topic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life!","review":"Several yeas ago I bought this book because I believed my mother had Bipolar dissorder.

But when I read about Patty Duke and her own mood swings I knew I had bipolar dissorder. So I went to my doctor and handed him the book and said \\"I think I have this\\"...he asked many questions and in the end agreed with me, put me on lithium and from that day forward my life changed. Patty Duke's words saved my life.Her own story should be an encouragement to all who suffer from this horrible mental illness.

Sadly, books on this subject seem never to be able to speak to such people, and this one is no different.Am I therefore criticising it for not being all things to all people?

How Patty Duke lived to tell her story is a miracle. Thank God she finally found her way out of her madness She gives hope to her fellow sufferers. From the perspective of gut-wrenching pain just reading her account, the book works wonderfully. But as a narrative, I found it hard to follow. I felt jerked around from eposide to eposide. There didn't seem to be a timeline I could follow to know what happened, when. Also, it was very distracting to have to plow through the pages of medical, technical information that were dispersed throughout the book. Overall, it's a fine description of the illness, but frustrating to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal story & solid info. and references on bipolar dis","review":"I would say that this is one of the most informative books on manic-depression, or bipolar disorder. Patty Duke's work is read by all in the psychiatric community, and the fact that she became a spokesperson for mental health did wonders to remove some of its stigma. It does more than tell her personal story. It is filled with up-to-date information on the illness, and should be read by those with the disorder, as well as their family members. It gives hope to those with bipolar disorder who accept the fact that they must stay on their medication and keep appointments with their doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting","review":"It has been a month since I purchased the model, but it still hasn't arrived.

However, the tale is pleasurable for all ages...Instead of straight story with pictures, the pictures tell a lot of the story themselves, with the characters' dialogues bubbling out of their mouths and spilling across the pages. This gives each pirate and each character a really distinct personality, and brings the reader from the \\"the pirates did this, Roger did that, his mother did this\\" to a more character oriented book.The jokes may be a bit above the very young reader, but most children will understand and be entertained and adults reading the books may have to go back and enjoy it for themselves once the kids are tucked in bed!I ran across the book as a nanny to two little girls and bought a copy to keep for myself.

It is interesting only as a primary source of German recruiting material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duh!","review":"I expected something a lot better. The movie is boring, confusing, and pointless. The actors are great, but the plot is lame. It shows a middle-aged hallucinating Darwin as a total looser with a troubled and sad life.

Where Keynes is balanced and careful this movie is excessive and biased. It is a fiction about a character loosely based on Darwin who we are to believe is struggling to the point of mental illness to reject a literalist, Book of Genesis, account of the origins of life on earth. The movie squanders an excellent cast of actors and the opportunity to provide a glimpse into the personal life of one of the world's greatest intellects. It fictionalizes history to make it fit into the current argument between those who accept the evidence for evolution as spelled out in Darwin's Origins of the Species and the Christian Creationist's and their theory of intelligent design. The result is a biased account of history and a story that makes Darwin appear to be a pathetic neurotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creation DVD Fan","review":"This is a wonderful movie and I was so happy when Amazon.com made it available to US audiences!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OSCAR WINNING QUALITY!","review":"Sad, Beautiful, Torn, and yet humble.

Darwin would have approved of this telling of his personal struggles and the pushback he received from his research and findings. Darwin suffered personal tragedy and he wanted to believe in the teachings with which he had been infused, but he couldn't ignore his well-tested observations and managed to stand up and tell the truth. It is a refereshing story for those of us for whom science is fact and mythology is opinion, while respecting the debate and challenges both views present.

The shades of gray with so little black and white in story can be riviting but this just seemed a little flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading a Lifetime movie...","review":"This book was like reading a Lifetime movie. Not quite sure what time the story is set in. If there hadn't been a reference to a cell phone, I would place the time from the early 90's or late 80's. There was also a reference to a vice president that I'm not too familiar with, so I know the author has a more \\"seasoned\\" point of view of life if you catch my drift. It was also way too melodramatic and too slow for my taste. The ending left me quite unsatisfied. Read at your own risk. The only positive I have about the book is that the author has an excellent writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel Goddard","review":"Great mystery. A fast read,couldn't put it down.

Beautifully written and lots of surprises. And it was free."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can't Grow Your Own House!","review":"A deceiving, gimmicky title that doesn't measure up to the book's contents.Lots of color pictures of absolutely huge bamboo community structures (NOT houses!) that basically all look the same. There's hardly any variety - just huge bamboo roofs suspended on bamboo stilts designed by the book's author.I bought the book because it mentions \\"House\\" in the title but it hardly has any \\"houses\\" in it... maybe photo's of 3 bamboo houses in total.The book is written in German text with an English translation printed alongside... so half of each text page is taken up with the German text.The book shows a few pictures of bamboo joints made by filling the ends with concrete and embedded bolts secured to metal joints. It doesn't tell you where to buy those joints because they are custom made.That was the most useful information found in the book from my perspective.So... I'm still looking for a book about bamboo houses!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for building instructions","review":"This book has some great pictures of structures built with bamboo.

It is rumoured (but I confirm it) If you put a music-only cd into a music-only cd burner then force the drive open, put a cheap blank cd in. It doesn't complain, and does the job. Buy the Memorex, they're cheap and do the job. Whats all this about 'sound quality' Its digital? Get a new cd player. And scratch-resistant?

The author attempts to identify multiple levels of interpretation of Biblical passages, although the book is rather slim and really just scratches the surface of the levels of information encoded in the Bible. Besides the astronomical symbolism, there is also historical/racial propaganda, social engineering/moral persuasion, reference to extraterrestrial factions and activities, alchemical/spiritual symbolism for initiates, sacred geometry, and other types of coded information, involving multiple groups and agendas. A whole encyclopedia would be needed to thoroughly cover these topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Total psuedo - semi - scientific- new age garble. Save your money. Jabbar doesnt understand basic judeo-christian mythology. Nor is his astrology in anyway upto date or accurate. Another in his series of deceptive books.

I'd like to say something positive but can't. -5 out of 10 sorry Jabbar back to school with you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"After a month of commutes listening every morning and evening to Frank Muller's gunslinger rasp, I finally gave up and brought the last part of this tale into the house to listen. Roland's world is fasinating. The now drawn \\"three\\" are such deeply sympathetic characters that one cannot hope that they will (get better Mr. King!) live forever.The flashback that makes up much of this book is pure romantic western. For those who have read the previous books and heard reference to Cuthbert and Alaan, you must meet them. They are wonderfully drawn and great counterpoint to Roland.If you have loved this tale so far, there is nothing to disapoint here and everything to amuse and amaze."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never wanted a fictional charactor as much as Roland.","review":"I have read this series of books over the corse of five years. The amount of intrigue that acopanies Roland of Gilead is unmatched. I crave him. After finishing IV I went nucking futs for a good half an hour, ranting and stomping about. The book is almost 800 pages and not long enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing Meandering Fiasco.........","review":"I loved the Gunslinger. The next two books were great also, though a bit uneven......King gets a little too bogged down with the Odetta stuff. I was so psyched for Wizard and Glass, and then I found myself bored by it. This book needs some serious editing. There is an interesting, though not great, story buried in there somewhere if we can wade through and through and through....I hate to say it, but this book was actually BORING King seems like he doesn't know where to go next with this Tower series."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the greatest authors of all time","review":"I have been reading every thing i can find by S.King since I first read the gunslinger many years ago.and have become one of his biggest fans.and since reading wizard and glass,i have been anciously awaiting the next in this series.I just finished his latest novel \\"HEARTS IN ATLANTIS\\" and found it equaly ingrosing.but also linked to the gunslinger, as many of his storys are linked together.he has given me hope,that he will give us another in this series, hopfully soon.THANKS STEVE..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"This book almost beat out The Stand as my favorite Stephen King story, almost. When I finished and closed the book, I only wanted to open it again and start reading, I almost did! I can't wait for the next installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was a very intense adventure novel.","review":"This book is the fourth in the series. It starts out where the third book left off. It's very suspenseful, and filled with action. In the book Roland tells part of his past life, and that's most of the book. The story he tells is full of action, and adventure.I thought this book was very good, and I would reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"another superb King book","review":"Although the book did drag on at times, this fourth in the series of books about Roland was a great piece of writing by King. He lets the reader get an insight into Roland's past, and consequently, his behavior with his current partners on the trip to the dark tower. I can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's Greatest Work! Sums up everything he's ever written!","review":"This book tells a lot about Roland's past, most of which is pretty depressing. (Just thought I'd warn you.) But, it's one of those books you just can't put down. You will also learn a great deal about both Cuthbert and Alain. The mysterious Susan is also brought up, which will tear your heart to shreds. In general, this book mainly consists of the palaver between Roland and the rest of his ka-tet. It will both make you laugh 'til the cows come home and pull your heart to tears. A wonderful book, with many similarites in characters to King's other maginficent works. I believe this series is an ending/disclosure of all his works. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My God... It's so amazing.","review":"Next to Insomnia and the Stand, Wizard and Glass is Mr. King's best book ever. It takes place in the town of Hambry, where a conspiracy and a horrific holiday sacrifice are uncovered by the young Roland and his Ka-Tet. Wizard and Glass explores the real meaning of Ka and throws you into Roland's past, where betrayl and death linger in the shadows. By far the best Tower book, and maybe King's best overall, not only because of the plot, but because it shows a peak at Roland actually being a boy. (I couldn't believe the great gunslinger was a boy once either!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical 1990s King","review":"Mr. King, regretfully has become a better actor than author. His first works were wonderful detailed stories. Now his works are suitable for the funny papers or soap operas. On and on and on and on ad nauseatum"},{"rating":"2","title":"I suggest that you stop here.","review":"This is the last of The Dark Tower novels that is worth reading. I finished this yesterday, and it was great. The first four Dark Tower novels have good depth in their story. Great writting by Stephen King. I recommend avoiding the last three books and stick with the first four. You'll like this book, so give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"First two were amazing","review":"The Gunslinger and the drawing of the three are amazing. But 3 and 4 are lacking. Wizard and Glass rambles as if nothing was edited out. It loses focus and King just stops. I'm looking forward to the next one, but if its as much of a dog as this one was - I'm driving to the lot in NY and pulling the rose myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance in the middle of a horror novel?????","review":"I really enjoyed the first three Dark Tower books, so I figured I would read this one. After the first few pages, Stephen KIng goes back into Rolands past to write about Rolands first love. Gag me. It would have been ok if she was a tough female and had some substance, but she didn't! And why do we want to read a love story in the middle of a horror novel? I wanted to skip past that part, but somehow I finally got through it all and the only reason I did was because I thought that maybe it would get better. I guess it did, because she died so now we don't have to hear about her much more. However, the first three books in the series are quite good (I especially liked number 2) so do read those, and just skim this one. Hopefully book 5 will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wizard and Glass","review":"This was the most disappointing Stephen King book I have read - and I have read just about everything he has written. There is nothing original here. He borrows from Lord of the Rings, he borrow from Star Wars, the Wizard of Oz, and himself (The Stand, The Talisman co-written with Peter Straub). The net result is a book that simply does not hang together and is really impossible to take seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From King's Best","review":"While I'm not surprised that most people are gushing over this book, I am surprised that others have picked up on what I have griped on about W&G. The interlude/flashback story was for me a real chore to get through. It was like reading a young adult romance novel. The hero and heroine perfect and flawless mentally and physically versus the bad guys who either slept with whores or were ugly outside as well as in. It was completely unrealistic and boring and irritating to read. The closest thing I can think of is watching a James Bond movie. You know what's going to happen before it happens and the characters (Susan the stereotypical strong female heroine) and storyline (hint, don't blame me, it was ka.)were predictable and poorly drawn. Forget the trouble with the Dark Tower, someone needs to put right was has been plaguing King's writing these last few years. The sickness has even spread to the Dark Tower."},{"rating":"1","title":"YERRR OUT","review":"Because he is The Great Stephen King, he can't get a 1. But like any great home run hitter King either drives it over the fence, or he strikes out. Mr. King...go have a seat on the bench.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Stephen King please stand up?","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The first three volumes in the Dark Tower saga are some of my favourite King novels of all time. Unfortunately, Wizard and Glass will not join them. DT4 starts off great, concluding the tale of Blaine, the psychotic, riddle-loving monorail. From there, it moves on to a long, drawn out flashback that contributes very little to the mythology of the Dark Tower. Lastly, just when it looks like we may get back to the real story, King slaps together a truly awful Wizard of Oz scenario. If you're looking for a sappy romance with a heavy helping of B-Western tragedy thrown in, give it a shot. However, if you're expecting more tales of adventure in Midworld, wait for the next volume. You won't have missed a thing. Maybe it's just me, but I haven't like a single King book since Needful Things. Wouldn't it be ironic to find that his talent was buried in the ruins of Castle Rock?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as a pink glowing Deamon moon...","review":"The story is amazing and answer a lot questions for Rolands past.I think its his Ka to write such marvellous stories... An advise: DONT BUY THIS BOOK DURING YOUR EXAMS...the result will be horrifing :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best!","review":"Congratulations Mr. King, this was a superb book! I can't tell you how moved I was by the character of Susan, I have never been so touched by a character in a book, save for \\"The Body\\" and that was over 10 years ago. I am anxiously awaiting the rest of the series, keep up the great work! -Erin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely one of King's best books","review":"In the fourth installment of King's DT saga readers find out more about Roland's past and his human side. This book is entertaining and completely the reader into the world that King has created. Anyone who feels this book starts off slow, hasn't read much King. The way The Stand and the Wizard of Oz are tied in is really interesting. This book is a fun read if you like King and the DT series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better, they keep getting better","review":"Fantastic tale that further blends all the universes of Stephen Kings world together. Rolands flashback is a fantastic tale. The only sore part is the defeat of Blane, which seemed hastily written to get on with the new story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deepens the interest for Dark Tower fans.","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. The flashback to Roland's past was an engrossing experience throughout. The death of Susan Delgado was pretty crushing, I had to read it a few times to let it sink in. I'm sure any DT fan already has this, but if not, get it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Tower : Movie ?","review":"This Books would make a fantastic movie for sure. Too bad we cant CLINT EASTWOOD starring as Roland, as Clint is maybe too old by now :) Thanx to Mr. King for this fantastic Story! I WANT PART V !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted a Western and I got a romance.","review":"I was a huge fan of The Dark Tower until I read the Wizard and the Glass. I expected a young Roland to earn his guns and become a great gunslinger. I got a Harliquin Romance, full of flowing blond locks, and heaving bossoms.I doubt I will continue the seiries after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Counter Didn't Go Any Lower","review":"I wonder from reading the comments of other readers whether we read the same book.This was an awful, awful tome. It was in dire need of a decent editor, who should have cut out AT LEAST half of the book. The disjointed plot is, of course, standard for the Dark Tower Series. The puerile prose must be read to be believed.I'm not kidding.Spare, expressive elegance is nowhere to be found. But Mr. King will be forgiven sins worse than this for producing such wonders as Shawshank Redemption, The Body, Christine and, most of all, the Shining. Mr. King can sell lots of anything now. People such as I, seeking echoes of earlier wonder, will buy. And buy. And buy.One would hope that he would have more pride.The only positive was that I bought this in the paperback UK edition, and did not have to pay the hardcover price.Stay away. Very, very far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got It The Day It Came Out","review":"While waiting years for this book to be written I wondered what King had in store for us. I was very pleased with every turn of the page. The crew followed the path to the Tower with all of it's mystery and thrill, even the possibility of catching Walter, the man in black. At the same time we learned of Roland's past. Almost a prequel, but not quite. Still, it gives us more insight to the mind of the Gunslinger.It goes without saying, Kings writing and creativity are amazing. This book has a wonderful mix of an old western, Armageddon, fantasy, and romance. Steve pulls it off beautifully!From Mark John SternalAuthor of \\"GUITAR: Total Scales Techniques and Applications\\"\\"GUITAR: Probable Chords\\"\\"Complete Guitar By Ear\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A flash back, but I love it.","review":"Roland tells the story of Mejis to Eddie, Jake and Susannah. They don't make much progress on their quest for the Dark Tower, but the story of Roland, Cuthbert and Alain is the best part of any of the Dark Tower books. This book is the highlight of the Dark Tower series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"In a superior series, this is an oustanding book. Explaining so much about the Gunslinger we love, yet loathe at the same time. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO WOMAN HAS THE POWER TO DISTRACT THE GUNSLINGER!","review":"I find it odd that there are so many reviews stating that this book was their favorite of the series. Only because it was my least favorite so far. It still was an excellent book; please do not misunderstand me. It is just that I personally had a hard time stepping back into the Gunslinger's childhood when I was so involved with what his gang was experiencing. It still gave me the chance to \\"feel\\" the youth of the character, I just wish that it was book one or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the Dark Tower Series!","review":"All of my doubts about the Dark Tower Series completely disappeared once I read this fourth installment of Roland's story. This compelling prequel finally answers some of the questions of Roland's past. You can learn all the secrets about Roland's friends and his family, plus an entertaining love story develops between Roland and Susan Delgado. The bad characters are pure evil, and the good characters make you laugh and cry. I couldn't put it down on a FIVE-HOUR plane trip!The book is very easy to get into because the beginning scene on the brainy train Blaine is one of the best sequences I have ever read. I read that chapter a few times because I liked it so much. The Wizard of Oz references are placed well, and it's fun to figure them out. This book is a great romantic fantasy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST SK BOOK TO DATE!!!!","review":"I told a friend of mine that I was reading a book by Stephen King and she said, \\"I don't like horror books\\". I would like to start off by saying that this book is about as far from horror as you can possibly get.(yet it is still scary) It is by far the best Stephen King book I have ever read, with the exception of The Stand.This book kept me up late into the evenings because I couldn't put it down. It is filled with stunning imagery and excellent character development. I think it could easily stand on its own, seperate from the DT series. I am not a huge fan of love stories, but with this book I may have to change my opinion.Please, please, please Mr. King don't make us wait another 6 years for the next installment. I had to go back and reread for the second time the other three books before I would pick up W&G."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't King read this one, too?","review":"As an avid listener of the previous three installments of the Gunslinger story, I was disappointed in this new release. I'd gotten more than used to S. King's peculiar nasal drone, and that he was reading his own story added depth that his voice didn't. So what happened? Who's this new guy with the breathy, \\"don't take this stuff too seriously, folks; it's only pop fiction\\" voice? Frankly, his mannerisms are distracting -- KNOWING that Eddie probably says \\"dis\\" and \\"dat\\" but not hearing him do it through hours and hours of reading until now was jarring, and that's only the beginning of the problem.Alas, the story's great; I'm hooked; and I'm unfortunately forced to be a listener rather than a reader. But the NEXT installment had better be read by its father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version Issues","review":"I am just starting Wizard and Glass, so the review is not for the content but for issues related to the Kindle Version. I often read at bedtime in the dark using the black background feature of the kindle. The text on this specific book is colored gray, so I cannot read gray on black. Very disappointed in this issue. It is not device specific either. This occurs on Kindle for iPhone and Kindle Fire. It also shows gray on the Kindle for Mac app. I suspect this is how the publisher/author decided to format the book. Maybe Sepia will limit the light in the room and allow me to read the book. Curious if the iBook version is the same. I may try a sample to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"More King Awesomeness!!","review":"So far, there has not been a BAD Dark Tower book. What a very good series of books!! Thank you, Steven King!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a sequel and a prequel!","review":"Number four of Kings Dark Tower starts off amazing tying up some loose ends. Then the story goes into some reflecting bits. Most of this book tells the story of Roland many years before taking up his search for the Tower. This is a good thing and a bad thing.The Good: You really get to know the mysterious Roland so much better. His back story is exciting and emotional. It also tells a self contained story within the confines of this large series. Characters are great and King manages to keep the suspense pretty high.The Bad: It loses some of the narrative edge of the last two because it really is just a story Roland tells. That means you don't get as much of Rolands Ka tet as you might like.Overall this is just another solid entry into the Dark Tower saga. Constant Reader is entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Least Favorite of the Series So Far","review":"While the writing is still brilliant and Stephen King creates an incredible story. I was dying to see my beloved characters get closer to their Dark Tower, but most of the book is a flashback to a particular episode of Roland's past. If this had been the first or second book in the series, I would probably have been just fine with this, but at this point I was so invested in the current quest that I didn't want to spend an entire novel focusing on the backstory of only one of them. However, if you've made it this far, you must keep reading. The Dark Tower is only a few books away..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story within a story","review":"I have just finished The Dark Tower IV and feel I have read a truly epic tale. The main focus in Wizard and Glass is the backstory of Roland and how he learned of the tower and began his search. It is part love story, part western and part fantasy, creating a perfect storytelling mix. The world King creates intertwines reality and fiction, both his and other author's works, into a surreal tapestry. It is enjoyable and disorienting and above all a stroke of genius.The book is long and while I wouldn't cut down the story itself, the telling of it would have benefited from some light handed editing. Anyone enjoying the Dark Tower series up to book 3 should definitely continue on. This is perhaps the best so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts Slow but Ends Great!","review":"This book provides great insight into Roland's past. Once the story got going, I just couldn't put it down. This book also shows what Roland's world looked like before \\"The Gunslinger.\\" It definitely has some bitter-sweet moments, and that is what makes it such a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to see the story continue but.....boring!","review":"I really waited a long time for this one and was sorely disappointed. It was nice to see the next book come out, though, and I look forward to the fifth and hopefully better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the dark tower- books.","review":"There is some good parts in this book, but mostly it's VERY boring. Lovestory between Roland and Susan is the worst part; I havent ever read anything that boring and irritating. I hope that next book is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Chapter Yet","review":"The fourth, and what I felt best chapter thus far of the Dark Tower Series mostly leaves Eddie, Susannah, Jake, and Bumbler Oy behind as we get a peek into the past of Roland and the great love of his life. King mostly departs from his usual blend of modern day horror and gore and instead weaves a wonderfully heartfelt and captivating Western infused love story. Here we're introduced to a much younger and untainted Roland, as well as pals Cuthbert and Alain. But it's the fair haired beauty Susan and her complicated and tragic destiny that intertwines with the Gunslinger and drives the bulk of the book. A final chapter returns us to our regular band of merry travellers with a conclusion drawn from \\"the Wizard of Oz' which was a little disconnecting in relation to everything that had preceded it. Still, the book overall is a great ride that's not the usual King fare, and doesn't fall into the trap of waiting for something to happen while galloping towards the end of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL AND SUSPENCEFUL","review":"I have read this book and found that like book two of the Darktower epic it deals with the emotions and the untold parts of the stories that you haven't yet heard. It keeps you on your feet definetly a thinking book. If you don't want to think about a story as you read it don't read this book. If you do this is your kind of book. I LOVED IT!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Journey to The Dark Tower stalls...","review":"Steven King writes an epic western, a tale of love and sacrifice. Too bad he used this series to tell the story. This could have been a tale set in the old west, another genre King could have been put his stamp on but instead the reader is sent through a journey into Roland's past. King's a craftsman and the story moves along but it didn't move the journey towards the tower any closer. It was a story King felt he needed to tell but maybe it didn't need to be part of Roland's journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world has moved on.....","review":"Stephen King DT series keeps me enthralled even when I'm not reading them! Mr.King I hope the next one to die in the story isn't who I think it is. For some reason I seem to know whats going to happen in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"All hail the King. Wizard and Glass is a Masterpiece.","review":"Not often do I read a book that not only captives my mind, but embraces my emotions as well. However, Wizard and Glass has done both. In this tale of Roland of Gileads early life you come in touch with Roland as a person. A trait hardly explored in the last three novels. This is Rolands story. It is a story of the horror, the courage, and the love of a boy that lives in a world that has moved on. Stephen King was true in his story telling. I not only believe that this is the best book in the Dark Tower series but the best book I have ever read. I advice to you is read it, you will not be let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, but DT3 was really better","review":"Well, after a long while waiting, finally there was the book and i read it at once. I really love it, but I have to say, that the story of susan was a bit to long and the story itself (the way of the ka-tet) was to short. Also I didn't like the thing with the \\"wizard of Oz\\". it didn't really fit in. All in all it is a good book, but the 3rd part of the series was a lot better"},{"rating":"2","title":"ARE YOU MADS?????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????","review":"This is referred to all KING's latest work detractors.The flashback not only clarifies Roland'past,but is one of the most KING's well written piece.FEEL YOU ASHAMED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Finally,excuse for my probably errated english."},{"rating":"1","title":"You and King would do better reading Harlequin","review":"After reading three volumes, I had expected more than a meandering and largely aimless adventure tale. For king completists only. If you want to be really disappointed, read volume 4 Wizard and Glass. After barely working the plotline, we jump to 450 pages of a mediocre love story. King needs to read some Harlequin to get the basics down. I fell asleep several times, then skipped 400 pages back to the main plot. The main plot does a terrible send-up on Baum books, most notably the Wizard of Oz.Question:what do they wear when they throw away the ruby cowboy boots? beats me, King apparently is going to have them walk for 4 more volumes barefoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope I die before the next one&judging from history I will","review":"Unfortunatly, I was sucked into this retched *trilogy* by the author's name. Worse yet, I cannot put down garbage like this once I have started. (Yes, I am compulsive-obsessive) The first three books in this series were far fetched and not very well written, but at least the plot was slightly interesting. I was livid when I got to the end of the third book and it just stopped. It seems to me there are better ways to pay for that new house than to put out a book that is still in progress! I waited...for a *very* long time for this book. I was disgusted!!! It is poorly written, with a sloshy plot that is beyond the realm of sci-fi, meandering into blithering, unbelievable rantings. It explores nothing. It brings up no interesting concepts or ideas. I was ill by the time I finished it! I do want to thank Mr. king for finally curing me of my incessant need to finish a series even if it is trash though. I will not read the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO MORE, PLEASE!!!","review":"I personally like Stephen King and his work but this series is among the WORST CRAP I have ever laid my eyes on.

As others have pointed out, it seems SK no longer feels the need to EDIT his books. This story was almost completely un-necessary. I didn't WANT all the detail, I was perfectly happy with the little hints about Roland's past that he had already given us. If I wanted to read a romance, I would not have picked up a Stephen King book in the first place. I have to wonder if people who are calling this 'King's Best' have even READ anything else he wrote?

I'm a big fan of king (the 'k' is small when the work is this poor.) and this is underdeveloped, predictable, unresolved, rehashed, overdone, verbose and painful reading. king in his comments remarks that this work was difficult to write and forced by the request of correspondence. Quite obviously. king delivers on none of the meager promises made by the tale. He's done most of it before (see The Stand, Dragon's Tears, earlier Dark Tower). What he hasn't done, others have (see Lord of the Rings, Tower of Geburah, on and on...) And the 'Wizard of Oz' junket has been done often and with more style (see Heinlein, and others). Good god amighty, steve. Write what you want, not what others ask, and ask for a well read and unintimidated editor. And the rest of you reviewers, if you liked this, try Tolkein, C.S.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed by this book. I found it slightly boring. The general story was great but I felt that there was far too much detail. Usually I love the detail that Stephen King goes into - it adds to the story - in this case I felt that it was mostly filler. This, however, does not put me off - I greatly look forward to the next in the series and Stephen King remains one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard reading, a sad, depressing story","review":"I loved the first three Dark Tower books. Wizard and Glass is well written, but I don't enjoy reading depressing books, nor books where I know one of my favorite characters is doomed to die horribly. If you paid attention to clues in the first three books, you know exactly how this book ends--and it ain't nice.Wizard in Glass is 90 percent prehistory and like all prequels it suffers because the reader knows what's going to happen. It's like watching the prequel Star Wars movies knowing that Anakin Skywalker is inevitably going to become Dark Vader (Wizard and Glass is waaaaay better written than those movies, however).This book fleshes out and enriches Roland's character, ultimately making him better for it, but I found myself flipping pages (tapping, I suppose, on my Kindle) to get through it. It took weeks of forced reading to get through. The first three Dark Tower books I could not put down.I'm on to book 5, hoping the momentum of the story returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly masterful storytelling accomplishment!","review":"I have been a huge fan of Stephen King's work for many years, but somehow never read the Dark Tower Series, and am thoroughlyenjoying it now!Will definitely be buying and enjoying all eight volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book in series","review":"I wasn't sure how many stars to give this book because while I really enjoyed the first 100 pages or so, with the escape from Blaine the Train and the last 80 pages are so were excellent, too. I found the flashback really boring and actually skipped over most of it. There is a flashback to when Roland was 14 but it lasts about 570 pages! And it really isnt neccessary to the plot either.Overall, a good entry in the series. If yiou like the flashback, great, you'll love this book. If not, it can be easily skipped. And the Wizard of Oz world in the last 80 pages was brilliant idea. Looking forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series Takes Huge Step Backwards, Literally and Figuratively.","review":"I really enjoyed The Waste Lands (Book 3), but I found this book nearly impossible to finish.

It was at first hard to get into but after the first hundred or so pages It became harder and harder for me to put it down. It was fasinating to read about Rolands adventures as a young gunslinger. I felt that this was Kings most romantic work in the Dark Tower. If you have not read the first three, what are you waiting for? If you have, then do not miss out on an extrodinary continuation to a gripping story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite installment of the Dark Tower Series","review":"This book was probably my favorite of the 7 books of the Dark Tower Series. When I first read that this book will mainly be Roland telling the story of his youth, I wasn't looking forward to it much, but after getting into the book some I was deeply engrossed in his wonderfully told story. One tip, I listened to the Audiobook and the narrarator did excellent!!! If you have the chance to listen to the audiobook, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by the Pound Harlequin Romance","review":"I would give the first three Dark Tower books four stars.

Give me a break and get me out of this screed!

King isn't anywhere near \\"literary\\" - his prose is passive and unimaginative (too many was's and is's, too much telling and not enough showing). Compared to horror kingpin's Poe and Lovecraft, King is shoddy - his novels are Pulp Fiction, nothing poetic about them. BUT - King does focus on character-based, rather than plot-based fiction - this is what makes him worthwhile to read - focusing on the characters of his stories.I love his Dark Tower series - surrealistic and mysterious. This 4th one, though, Wizard and Gass, disappointed me - too much straight storytelling, and hackneyed characterization. Pulp and not enough mystery. Bleh.."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Never End","review":"Wizard and Glass was a good read, if you care not about the future of the series. Even though Mr. King feels he could actually end this series in his lifetime, I seriously doubt it.It is definately the best in the Dark Tower series, but there is a reason for that. The novel tells the story of Roland's first love, when he was young, and therefore the wonderful characters of his youth are with him. Cuthbert and Alain are exellent characters, whom you wish to discover more so than the droll companions which accompany the older Roland on his quest to the Dark Tower. I would much rather find out what happens to those childhood companions than see what awaits the merry crew in the Dark Tower.Mr. King must realize this as well, therefore he will spend the next couple of novels telling the story of their demise. That leaves him little time to tell the REAL story.Frankly, that's fine with me. When Roland stops reminicing about his troubled past, I'll stop reading about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost the best Dark Tower book yet.","review":"Although not as compelling as DK III, this latest installment of the Dark Tower series is well worth the read. The Wizard of OZ part was cheese, but an interesting twist. Looking forward to DK V. Hope we don't have to wait five years this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre!!! Not worth reading","review":"SK has obviously struggled with the entire series and all four books are filled with inconsistencies and contradictions as pointed out by a previous reviewer. When he can't make parts of the story come together he just wings it and somewhow muddles through. He has become to busy as Stephen King Inc., to give us the benefit of his unique talents. While he does have a phenomenal imagination, his writing has become mediocre. He hasn't produced anything worthwhile for a long time. As it were, this book and the entire series is not worth reading and there are too many books available in this world that are worthwile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling with vivid imagery","review":"King has done it again. This one doesn't disappoint the devoted fans of this series. ROland finds love, an evil witch and the coldness of the world we live in today. King does a great job of paradoxing the Wizard of Oz. And also reminding us once again of the apocalyptic vision of The Stand with Randall Flagg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, the flashback is worth it","review":"I can not understand that some of you so called \\"Dark Tower fans\\" can say that the entire flashback sequence was stupid - it was King's most beautiful writing of his career, and as a teen - it was right on with the feelings of teenage love and angst. So anyone that is considering buying this book, if you want to be submerged into an amazing world and fall in love and love to hate charachters, buy this book. If you haven't read the first three, read them first so it all means more to you. Even the parts where they are all in *****************SPOILERS************* Topeka and the palace place with Flagg ***********END SPOILERSare beautiful, funny and scary. This is King's best book ever and one of the best books ever written!!!BUY THIS BOOK NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.","review":"Stephen King has truly outdone himself. This book is just as good as the previous ones, in terms of suspence and action, but even better in terms of writing style, and depth. Furthermore, the romance in the novel (the fulcrum of most of the bad reviews, it seems), is by no means wishy-washy, and is a necessary step in Roland's character development. Overall, this is one of King's finest works, and a must read for anybody who enjoys a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put this book down. Reading it is a must!!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutely loved reading this book. At almost 700 pages, it seems like it will take forever. But, you just get so engrossed in the book that you finish it rather quickly. I read this book, not realizing that it was a part of a series. Now, I'm going back and reading the first three. I'm sure they will be every bit as intriguing as The Wizard & The Glass. Enjoy the book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the future the past","review":"This book is the fourth in the dark tower series. I waited a long time for it to come out we find our KA-TET right where we left them but this book takes us deep into Roland's past. For those who are into this series this book is a must read (of course). If you never have read any of the others you can still enjoy this book (and then read the others knowing more than I did about Roland) I personaly don't read any thing else that King writes but this series facinates me. Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long... so, so long","review":"This is a good book. I mean it. But man, this dude can't bring himself to edit. I don't often feel like King's books are too long, but that's because he usually keeps me on my toes by having a lot of stuff happen. This time, nothing happens. Then, nothing happens some more. Seriously: there's about 300 pages in here where the only part of the plot that's actually moving is King's chronicling of a teenage crush. Now, I'm all for teenage crushes, and I don't expect King to be another Stendahl or whatever, but man, they do get old if you read about them enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard and Glass","review":"These books are addicting.

A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of the series","review":"I wouldn't recommend this one even to fans of the previous three. The change of direction in the type of story he's telling seems to suggest he doesn't really understand why the first three are so good in the first place. King cannot write romance and I'm not quite sure why he took a stab at it here (I'd venture a guess that most fans of the Dark Tower series, which I am, aren't exactly fans of sappy romances anyway...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Epic book of Stephen Kings Epic tales","review":"Wizard & Glass is the best Stephen King book I have read. I enjoyed the dark tower series a lot, this is by far the best book of the series though - the flashback story of Roland's, the last gunslinger, past is terrifically mystifying and capturing and also devistatingly sad. It is an epic tale of adventure, love, magic and tragedy. I recommend this book with out a hestitation. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE IS ANOTHER CHAPTER AFTER THIS BOOK!!!","review":"Hello...I already reviewed this a few months back (didn't like the book much, too much romance which I can't stand, and it gives details about Roland's past that I preferred to have remain a mystery). BUT I wanted to let all of you who LOVE this series to know that there is another part of the story not contained in the 4 main books. Read \\"LEGENDS\\" an anthology which contains a great 'Gunslinger' story called \\"The Little Sisters of Eluria.\\" It is MUST READ stuff for fans of the Dark Tower series. Editied by Martin Greenberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please help me find the plot.","review":"Although I have thorougly enjoyed the series so far, I feel that Mr King has been allowed far to much license by his editors in recent years and has stopped considering that his readers might want to have a life outside spending several weeks reading his latest work. The ongoing plot of The Dark Tower cycle occupies less than a fifth of this weighty tome, The remainder being an extended look into the past of the central character, The Gunslinger-Roland. Although we were promised this in the argument at the end of the (first or second, I forget) book, had I realised that this was all the fourth book would contain I would have been less eager for it's publication (Oh, and look, here's Randall Flagg again, what a surprise!) Heres hoping Mr King can find it in his heart to try and return to form for the next offering from Rolands world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King has spoken","review":"As a Constant Reader since I sat on my Daddy's lap looking through various King titles, I was beguiled by Wizard and Glass as a continuation of my King obessesion. Some readers complain that it was needlessly long and boring, but I say, that if you read King, you know that the Dark Tower series will be ten or twelve volumes (at least) in the making. Why complain? Yes, volume four took five long years; yes, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake were almost non-existant. But what about the superb flashback to the real Roland? Is'nt he what it's all about? Wouldn't you love to know a little more about his sufferings and loves? I was heartbroken by this book, and I am reluctantly waiting what could probably be another five years. However, I consider the fact that I have been collecting data on Roland's quest through The Eyes of the Dragon, The Stand, Insomnia, and Dark Towers 1-3. If this is a life-long commitment, then wish King luck, and prepare to be amazed. Much love Constant Readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"King stacks the deck with \\"Wizard and Glass\\"","review":"After a seemingly endless wait since \\"The Waste Lands\\", King has finally delivered the fourth chapter of the Dark Tower saga. In this one, he finally tells us about what happened to Roland prior to the \\"The Gunslinger.\\" Was it worth the wait? Well, yes and no. The story is well-structured, imaginative, and genuinely moving, but like many of King's recent works, it is bloated. However, King does tell us the things that have made Roland the man he is, and gets us to root for his heroes, as always. Nobody does characterization like King. He is also getting more daring with the references to his other novels. This gamble could work one of two ways, it could either create a genuine fantasy universe, or it could go over the line into self-indulgence. Only time will tell what happens, but all in all King is delivering one of the great fantasy epics of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum - The last 50 pages were worth it","review":"Alright...I admit that some background is nice but a whole novel dedicated to it? I found that this installment in the Dark Tower series was pointless and boring. The story itself was very well written but could have been narrowed into 100 pages. Compared to the other Dark Tower books..this one pales in excitment and intrigue. Shouldn't the novel focus more on \\"The Dark Tower\\" (hence the title of the series) and less on Rolands past? I must say that the last 50 pages of the novel was worth the monotany of the the first part. Hopefully the next installment will be more of how they get to the tower and less of a history lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"King is the King!","review":"I eagerly awaited this installment wondering what would become of Roland and company.

I thought that the book would clear everything up, and it did. The problem I had was the length. I wanted him to end the book. Now we all have to wait for the fifth book, which by the way these stories are coming out will be awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful shift in gears!","review":"I loved this book. It lends insight to what makes Roland tick; until now he was the biggest enigma in the ka-tet. Through use of this flashback story we finally begin to understand where the Gunslinger's single-minded pursuit of the Dark Tower stems from. He also becomes more human in the reader's eyes as a result. Hopefully Mr. King will now continue with the plot in a more linear fashion. I would hate to see this story going nowhere fast in the fashion of Robert Jordan's WOT. Thanks for a great read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than The Stand!","review":"After enjoying the first three Dark Tower books, I could not wait until book four. After several years, I was very pleased with the final product of Mr. King. I could not stop reading this book, 1 and 1/2 days later I finished and could finally get some sleep. Steven King has matched and surpassed The Stand, and I am looking forward to book five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizard and Glass Review","review":"The fourth book of the Dark Tower series is very interesting and keeps me wanting more.

Thank You Stephen King!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing series!","review":"I was hesistant about reading anything by Stephen King, as I'm not a fan of horror, but the Dark Tower series is incredible. This books feels a little slow after the rapid pace of the first three, but as you read it, you are completely sucked in to Roland's young life. Don't let that scare you off!

They absolutely love it! We did have problems with the rim falling off easily at first; but I called Little Tikes and they helped me solve the problem. They told me to take the backboard off, lay it on the floor and attach the hoop and then actually step on the flat part of the hoop until I heard it snap into place. This worked like a charm and the hoop hasn't fallen off since. We all enjoy playing basketball. Little Tikes has great toys and their customer service folks are really helpful if there's ever a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn good toy, my 20m old girl LOVES it!","review":"This basketball set is great. As long as you attach the rim according to instructions and fill the base w/sand (use a wide mouth funnel), it will not come apart or tip over easily. My 20m old girl uses it almost every day, many times twice a day. Her 8 yr., 5 yr. and 2 yr. old cousins also love it. People who have had problems with the rim coming off did not attach it properly and those that tip over did not put sand in the base. It would be a good idea to buy a couple of extra same size balls and a small hand pump for them, especially if more than one child uses it at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another GREAT TOY from Little Tikes!","review":"My son received this when he was one and we set it up in the living room...

The height adjustment is a very good feature because our son is very tall for his age - it seems like we're adjusting it all the time. We have nothing bad at all to say about this product.

I thought it would be good because it can be used indoors or outdoors. (Theheat in the summer, makes it too hot to play outside) I thought it may bea little \\"old\\" for her but she loves it. It can be lowered so a one-yearold can reach it. My sister says it can be tippy so you have to make sure it has the sand added to the base.

I would have to recommend this for all kids and am thinking about getting one for my 2-year old daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid fun","review":"solid little basketball set for toddler (my son is 13 months old and is just tall enough to dunk at the lowest setting).

It seems like it is going to hold up well. We might have to fill the base though for a little more stability. I saw on another review someone said something about turning the music off on this toy because it was annoying, but there is no music on it. They must have meant to review something else I think.

I delayed buying this toy for over 6 months because of the bad reviews it received. Let me allay your fears, this toy is very durable if you put it together properly and fill it with sand. Do not deprive your child or yourself of this much fun. My days of rigging the over the door hoops to chairs, the fridge, or radiators are over! My 18 month old is having the time of his life.It may not be educational, but it sure is fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I've purchased many Little Tikes toys; however, this one was a definite disappointment. My two year old loves basketball and loves all of her other Little Tikes toys. Immediately after purchasing it; she was so excited that she could hardly wait until we put it together. Assembly is easy and very painless. However, the plastic rim continues to detach from the baseboard during play. The plastic lacks the ability to remain attached even during light play. When she walks up and gently places the ball into the net, the rim still falls onto the floor. She is very disappointed. Our family is very displeased in the durability and performance of the Easy Score Basketball set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy.","review":"We bought this for our 22 mo old son for christmas.

It was easy to put together. Santa appreciated that. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Christmas present!","review":"I bought this basketball set for my son's Christmas gift this year. My husband loves it as much as my son! When my husband gets home from work they spend at least 30 mins playing ball. It is easy to adjust and the ball is just right for his little hands. We live in an apartment so it stays inside and we don't have sand in it.

My toddler loves to play ball, and he was interested in the basketball hoop at Gymboree. However, I found two problems with this set, and I'm returning it after one day of play. First, the plug for the water hole does not plug in tightly. If the base is tipped over, water spills out. Second, the rim/hoop falls down every three times my toddler puts the ball in. He loves to shoot the ball, but I have to keep putting the rim back in. I'll be looking for another set."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BE FOOLED","review":"I paid more than I should have. I overpaid because this toy was advertised in cute girly colors, yellow and purple. I could have spent $10 less and gotten free shipping had I known I was going to get a blue and black toy.

His writing style is arguably one of the most lucid and emotional found on modern shelves. Yet he twists our world into frightening - sometimes shocking - images that will certainly haunt you long after you put down his work. He is not for the faint-hearted.Imajica is perhaps Barker's best novel - it is certainly my favorite.From a philosophically adept literary opening, Barker slam-dunks the reader into a dark world of mysticism and bloodshed. As his central characters struggle to solve the mysteries that surround themselves, including sinister revelations about their own identities, Barker neatly weaves an epic that explores our views of God, gender, sex and mortality.Even if you are already dead, do not miss this novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest novel I have ever read","review":"The day I found Imajica on the shelves, I was intrigued by the wonderful cover, and having already read a wonderful Clive Barker novel (The Thief of Always) I picked up a copy of Book 1. I have to admit I was confused at first, it really threw me, but once I climbed into this surreal world. I loved every minute of this breath-taking epic, enticed by the lurid boundary-breaking love scenes, saddened by the tales of woe and even heart-poundingly excited by everything this has to offer. I have to admit that Clive Barker isn't that high on my favorite authors list, but this masterpiece will always be re-read and passed on through every generation of my family from now on.

I swear, I don't care about a single one of these characters, and the plot is so meandering... it's like being lost in someone's dream. While I find dreams interesting, they generally aren't coherant enough for a 500 page novel.I enjoy a wide variety of books, and I'm usually pretty forgiving. I usually read a book of this length in a day or two, this one took me over a week. Far from being the \\"book you can't put down\\" this book just seemed to ramble on and on. Each new plot twist seemed like a gratuitous and poorly thought through whim on the part of the author.

I am, being 37, your stereotypical Tom Baker fan, but SM was always just annoying whereas the other doctors were just different.. I did however have a vague recollection that there was a SM ep I liked and thought it was this one. Nope. It was Ghost Light. Acting is bad at best. Plot suffers from too little said to let you know what the hades is going on yet too much babbling about other personal issues that meant squat to fans of the show. ugh.. Buy the Two Doctors instead.

It IS one of the better McCoy stories, and that's the good news. The bad news is that it's still awful. There's WAY too much going on in this story to have it make sense in the short amount of time television gives you to explain it. There's tons of subplots, various theories about what's actually going on in the story, too many characters, and the whole thing just comes off as a pompous mess.

This one is at least watchable, with no Kangs in sight, but once again, the story suffers from McCoy's acting. Either he simply can't act, and hamming it up is just his method of acting or he refuses to take the material seriously. Either way, he is just incapable of saving a bad script in the way Tom baker could on the strength of his charm alone.

There is a lack of atmosphere,and frankly it is too well lit for scary theme. It does not persuade."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too little a little too late","review":"When watching this episode, I got the impression and the pride that Sylvester McCoy and Sophie aldred were giving their all to save the show. By his third season, McCoy seems very comfortable being Doctor Who, finding his unique personality, and delivered the best performance possible giving the weak scripts to work with. This story was the direction the show should have started going in, but alas two years of ridiculous stories/scripts like \\"Delta and the Bannermen\\", \\"The Happiness Patrol\\", \\"Paradise Towers\\", etc. had done the damage to the ratings and loyal fans. That combined with neglect from the BBC was the death knell of the show.

I had a difficult time making up my mind between the X20 and Breadman's TR4000. After determining that the TR4000 still only had one kneeder I went with the X20, even though the ZO people said they still used the same non stick, interior coating. After receiving the machine and using it several times I do not believe the coating will cause any problem, if treated as directed.

The other bonus is that I can control the ingredients going into the bread. So far, every loaf came out pretty good.

Right at the programmed time, I had a wonderful loaf of bread, ready for dinner. Everything worked perfectly, the loaf was well formed and had an even crust and was delicious. I must admit that I did have to give it a good shake to get the loaf out of the pan, but it was a minimum of effort.

The crust is very uneven, with the bottom being too thick and brown, while the top is too light. The texture of the bread is heavy and doughy. One or two loaves have been barely edible, the rest hardly so. I don't know what to do, but I am exasperated after paying such a huge price.

Lately, I've been using the \\"knead\\" function to make dough, either for pizza or for bread, and then finishing the loaf in the oven (great challah recipe + bread machine = easy loaf that tastes great and didn't require any work on my part).Bread is a snap though, and I am extremely happy with my Zojirushi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Zojirushi Bread Machine","review":"This is my first bread machine.

I really like it but the recipes it comes with are awful. It recommends that you only use their recipes but I recommend you don't use any of them. None of them have tasted very good. I've tried several of them but none of them are very flavorful. The size and texture was good but no taste. I started using the recipes from www.allrecipes.com and everything has been wonderful from there. Also, it's kindof strange that it comes with a VHS tape for instructions to the bread machine instead of a DVD. Who has a VCR to watch it now days? I just read the instructions that came with it so I don't know if the VHS tape is neccessary to watch or not but I think I have done fine without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoj not up to previous standards","review":"The Zoj X20 was very disappointing. Bread receipes we have been using for years on a previous Zoj model and on a Breadman failed to bake. They were small, hard, and caved-in in the middle.

We returned the product - bought a Breadman, at half the price, and are just delighted with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zojirushi bread machine","review":"This bread machine is great.

We make bread and also love its dough mixing feature. We have learned to use the bread machine to make dough for pizza, pasta, dumplings, and bagels.After purchasing the bread machine, we later bought a pasta machine when we realized how easy it was to make the dough for pasta. So, our repertoire of cooking has expanded to not only fresh loaves of bread but also fresh linguine, ravioli, thin crust pizza, asian dumplings and bagels.My only gripe is that you need a fairly large cabinet to store this bread machine. But this is true of most electric kitchen appliances like a blender, Kitchen Aid, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second Zojirushi","review":"This has always been the best bread machine on the market, in our opinion.

It is easy to use; easy to clean and makes excellent bread. This machine easily adapted to some of my manual bread recipes; such as Easter Bread, which is very difficult for me to make manually. I was surprised to learn that it also makes meatloaf, cakes and jelly. What a neat idea. I would recommend this machine to anyone that wants to make their own bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supreme Bread Machine","review":"This make of bread machine is the best we have ever used, and we have used 6 or 7 of various brands.

I finally decided on the Zojirushi BBCCX20 because of all the excellent reviews it received. I have tried several different types of bread and have been very happy with all the results. I did have to increase the amount of rapid rise yeast by 1/2 tsp in most recipes as the bread was too heavy and dense without it. The machine is super easy to clean and I have had no problems getting the bread out of the pan. It does take a good shake or two but nothing I can't handle! Cleanup is a snap. I use a flashlight to keep track of the progress and marvel at how well the paddles work. I could not be happier with my decision to buy this bread machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bread Machine","review":"This is a great machine. I had purchased a different brand in December and in less than 60 days it stopped working so I went through all the reviews before deciding on this Zojirushi and have no regrets. The two paddle system allows for the standard shaped loaf making them much more convenient to store. Bread makes and bakes beautifully and the systems holds my previous setting -- my old machine did not. Also the bread pan tips out when done baking making it much safer to operate. My only issue is with the release of the bread. It can sometimes be difficult to get out, however, if you let pan cool 8 to 10 minutes it comes out easily. Even with that problem I would buy this machine again. The superior construction is obvious when you use it. You never hear it operating, even when kneading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"I really like this bread machine. Mostly I used the dough setting. But have tried the jam and it is good but not quite like homemade. Would be great over pancakes. The cake setting is good and you just dump it in and it mixes and cooks for you. Bread setting works great too. I like the fact it is shaped like a loaf of bread not a cylinder. This is my 2nd bread machine and I would recomend this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"Love, love, love our new breadmaker. Simple, simple, simple to use... I have been working out of town for a month so my husband has made half loaves for himself and has even made bread for our neighbors who have adopted him since I have been gone... I have great neighbors don't you think?There is nothing better than the smell and taste of fresh bread. Yum, yum, yum... you will love this breadmaker. Clean up is a snap!The price includes shipping which is another definite plus so purchasing from Amazon.com is a great way to go.Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!!!God bless you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"good preformance","review":"We have used this product many times since receiving it. The breads come out fine, but it takes some learning on what works right for my recipes. I have yet to get a bread machine cookbook. It will surely assist me.

And I have alot to learn as far as secrets, but we are pleased and look forward to using it more often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zojirushi BBCCX20","review":"Works well, kinda disappointed in the lack of recipes that came with it.

I'm completely satisfied and can highly recommend this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zojirushi is a must have breadmaker!","review":"I'm now the proud owner of a Zojirushi Breadmaker! I have owned 3 other brands, but Zojirushi beats them all. These are the things I like: It has 2 paddles which mixes and kneads better than having just 1 paddle. It has a pre-heat cycle that gets the ingredients to the perfect temp. I have tried the light crust and the medium crust and my husband likes them both. I like the texture of the bread, it makes bread more like store bought bread than any of the other breadmakers I have used. The best part is: The texture is so wonderful you can slice it to make sandwitch bread! Living in Utah cutting the yeast back to 1 1/2 tsps is perfect. My loaves come out of the breadmaker nice and rounded on the top. We bought our daughter-in-law a Zojirushi for Christmas as she makes bread, rolls, etc. everyday for her family. She has gone through 6 breadmakers! She took her old breadmaker to Goodwill!

However, we love it! I like that the bread comes out looking \\"normal\\" and the recipes we've tried so far have been really yummy. If it really does make jam well and if it holds up over time, it'll be worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The Best There Is","review":"Let's start here: You will never in your life have better TOAST than with the bread this machine makes.Okay, that being said: I've owned 2 bread machines prior to purchasing Zojirushi's Home Bakery Supreme. They were flawed, but it was possible via 'work-arounds' to get a respectable product. The HBS is, by comparison, a hands-free machine. I've made bread with it for several weeks now, and can attest to the excellent consistency of product it turns out.Taste, texture, shape of loaf, ease of machine use, flexibility of options,.. all are far beyond my expectations.The other day, by following the simple instructions in the manual, I baked up an extraordinarily impressive batch of CROISSANTS. No joke. Not phony, sort-of-like-a-croissant croissants. Honest-to-goodness, flaky, buttery, amazing croissants.As of this writing, I tend to believe there's no better machine on the market.

Unfortunately, they did not. We used the machine maybe 1-2 times a month (sometimes more, sometimes less) for three and a half years, which means about 90 breads. The pan now is completely warped, it is leaking oil into the bread, and the paddles have completely scraped off the nonstick coating. A new pan with paddles is $80 with shipping. Ouch...The overall quality of the bread is not bad, but we actually had somewhat better results with the old one. The new machine has very uneven crust browning, and the loaf always comes out a bit lopsided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Before purchasing a bread machine I spent hours researching online trying to determine which model would be best for what I wanted. I chose the Zojirushi for 3 reasons, the horizontal bread pan, the twin kneeding paddles, and the multitude of good reviews. It has lived up to all expectations. The bread turns out beautiful and it's easy to use and clean. The recipe book that came with it has not been anything special and I've found better recipes online but the instructions that come with the machine are important to follow. Definitely made the right choice with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Quality - worth every penny!","review":"I have been delighted with my machine - in reading some of the negative reviews, I noticed that most of the problems others mentioned were addressed in the manual. I had an issue with one of my loaves - I looked in the book, determined the issue, corrected it and have not had a problem again. This machine is well built, sturdy and turns out a perfect loaf each time - I took the time to read the manual BEFORE I used the machine.I would highly suggest this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time, money or ingredients!","review":"If you have reached this page looking for a reference to the Zojirushi, here is my delima: I purchased this machine and wish I hadn't.It looks and seems like it would be a good purchase, but when I got it home and tried baking several loaves, they were hard as a rock and wouldn't release from the pan. I called the company and they sent me new blades. That helped with turning the loaves out, but they were not eatable. The crust was very hard and the bread was so terrible, I gave it to the birds. I kept calling the company and they finally said to contact the sender and get my money back....thank goodness, I returned it and by recommendation of one of the South Beach forums, was advised to purchase the Breadman Ultimate.

The second Zo had the same problem and I had to return it. I am going back to Panasonic which was a great bread machine.

I have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don't turn out just right. My big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures. Even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time (70 minutes), my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked. I was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe. The machine was quiet, strong, and had a lot of bells and whistles, but with only partially baked bread, I had to return it to Amazon. Amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived, but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back, and were quick enough with the refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"My wife states this bread maker is over rated and no better than the least expensive bread maker on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine","review":"The Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine burns and dries out the bread.

It came out a very heavy thick loaf every time. I called a customer service and was told to cut bread flour a half and follow the recipe for the rests. I tried it, wasted all my time, and all the ingredients. Then I tried a recipe(3 cups flour and 1-1/4 cups water) of the \\"Panasonic\\" bread maker and could get a soft light loaf finally. Zojirushi's recipe is totally useless as well as the uneducated customer service. I don't believe this happens only to me. 4 cups flour and 1-1/2 cups water makes very dry dough obviously. I don't know why the other reviews were so good and Zojirushi didn't correct the recipe. This machine may be good as long as you don't follow their recommended recipe.

My wife tried cooking yeast free bread in this bread machine only for it to turn out to be a flop and non edible. It would behoove the Zojirushi Company to create bread recipes for the multiple and/or yeast allergic population and not advertise that their machine bakes quick breads because that is false advertising if the qualifier all recipes contain yeast or all recipes compatible with this machine must contain yeast whether regular breads or quick breads is not included in their advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I found that this bread maker made a HUGE loaf. 2 lbs. is tremendous, and the 1 1/2 lb. loaf is big, too.

I need to reach in to reshape the loaf over both paddles. When I add raisins, nuts, etc. They don't incorporate into the dough evenly. I need to pull the dough out and manually add these items.

It took a few days to get new paddles in the mail, and I'm back to super healthy bread. Scales make sense for all cooking - it's a far more accurate way to achieve the results you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the buyer beware!","review":"I loved the whole concept of this bread machine! Fuzzy logic, two mixing paddles, preheat, good recommendations...This is my third bread machine and I am distressed at how badly this machine has worked for me. I tried everything. I talked to Zojirushi and did what they said. I've made 15 2lb white bricks I wouldn't call bread. I am an electronic failure analyst in real life. I believe there is a quality control problem at the factory probably in an integrated circuit or sensor. That would explain why some people have had no troubles and a smaller percentage of us get messed up bread. My previous bread machines were dump the stuff in and get great bread. This one is hopeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love bread?","review":"If you believe bread is a staple in any good diet, get one of these. You'll have a good time adjusting the recipes and creating the best bread you've eaten in a long time. Great for sandwich bread used in school lunches (doesn't get soggy and great flavor). We enjoy a raisin, cranberry and cinnamon loaf for breakfast, finishing the top with maple syrup and course sugar. We have never used one before and now bake 3-5 loaves a week. You'll be needing a bread knife and fresh yeast. We have had no problems at all and enjoy fine tuning each version now relying on three varieties as main stays."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected","review":"I read several reviews and had certain expectations of it being a little bit noisy but I was pleasantly surprised to have it quieter than I expected.

We got other accessories to go with it like a bread slicer because we are going to live in a remote location and we hate flattened bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"made several loaves so far and it works exactly as promised. clean up is simple and recipes included are easy to follow. fresh bread tastes great without the preservatives in grocery store bread. we've also made banana bread using the cake setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good way to start making bread!","review":"I used to make bread the old fashioned way every Sunday morning, but being retired has shaken up my old routine. I bought this machine and found it simple to use; so far have made about 8 loaves of various breads, all good, if frankly, not as good as plain old up-to-the-elbows in flour made bread. But good enough to beat the almost $5 a loaf \\"rustic\\" breads in the local market. Easy to use and clean up. Takes some practice, but that's easy. The best part is when it's done, with butter and home-made jam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This machine has been a huge disappointment. We get an edible loaf once every three or four tries, for no discernible reason. Often, the bread doesn't rise, or doesn't mix. The customer service person said this was because I scooped flour, rather than measured by spoon into the measuring cup. That explanation doesn't fly, in my opinion, since I measured the same way with our old breadmaker (Regal) and had great bread all the time.Also, you can't use the timer function for the \\"quick\\" setting (which is appropriate for the Fleischman's Rapid Rise Yeast). I wish I had known this before buying. The recipes are not at all exciting and the format of the manual/recipes is not very user-friendly.Overall, this breadmaker is very finicky and not at all worth this price. I wish my old one still worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I Bought This Bread Machine Because It Was Rated As One Of The Finest. I Have Attempted Approximately 6 Loafs And 2 Have Been Successful. I Follow The Recipes To A Tee And Measure All Ingredients Accurately. For The Price Of Over $200.00 I Expected More. I Picked Up A West Bend Breadmaker With A Recipe Book At A Garage Sale For $2.99, It Has More Features, As An Example It Has An Extended Rise Cycle And A Light To View The Bread, I'm Sure The Orginal Price Was Not Even Close To The Zojirushi's Cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two paddles a mistake","review":"We bought this machine because of it's size -- it would fit in our appliance garage. However, in order for it to be narrow, the loaf pan is elongated, and hence there are two paddles instead of one. This results in poor kneading, because the dough gets repeatedly torn, tearing up the gluten strands as they're forming (at least this is my conjecture). It works OK if you make a large amount of dough, but you can't make a small loaf or a smallish amount of pizza dough. I have not tried baking in the machine, but I doubt this would work well either, because when I lift the lid to get the dough after the first rise, it's usually lopsided. It's very expensive too! The one I had before that was only about $50 and did a fine job. That one, however, started \\"schooching\\" on the counter while kneading and finally smashed to the floor. I have not had good luck with bread machines. A caveat: I bake all the bread for the family, so it gets used 3-4 times a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second to Best","review":"After a lot of research, we decided to purchase this machine as it had the highest ratings. I have baked 3 loaves of bread in it. The first loaf was a 2 lb loaf and it rose and stuck to the window. The second and third were 1 1/2 lb loaves and they turned out fine. My original bread machine was a Westbend FRONT LOADING bread machine and I loved it. Unfortunately after several years of use, it had to be retired and they do not make it anymore. One of the negatives to this machine is I must pull it out from the cabinet to get the bread pan in it. Another negative is that it doesn't have a light. The bread pan also seems hard to get in so I must place it in the machine prior to putting my ingredients in so they don't mix before they are intended to. The quality of the machine is dissappointing and it is quite expensive but it does make a nice and tasty loaf of bread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Bread Quality","review":"I've been baking homemade bread for over 15 years. Have just recently turned to bread machines. I went through two Breadman machines in the past 18 months. While the Breadman's produced very good bread they were poorly designed from a mechanical perspective...kept breaking down.So I thought I would \\"splurge\\" and get the Zojirushi BBCCX20. What a mistake!The Zojirushi is well designed mechanically...very sturdy. But in over 20 attempts, trying various Zojirushi and other recipes, I cannot produce what I consider a good loaf of bread.I will probably go back to making bread by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't bake a even loaf","review":"This is the worst bread machine I have ever had.

I did research; the horizontal loaf and the reported quiet of this machine lead me to make the investment. The machine is quiet as reported. The horizontal loaf makes slicing easy.The machine is very easy to operate. Although a beginner, I immediately started experimenting with whole wheat recipes and, on my third try, came up with a great stone ground whole wheat recipe using a little fructose and Splenda, which rose fine and tasted great. My next experiment is to come up with a recipe for stone ground whole wheat pizza dough."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"This is my second Zojirushi bread machine. I had my other one for 8 years but wore out the bread pan. A replacement was too costly so I just purchased another machine. I make bread almost every day but I usually just use the machine to knead the bread or rolls or pizza dough. Then I take it out and let it rise and then bake in the oven. I do make banana bread in the machine though and other kinds of coffee type cakes. It is a great machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it","review":"We use our Zo to bake whole wheat bread, and I find it remarkably consistent. My first loaf failed - but with the trobleshooting guide in the back of the owners manual, I now know why. Since I made some slight adjustments to my ingredients, every loaf I've made has been perfect. I use the homemade settings, which allow me to tweak to my heart's content. Others have mentioned the lack of a light for the viewing window, but it doesn't make any difference to me. I can see just fine in there. I would highly recommend this machine to others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Zo!","review":"I bought the Zo bread machine after having read great reviews of it in Consumer Reports and in the King Arthur Flour publications. I had the chance to use it heavily to prepare for Christmas entertaining. It was easy to use, easy to clean up, and extremely consistent in results in basic, wheat and dough settings. The instruction book is easy to follow and useful- a great way to adapt existing recipes for the machine. I have nothing but praise and wonder why I waited so long to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bread Ever","review":"I tried my Zojirushi bread maker the next day after receiving it.

This one is absolutely fantastic. It's not really a breadmaker--it's more like a bread robot. We named ours Johnny 5. I love how versatile it is with its programmable settings. I also find that the dual paddle system does a better job of kneading than my KitchenAid. I use it 3-4 times a week to make sandwich bread, challah and even seitan! I highly, highly recommend this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine","review":"I purchased the machine in March 2010 and have so far baked two loaves of basic white and one of honey oat. Overall, I am satisfied with the machine. As other reviewers have noted, at the end of the knead cycle you have to manually pat the dough so that it is even in the pan. Otherwise, you will get a very misshapen loaf of bread. If you do this, you get a great looking loaf. It seems to cook evenly and the texture is good, although the crust gets dark on the bottom and sides but the top remains light. If you live in a high altitude area, there are some high altitude adjustments listed in the Creating Your Own Yeast Breads section of the manual and there are additional tips in the Troubleshooting section. I only recently became aware of those, so I will make the adjustments and see how it affects the bread. Even without the adjustments the loaves have come out nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Over the years, I've had a few breadmakers.

Now, the dough does not form correctly and the paddles do not mix it well at all. I don't understand why so many positive reviews on this product. I will never buy another! Customer support was a joke. They had me do this test by rotating the paddles until I felt resistence...which I never did so I assume it failed. Even after failing THEIR test, the rep told me I must be making the bread wrong and that I need to get a scale to weigh the flour because the machine is so touchy. Well that's rediculous, why did it work before using same recipe?Obviously Zojirushi does not stand behind their products and I will never buy any from this company again.

With the increasing incidence of many health problems including cancers, tumors, Altzheimer's, childhood diseases, who can say for sure that it's not caused by something as all-pervasive and seemingly benign as our cookware? What about cookware that contributes little metal particles to your recipe?I haven't seen it warp yet but the V20 pan warped and I suspect that this one will warp as well over time (why wouldn't it, it's the SAME pan).Summary: I've stopped using it and sold it at a yard sale.

I only use this machine for making dough, then, I finish the bread in the oven.I've written the company a couple of times and received some general information on what to change but nothing I do seems to produce a good quality loaf of bread. Did I just get a bad machine? Maybe, but I'm certainly not going to spend the money to get another Zoji to see if a new one would be any better.

This machine is a workhorse and we use it about 3-4x a week for making bread, making bread/roll dough and even pizza dough. We loved the recipe for meatloaf, made right in the machine. We highly recommend this product and think it is more than worth the price. You won't be disappointed! ...

In reality, nope. i doubt any will ever fit. its so small, its almost a scam. Totally misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guinea Pig","review":"I bought this for my two month old guinea pig. I have blocked all the hard to access dark areas she loves to hide in, so I needed an easy to access toy that she felt comfortable in (they like dark areas). The crinkle tunnel allows me to know that she is inside since there is a hole in the middle. The color is just as shown and it is not too loud when she runs in and out of the tunnel. She is not the biggest fan, but it allows her to feel safe in open areas I let her run around. I would buy this for my guinea pig again knowing that since I just got her she is still getting used to the environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini-lop rabbits still love it","review":"It was smaller than expected, but the rabbits love the crinkling sound it makes when they toss it around. One of them managed to squeeze herself in the tunnel, that was quite funny. This would probably be more suitable for guinea pigs and other small rodents (rats and ferrets). its very sturdy but not chew proof, so beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small for my dwarf rabbit","review":"My rabbit is a dwarf and weighs 3 1/2lbs...There is no way he can fit in this tunnel...The tunnel is shorter and smaller than pictured...I would not recommend this tunnel for rabbits at all...Yes a much smaller animal...If I did not have to bother with shipping costs and post office lines I would definitely return this...I did not receive what I thought I was purchasing.The good thing is that if my rabbit could fit in it, it seems to be sturdy and made of good quality. Hope you find this review helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I ordered the super pet crinkle tunnel labeled as LARGE, and was shocked when it arrived to discover that it's very tiny. It states that it is for rabbits but no bunny over 4 weeks old would fit in this tunnel. It was so small. I have to return it and look for something that can accommodate a average size rabbit of 6 lbs or more."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOO SMALL","review":"I have baby rabbits and they can't even fit in this. I have no idea how any rabbit could get into this tunnel. May be better for small guinea pigs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Small","review":"I have two 6 week old bunnies and this is the perfect size for them. The problem is that I expected it to be twice the size it is, so they can use it when they're adults ( 3-4 lbs ). They probably will only be able to use it for another month or two until they out grow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"much different than pictured","review":"This is for small animals. We got this for our 4 month old kitten and it is way too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, this was a joke","review":"The picture that was shown on this product was a full size rabbit inside the tunnel so I assumed my cats would fit in it no problem. Ya well, my hand barely fits in it. It's hecka tiny. So if you have anything bigger than a mouse, dont waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My buns love this","review":"My buns love this thing, I recently adopted them from a local shelter, male and female bonded pair (yes they are fixed, lol). They were a bit reserved when I got them home, but when I got this tunnel, they LOVE it. My female bun Lilly, really started to show an interest right away, and she is beginning to trust more and more daily. They are Lionheads and they are about 4 pounds each and just fit, so if you have a larger bun it might not work as well. I wish I had longer, and more of this. They both just LOVE it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only For Tiny Bunnies!","review":"I saw the rave reviews from other rabbit owners and thought I would give this a try. I have two very young Holland Lops and figured even if they did outgrow it they would get some fun out of it for a while. They are 10 weeks old right now and weight just over 2 pounds. Some of the reviewers have said that their 4 pound buns are able to go in. Maybe my 2 pound buns are just too fluffy or we haven't tried hard enough but the first words out of my mouth when I opened it were \\"They're not going to fit\\". They probably CAN fit in it right now but I think that they are a bit freaked out because it seems like such a small space so they are hesitant to want to try. So buyer beware...this is probably great for cavies (guinea pigs) or small bunnies but your bun may soon outgrow it or be afraid to go into something so small. If they change their mind and fall in love with the thing I will update my review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have an average size rabbit, this will be too small","review":"The advertised picture is misleading, I have two average sized lionhead rabbits and they have to squirm like worms to get through this tunnel. For ferrets, guiny pigs, and hamsters it will do just fine. I think this would be too small for dwarf rabbits too. It does crinkle and scrunch up nicely for storage. If it was larger, I would give it 5 stars but I cannot use it as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small For Use With Rabbits","review":"The photo shows a bunny playing in this tunnel, but it is WAY too small for animals bigger than a guinea pig."},{"rating":"1","title":"The picture was misleading","review":"I have a pet rabbit that weigths 3 pounds and is 11\\" tall.

Dasha Kelly has written a novel about friends, relationships, and the power of lies. I don't want to give away the plot, but readers will be pleased with this emerging voice.The story of Emorie, her friend Denise, and Emorie's husband James is explored in the novel. It has just the right amount of flow and action, one to make you sink your teeth and not let go until the conclusion.Looking for a quick, yet thorough read, look no further than this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd cover - Great book","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. The only thing I didn't like about the book is the picture on the cover, it could have a better title too. This book is about women and how we are created - to desire and nurture relationships. A better title would be, \\"The Heart of a Woman\\". I appreciated the insights I got about myself and women in general from this book. Sharon challenges women to examine the ruts we are in and encourages us to move out of them and engage in relationships again. She mentions an activity used to build self-esteem. I love that activity so much that I presented it to my women's group from church and we are all going to work on it and share with each other what we do. I'm excited about hearing what each woman has to share.

Highly recommend to people who enjoy Townes music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch","review":"This is a great movie for anyone who isn't familiar with Townes Van Zandt. A credible documentary that displays a well-rounded view or the artist from personal stories and descriptions from people who knew him best, his close friends and family. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn about Townes or just watch a creative movie about a unique individual who had struggles but was able to deal with them and create some beautiful music that entertained, encouraged others and helped people realize that they are not alone in the difficulties Life may bring. 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Townes","review":"Townes Van Zandt was an amazing songwriter with an amazing story. Many songwriters imitate Dylan but Townes was not one of these. He actually had the gift. This Doc gives detail about his life from the early years to his death and gives a good picture of what it's like to pursue your dreams. What amazes me most is that the success he did achieve never went to his head. He actually pushed it away. To him it was all about the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great blend of Jackie","review":"If you think of recent Jackie movies as paradies they're more fun to watch. This mixes the Pierce Brosdin-type James Bond with the Beatles A Hard Day's Night (or is it Help? ). He does some globetrotting and some innovative stunts, has embarrassing moments and keeps in touch with Uncle Billy. As always, he climbs some walls faster than a squirrel and some fruit gets mushed. The storytelling isn't as compelling as Spielberg but Jackie's personality shines through."},{"rating":"1","title":"More movie and less fighting...","review":"First Strike is another title for Jackie Chan. I believe him to have excellent fighting abiltity and he shows it in the very few fight scenes in this movie. The fight scenes that are there are incredible as usualy... but there are really only two major scenes with combat in them. For a fighting movie, it's not that great, but the fights are amazing. Just too few."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favourite Jackie film","review":"The most memorable thing for me in this film is the North Face outdoor suit (in glaring yellow and black) that Jackie ends up accidentally wearing for most of the film. I am sure that sounds superficial, but while I have seen this film twice, I found little in it to rival either the older and cheaper Hong Kong made Chan films, or the slightly bigger budget \\"Jackie in America\\" films. I am an Australian, and that may affect my perception of the exotic locales. Frankly it was unconvincing. But please, come ski our fabulous mountains anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Movie","review":"If you are a true Jackie Chan fan.

There is not a lot of action but when there is it is A+ action. It is comical when you see Jackie with the kowala underwear. Overall the movie is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 sdtars for the movie, 5 stars for under-water fu","review":"Now the movie itself is a little better than the rumble in the bronx or nice guy, but as a whole it kicks the sheeit out of those movies. The story isn't really worth going over, he goes on a mission. But the 2 things that stand out are the water fights and the ladder fight. Truly only jackie could come up with this stuff. And he is not even liste as the coordinator, but you knwo he had to have a hand in it. Overall this is only a 3 star movie at best, but with jackie literally jumping through this ladder and swinging it like he was trained his whole life with it. And there is another nice little movie within a movie at the end.And I have to say that the american version of thisw si very good, the dubbing is better than usual, the 5.1 sound kicks ass, and if someone has a bette version of this, than post it on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"I just want to know one thing.. how does Anne Rice manage to get away with writing child pornography?

He literally says this. Hence, the writing of this book.So here's another part of the problem.

I also wanted some portability (one room to another, an occasional trip). It's worked great in the 1.5 months I've had it. Has all the bells and whistles I needed. I was not looking for an entertainment center. A computer to edit photos; some video; watch a movie, perhaps, if I was on the road.I have two gripes, though. First, the right shift key is half sized. I could have gone without the second set of arrow keys (this laptop has the numeric keypad) for a fatter right shift key. Second, the headphone outlet is in the front of the computer so when I was using watching a movie on that rare flight, I had to be mindful of where the headset was plugged in.This may not be the computer for you if you want an entertainment center, but it will definitely satisfy you if you use applications such as Office or use Macromedia and Adobe multimedia software, and you want all that in a desktop replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent purchase","review":"This is a great machine for a fine price.

The large screen is clear and bright, the amount of RAM is double that in other similarly priced laptops, the processor is speedy and never gets too hot, regardless of the strain I put on it, the audio is perfectly fine and the 3D, while not top of the line, is still quite good. Toshiba has made an excellent product for a very fair price.

His artistic path is characterized by a deep concern about the human nature. In this sense, his style is intimately linked with Max Ophlus; he seems to be closer to European audiences instead the American ones. He influenced remarkably to Rainer Werner Fassbinder.A hard relationship in a couple as direct consequence of the war wounds, a letter that will make turn back the memory key, the vanished livings in a devastated town. It's so difficult at first glance to be engaged unless you are placed from the another side of the world. Thousand of altered destinies, of forced twists of fate, of what it could have been and it wasn't.A shadowed film, loaded with dark poetry, not easy going but immensely rewarding at the end of the road.Based on Erich Maria Remarque's play, including a curious intervention of the same novelist in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW CAN ANYONE REVIEW THIS BOOK YET!?","review":"I received a gift card LAST Christmas so I could get this book when it came out, imagine that.

I have dropped the book from our daily study and fortunately, so far, my son has not noticed. If you are looking for a Reformed children's bible try The Child's Story Bible by Catherine Vos.

Anna Torv is just plain smooth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky is an understatement","review":"Always set the DVR to record this fasinating, addictive series filled with the original and funny characters, including a milk cow named \\"Jean\\".

Beyond any doubt, Fringe is one of the best produced shows currently on TV b/c the writing is so clever and we (the audience) actually care about the characters and the struggles they go through.The cast could not be better: John Noble is superb, and Anna Torv and Josh Jackson have good chemistry together (much like Scully and Mulder).Producer JJ Abrams (Lost, Alias, Star Trek, Mission: Impossible 3) has another winner on his hands with Fringe.* Highly recommended *"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Best Sci-Fi Show in Years\\"","review":"One of the most original and thought provoking shows that I have seen in the last few years.

I wanted to see it from the beginning, so that I would know EXACTLY what had happened, and when, and (hopefully, eventually) why. The characters are extremely real, with flaws and flubs and the whole human emotional range. You can see how their personalities have changed,not only in the present, but from when they were younger: especially Walter Bishop. The actor does an extra-ordinary job of portraying a brilliant man who's not only struggling back from madness, but seriously trying to right the wrongs he did when he was younger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fringe","review":"Very good sci-fi series.

Suffice it to say, they were correct that episodes 2-4 are fairly weak and then the show takes off like a rocket. I have just finished watching all 4 seasons and will buy the 5th which, as always, looks to be a nail-biter. We tried to find a word to describe this show best. \\"Gripping\\" is an apt description.

Because I watched the entire first season over the computer, and noticed that the quality was actually far better than some other shows I've seen online. Add that into the fact that the first season was amazing, and I will back my 5-star recommendation. Yes, it's a bit like the X-Files, and I love the X-Files, but it's been gone so long that fans should be welcoming to this type of show. I notice that people are giving it 1 star because they're mad about Sarah Connor, or mad about subtitles, but that should maybe take one star away from the review. This is a fantastic show, great cast, great theme song and credits, and great twists. I'm sure the quality will be great as well. Highly recommended.Oh, and PS - Walter actually does make you crave for the same snacks once he says it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xfiles-copycat","review":"If only it was fun to watch, but no, it tries to catch the x-files storytelling but it fails horribly.

Bad Acting. Bad writing.And if by some miracle it does get better, can you really trust FOX? They will just cancel it anyway. Does Firefly or Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles ring a bell?

Just avoid this terrible show from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time","review":"well there are some nice ideas in this show but absolutly no realism, everything scientific riddle, no matter how weird it is, is dissolved in 40 minutes, and the old doc seem to have worked on everything. I allways switch to another channel when this show is running so dont spent your money on it, its just a waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This show is unwatchable awful and a horrible network. I can't believe FOX would renew this crap and cancel Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"It may be The X-Files Lite right now, but Fringe has massive potential","review":"I started watching Fringe from the beginning mainly because I'm a fan of Lost and this is another spawn of J.J. Abrams. This show didn't really hit it's stride until the middle of the season. It was at this point that the characters began to grow on me and the mysteries expanded. I couldn't stand the main character, Olivia Dunham, at first, but I ended up liking her the most by season's end. Same goes for the Walter Bishop character, played by John Noble (of The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King fame). He is one crazy mad scientist, but he provides most of the shows laughs. Fringe may not quite be at The X-Files level yet, but it has come pretty darn close for this genre of TV shows. It's well worth the time of any Sci-Fi fan and unlike many FOX shows, this one probably won't be canceled anytime soon due to the above average number of viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive series","review":"Not only does it satisfy my Sci-Fi wants and needs but it has a realistic element to it which is interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great TV Recipe!","review":"What do you get when you combine crime show drama, action packed sci-fi, and a dash of soap opera?- FringeThis show has something for everyone!With each jaw dropping episode you think it can't get any freakier, but it does.My only hope is that they keep the suspenseful surprises coming and don't let it fizzle out after a few seasons because it really is a great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Science fiction you will love.","review":"Like the X-Files 10 years later with better effects.

The core characters have decent chemistry and are enjoyable but the science and story lines are not believable even for scifi (unless you are 17 years old). Oh amazing, the Dr. found another cure in 8 hours... I am often bored to death as each episode unfolds hoping it will eventually grab me. I have 5 more to watch to finish the first season. Is it worth my time? We will see how disparate I get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Intriguing","review":"Even though the science, even in theory, is mostly bogus, I find that this show is a welcome relief from a lot of what we see on television today. The characters are surprisingly well developed and well played for such a new show. And, of course it's tons of fun! It keeps you guessing too. All in all, I'd say it's not perfect, but it's certainly fun to watch. Five stars for originality, character dynamic, acting and storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"FRINGE IS SUPERB SCIENCE FICTION","review":"Fringe is superb Science Fiction leaving everything to the imagination.

Will never understand why NBC canceled it. It's right up there with 24, Fringe, Breaking Bad, Homeland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing television","review":"I'm a big fantasy/sci-fi geek. I watch it all (or almost all of it). And I can safely say that I haven't seen a show this entertaining and engaging since The X-Files. Before I started watching, someone described the show to me as a mix of The X-Files and CSI. I think that describes this show exactly. It's the perfect mix of crime show whodunit with a heavy sprinkling of sci-fi to take it juuuust outside the norm, keeping mainstream viewers and die hard geeks like me hooked. And episodes range from icky to disturbing to heartbreakingly thought-provoking. This is a tv series I will watch over and over again.And the cherry on top? Walter and his classic one liners. I love this show and pray that Fox doesn't screw up yet another fantastic series when they moved it to the \\"kiss of death\\" timeslot: Friday evenings. Program those DVRs! Buy the DVDs! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"First let me say I LOVE syfy, this is the best thought out show i have seen my only complaint is season 5, why did the show had to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, entertaining characters","review":"JJ Abrams, producer of Lost, created Fringe. Fringe has not been nearly the cliffhanger that Lost was, but I still find myself pulled into the story. The kooky scientist Walter Bishop and his sarcastic son Peter have such a fun dynamic. I am streaming the program free on Amazon Instant Video through Prime. I'm enjoying the show and would recommend it if you like sci fi or the X Files or shows like Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. Its pace is about equal to the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see show!","review":"This show is so different! Always keeps you guessing. Awesome! Love it!! Very much unlike anything out there today. The cast work amazingly well together. By the time you get three episodes in you won't be able to stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats X Files hands down!!","review":"I stumbled across this series quite by accident - am I glad I did!! GREAT story lines, wonderful acting ( 2 Aussies in main roles!!) and special FX are SO well done.One wonders just how much of what is seen on screen is actually happening in research labs that we know nothing about - scary thought, isn't it?I used to enjoy the X Files, but feel that this is a much more finely crafted show. To have a beautiful, strong woman (Anna Torv) as the lead character is good to see - and the wonderful John Noble as Walter Bishop - the 'mad' scientist - a marvellous combination. Joshua Jackson as Peter Bishop makes them a fine trio to watch.I look forward to seeing this run for many seasons to come - congratulations to all involved in the making of a very well done sci-fi series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is an excellent program. It gets better and better with each episode. The acting is really good -- all characters. The Walter Bishop character is the best of the show. I love his relationship with Peter. This is a smart show -- which explains the low ratings. It does not involve stupid love/sex stories with cheesy background light rock music (Gray's Anatomy) or a bunch of flash (CSI). It is an awesome show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, sets the stage for an addicting series","review":"I loved this dvd. The first episode is a little slow, but necessary as it introduces the audience to the characters. Stick with it, and by the third episode you'll be hooked! Great character development and interesting storylines! Order the second series in advance, as you will not want to wait to continue watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's addicting!!","review":"I was always a huge fan of the X files and have been waiting for a show of that style. I think Fringe is a really good replacement!! It really draws you in!! It has a really good cast and they do a great job playing the roles they were given!! I wish i would have started watching this show sooner!! I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys shows about the paranormal!! I plan to watch every season!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth hanging in there","review":"I was a little iffy on continuing to watch the series after the first few episodes because the show hadn't really grabbed me yet. But there is definitely a big payoff towards the end of the first season that makes it all worth it. Similar to LOST, the more you can suspend your disbelief and just enjoy the twists and turns the creators are throwing at you, the more you will enjoy the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fringe","review":"Great sci-fi story . Well written and acted. Very believable. Locations are very realistic and well photographed. Titles look three D.

I am however only halfway through the second season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite the X-Files","review":"Being a Mulder and Skully fan probably prevents me from allowing a 5 star rating on this series. Maybe in subsequent season, the father/son dynamic smooths out, but I find it annoying in season 1.Fringe has enough sci-fi in it to be entertaining and there'd never be any chance of confusing this show with reality! I'll keep watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similar idea from fullmetal alchemist","review":"Can see some idea copied from fullmetal alchemist animation. Anna Torv is a very good actress. Overall it is a worthy to watch show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for rainy days","review":"The DVDs arrived in great shape. I started watching them right away. These will be great on the cool wet nights to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Sure to Watch","review":"I took a chance and got the first season on Net Flix. I work a graveyard shift during the week so I miss most of the TV on those nights. I was hooked from the first episode. Mark Valley is a favorite from another good show, Boston Legal so it was good to see him and John Noble was memorable in Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King.The show kept me riveted and was very entertaining. I just used the on demand feature we have on cable and saw the last episodes from the recent season featuring Leonard Nimoy. I loved the animation and the LSD experience of their fearless leader.I recommend giving this series a chance. The cast works well together and I look forward to seeing the new season next month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 1 Fringe, Entertaining","review":"I didn't start watching Fringe after the first season was released on dvd.

Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch people get 'operated' on - no thank you","review":"A great idea gone wrong. For having the production team behind the series, it was very disappointing to have it turn into a horror show. There are some great characters and a story line that is tight and well-written. What ruins it is the graphic experimentation and pain you experience. Was looking for a show to engross me in scifi, not gross me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"very good sci fi","review":"I enjoyed the movie and the characters were good, I was able to relate to them and create a minimal bond. However, Amazon needs to work on the delivery of the movie. I noticed , for the second time , a lag/delay that was noticeable and annoying. Once they get as good as netflix and its video on demand this will be a great way to enjoy new releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need more space?","review":"I love the series, but I find out the dvd version has spanish subtitles but the blu-ray version don't have it, must be a joke, having all that space, and missing that!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ersatz X-Files","review":"Terrible remake of the X-Files - without the writing or acting quality of the original. Don't waste your money on this turkey. Unbelieveable premise, lousy acting, extremely slow and suspense-less writing style - if you're stuck with it like I was play a game trying to guess what the next line will be. There's enough time between lines to think up some cliches - and you'll probably be right 75% of the time.A really hopeless series - with all the great shows that got cancelled, I cant believe this made it to a second season!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad written with stupid plots","review":"This show is only a bad intent to make another X-files, it has the most stupid and nonesensic plots a series has ever had with disgusting and unnecesary scens.. Definitely the series continue getting worse and worse after the first episodes. The main actress acts so bad that it's very difficult to believe that is a professional actress. In my opinion is one of the worst written shows currently on TV, believe me, very bad written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitles?","review":"Why not portuguese subtitles in Blu-Ray if it's available in DVD?In fact, Brazil and USA are in the same Blu-Ray region, which does not occur with the DVD, ergo, it's possible for a brazilian to buy a Blu-Ray in USA, but if a DVD is bought, probably it won't work.If portuguese subtitles where included, sales to brazilian customers would florish.Regarding the series itself, definitely it's THE Best Sci-Fi series since X-Files.Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Science","review":"The science in this show is atrocious. I streamed the first 3 episodes and cringed in every single one. It feels as if they didn't even try to get it right. The episode with the brain surgeon murderer was probably the worst as it discussed a guy who surgically removed pituitary glands and ate them for the hormones to keep him young. While it is true that the pituitary gland controls aging, the show claims that consuming the pituitary allows the murderer to live longer. If anything, eating the pituitary gland would cause aging due to the consumption of growth hormone which stimulates cell division. This is just one of the many flaws with the science of the show and has led me to feel that it is not worth my time.All in all, this show made me feel sick to my stomach, It made me rage at the scientific inaccuracies, and it has poorly developed characters and a weak plot. Try it for yourself if you must but I don't think it's worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still waiting to watch these","review":"I'll get to this collection soon I hope. I love Fringe. I still watch the TV series every week and will order it in the collections also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show!!!","review":"It's rare that I get hooked on a old TV show but this one has me gripped.

Abrams until the 5th episode.?I like it more now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"This series is like a modern version of X-Files. It deals with all sorts of controversial/quack science ideas, but is entertaining and well written nonetheless. Joshua Jackson does a good job portraying Peter and is a much better actor than I thought he was. Anna Torv is just barely passable as Olivia Dunham. Her mannerisms are very annoying. The high of the show for me is John Noble as Walter Bishop. He plays a great crazy person, (Denathor in LOTR) but yet has an emotional range that most actors wish they had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"This show is different so it gets your interest right away, you have to pay attention so you know what's going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"X Files Rebaked","review":"Basically that is what Fringe is, a retelling of the x-Files, up dated of course and with a little different slant but basically the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"just plain awesome","review":"I have never been much of a drama/science fiction tv watcher, but this show is just plain great, it blends so many different aspects into one show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Show!!!","review":"It's about time we had an answer to X-files!!!!! This show is intriguing. It's an awesome display of theoretical science!! Keeps your brain working. I personally love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting premise","review":"This show is one of my favorites. The plots are always interesting and they lead to more questions than they answer. The actors are overall good, although Anna Torv is a little one demensional. Joshua Jackson and John Noble are very good and both have some great one liners.Overall, I would recommend this series to anyone who likes the whole syfy, paranornal, conspiracy theory type of show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be 5 stars if it had Closed Captions","review":"Would be 5 stars if it had Closed Captions. The series is of the best quality in Science Fiction. The arcs make it hard not to just keep watching. If only Amazon would get with the program and start providing Closed Captions with their on line streaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fringe season 1","review":"This is a great tv-series! Gets you hooked on first few episodes on what will happen next. lots of mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fringed","review":"Fringe is one of J.J. Abrams better ideas. Fringe has all the elements of a successful series, action, deep character devleopment, humor, intrigue, grief, and humanity. For those fans of X-Files that were missing their dose of reality mixed with insanity, this is it on steriods. Do not miss the opportunity to to go over this series and discover the small things that add up to so much more and make the story line an intracate weave of possibilities. Torv, Jackson, and Reddick are perfect for their roles and make the story all that much more engaging. All I can say is this is masterful TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best SCI FI show since Lost of Battlestar Galactica!!!","review":"The show is about an FBI Division that explores the freak or unusual phenomena. The relationship between Peter and Olivia, Astrid and Walter, Peter and Walter (father and son) are just so deep and wonderful to watch. The characters are rich and interesting, Walter Bishop is just the best Mad Scientist since Doc Brown. I can't say enough of this series through here. If you like a good detective story investigating the paranormal, look no further. If you enjoy the thought of alternate universes mixed with a little bit of time travel, and some out of the ordinary characters (The Observers), there is NOTHING like FRINGE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I expected a few extra features...","review":"Everything was great, I love this show and I didn't have the blu ray collection so I decided to buy it once and for all. When I received this one (first season) I was really excited about it, but I expected a little more about the features regarding the subtitles, because I'm more comfortable with the spanish subs (which is my mother language), I know that it was my fault 'cause I didn't see the product details, but I must say that there was no other offer with this characteristics, I mean there is no blu ray of Fringe first season with spanish subtitles. Anyway I'm almost the happiest girl with my collection. I just need the fourth season and we are complete!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent script and acting","review":"Edge of your seat TV.

I hope you all enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"I had heard about Fringe for awhile before finally checking it out. I am so glad I did and have since watched the entire run of the series. It starts a little slow before finding its footing around episode 6 or 7 and being consistently good after that. The characters and the actors who play them are what make the show so good. John Noble as Peter Bishop is my favorite but the rest are all solid as well. If you liked The X-Files, you will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 1 sets the stage for an incredible 5 season run","review":"The story lines and the character development for the first season are well thought out and approached from a \\"procedural\\" or episodic type of sic-fi drama. In the second season the show delivers on the mythology that accumulates throughout the first season in a more concrete and linear fashion. Season One contains lots of clues thrown in but not in order of importance or in any clear sequence which is the key to not feeling like you are being spoon-fed some conspiracy theory that is oversimplified just to make this a mainstream show like CSI or NCIS or UPS911.The time you invest in this show pays off throughout the series but don't expect to figure it all out by the 4th episode. Who would want to anyway? Ana Torv and Joshua Jackson lead an amazing cast so don't be surprised when you find yourself watching 6 episodes back to back without noticing it's 3am already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Explain,Easy to Love","review":"The first time I watched one of the episodes, it was in the middle of the series. Usually, a show with so many mysteries is hard to like if you don't know all the facts, but this show was different. it appealed to me even when I couldn't understand some things that were only explained in previous episodes, because each episode still has its own story. What's not to love about a dedicated agent, a crazy(and humorous) mad scientist, and his slightly annoyed son? Plus the pattern and all those other freaky experiments leave you thinking and wondering what will happen next.For all those non sci-fi fans, I think this show might change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Fringe","review":"Fringe is the perfect combo of law and order meets x-files.

The reason I only gave four stars was because of the subtitles of the DVD in Chinese. I don't know whom they hired, but the Chinese translation is not good. It is not horrible, but it definately does not grasp the essence of the lines in many scenes. It's a disgrace to my favorite show.

It is one of my favorite shows. Contrary to popular opinion, I like it better than X-files. It is rather more mature and sophistocated.When I got to disc 3 Episode 6, \\"The Cure\\", where Agent Olivia Dunham, faced down David Esterbrook, Senior Officer of INTREPUS, it was so cool I had to watch it 3 times. It would only have been better if it had shown her perp-walking him out of the building, which apparently she did. This is one of the best scenes I have ever watched. I have to get off of here and back to FringeThe only thing bad about this set is that it is in the window box form. I can adjust my sceen to display it to the full widescreen, but then I have to adjust it back to use the menus. The resolution is just fine, but it would be really nice if the makers of these windowbox DVDs would also make the menues in window box so I wouldn't have to switch back and forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtitles?????","review":"English subtitles on blu-ray version ??????

It is slow. Something happens, let's go see what is going on. Every episodes are similar. After the first season, I lost interest. The characters don't have any emotion. The show lacks content. The show has very little philosophical or psychological value. It doesn't make you think or connect. This is definitely not X Files or Star Trek.*Spoiler*I like the idea that we are having a war between our parallel universe. I also like the idea that ET is watching. But again, after the first season, I just don't care anymore. It maybe nice if they give ET a bigger role to understand what make us human even in a parallel universe.

Just awful. If I could have left less than one star, I would have...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this series really get any better???","review":"I watched the first 6 or 7 episodes. The premiere was a knockout, but it gradually slid down from there. I disagree that Anna Torv as Olivia is the show's weakest link. If anything, Torv brings dramatic weight and intelligence to her role, despite her nebulous accent. There was originally some great tension between her character and Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), but that evaporated quickly. Now Peter has the all the personality of drying paint. As for Walter Bishop, he also started out with potential, and now comes across as comic relief where none is needed. He's dangerously close to being as annoying as Dr. Smith, who turned \\"Lost in Space\\" into a farce. None of the characters have any life outside of their endless string of bizarre adventures. And as for the whole topic of fringe \\"science\\", this show is about as scientifically-based as baking chocolate chip cookies. At least I'm glad I wised-up before I spent a lotta $$$ on the boxed set."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I rented this movie expecting it to be \\" scary \\" by the previews and the sound effects.

I wasn't surprised at all, and that's disappointing! I wish someone would remove the part that tells who William Bell is.I realize 1 star is harsh, but I would definitely give it 5 stars if the description hadn't ruined it. The part where Bell steps out of the shadows is very dramatic but would have been 100% better if it had been a surprise.

With streaming TV I get to watch series that I would not normally watch. I have been intrigued by this series for a while and I now get to watch it on my terms. It is fast paced, challenging, fun and a pleasure to watch. The only problem I have at times is that good science fiction has several components, science, politics, sex and an explanation of the outcome. Sometimes this series leaves the last item out there dangling. I suppose that has to do with it being a TV series and it is not a real deal killer. I think the 3 main characters are very well cast and I think Dr. Bishop is a hoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Season of Fringe","review":"The First Season is my Favourite Season of Fringe!!!

When I grew up we were taught that the Republicans in the Senate and House in the 1860s and 1870s that accomplished the freeing of the slaves and the passage of the 13th, 14th and 15 amendments that outlawed slavery, applied the bill of rights to the states and guaranteed the right to vote to the freed slaves were \\"radical\\" Republicans. I guess that made the Democrats of that era, who passed the Jim Crow laws, that formulated separate and unequal, that disenfranchised and disarmed the freed blacks so that they could be subjugated and lynched, mainstream. Michael Zak tells the true story of couragious Republicans who valued integrity over expediancy, and who placed their lives and safety at risk for a noble goal. He and his book are to be commended for telling us the story that mainstream academia would rather just ignore."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the book","review":"I really enjoyed reading Back to Basics for the Republican Party.

The package is labeled such. Don't get two of the same frequency within range of each other! Oh, and the switch and control block do not look like what is pictured.

(paper thin walls) I've gotten more used to such sounds but these ear plugs block out most sounds such as keyboard / mouse clicking and fridge humming. You can still hear people talking if you occasionally, ac blowing and constant white noise similar to a sea shell because of the way it fits in the ear. I also got used to the white noise but still these are pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I recommend the seller but not the product.","review":"I would recommend this seller because the item was sent and arrived faster than estimated. I bought this product for someone else's usage and though they didn't find the product to be useful, in that it did not appropriately plug the ears to cut off sound, it was safety packaged.

From seeing this piece of trash, I know that the Colin Baker years really were the worst. AVOID!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too long.","review":"I must admit, The Two Doctors was dissapointing. At three forty-five minute episodes long, it is at times boring. The plot is exausted at this length. Patrick Troughton makes a welcome return appearance, as does Frazer Hines. The location filming in Spain is nice but does little for the plot. The Sontarans are introduced far too early in the story (and why they've all grown beards is a mystery). Also, it is nearly impossible to forgive the Doctor for murdering Shockeye (unless pushing Cyonide in his face was an accident). On the whole, a painfully confusing but watchable story. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat on the back!","review":"Ok, so the explanation for the pairing of these two Doctors doesn't make that much sense. WHO CARES?! This is pure unbridled fun, which Who should always be, and for those of us who like Blake's 7, this one is a real treat. Troughton is always a pleasure, and he elevates every scene he is in. I've never been one to be off put by the Sixth Doctors incarnation, but I admit that his views on the inability to eductae/domesticate an Andrigum was a bit shocking, though totally in line with his portrayal. I was surprised to see Troughton's Doctor share the sentiment. The story really moves along nicely, and the sequence of the Doctors in the restaurant is worth the price of admission.

To classify him as a late-Romantic composer does not do credit to his inventiveness as predecessor of Ravel and even Schoenberg. On this recording Mr. Oue and the Minnesota Orchestra excel in humility towards the singers. The contribution of the orchestra is punctual but somewhat lacking of depth. Jon Villars has a beautiful voice, but not deep enough to point out the drama of a drunken man. Especially in the higher regions he lacks purity. Michelle DeYoung has a wonderful voice too, her German is acceptable and her lyricism is quite thrilling. She saves the record in Der Abscheid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat dated and grandiose","review":"This is an extraordinary piece. It deserves a setting where the music can come through.

Too bad it's not made of fir -- could also be used as a Christmas tree. (Just kidding about the last part.) It's the first time I've used one without handles. I like the way it feels when rolling out bread doughs. Thick, straight, smooth, just the right weight. Works very well. And you can bear down as much pressure as needed, without concern of bending or breaking handles like I've had happen before. Easier to clean than one with handles. And the current $12.99 seems like a reasonable price for what you get (i.e., North California standards, that is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this rolling pin!","review":"This rolling pin is the bees knees!

Nothing is more embarrassing than presenting your guests with unshapely flatbreads (burnt because you toiled so long on each that the previous one was neglected on the griddle). This beauty gets it done with speed, dignity, and a touch of sass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short, too thin, and tapered too sharply","review":"I ordered this without knowing the dimensions, which were not given in the description. The Vic Frith French Rolling pin was smooth and well made, but too short, too thin, and the taper began right at the middle, so that the center section was not flat, which made it difficult to roll pastry evenly. I measured the Frith dimensions as 20 inches long by 1 1/2 inches in diameter, and then ordered a larger model made by Fantes, 20 1/2 by 1 3/4 diameter, which worked much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rolling Pin","review":"If you have to limit yourself to a single rolling pin, the Vic Firth Bakery Pin is the one. Personally, I don't do a lot of baking, and a single pin is sufficient for my needs. I dislike pins with moving parts, and I have never liked the so-called French pins that taper at each end and which some bakers swear by. When I worked in France, this style of pin is all I saw. It is a basic dowel and of sufficient length and weight to accomplish what you need it to, but not so heavy or bulky as to be exhausting. It is sturdy enough to wail on your cold pie dough, but controllable enough to get it down to an excellent, even thickness. It is the best rolling pin that I have ever had the privilege to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vive la France!","review":"I love, love, love this rolling pin! We are a bread loving family and I spend hours making pizza's, tortilla's, calzones, pita bread and so on. This rolling pin is a god sent.

You will see them advertised elsewhere on Amazon for less than half the price of the Vic Firth. Funny thing, though. There was no note of apology from Red Arrow or explanation or offer to refund us the difference in price. Hmmm.... A little suspicious?? After we received it we dug through the Amazon reviews and discovered this was not a one-time fluke. There are numerous reviews from people who received the same cheap knock off. After talking with Amazon, they gave me the phone number to contact the company to try to get the order straight. The number simply went to a voice mail saying, \\"The person at this extension is not available.\\" Nothing saying what company, dept or person I had called.

However, despite what the outer wrapping showed (aside from signs of re-wrapping) what I got instead was a Winco WRP-20F, made in Taiwan, complete with sticker applied directly to the wood. And while Amazon does have this particular item listed, it is not sold BY Amazon. And further, the Winco is about $14.00 less that the Vic Firth model. Bottom line, while my other Vic Firth pin is solid and smooth, this thing is, for a french pin, too big and heavy, and needs another turn or two on the lathe and sander. So is it Amazon trying to pass of another product, or is it the company selling through Amazon that is trying to pull a fast one? Either way, this one is probably going on the wood pile.

Expecting long-supressed secrets about RK, what I got was a very few obscure statements and stories turned into an elaborate Freudian analysis of Tantra. This, along with a meandering hypothesis about what was in RK's subconscious. It's just too shaky, and Kripal is too eager to sniff out a conspiracy. For example, in the book's second edition, Kripal admits that Ram Chandra Datta's book--which he claimed was supressed by the RK establishment--was, to his surprise, published by the Ramakrishna Mission the same summer as the first edition of \\"Kali's Child\\"!

Outcome is: massive intentional and stupid mis-translations leading to a utterly crazy (NOT scholarly) hypothesis.My comment:If Mr. Kripal's translation from his references are correct, then the other frightening possibility is (I happened to carefully read those original Bengali books.):I must have absolutely forgotten my mother tongue (Bengali), which I hoped to use until I die!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most disgusting book","review":"I am a Bengali myself.

He is yet to accept a debate in Bengali language in an open forum speaks reams about his proficiency.There has been a scholarly rebuttal to Kripal at http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/s_rv/s_rv_tyaga_kali1_frameset.htm.

A person of such great spiritual stature who inspires in ordinary people to lead a chaste and spiritual life cannot be tainted in such a grotesque manner. Is religionobtained by mere scholarship and erudition? It cannot even be realized by argument. Whose sanction did Mr kripal have when publishing this book. Religion is obtained by leading a pure and chaste life coupled with austere practises. Would Mr Kripal have left any of his wordly life pursuits while writing this book. Sri Ramakrishna was a spiritual giant and only giants can comprehend giants. Mr Kripal obviously is not a realized man. What then makes him an authority in publishing this book.

The book is, therefore, a projection of the author's own homophobia. Jeffrey is a pretender. While he harps that he referred to the 'original' Bengali sources, the fact is that he cannot even read Bengali without the help of a English-Bengali dictionary.

Secondly, the descriptions of the stitches are written assuming that the reader already has a basic knowledge of crochet, using terms that do not make much sense to a first time crocheter, (and with tons of typos!) ei. \\"Inserting you hook into the ring, work as many stitches into the ring as your instructions tell you.\\" Fine for a seasoned crocheter, but a bit confusing when working stitches into a ring has never been explained!I would give this book a 4 or 5-star rating for someone who has at least basic knowledge of crochet, but for the newbie, I'd give it a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simple to be interesting","review":"This book likely won't be of much interest to experienced crocheters, because they've probably seen the projects in similar form in some other book or magazine.The projects are mostly in single crochet, which is fine even for experienced crocheters. However, most of the projects aren't unique. For example, a granny-square throw is included, which is a \\"been-there, done-that\\" project for many crocheters.A large, sleek-looking floor pillow stitched out of leather is the most interesting project in the book. But the author warns the reader that stitching with leather is hard on your hands.There are some unique color combinations in the book, and the photography is well done as others have said. However, avid crocheters are focused on creating crochet projects that appeal to them -- with or without the clever camera work of a photographer or the creative staging techniques of a photo stylist."},{"rating":"1","title":"simple crochet","review":"even if your a beginer this book is just to simplethe projects were so dull I can't see myself ever doing a singlething from this book .

The good doctor questions the ethics of curing one with such \\"true passion\\".There is some interesting study of sexuality in relationship to 'religion', although other than acknowleging that it can cause repression, odd behaviour (the boy) and hypocracy (the father), I'm not sure any new ground was broken or that this movie said anything that made it worth sitting through all the other BS (see paragraph above).

These types of films generally suck plain and simple, but this is among the notoriously worst of its kind. Would you care about the boys psychological make-up and rehibilitation if he had done this cruel act to a group of children? I think not.

One of the scratches is rather deep and didn't go away totally so I did another coat of Nu Finish and it helped but it is still visible. I'd estimate that it is about 75% better than it was to start with.Overall, I am really impressed with the results.

The marks I was sure the GS27 (which I'm not sure they make anymore) would have fixed, the nu finish did nothing. Might as well wipe hand lotion on the scratch. A waste of $10.

It will completely remove extremely light scratches- the kind you have to get down close to see. Anything beyond that it might be able to improve to some degree, but it is still easily visible. I've found that it is about 90% effective for paint transfer from one car to another. You have to work at it, but it will do a pretty good job.

It is not the products fault if the cat still flings it out the front. I also thought that having the hood might help with keeping the odor under the hood, but it really didn't do that.

I would definitely recommend this product to any cat owner who's cat cannot keep their covering to a normal level :) Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cats hated it!!","review":"My two cats refused to get in the litter box after I put the hood on so off it came.

It has pegs that fit right into holes on the litter box, and it is very secure. The plastic is sturdy, and my cats haven't knocked it off at all.It really helps in keeping the litter in the box. Sure, your kitty is going to bring a little out with him, but not nearly as much as he could scatter when he's digging around.My only problem is that the hood seems a little low for larger cats. I have a great big, 20 lb male who is very tall. He has to stoop down very low to get comfortable in there to do his business, and sometimes he ends up \\"depositing\\" behind the rake. Not a big deal, cause he's a pretty easy going cat, but I think they could make this hood taller.Other than that, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personality formation through a fear framework","review":"This is an important and thorough exposition of the affects of fear (and other factors) in early childhood in the development of the self. It is hard to fault much of the theory of the book (679 pages) but it is still a book of its time. Rowe apparently dislikes psychiatrists and seems to feel they are basically superficial and too ready to classify diagnoses using the DSM and then prescribing harmful drugs. She probably takes the fear concept too far when she talks about schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in light of the recent discoveries of brain research. She also seems to believe ADHD is more a new fashionable diagnosis than a very useful concept of the way some brains function.There is much more to this book to do it justice here. Thoroughly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"False dichotemy.","review":"Dorothy Rowe has earned a great level of respect and is known as one of the wisest people to exist in the UK.

Now granted, I haven't read her whole book and will create an update when I finish, but knowing that she overlooked something so fundamental to our responses makes me doubt how rigorously she assesses even some of the basics. Nevertheless, since I haven't read her whole book, I'll still give her 4 stars on good faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I have recorded several CD's from albums with a Phillips recorder and they sound good.

The so-called master in this video has spent too much time in the dojang and has no idea of what would work in the street. His movements are stiff and predictable. He demonstrates against people doing stiff TKD attacks, not against anything like what one would really encounter. When he punches, his elbow flops out to the side which both robs you of power and steals the nice crisp look which many TKD people admire. I get the impression, however, that he may have some idea of what to do in the street, but not using the techniques he demonstrates here. Unfortunately, this is an all too common trait in the TKD community - \\"I'll show it to you this way, but do it another way if you want it to work\\".

Most of the time it took the computer several attempts before it heard a dialtone from the modem.Last time I checked, Creative's support website had not yet addressed this issue.

This modem works fine, but it didn't improve my connection. I still connect at the same 40-43kb/s. I even tried it with two different ISPs, same effect. I even changed the phone line going into the modem and no change. Oh well, it was worth a try anyway, but I didn't expect any miracles.The installation was easy. Especially since I took another reviewer's advice and downloaded the XP driver from the Creative website before removing my old modem.Overall, it does what it's suposed to do, but I wouldn't recomend getting it if you want higher connection speed, unless your ISP supports v.92 or you have a modem less than 56k."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norman, no...Gloria, yes!","review":"I gave this dog to my niece, Madeline, for Christmas, along with a hardcover version of \\"Grumpy Gloria.\\" She loved it.

I had taken several Pilates classes before buying this DVD, but I found it difficult to remember exactly what to do in each pose since all of the instruction is at the end. Much of Pilates is in the finer points like breathing correctly and making sure to squeeze at the right times, so with no reminder of what I should be doing in each pose I felt like I was being cheated out of a workout. I don't think that having no interruption is worth sacrificing form, so this DVD will be stored away while I learn the specifics of Pilates elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great workout!","review":"I started with Winsor pilates, which is great but sloooowwww. Winsor moves through the moves with a lot of detail and explanation. But FIT CHIC is awesome! There are two parts to this video, the first is the routine which is done with no breaks. She moves from one exercise to the next like a dance, following her choreography. It is a great intense, twenty minute workout. Afterward, is the instruction bit, where she explains all the moves, how they should be done, and number of repetitions.

I defy anyone to email me and present to me an original topic that this woman tackles. As for the reviewer here who wrote 'Would you attack cancer researchers for their obscure language?' No, because cancer researchers are attempting to break down complex chemical and biological processes to their simplest explanations. They strive for clarity. They attempt to explain. I know cancer researchers. I have read their textbooks. Ms. Butler is no cancer researcher. Readers and not engineers, literature is not a science. Literature is the study of the human experience and the human soul, and the pretentious Ms. Butler has shown us her soul--and we find it empty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual Pretension","review":"This book only has one useful function, and that is to demonstrate how NOT to construct a solid, sound, logicical argument. The problem is that everything dissolves basically into Butler's bizarre form of \\"logic\\" and \\"thinking\\": \\"IF this is so, then...\\" Read this book and check out how often she employs this way of writing. Well...the IFS multiply and multiply, and could be thoroughly challenged and critiqued at every single stage. However, she needs these extremely thin \\"IFs\\" to construct the bogus positions she wants to \\"deconstruct.\\" Her reading of Lacan--which she then goes on to \\"challenge\\"-- is a total fantasy, specious, and wrong. How can we seriously consider anything she says when her mode of writing is so untenable to begin with? Do not be blinded by Butler's pretensions to being a deep thinker, she is not, she is merely a person with decided OPINIONS, and that's all this book is, someone mouthing off about their opinion. But it is not a real work of thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"I bought two brand new Dirt Devil filters for about half of what it would have cost me in a \\"big box\\" store.

For the novice or the expert you will find things you didn't know about politics, political relationships and the real world of elections and winning. One can only hope that Mr. Walker gets \\"FOUR MORE YEARS!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's a \\"real\\" find.","review":"I picked this book up on the recommendation of a friend and now I recommend it to my friends. Having worked in numerous political campaigns and run for state representative once myself, I can attest to its realism.I'll say right out that this is not Twain nor Tolstoy--I didn't expect that--but it is a great read. I'd compare it to Tom Clancy. I spent six years in the U.S. Navy, on submarines. I'd avoided military/thriller books until I found Red October and enjoyed its alarming correctness and style.Now I find the same things in Walker's book. I enjoyed its style, jumping from front to front, until it all comes together. Based on my political experience, I was relieved to find the story so believable. I found myself comparing the characters to real life people I know and work with (or against). I'm hoping for a sequel Mr. Walker, if you're out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Muppet lover's dream","review":"This is a wonderful game.

It's also hard to see where a passage leads.Sound: 5/10 - The usual cartoon racing score hangs in the background, while the cars don't do anything too dramatic with their engines.Value: 5/10 - Most racing games are worth the money because they're entertaining, but to make a long story short, this one isn't really worth paying for unless you're a really big fan of the muppets.Overall: 5/10 - This is the sort of game you play in the game or record store while your waiting for Mum to finish her grocery shopping. In a game where you can hardly see where you're going, is it worth even playing? Yes, but only if Mum takes a couple of hours to find a broccoli stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"It definitely wasn't like Crash Team Racing","review":"I was hoping to find a game that would be similiar to Crash Team Racing.

I got this for my daughter as a Christmas gift in 2000 and she was 7-1/2 at that time. She tried to play it several times and has found it very difficult and frustrating to play. I've tried playing it myself and found it very difficult to control.

Instead of being a coffee table book containing mostly the latest, prettiest photos, much space was wasted on perfunctory texts containing little new information to space buffs, and the layout of the pictures was poorly judged, in my opinion, with several oddly-angled pictures splayed across the pages.

I noticed a liquid that beaded like tiny droplets of water was separating from the paste as I spread it on the hood. I didn't think anything of it. I let the paste haze as usual and then wiped it off. My hood now looks terrible. Where the tiny droplets were, there is no paste coverage so the finish looks spotted. I put another coat on with a dry applicator thinking maybe I had it too damp the first time. Big mistake, now it looks even worse with big swirl marks when you look at it at an angle.

It's amazing how you can take a bunch of tracks like \\"Punk\\", \\"Man Research\\", and \\"5/4\\" and create something softer, more laid-back. This is kind of a \\"California Beach\\" record (or at least that's what I think). I really like it, but once again, I don't own it, so I can't say for sure.

Mixing the low bass and mystical fog feel of dub with the feel good sound of reggae, and a splash of dance, this is it. There's nothing better than a 20 minute instrumental, with smooth tunage and sounds out of nowhere to mezmerize the soul.If you dig this, you should pick up the Dead 60's dub/extended version of their only album.

Some people will say it's awful, but there's things I didn't even really notice about the original songs until I listened to the Spacemonkeyz remixes. The 5 that really stand out to me are 19-2000 (very slow, droopy downbeat with a good baseline), Slow Country, New Genius, Re-Hash (an awsome New Orleans Jazz feel), and M1A1. I've never been a big fan of the original M1A1, but the remix is really sweet. It sort of has an inviting friendship feel. I don't know how to discribe it.

This album is absolutely novel, you will probably not even recognize a few of the tracks at the first few listens.

He is very promising as a healer and is accepted into the Citadel, where he will be taught. The Empress becomes in debt to him, and all seems to be going well, except that her advisor, an evil person, has power over her and hates Gabriel because he thinks that his job is being stolen by him. (That whole powerful advisor thing reminded me of Aladdin.)When Jaganath (that's the guy's name) finally turns over Gabriel's life, he starts another with the Shinali people and tries to bring about a prophecy that both cultures yearn for.Those some of this was cliche, it will leave you staring at the last page, wanting to start over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vigilante is a great, underrated exploitation flick!","review":"This is a review of the Blue Underground Blu-Ray release of VIGILANTE.Forster steals the show here.

This movie had way too many unneccessary parts and it's like they ran out of money or something and just made a hasty ending. I don't get the whole jail part and what purpose it served is beyond me. Even further beyond me is the fact that only about 25% of the movie is acually about the revenge of the husband. Why show and group of guys go around beating up drug dealers and pimps when it serves no real purpose in the storyline? It'd be OK if it had all come together in the end, but it never did.

If you want something decent, pick up a previous disc, because this one is seriously lacking in everything that makes Wumpscut worth listening to. \\"Scavenger\\" is the only redeeming feature on this CD, and really, it's not all that spectacular.

This is uninspired drek of the worst kind. The songs sound like they were made using some paint-by-numbers composition program. Behold the joy of being flogged endlessly by looped choruses, sleepy mid-tempo beats and some of the worst lyrics ever delivered by an industrial band (the chorus to Fatal Longing is \\"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\" repeated ad nauseam). The high points of the album don't come until the end, with Fallen Angel being the only middle of the album track worth mentioning. Music this shallow might be par for the course for corporate rock radio, but from an artist like Rudy Ratzinger its just insulting. We know you can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wumpscut Album (I think)","review":"I have many Wumpscut albums and this is my favourite. Not too heavy, not too light.

It just did not grow on me at all like most music in this genre does. Rather than find some way to relate to the songs, pick up on a vibe to ride the album on, or even find some way to appriciate the 'artistic merrit' of the album, I only ended up feeling... cheated. The few songs on Bone Peeler that I somewhat liked ended up sounding redundant and weak. The music was not at all interesting and I swimmed around in Bone Peeler searching for something, anything to help me like the album. But alas, it ended up feeling like a very half-hearted album on the part of Rudy. And this was not the only time that Rudy would leave me feeling dissapointed. Rather, he would take it down one more notch, and take his music into another realm: That of complete and utter drearyness. One more album after this one, and I had lost all utter wanton to continue purchasing new :W: releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear.. no no no.","review":"I'm not going to delve into this album, as other people have already pointed out the majority of its flaws.

She fell in love with Bill Parks, an adventurous westerner who taught her to love the Arizona landscape as much as he did. Despite many hardships, both became writers who described the beauty of the land around them. This memoir is filled with stories of hardwork, courage, and adventure as well as fascinating detail about what Arizona was like in the 1940s and 1950s and beyond. It will appeal to readers who admire women with the courage to make a life on their own terms as well as lovers of the American West."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same stuff I used to use","review":"This product seems to cause more stomach irritation,than its suppose to be relieving.I took one capsule and it hurt my stomach.I may try it one more time ,but the first time was so unpleasant thatI was reluctant to try it again.This product was missing from my rite aid shelves and than I found it on Amazon.I am unsure if Schiff changed its ingrediants or what,but I purchased three boxes at one time,and I dont think I'll be able tofinish them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"This product works well.

I bought the cheapest ones I could find on Amazon (the Kirkland brand), and they worked amazingly well. I took two instead of one whenever I ate dairy, just because I wanted to make sure there was enough lactase in my stomach to digest whatever lactose I had eaten.

Except when I eat cottage cheese; my system does seem to need 1 LI pill then.There's really nothing to worry about, because it's not a drug. There's no problem if you take too much.

Now, I take one pill in the morning and I can still enjoy ice cream 10 pm in the evening without any problem! The pricing of this bundled package is the cheapest I have found so far (cheaper than Wal-Mart). They do warn you that in the beginning you might have mild bloating, which I had. But this was not such a big deal (lasted about 30 min) and if you are concerned, I would supplement with your regular lactaid pill in the first couple of days.I think this is the best LI products I ever found and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from lactose intolerance.

Being Hispanic I lacked an enzyme which helped digest dairy products. Now I drink milk daily and eat ice cream on occassion without concern. My 2 sons take a pill daily. We only have to take one pill a day as opposed to other products which require you consume a tablet everytime you eat a dairy product. This is an over the counter supplement, not a drug.

That turned out to be one of the things I don't like about it! I'm forever dis-assembling and re-assembling the darn thing, and then it comes out of the dishwasher scummy-looking, so I still have to wash it by hand. Also, because it is level, not tilting like the George Foreman grill, juices flow out of it in all directions. It reminds me of a waffle maker that way - where you have to scrub the back and sides when you're done. Lastly, the required 5-minute pre-heating time is irritating, and then it seems to be TOO hot! It burns items easily. All in all, I found my self using it less than the George Foreman, which was always ready to go.

As a matter of fact, I am kind of embarrassed by it's lack of a red ring, and plasticky-ness.

I bought this lens for \\"fun\\", just wanting to play around with some macro photography. And it is very fun! Aside from a little extra hunting for the focus, which should be expected from any macro, this lens is a dream. I'm using it on the Canon 5D. The clarity and detail from this lens is superb. The bokeh is beautiful. I've found I'm even using it professionally, and it's working out to be a wonderful portrait lens as long as I have time to let it focus. This is on my list of favorite lenses!Updated in 2010: It's been over 3 years since I bought this lens, and I still love it.

It's ridiculously sharp, to the point where it's something you have to be cognizant about. I could see the spines of my shoot-through umbrella in the reflection on an ice cube in a photo of mine.

It's a great macro lens. If you are considering this lens I would recommend it but be aware that you will need a tripod because there is no Image Stabilization in it. I take pictures purely as a hobby and I think I had become a bit spoiled by the IS in my other lenses.With that said, it is well-made, sturdy but a bit on the heavy side.I use it for macro work and its also great for landscapes. The color is great. On most images, I don't have to adjust the saturation at all.

It's odd in that the key terms are not bolded in the text. But if you can look pass this and not mind the very simple, almost bland in text pictures, it's a good book to use. The text is simpler and easier to read compared to some introductory hematology books, except for the cytokine and interleukin parts, but those topics are harder to digest in general.

The descriptives in this book were not directly related to the names listed. They were random listings of statistical facts about ALL the people who were lost 9/11/01, some were stories of what the people may have done on the 10th of september, there were a few interesting paragraphs describing what kinds of tatoos people had, or what kinds of cloths they were wearing. This book was so moving. I can't explain how intense and well thought out it was. The amount of information she used in the book is so vast. She just helps you to know more about the people who were lost. I am sorry Mrs Fairben feels that way, because the book is something to treasure and a way for those of us who did not know the people who were lost to feel closer to those who were.

However, when I got to the page where my son was listed, I almost felldown. He was listed with 3 or 4 other names, alkl women. Under that was the sub title, Physical Descriptions.

Then he worked under Niels Bohr at Copenhagen and under Max Born at Gottingen, before World War 2. This was during a time of great intellectual ferment in physics. The underpinnings of quantum mechanics were being hashed out at both places.Mott specialised in solid state research. He is remembered in the \\"Mott transition\\".The book describes his work in a manner suitable for a general audience. And how in 1977, he shared the Nobel in physics.

My son does like the singing animal buttons but the shape sorter side is a source of total frustration. Obviously, he's too young to unlock the door so we leave it open. But then he has a hard time keeping it open to get the shapes out and ends up ripping it off it's hinges! I'm sure that can't go on for too long before it will be broken for good. The pop-up bear side is too hard for a little one to work and too simplistic to interest an older child. The other sides are mildly interesting to me but not at all interesting to my son.

The plastic on the body of the machine broke where the bottomplate screws into. This is my fifth Hoover and it is the only one that is so poorly made. I still have two older Hoover that I use cleaning downstairs and the garage. One is over 15 years old. Of course all of this happened right after warranty and Hoover was sympathetic but was no help. No wife says she will no longer buy a Hoover since they evidently do not stand behind their products.

It leaves a horrible DUSTY mess. I'm taking it back to the store I bought it from immediately.

I just spent the past two hours cleaning out the entire vacuum and decided to fix the filter as well. The motor for the filter still spins, but the filter does not. The reason it doesn't is because they made the motor-to-filter connector with some strategically placed holes that make the plastic break over time. Once the plastic breaks, it is no longer able to grip the filter to turn it. I am breaking it inwards and filling it with expanding glue to fix this (this should do the trick). I would be surprised if the self-cleaning worked more than a year on this model.It was also very messy cleaning, and took 25 screws to get it out (which is important if you plan on replacing the filter)"},{"rating":"1","title":"bummer","review":"Bought this vacuum lasted a whole 6 months!

Also, the so called \\"powered\\" brush for use on the upholstery wand is \\"powered\\" by suction through the hose.

After buying it, I read Consumer Reports rating and it was favorable, so I was relieved. Well, that did last long. The first couple times I used it I was ok with it. But it really is a piece of crap. In fact, it is even worse than the $69 Eureka I used in college. Here are a few reasons why it sucks (in the bad way):1. It doesn't suck (in the good way). I have never used a vacuum that has less suction.2. You have to empty the can every single time you use it. If you don't, it literally will not suck up a small leaf off the floor.3. It is messy4.

But when it came time to empty the LARGE dirt cup, a bunch of dirt fell outside the cup. I thought that it might be that I over-filled the dirt cup, but no matter how much or how little I vacuum before emptying, I always end up using the dust buster to clean up the dirt that drops once the dirt cup is released. I tried shaking and pounding the vacuum before emptying to try and get the dirt to drop, but it won't until the cup is removed. I can't deal with having to constantly vacuum my vacuum.

It has some nice features, i.e. the long hose, the handle that slips out to become the cleaning wand, adjustable height, but the poor performance easily over-rides them. The suction disappears after fewer than 10 minutes of vacuuming, and the dirt cup must be emptied so that the top filter can be cleared of dust and fibers that have accumulated. The mess that is created by the contents falling out of the HEPA filter and the dirt cup make for quite a mess on the floor, that must then be cleaned up. It seems to defeat the purpose of the HEPA filter to have all that dust floating into the air! I took mine back after 2 weeks.

I call again Hoover ask to be exchange for another vacuum cleaner and they said they couldn't do it. If you ask me bad customer service that you don't expect from Hoover (they never were rude) since this vacuum doesn't fulfill its purpose. They should accept the vacuum cleaner has problems.

It has been about two weeks since we got them and it have not break yet except for the gold button on the breast shield. I believe they were playing pretty rough with it and that gold button broke off. The helmet is a little too small for my 4 year old boy and too small for my 6 year old boy, but they wear it anyway, ha!

My children have been playing with their sets everyday since Christmas. I'm just amazed that they have continued to play with it and that they haven't broken them yet. When my daughter was invited to a friends birthday party and his mom said he liked swords, well I knew that this would be an excellent gift for him. It ended up being most favorite gift and all the kids at the party wanted to try it on and play with it.If your little one has a warriors heart, they'll love this imaginative play set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, good quality","review":"This is well-made.

Now it is permanently creased and difficult to play with. The helmet doesn't have a chin strap and won't stay on during play. The vest attachements are not kid friendly and so my 4 year old can't put it on himself and it has sharp corners that poke in to him when he moves. Great idea, poor execution. If you want a fun knight costume, I would look for a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not exactly a SLOW cooker","review":"I thought this monster slow cooker would work well with my large family. I have used crockpots for years. Well the problem here is that it cooks too fast. The high setting is like medium high on the stove. The low setting is like almost medium high on the stove. I put five pounds of chicken in at 4 and by 8 I had very done chicken. I put a stew in on low when I left for work. Eight hours later....things were so done that I had mush. Yes I filled it up past the halfway point. Veggies get done without an isssue in this appliance.I use this slowcooker now like an extra pot off the stove. On high, it will bubble and boil. I use it to put tomorrow's dinner in at five thirty in the evening. By nine that same night, I have a meal for tomorrow. I am just glad I did not give away my old crockpot. Sometimes you need the food to cook SLOWLY. This should be named the Spacious Extra Pot that can cook tons of food quickly. There is nothing slow about this appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have This Crock Pot, not that GREAT","review":"I bought this crock pot new and have only used it 4 to 5 times. I will buy a new one as this one is not that great.Pros:Cooks very fast, easy to useCons:burns the food, lid does not stay on tight so all the liquid squirts all over the counter, the lid dances on top of the pot, hard to clean, and the worst part is the metal gets extremely hot.

So, sorry, but I can't comment on the delay issue, all my listening is/was in stereo.This is a DVD-A. That means that, in effect, it's a high definition CD, except that you need a DVD player to listen to it. It will NOT play on a standard CD player.I'd recommend this collection of songs to old time, hard core fans, like myself. It's alternative versions of some of their earlier work. If you're just discovering UH, start with regular studio albums or 'best of' type recordings. Especially since this is out of print, rare, and expensive.The sound is clean enough, but sometimes the songs don't sound completely finished, ie: vocals too forward, one channel louder than the other, etc.However, I'm a fan, the songs are great, and the differences from album versions run from interesting to 'Wow, cool'.joe"},{"rating":"2","title":"One step closer to inner peace and happiness in my marriage","review":"I was having a world of problems in my marriage and I did not know where to look.

NOW WHAT? punched right through my walls of denial and forced me to make a real objective re-evaluation of myself and my relationship. It did wonders for me. After that it was easy to see that I did not have to stay hung up on trying to prove that I was right every time my husband and I disagreed. The touching personal stories in this book showed me how I could get past the stuck point in an argument even if my husband refused to see things from my perspective.

With twists and turns, the surprises abound. Just when you think you have it finally figured out, you find yet more surprises! Once I started reading it, I didn't want to stop!

I don't think the fault is with me especially since I had several other people try to decipher the instructions for these projects with no success.

Thank You"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague and Unhelpful","review":"In the spirit of full disclosure, I have to say I have some experience with bookbinding and was probably expecting more from this book than I should have. Apart from that, though, I still think this book is not really worth buying if you're interested in beginning bookbinding. Not only are the instructions vague and unhelpful, some of the instructions go against everything else I've learned about bookbinding. An experienced bookbinder might be able to interpret the directions for some of these projects, but only because of previous practice instead of clear instruction and helpful photos and diagrams. I would recommend Handmade Books, by Shereen LaPlantz, Making Handmade Books, by Alisa Golden, anything by Keith Smith, or internet tutorials instead of this book.The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one is that there are some fun ideas that could inspire a bookmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and unique books!","review":"This is an excellent book for you if you want to create a book thats not the \\"norm\\".

Some products will leave a residue or make my hair feel weighted down, or make it more difficult to run my hands though my hair. Not this product. In fact, not only does this stuff make my hair look lots shinier, it makes it slicker too, so it feels better to run my hands through my hair during the day.The price can't be beat either, so I never feel like I have to \\"save\\" this product for a special event.

Dino crisis 2 is much better than the original (though the original is fun too).. the weapon layout and game play is wayyy better in the second one. There are way more dinos to take out and more area to explore. The graphic are slightly better and the menus are laid out better. Game play is just as fun as newer games imho. If you havent played these yet.. just imagine resident evil 2 with dinos instead of zombies. Only thing that kinda sucked was I did get enough 'dino points' to buy the best weapons & supplies till the very end.

A great game all around.You control two dynamic characters, Dylan Morton a TRAT special task force member with a confusing role. Regina returns for this mission. If you are into games where things just jump out at you unexpectedly, Dino Crisis 2 is the game for you, because it is packed with much heart-pounding action and intensity.

This is NOTHING like the first one. For instance: There arent any scary moments that have you changing your underwear. And there's WAY to much ammo and guns that you can buy thanks to those stupid \\"points\\" after killing dinos. There's really no challenge in this game. POINTLESS compared to Resident Evil where you have to save every bullet to kill the zombies. In this game you just run around shooting dinos that always re-apear seconds after there dead. The voice acting is decent, and there's plenty of scencs that keep the story moving, even if the story doesnt make too much sence. The CG movies are awesome, especially the intro. But thats about it.

Would definitely do business again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Magical, Marvelous, and Fun!!!","review":"Dragon on a Pedestal was the 1st Xanth novel I have read. I can say but one word: WOW! It was a great story. It combined an interseting story about how little princess Ivy got lost in the jungles of Xanth after being saved from the Gap Dragon by a zombie, and added many interesting twists at the same time. Ivy's fearlessness and bravery got her through every challenge she faced. Piers Anthony even added some interesting words from, possibly, a \\"Xanth Dictionary\\" to make it fun. I really got into the story. Anthony described everything very well, it was as if you were there. I think it was an extremely awesome book, and anyone interested in fantasy stories should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Effort from a Worthwhile Author","review":"I have truly enjoyed all of Anthony's Xanth books up until this one. The books of this series are made memorable and entertaining to me largely due to the incredible imagination of the author. That is, unfortunately, the main missing aspect of this novel. Our young heroine's talent seems to function as a vehicle for making unbelievable polt twists occur rather than as a specific talent that marked the heros and heroines of the other Xanth novels. **SPOILER** Another weak chain of events was the benefit reaped by the Tree of Life. That idea was about as poorly put forth as Ivy's talent of convenience---I was half expecting Irene to find a seed that grew cannons or Volvos.While most other Xanth novels had the ability to make the reader believe that the fantastical events were possible in Xanth due to the incredible magic of the land and characters, this one just made this reader believe the author ran out of good ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ended my desire to read Xanth novels","review":"Simply put, this book was terrible. I couldn't read another Xanth novel after this.Did none of the other reviewers tear their hair out while screaming things like \\"A 3 year old could not possibly think like that!\\"The first 3 Xanth novels established Xanth as a wonderous and dangerous place where people were afraid to leave their own villages unless they possessed strong magic. Now some little 3 year old tyke can venture into the wilderness almost with impugnity.Do yourself a favor. Read the first 4 Xanth novels. They are great. The few after that are merely OK until you read this one. After that, I do not know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way cheaper than Autozone!","review":"I used this on an 05 chevy silverado quad cab!

Her writing is wonderful, and a lot of the best elements of both her writing and usual themes come together wonderfully in the final story. The other ones are worth reading, too, but the final story stands on its own and is alone worth finding this book now that it is, sadly, out of print.

However, the last story had a profound effect on me. Ursula LeGuin is one of my favorite authors, and \\"A Fisherman of the Inland Sea\\" is definitely my favorite LeGuin story. It makes one think about what is really important in life, what makes life worth living (and indeed, liveable at all). It also begs one to ponder the aspects of personal relationships in our society which are often taken for granted. Buy the book if only for the last story. Then read _The Disposessed_ for another side of LeGuin, and another terrific story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and play poker for real","review":"I was looking forward to this game but was I ever dissapointed.

Every child who has used it in my pool becomes bored with it within a few minutes. When balancing on the board, it can launch out of the water and have had a few people get a fairly good smack in the face.

I have to turn it back on about 6 times to finish a pot of coffee. I might as well squeeze the beans under hot water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"This is my second Black and Decker thermal carafe coffee pot and this one is no better than the last one - that was recalled! Getting the water into the back is messy but the worst part is letting the \\"untrained\\" pour their own coffee. You may finally learn how to use the lid but believe me your guests won't. I bought this because I thought it would keep coffee fresher for entertaining. All it does is cause a headache. People either leave the \\"lock button\\" open and the coffee gets cold or they unlock the lid and then when they try to pour coffee, the lid goes flying and coffee comes pouring out - all over the counter, cabinets, in the drawers, on the floor, etc. If you don't want to have to train your guests, get something MUCH EASIER to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"This coffeemaker has been recalled","review":"If you bought this coffeemaker, you need to visit this website:http://www.acprecall.comBoth the TCM700 and the TCM750 have been recalled by the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starbucks is playing this in the coffee house?","review":"I didn't expect Starbucks to start playing Jimi Hendrix, considering the material they often play. But then I remembered that they sell Stones cds, and that was the end of that.Rainy Day, Dream Away is great if you are either an occasional listener of Henrix or if you are starting to listen to Hendrix. Either way, it contains songs from the Jimi Hendrix Experiences three albums and puts them together in a great package. All songs are crystal clear, and does a good job of covering Jimi Hendrix's short lived career."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent camera!","review":"I'm not a big \\"picture person,\\" I usually only take my camera now and then for special occassions and trips. I've had this camera for about 3 years and it works perfectly for everything I've needed to do. The big downside is there's not much memory included. I paid around $200 for it when it was new...now it's worth much less...but for someone who only snaps a few pictures here and there, it's great. A bit bulky (not a pocket camera) but hey - it does the job, and does it well; almost all my pictures are from this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant (At first)","review":"This game is absolutely brilliant at first: the splendid graphics , the plethora of weapons at your disposal, the genius level layout, the more than abundant gore but the fun gradually fades away after about 6 or 7 hours of playing it. Do not get me wrong, this one of the best if not best spawn based games available right now but nothing can negate the fact that it just becomes a bit tedious after you have unlocked most of its characters and galleries. If it was not for this I would give this game a five star rating, albeit if you can find this game at a bargain price, like 10 US Dollars, I would highly recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing game!","review":"I used to play this game in the arcade when I lived in Laredo. It was the only game I loved the most. I unlocked all the secret characters for the cabinet right before they took it out (there are more characters than in this version). When I moved to Houston I found out just recently that it existed for console on the Dreamcast. So I aspired to own this game as soon as I buy my console.

After reading the other reviews perhaps it would have helped to have read some of her other wolf books first, but I doubt it. Her story line was full of inconsistancies - almost as if she had forgotten what she had just written, her descriptive prose was awkward, repetitive and oh so boring, and her characters could have been interchangeable cardboard cutouts. I tried to give up on reading this book roughly every 50 pages or so, but I haven't given up on a book in over a decade so I guess you could say it was a matter of principal that I perservered and kept reading. Besides, it had to get better, right? Wrong. I sincerely regret wasting my time. There are too many marvelous new and old authors to ever try this author again, so consider yourself warned. I wish I had been."},{"rating":"1","title":"And another thing....","review":"The author keeps referring to Dryas as an Amazon. But then when Dryas refers to her people she speaks of women and men living together in some sort of harmony. The Amazons of Myth never cohabitated in harmony with men...the Amazons used them as breeders to populate the female race then they tossed the men aside or used them as slaves--as well as any male offspring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night of the Wolf","review":"WOW! Fantastic grasp of the period. What an incredible magical tale! I think if you enjoyed The Mysts of Avalon this book will be a hit with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after 150 pages","review":"I hardly ever put down a book prematurely once I start it, but I found I had no interest in the characters, therefore I didn't care what happened to them. So I quit. Seems to me like there should be some evidence of a plot by where I was in the book, but unless it was a love story (gag), I couldn't discern it. The only reason I bought this book was the relation to A.Rice. Big mistake. Too bad too, because the first 75 pages or so started off great. She can definitely write well, she just needs more of a story to build on. Like what kind of creature is this wolf? No clues were given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research, research, research","review":"If you know anything about the Roman empire, you know more than this author does. Her innumerable Latin (and English) grammar and spelling errors make this book unreadable. I dogeared pages with mistakes, and my copy looks more like a fan than a text. Avoid this book (and its sequels) at all costs. You have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"I enjoyed The Silver Wolf, but Night of the Wolf just didn't go anywhere. The story surrounding the wolf character was boring and the stories about the other characters were confusing. Perhaps those who persevered into the second half were rewarded. I couldn't get there.I'm glad it was a library book. I won't be trying Ms. Borchardt again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally forgetable","review":"Having picked this book up second hand for $2 i thought that I'd give it a go; a mistake. It was adequately written but not remarkable. The characters were either cardboard cutout stereotypes or just uninteresting. Sadly even the sex scenes were dull, written in that \\"fluffy\\" manner that typifies some styles of writing. That, plus the other flaws of the plot, characterisation and writing, coupled with seemingly gratuitous violence left me unable to finish the book and utterly uninterested in what happened to the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment and a waste of my money","review":"After buying the first book, The Silver Wolf, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. The Silver Wolf sucked me in immeditately and I was never able to put it down. This book, however....First off, the transitions are clumsily written, making you feel confused almost all the way to the end. Not only that, the plot moved like a snail. From the portrayal of Maeniel in the first book he seemed interesting and a character of depth and honor. As I read on in the sequel, however, I felt as if he was nothing after all but an animal. He has not even half the depth of Regeane's character from the first novel.I think that maybe this book was rushed or something. I hope she puts a lot more effort (and better character development) into any upcoming sequels. This book was a severe disapointment to me and I know (using The Silver Wolf as an example) that she can do much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story to dream to be a part of...","review":"I loved this book. I read the first one, I loved it too. I've read Anne Rice before, and I think I'm going to have to vote for the were-wolf stroy teller. It probably had to do with, my favor of wolves over bats, but the story was magnificant. I have found a new passion in historic fiction, as long as there is a bit of magic. I really felt like I was there, I could see ancient Rome and Gaul. I could feel all the emotions of the array of charcters. Its a story packed with magic, passion, greed, duty, and curiousity about the other side. Just a great tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"hardly readable","review":"I expect so much from the concept, and yet I am more disapointed each time I read another of this author's books. This one had great potential, but I consistently and almost immeidiately found myself wondering about the plot connections ( they were vague to say the least) and just what was really going on. I did slog though it,skipping huge sections, hoping to get more insight into to wolf, but I feel Maniel was not developed nearly as completly as he could have been, and that certain love story elements were created at the very end just as an afterthought. I could go on, but I would not recommend this book, which is too bad, as the concept is great and the time period is interesting, but the author: frankly I am amazed that she can get published. Very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing prequel to Silver Wolf","review":"This book is more of a historical novel filled with erotica than a fantasy novel, even though one of the characters can turn into a wolf. Her previous book, \\"Silver Wolf\\", seemed more story-driven, while this one just seemed long. I trudged through the whole thing, thinking I would at least learn more about the wolf, but ended up disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Beautifully written, flows well, Alice is a wonderful story teller bringing you into the story making it seem like if you opened your eyes away from the book your there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Strikes, You're Out","review":"If you want to be confused for almost an entire story, just read this. Alice Borchardt did not keep to a very good story line in her book Silver Wolf but in Night of the Wolf I believe there never was a story line. She jumps from one thing to another without any conection what so evcr. This is probably the 3rd worst story I have ever read and I read about 30 books a year. Anyway, that was strike two. I will give her one more chance before I decide to never read another of her books. It's hard to believe she is related to Ann Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I hadn't bought it...","review":"...I would have quit after 50 pages or so. Ms. Borchardt successfully created a mysterious atmosphere by not explaining many of the characters' actions. There are many undercurrents and mystical events that are never explained. Perhaps if you are an expert on mythology, some of the mysteries will be apparent to you. I'm fairly well read, but much of the book went over my head. I won't buy another of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful adaptation","review":"Excellent western with fantastic scenery. Follows Zane Grey's book almost to the letter.

One Macedonian who works as a translator praised the book, commenting that it helps to have been written by an American (or a Canadian) who can understand Makedonski from the English speaker's point of view. A *mild* criticism is that the book barely prepared me for the ethnic diversity I encountered, even in Skopje.

I leave my cool grips in place over the handles. Like the Calphalon pans, the cool grips must be hand-washed. If I don't have a cool grip for a Professional Hard Anodized pan, I use the Calphalon suede panhandler or a thick potholder because the chrome plated iron handles on these pans may be hot to the touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are a MUST","review":"I've had my Calphalon professional hard anodized set of cookware for about 10 years now. Wouldn't use any other brand, but these cool grip handles are a MUST with this particular line. The handles on the pots do get quite hot, but these handles can even handle oven temps up to 500 if you need to put the pan in the oven.I'm ordering two or three more since I have a couple of pots I'm using more these days that don't have the cool grips on them. I usually leave the grips on my pots and take them off occasionally to clean them by hand.I wish they would make these post-purchase type products for the lids on my pots. Those handles get quite hot as well and I have to use a potholder. I know the newer lines of Calphalon don't have hot handles on the pots or lids, but the older lines still have them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An undiscovered jewel","review":"Peter Lewy is an extraordinarily gifted cellist and composer. His original interpretations of the classical canon are daring and eye opening. He approaches Bach with a unique sense of freedom born from improvising classical music in a jazz style.

Often that means a lot of cleaning up and many dirty pots. That is where this beast comes in. Make no mistake about, this is one big pan! Fortunately it's not too heavy being made out of aluminium (if was copper like some of my other saute pans it would weigh a ton!).When I am cooking something that involves first browning meat, then adding vegetables and eventually adding a sauce this pan can hold it all. I can make enough for ten or more people. It is great for:* Meat pasta sauces like a Ragu (not the brand, the real thing) or Bolognese-stlye meat sauce* Chicken Korma* ChiliI even use it for just browning meat without crowding it. This is an affordable pan for it's size. I use it often and it has held up well.

And IF you are lucky enough to get the bag zipped and the air vac'd out, the air-lock leaks.

The principle sounds good but the proof is in the pudding. The Space Bag is just poorly made. The material is just too thin and prone to pinpricks and tears. I pasted on so much ducked tap to seal tiny holes that were letting air in that they soon resembled a patchwork quilt. The sealing tab ripped the plastic to the point that I could no longer use it to seal the bag. It didn't matter much since it seldom sealed the bag anyway.

Once I knew the trick, the bags were very easy to zip. The problem that others experienced is not that the bag looses air, but that the person sealing the bag was to impatient and didn't take time to think about it. I love these bags.

The end result is a must have for fans of Celine Dion or of the french language itself. The power of Celine in her native tongue...leaves one speechless. You haven't heard Celine's full power until you've heard her like this. Track 2 'Zora Sourit' is already on it's way to becoming a hit. My personal favorite is Track 8 'L'abandon'.

However, just today when I used it, I came back to find that for no obvious reason, the plastic lid was melted on the heating plate. It was so bad, I was not able to pry the plastic lid off. I had to throw the whole unit--cooked eggs and all in the trash. There was no warning from previous use that this was going to happen.

Clean up is a breeze if you use a cooking spray before adding the eggs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oster 4716 Egg Cooker","review":"Product worked great at the beginning but after a very few times of poaching, the egg gets more and more runny until now it is almost like a raw egg even after putting more water than it calls for when poaching. The next time I poach I will try putting the water up to the boiled eggs line and see if that will work. It continues to steam some but it must not be hot enough. I like the concept and I must have a defective egg poacher because the other reviews have not mentioned this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD PRODUCT, EXCEPT","review":"THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY EXCEPT THE SIZE OF THE CUPS.

It was highly efficient, made eggs perfectly, and was reasonably easy to clean. Its use was as recommended by the manual.Then, two days ago the house filled with the stench of melting plastic. When it was traced back to the egg cooker, it appeared switched off but was in fact burning into overdrive. The plastic canopy had melted like Dali's clocks, and begun to sag over some hard boiled eggs left from the night before. I unplugged the cooker, and discovered that the canopy had melted into the base and was fastened tight.Not only was it completely ruined, but if this had happened when no one was at home, it might have even burned down the house!In spite of all of this device's very positive qualities, this is clearly a fatal flaw and cannot be recommended. Oster should recall this model and overhaul the design for safety purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible, horrible design flaw","review":"If the lid that accompanied this egg cooker was glass (as they used to be) or stainless steel, this might be a handy device. Unfortunately, the lid is plastic. And the lid is in constant contact with the part of the egg cooker that heats the water. The byproduct of this is that the lid will melt. I wish I had read the one-star reviews. They all say the same thing.Given the design of this, I can't imagine how anyone's plastic lid didn't melt. Perhaps these reviews are combined for an Oster product that's no longer on the market? One with a glass lid?Also, the instructions say that for cooking fewer than 8 eggs, more water may be necessary. But that's all. Cuisinart's egg cooker has a measuring beaker with exact marks showing how much water is necessary for how many eggs, and for what consistency: Hard, Medium, or Soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Design Flaw","review":"Bought this unit in 11/07 because of the great reviews. Worked just perfectly, then in 1/08 came back after the eggs had cooked and found the plastic top had melted into the cooker. Had to get a screw driver to get the ruined eggs out.

I wanted to try a new brand and it is a mistake. This egg cooker has no plastic handle edges so you have to use a tong to remove eggs and dirty another bowl to rinse them. Then in order to cook less eggs you have to guess the amount of water to decrease by. The West Bend egg cooker had a nice cup to measure the amount to match the number of eggs you want to cook. Also because the bottom is not flat in this model (which it IS in the West Bend), to clean the yellow residue out, you have to wipe in the grooves at the bottom, which is best to do while hot to get it out. PAIN!!! I returned both that were holiday gifts and am ordering West Bend models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for awhile and then POOF!","review":"I loved this cooker.

Yeah we used to get eggs free here at the office now they charge us. Anyway, we (the other ladies here in the office and I) decided on this brand because of the name and the other reviews we saw here.So far we have used it every day for a week, once a day in the morning and it has cooked our eggs PERFECTLY. We have only done hard boiled eggs, not pouched or soft eggs. It sits on my desk and I watch when the light goes off and it clicks. I don't need any more bells and whistles to alert me.One thing to be careful about is not to puncture the eggs twice...else it will leaks some yoke but still the eggs came out perfect the yoke thing was a first time trial mistake.

I suspect that the thermostat got stuck in the \\"on\\" position. It didn't receive a lot of use, perhaps twice a month.We seldom used the poacher because of the elsewhere mentioned sticking problem. However, cooking in the shell worked very well.As with everything else, judging by recent reviews they have cheapened it up despite it being about the most costly cooker on Amazon.My principal issue with it was that the unit couldn't be submerged. This may also be true for all cookers; I haven't checked yet.In any event, we need to buy a new one and am unsure about which model to replace it with.

Loved the way it cooked eggs but it was very difficult to clean. The poaching tray was terrible as it was impossible to clean. Supposedly it is teflon but it is not. I don't know what it is, I just know it's not teflon and egg sticks horribly even with butter. The inside aluminum tray for boiled eggs is difficult to clean and the paint or coating on the base unit started flaking off into the eggs. I used it frequently for about 3 years and threw away the poaching tray. The only way to actually clean it is to put straight vinegar in the base and let it run a cooking cycle. But then your house stinks of vinegar.Bottom line - great design, very poor materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"It melted!","review":"Worked fine for 4 months ...then it MELTED!! The top is stuck on.

The Oster also cooks soft boiled and poached eggs but unfortunately never got around to trying other eggs as the unit malfunctioned and melted the cover after only 6 months! I followed the directions to the T and the automatic shut off should have averted any overheating. My entire house stunk with the smell of melted plastic.

You are an excellent writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liar's Game","review":"A strong adrenaline rush! Eric Jerome Dickey has mastered the art of manipulating words. This fast paced novel captivates you immediately. The characters and dialogue paint a realistic picture of the type of dysfunction that results when deception, fear, and dysfunction are brought to the table at the beginning of relationship. While the characters all appear to be selfish and insecure in one or another. The plot is believable in that it touches the core of the chaos and drama that almost always results in relationships when unresolved pain and personal insecurities are present. A dynamic read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relationships are a trip","review":"Mr.Dickey is one of my favorite authors. If you read one of his books then you must read them all. All are page turners.

Yuck. Waste of ink focusing on her and her boring marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Over.......","review":"As a loyal \\"Friends and Lovers\\" fan, Liar's Game was a big disappointment. None of the character possessed the charm or complexity I have become accustomed to in previous EJD novels. Dana was a poor example of a woman, a true \\"bag lady\\" with emotional issues, financial debt and open scars from a previous relationship. She overreacted, and overanalyzed everything Vince said or did to her, but didn't seemed alarmed by her best friend's dangerous night job or poor taste in men. Vince was meek and vulnerable, and allowed Dana to trample all over his heart and then attempt to give him advice on how to repair his relationship with his daughter- with disastrous results. Harmonica was the only decent character, and for all his efforts to share his wisdom it feel on deaf ears.I have always appreciated the interweaving plots in Dickey's books, but this particular story line had too much drama, and not enough depth for a real connection with the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better!!","review":"After reading all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books, this one disappointed me the most. Not only was it hard for me to concentrate on the book itself, but I could not feel any of the characters (especially not the lead female). The thing that really disappoints me is that when I try to recall specific parts in the book, I go blank. Nothing really stood out, except Miss Thang forwarding his calls to her pager, or the fact that she had to go to the bathroom to much. Even though this book was a disappointment to me, I will continue to buy others because I simply love his writing style and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOS... Same Ole Situations..","review":"This was not my favorite book and I could not finish it. In the beginning of the book, the character Vince sounded just like Tyrel of Friends & Lovers, Jordan in Milk in My Coffee, Stephan & Darnell in Cheaters. I can't distinguish one book from another. Eric Dickey may be a talented writer, however all of his books are \\"just alike\\" only characters with different names, but same quick-wit, fast talking, ghetto-fabulous personalities. His writing is Commerical Fiction at its best and that's why he's on the New Times Best Sellers list and I understand why. I'm not hateing on a brother, but I would like to read some stories from him that deal with characters who are more developed and have depth to their lives. I will keeping reading his works, hopefully I will be able to get through the next book without hearing the same voices and stories again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work....","review":"I am an avid reader of Eric Jerome Dickey's books and this is not his best work. When I first heard about this book I bought it on the release date and expected it to be a book full of serious drama based upon the title. Was I ever so \\"wrong\\". This book didn't live up to it's title at all. The lies that were told were very petty which lacked drama like someone getting caught cheating and having to deal with the reprecussions. I was not a good read at all, quite dull. The only good part in the book was the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD READ!!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Mr. Dickey's works. This one was not his best. I wanted to slap the mess out of Dana so many times it was not even funny. All of his other books had twist and turns that make you want to keep reading to see what happens next...This one made me want to keep reading so that I could get it over with. If you have never been a fan of his works or never read his works than this is not a good book to start with. Read his other one's first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, couldn't even finish","review":"I got to the middle of this book and was still waiting for something to happen. A book needs to jump of within the 1st 30 pages. Halfway through this book, I still didn't know where it was going. I'm all for suspense, but it seems like Dickey was still deciding what he wanted to do with these characters. I probably will not finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't realy think this was good.","review":"I thought this book was going to better than this. I am a teenager and this is more of a adult book so I didn't really enjoy this. The book was really realistic in the way people deal with situations and jealousy was a big thing in the book. Jerome Dickey may be a good author but it didn't show in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choosy Lovers.....NOT","review":"Eric Dickey took his readers on a road trip out of this world! I never could imagine how much I would enjoy this book! The characters were just like they lived next door. His twists and turns, and unexpected surprises will have your mouth open...catching flies, bees, lent or whatever is flying in the air....because you will be in pure shock. \\"Oh no she didn't\\" \\"He did what!\\" \\"I would have never thought!\\" are just a few coined phrases I promise you- you will say before the book is completed. Excellence-**********10 stars Mr. Dickey **********10 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Mr. Dickey has written another hit! I could not put the book down. You start to lose yourself in the story. You feel as if he is talking about your own relationship. He gets inside your head and makes you really think. Now I see why Eric is on the New York Times Best Seller list. Liars Game is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric is truly amazing!","review":"Eric has done it again! I picked up the book and could not put it down. I could relate to every aspect of the story, especially the area it was set in. I knew where everyone of those \\"spots\\" were. All the characters were developed, some more than others. I had a little problem with Dana, however, and I felt she did not deserve a man like Vince since she was so unfair and untruthful to him, even after he was truthful with her. God Bless you Eric, you are truly a prolific writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good","review":"I'm totally a Eric Jerome Dickey fan. When I hear he is coming out with a new book I rush and go get it. This book is really good. The characters are full of adventure. They seem real with the things they go through. You can relate with his stories. If there is a author that you don't have to worry about if the story is going to be good, then this is the one. Every book he has written has been good. Whoever reads this story will really enjoy it. Waiting on the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"it only gets two stars because i finished it...","review":"is it just me, or are ejd novels are starting to read alike? vince and dana could've been characters in any of his other books and he should come up with better plots. if i were a dad and my ex wouldn't let me see my child, she wouldn't get nada, but vincent sends his money to her like the poor schlep that he is... eric may be talented, but it seems to me, that maybe he is starting to run out of ideas...milk in my coffee will always be my favorite ejd book.but maybe we have seen the best of him?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!","review":"I've read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's previous books and this one disappointed me. The storyline was weak and I was left wondering about some of the characters (Claudio, Gerri). Everyone is entitled to make a mistake and this is one of them. I will continue to support this writer and I've even encouraged some friends to buy the book because they might enjoy it. I'm not one of the readers who was enthuiastic about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big, Fat Disappointment","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. Perhaps my first clue was the fact that this book could not hold my attention. I must have put it down and picked it back up a hundred times before it actually got interesting to me. Couple that with Dana's irritating personality traits and Vince's baby-mama-drama and you have the makings of a not-so-great book. I have always been a fan of EJD, and have read all of his other books, but Liar's Game was almost enough to make me change my mind. Better luck next time...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it, but it's not my EJD favorite!","review":"I am a really big fan of EJD's work. I have read each one of his works of art. While I enjoyed this book, I expected much more from Eric. This book kept me reading, but I was not particularly fond of the characters. Dana was my absolute least favorite. I expected Vince to be smarter or stronger. I suppose this is how real life is. I wonder what would have happened if Vince and Gerri hooked up? I still love his work and I can hardly wait for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Read","review":"This book was very hard to get into.I've read several of EJD books but Liar's game is by far the worse.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied with product","review":"I will not order from this seller again. The shipment took to longer and if you're ordering with this seller and the description says \\"Like New\\"...take it's as \\"Just Readable\\" even if that because it was dirty and in very bad condition! I'm very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liar's Game by Eric Jerome Dickey","review":"I began reading this book and I could not put it down! Eric Jerome Dickey allows you to become a part of each of his characters in the book. You feel you know each one and you feel exactly what they are experiencing. There were twists and turns to keep you guessing. I love his style of writing and highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggle to Finish!!","review":"Liar's Game was a struggle for me to finish. The author was repetitive on how Dana felt about Vince's relationship with ex-wife and daughter, as well as how Vince felt about them. Dana was a selfish soul, who did not want a man with children (bottom line). Personally, I feel that with the drama Vince and Dana went through, they both needed to close this chapter in their lives and go their separate ways. (Call it a TKO!!) However, I was not surprised by the outcome, typical EJD style. Not your best EJD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"If you like Dickey, you will like this book. It's a good book to read if you want to be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK IS THE BOMB!!!","review":"All I can say is that EJD is a GREAT AUTHOR. I started reading his books because one of my friends told me to read \\"Cheaters\\" (whewwwww, that's another story); but anyways, that was the first one I read, and ever since, I've been hooked...I'll tell you, once you read at least ONE of his books, you'll be HOOKED!! Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Waste of Time","review":"I had never read a book by Mr. Dickey. I must admit, i was dissapointed by his style as well his plot. I have never known a person or character with so many issues like Dana. Dickey continually dissapoints you with the lack of a plot and the lack of strong characters. Stay away unless you want to be bored out of your skull. I would rather watch grass grow on a golf course than read this book again!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I was a big fan of Eric Jerome Dickey and I have read all of his books, but is it just me or all of his books starting to sound alike? It seems like they are all out in L.A. and that there is always a man with his heart broken. He is a very good writer but I was not feeling this book. Reminded me of all of the other ones with that tierd, hurt, black man plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way you do the things you do!","review":"I liked this book tremendously! I have read all of EJD's books and even though CHEATERS is my all time favorite, I could not put this book down until I was finished. I didn't particularly like Dana but she is as real as real can get. Eric is the only male author that I have read that can capture a woman just as well if not better than another woman. His stories are real and make you feel like you are right there living and breathing his characters. I love the way his storyline envelopes you. All I can say is when does the next book come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What you do in the dark will soon come to light.","review":"This book takes you on a emotonal roller coaster. It has it's highs and lows. It's not the best dickey book I have read, though I did enjoy it towards the end. The characters are very realistic, especially the situation with Vincent, his ex-wife and child. I was happy that he still loved his child even though he was no longer married to the childs mother. A lot of men divorce the children also. I didn't care for Dana because she was very insecure and seem to take her jeolousy of Vincent love for his daughter out on a picture, the only memory he had. I thought this was very typical. I'm also glad he didn't leave me hanging with the situation with Naiomi and the one night stand. That goes to show \\"What you do in the dark will soon come to light\\", even if it's nine years later. Over-all I enjoyed the book and can't wait for the next one to be released. I am still Dickey's #1 fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first EJD book & Dana got on my nerves!","review":"I wanted Vince to buy her a final Big Mac and send her back East to the world she said she craved. Eventhough she pumped ip Vince with guts to demand to see his daughter, her selfishness nawwed at my nerves. On every other page, there was a similie, that also rankled my nerves. I will read another EJD, just because I am curious if they all do sound alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again....","review":"Once again EJD has written an excellent novel. Even though Cheaters is my favorite he came through for me. I couldn't put it down. A must read, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Comparison","review":"The male Terry \\"who\\"? This book should end any comparison to any other writer. Reading a book by Eric J. Dickey is like licking chocolate chip cookie dough out of a bowl. Liar's Game was better than good. There is no need for details about the story. If you have enjoyed at least one of Dickey's books, you will definitely LOVE this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"I felt compelled to write after just finishing Mr. Dickeys book. I have now read all of them and I can tell you this one is just plain awful. What was up with the licking of the gum? Why did we need to know this? He seemed stressed for ideas and good story line in this book. It seemed he just threw in some weird stuff like the gum licking and the female lead always having to pee for lack of any real substance to write about. We are sooooo tired of wacked out female characters. I would not recommend this book especially if you really liked his other stuff. You will be highly disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lies, Lies and more Lies","review":"One lie lead to another lie and so on and on. Just tell the truth from just start.EJD is one of my favorite authors. I've been with him from the beginning and still holding on strong. I enjoyed reading this DRAMA filled novel. From reading some of the reviews it appears that some readers didn't care a great deal for Dana. I liked her. Yes, she made some stupid mistakes but who hasn't?As always, I enjoyed the unique writing style of this great author. All the characters were exciting. If you haven't read this novel yet, you are missing a treat. Be Blessed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this book was pretty good reading","review":"I thought Dana was a bit weird when it came to Vince's daughter because lots of men have children that don't take care of them, and he was one to stand up and take care of business, but she had a problem with him doing anything for his daughter. This book was not as good as 'sister, sister', but it was good reading. Thanks Eric for the books that just keep ending up in my hands. Love ya boo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liar's Game Review","review":"Liar's Game was the first Eric Dickey book I had read. I was captivated by the characters. The characters were so lively that you felt as if you knew them or someone like them. I read this book in three days. I was really captured in the stories. It is a great book. I feel it is definitely is worth your time. It will only take a few days; however, the characters will remain with you so when you read his other books you'll remember them. Also try Cheaters. I'm in pursuit to read the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY INTERESTING...","review":"Eric has done it again!!! I definitely mean AGAIN!!! After a long anticipated wait for his new arrival...I completed the book in no time. The characters, Dana and Vincent are similar to the previous entries; however, one must say, as always an excellent read. Eric has a way of being that \\"fly on the wall\\" in all of our relationships, which makes for a good read ANYTIME!!!To new readers of EJD: YOU'LL DEFINITELY ENJOY THIS ONE!!! To the OLD TIMERS: STILL ANTICIPATING THE NEXT ENTRY FROM EJD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The man has truely done it again!","review":"Well once again I can truely say that Eric has outdone hisself this time. Liar's Game is a must read on anyone's to read list. This book makes you laugh, makes you cry, love and hate all in one. But it also let's you feel the characters growing becoming people that we all now. I don't think i well be able to stand the wait until next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting;Juicy","review":"This book is very juicy and helps you relate to alot of things you do in life and that is what makes it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read...","review":"eric delivers again, i am just a fan and anything mr. dickey writes i am with it. very consistant also. get it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment!","review":"I was once a huge fan of Mr. Dickey. In my opinion, his early writing definitely raised the bar in the genre of African American fiction. I don't understand what happened. Since Milk in My Coffee, his work has sunken to the level of the writers he once wrote circles around. Liar's Game is a prime example. The plot is weak, the characters weaker and the writing is sophomoric at best. Lia's Game fluctuates between being overwritten and underwritten, leaving the reader feeling both frustrated and disappointed. On several occasions I found myself asking \\"Who would say this???\\" I don't know if Mr. Dickey is feeling pressure from his publishers to crank out more stories but it definitely feels that way. I wish he would slow down and write more of the great fiction that made us love him in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"EJD is one of if not the most talented author I know. As soon as his books hit the stands - I'm there! (it's on my calendar months in advance).But I have to say that this book was not his best work. The story line was slow, neverending and boring. It was a very slow read. The only way I could finally finish it was to take with me on a 6 hour plane ride! EJD you are still the best - but this one was not your best.Disappointed in Queens, New York"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie, \\"that's for sure.

Virtually getting every 4th case free."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better WW2 movies","review":"Based on the real life Battle of Bastogne this film has plenty of action for everyone. Starring Van Johnson and ably assisted by James Whitmore, John Hodiak, Ricardo Montalban, George Murphy and Marshall Thompson this film takes a realistic and gritty look at the real horrors of war. Members of the real \\"Battered Bastards of Bastogne\\" who actual fought the battle round out the cast and add authenticity to the film. A good addition for any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably, the Best WWII Movie Ever Made","review":"Wellman and Pirosh deliver believable action and dialogue in this historical saga directly based on the events of the seige at Bastogne during the Ardennes Offensive of WWII. Casting is highly commendable with rich performances by Van Johnson, James Whitmore, John Hodiak, Ricardo Montalban, Leon Ames, Herbert Anderson, and many other up-and-coming stars like James Arness, Richard Jaeckel, and Marshal Thompson. Black and white lends itself to the stark contrasts of the bitter winter scenes. The gritty action is enhanced by the rich character-driven performances. This movie, no doubt, set the pace for the war pictures that followed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is an excellent war movie, with a good picture of what the Battle of the Bulge would have been like for regular soldiers. The characters are interesting and likeable, and the battle scenes are gripping. The end is heart- rending but uplifting, and there are many moving scenes along the way, including a good short speech by a chaplain. Even some of the \\"wise- cracking\\" phrases that the American soldiers use in the movie are documented as being frequently heard during the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I saw this movie in a theatre when it was released in 1949/50.It made a big impression on this 11 yr. old at the time and it still retains impact today.The insertion of Denise Darcel as a Frenchwoman was a mistake in my view but does not seriously take away from the movie.I recommend purchase if you are a WW2 movie fan,it is not some low production value knockoff that we all have probably seen and you should enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Army perspective","review":"This movie when it was released after the War, was the \\"Platoon\\" of it's time.

Hollywood had the responsibility to rebuild a positive sense in life, and war movies like this had the purpose of portraying war a nasty ugly thing were irony and American positive values could still dominate. Today we are used to realism and this movie clearly belongs to another time in history.The story itself is supposedly centered around the battle of Bastogne, but in reality the battle and its struggles are exposed with limited details. What is extensively depicted is the life of the American soldier at the front. This would make a movie interesting, but again this movie cooks the story with too much irony, positive values, and American idealism that in my opinion becomes boring and ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite movies except for van Johnson","review":"I only order movies I like, and these are all excelent movies that help me kill time in the winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great war film","review":"My father is a war movie buff, from pre war, during and after.

Unfortunately, I am getting too old towaste 85 minutes on junk, but despite an awful script, terrible effectsfor a futuristic sci-fi, and amateurish direction and performances, Ididn't hate it.

Trust me, my husband LOVES this movie, so I've seen it a lot, mainly because I made the mistake of buying it for him one Christmas. This is the type of flick that Joel/Mike and the bots love to hate on MST3K. It's like a particularly bad train wreck, or an episode of Beavis and Butthead -- it's so horrible, but you can't turn away from it. You have to watch it all the way through to its cheesy end. The storyline is absolutely awful, rendering any acting talent in the film quite useless. I was particularly upset to see Patricia Arquette in such a stinker; I usually enjoy her performance, no matter how bad the film. This was an exception.Do yourself a favor -- spend that hard-earned $ on something you'll enjoy, like \\"The Lost Boys.\\" Now that was Corey Haim in his prime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a film! Better than Star wars and it has Corey Haim in","review":"Well well what an amazing spectical of rubbish. Who wrote this film, probably Greg Hughes, and what a magpie he is.

Well he was big in the eighties and probably the greatest actor ever.Second its about a group of \\"roller boys\\" who dont seem to do much except skate around in jackets, which look like they were made by a blind chimp with no arms, (oh except they push drugs). Thirdly it has a fantastic plot involving a caravan filled with machines that mix stuff. This film is the best!!!!

I will admit that it is not the greatest film ever, but it is very entertaining. I mean, jeez, who wouldn't wanna put on a tan trenchcoat and rollerblade around swinging your arms in synchronization with the other rollerboys? You can feel Corey's angst when he rollerblades around after a hard day's work at the pizza shop. All in all, once you sit down to watch this film, you will not be able to get up and walk away from it. It will entertain you in a way you don't expect- and that's a good thing! BUY THIS FILM!

The toast heats unevenly, making one side browner than the other. Not so bad if you dont mind turning your toast half way through the process. The really bad part is the knobs to release the toast broke after less than a week - both sides! Now my knobs are merely there for decoration, as they certainly dont pop the toast up, my toast still is overcooked on one side and not at all on the other - no matter what setting it is at. Needless to say, I will soon be buying myself a new toaster, and likely not this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bagels don't fit :-(","review":"I bought this toaster about a year ago. It is good for toast and frozen waffles - and only good. The settings are not accurate and not consistant on both sides; put it on 2 for toast and 2 slices will be darker than the other 2... also, the front and back sides are not done evenly. Today, the right side quit popping up. Even on a low setting the side that won't pop up, it just keeps cooking until you smell it burning.

If you want to replace your accessory cover, I suggest getting one of the new Color Accessory covers from HPshopping.com, or the leather flip-top case (at leat it snaps shut)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleek, but inadequate","review":"Perhaps the only redeeming feature of this case is that it is superior to HP's \\"Executive Leather Case with Flip Top.\\" The Bi-Fold case has no closing mechanism, and when the stylus is stored, the case remains half open. The Flip Top case has a latch, but with the Jordana inside, it refused to stay shut. Neither of these cases protects very well from dust or accidental drops, or has room for business cards and the like, so I'm about ready to velcro my Jordana into my old organizer case -- at least that will zip shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice exterior, lousy interior","review":"Why would I want to stick velcto strips on my nice Jornada 548?

It was great, made my cocoa perfectly, the perfect temp, and nice and creamy. We just had our first cold morning and I was so excited I pulled it out and poured my milk and hot cocoa in it. It heated it, but the motor doesn't work any more. I have had this less than a year, and I haven't used it in months. I got maybe 2 months use out of it. I am now looking for something that will hopefully last."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Hot Chocolate Making Machine","review":"If you like hot chocolate at all, you NEED this machine. It makes making hot chocolate very easy. Simply add your milk (or water) and your hot chocolate mix and click the button. The Cocomotion will automatically stir the mix using it's magnetic, spinning stirrer, and will heat it up to the perfect temperature. About 10 minutes later, you'll have a nice, slightly frothy pitcher of hot chocolate.Sometimes, I will brew up a larger mix and keep the pitcher in the fridge. Then when I want some hot chocolate, I just plug the pitcher in again and let it do the work.The only tricky part is cleaning. The entire pitcher is in one piece, so this is not machine washable. You will need to carefully wash by hand with soapy water. Make sure you take the magnet out when you wash too, since some liquid gets trapped underneath."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got 3 lemons! Incredible when it worked. But hard to clean!","review":"The hot cocoa this makes is incredible. Its hard to wash. Soak the container or rinse as soon as possible after using. My first one lasted several months. The second one a few months and the third one less than a month. My friend bought one when I got my first one and it still works 3 yrs later and she uses it often. I am very particular about washing and handling it. I dont know what the problem was."},{"rating":"2","title":"We really love this","review":"We are big cocoa fans. Santa brought one this year. It makes great cocoa. Super easy to make. Not too hot. Easy for the kids to measure out and use on teir own.My only complaint is cleaning it. Since its all one piece, you can't submerge in water. The carafe never seems to get really clean, always seems like there are chocolatey spots somewhere. Also, you have to use a paper towel to grip the magnet to pull out. It's an odd thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"cocolicious","review":"This machine works really nice!

Imagine my \\"happy dance\\" when I was lucky enough to find one still sealed in the box 4 months later at a local yard sale for just $2.00.Well I guess I got my $2.00 out of it....it made a total of about 4 cups of hot chocolate before the ball bearings fell out of the little mixer attachment into my hot chocolate and across my kitchen floor to never be seen again.This is basically a blender with a heat setting...the hot chocolate wasn't frothy, just warm and well blended.I my case I can achieve the same results heating water in the microwave and mixing it with a spoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I was excited to receive the Cocomotion machine. This is how the first use can be described. I filled up the container with 2 cups of milk and within about 10 seconds I had 2 cups of milk in a puddle on my kitchen counter. My husband and I filled it over and over again (with water and over the sink) to see why it was leaking. It leaked around one of the screws on the bottom of the machine. Needless to say about 24 hours after receiving I had it packed up and ready to return to Amazon. I did call the Mr Coffee company service line and was told they no longer make the product. Hmmmm...... I would recommend to NOT buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little wonder..","review":"I have had this for one week and have used it every day! I have made powder mixes with water, powder mixes with milk, and from scratch with water, chocolate shavings, sugar and little milk and they have all turned out frothy and wonderful. When I am done, I put a drop of dish detergent with about 3 cups of water and let it run through the cycle and rinse well. Comes out nice and clean. My son and I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but the lid design is weird","review":"It's cheap and it works great. The lid is a bit weird because it only locks on when the spout is open, and you're supposed to turn it on with the spout closed - but the lid is unlocked and can pop off. I usually only have one or two cups mixing at the most so it hasn't been a problem for me, but I could see it being a problem if you're mixing a little over the max.So far, I haven't found a good chocolate to use other than the powdered variety. I tried a few different brands of dark chocolate and mint chocolates, breaking them into postage stamp sizes before tossing them in. They melt pretty good and mix evenly for the most part, but it's still too bitter to my taste. I'm going to try baking chocolate chips and hershey's kisses next, hopefully those work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I got the Cocomotion for Christmas 2011. We were able to use it only 3 times. The cocoa was delicious and it worked great when it worked but unfortunatley it didn't last long. I called Mr. Coffee and they said that they haven't made this product for 2 years!! If you buy this and it breaks down Mr. Coffee can't replace it because they no longer make hot cocoa machines. If you are thinking about buying this product I would think twice about getting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gift Ever!!!","review":"I received this as a gift about 5 years ago. It is well used and well loved. Everytime I use it to make hot chocolate for other people, I always get compliments. I use 2% milk and Swiss Miss mix with marshmallows (which dissolve during the mixing process, but add to the flavor)....one packet per cup of milk (cup notations are impressed into the maker). It comes out perfect....a little frothy and most important....the right temperature. I use it to make hot cocoa for a lot of kids, and I never have to worry about it burning their tounges on the first sip (which can ruin an entire cup of cocoa). I am looking for a second one, as it makes 4 mugs filled, but I find I am making larger quantities for youth groups and school functions....it takes about 4 minutes a batch, but no one wants to be the last in line!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective device twice","review":"When we first got the hot chocolate maker, we were delighted with it. The froth was fabulous, and it was so easy to use. However, after about 2 months, the little ball bearings inside the magnetic disc began to come out one by one. I called the 1-800 number listed in the manual, and the customer service representative was very helpful. We received another disc to replace the old one. We used the machine again for about 8 months when we had the same problem. As the machine was no longer in warranty, we continued to use the disc after all the ball bearings were out of it. The machine continued to work, and we didn't taste any difference in the hot chocolate. After a few weeks of using it without the ball bearings, we began to hear a terrible noise, so we discontinued using it. I was really disappointed. We did use the machine almost every day, so I don't know if we used it too much or not. The hot chocolate was wonderful; I just wish the machine would have held out longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise Salvation","review":"I'm sipping double dark Valrhona cocoa as I compose this.As with another reviewer, this was a kid purchase. And truly, it deserves 5 stars as a must-have for the household with kids. (I use the term \\"kids\\" loosely.) My teenage boys typically demolished the kitchen making their various cocoa concoctions, and invariably would either scorch it in the pan or worse.This machine is beauty in simplicity. You don't REALLY have to measure anything. Just dump in what looks good and hit the ON button. And clean up is DRAMATICALLY superior to saucepan cocoa, at least as wielded by teenagers.The cocoa blends and heats up beautifully. It froths, too but that is an ingredient issue, IMO. Additionally, the Cocomotion is darn useful for heating milk and cream for tempering, sauces and stuff. I have used it to froth milk for lattes, when I am feeling uncommonly lazy and unpicky. The boys and I will continue to experiment with this thing.I'm done opining -- back to the cocoa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for the price","review":"I got this item for a Christmas present a couple of years ago, and I love it! It heats up the hot chocolate quickly, though if you like your hot chocolate incredibly hot, you may have to run it longer - but it was definitely hot enough for me! I love how easy it is to use.However, there are a few down-sides to the product: the pitcher doesn't detach from the base, so sometimes cleaning it was harder, and you have to unplug the whole thing if you want to take the pitcher to pour drinks somewhere else. Also, the stirring part of the mixer is held in by magnets and after several times of removing it for cleaning, some of the metal balls around the stirrer started falling out (though I didn't notice a change in performance - I'm not sure what the use of those little balls were...)Overall, this is a great and easy product if you want to find something for those who don't like coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmmmmm","review":"Great product just wish it came apart for clean up simple to use kids love it not to hot not to cold perfect hot chocolate everytime"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I had one of these growing up (I'm thinking we got it in the late 90's) and it worked perfectly until when we last used it (2010) when it mysteriously disappeared.

I bought two of them at a 1/3rd the cost elsewhere. It warms milk up wonderfully for hot chocolate or for cappuccino, doesn't burn the milk, and easy to cleanThe MAJOR problem is the whipper disc at the bottom. It connects to the base via little round ball-shaped magnets inside the disc. After just a few months, you will notice (let's hope you do-otherwise you are swallowing them) that the magnets are escaping out of the bottom of the disc. I tried to think of some way to stop that from happening, but could not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really suprised how much I like this.","review":"I try to cut down on clutter and extraneous kitchen appliances, but I am totally in love with this product. It is just a hot chocolate maker, but you pour in the milk to the lines shown on the container for 1 - 4 cups of cocoa, add the powder or syrup and press the on button. It warms up the milk and mixes the chocolate to perfect drinking temperature, just pour from the pitcher into your mug and enjoy. Easy and safe for tweens to use and don't have to worry about them overheating the milk in the microwave or leaving a milk scummy pan from the stove. We wash it by adding water and a drop of dish soap and pressing the on button. So easy. Cost more than I would have liked so I hope it lasts for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is great!!","review":"I've owned the Cocomotion for 2 years now and it's worked without a hitch.

Then with a wet soapy dishcloth, wipe it clean (take out the magnet \\"mixer\\" and wash off...rinse and it's done. Takes about a minute to clean and dry. I always use milk and only a slight bit of water. The hot chocolate comes out rich and creamy and frothy every time. Delicious! If you use water only, you will not get the frothiness that milk gives. Another added pleasure, is especially with Christmas over but tons of peppermint and candy canes around, drop a piece of the candy cane in while mixing. It is a variation of the mint chocolate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Can Be Quite Deceiving","review":"This was probably the third or fourth book related to James Dean that I read. When I first read it, the book seemed like a breath of fresh air as compared with some far-from-complimentary biographies I had read on Dean. The first thing that attracted me about this book was the air of mystery about it and the question it clearly places in the reader's mind: is this person James Dean's daughter. After learning the real answer, which is \\"no\\"--and it took me almost a year to get a definite answer--there really isn't much left of the book. This is a collection of poetry--but as a poetry collection, it reminds me of the kind of poetry a school girl would right regarding her first love. In other words, the poetry is all form and consists of very little substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth be Told","review":"I had a hard time finding this book. It is a fierce \\"gem\\". Very few give such poetic service and honor to an actor whose stature belonged to \\"Jimmy\\" alone.

I have to stop and stir and blend again. I wonder how long this motor will last as it strain to the verge of overheating.I thought that $300 for a high quality blender was too much. I thought that if this one wore out and broke after a year, I would just buy another. That was a good theory provided that the blender could easily make a smoothie.

The purchase of this blender, however, is an exception. The blender is plastic and not glass. Originally I thought that it did not matter, but the plastic quickly gets hazy. And by quickly I mean after using it twice. The blender does not lock onto the base, but rather sits there which is quite annoying. I also have a little bit of problem with leakage from the bottom which could be entirely my fault.As a blender, it functions well. But if I could go back in time and buy a slightly pricier blender, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oster 6640 Blender","review":"I had the same model for 20 years. Just last month it started to leak oil and wasn't chopping or mixing as well as it should. After 20 years it needed a rest so I went looking for a similar blender. I was pleased to find the same model is still being made, however now it is much lighter and easier to use. The jar is plastic now, the older one was a very heavy glass. I do prefer glass. This works very well. My only complaint is that when I use the chop, grind, whip and grate modes the darn thing moves and the lid pops up. I have to hold it down and still. Annoying, but not too bothersome considering how well it works for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandbags couldn't stop this leak","review":"Let me start off by saying that I placed the rubber ring in the correct position. First two blends for smoothies - leakage. I thought, well, maybe it can't handle juice and frozen fruit for some reason. So I tested it with just WATER. Leakage. Unbelievable.So on my third blend, I placed frozen fruit in by itself, and alternated between low and high Grate / Easy Clean. I basically babied the friggin' blender. I only went to Pulse a few short times. I then slowly poured the juice in a little bit at a time while I used a wooden stick to stir. Bottom line: No leakage, but it took way too much time and effort to keep it from leaking.Not a \\"Good Buy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I am on my second Oster. It actually does a very decent job, except that it is next to impossible to use for any task more demanding than whipping a single milkshake. The first one I bought burned out after a month of use and was replaced. I am more careful with this one meaning I don't run it for more than 10 seconds, and stop the moment it starts smelling like burnt plastic, which arrives exactly then, at 10 seconds. The bottom plastic piece has cracked and is held together by epoxy.

Woody Strode and Jeffrey Hunter give great performances! I have always felt that Hunter was one of the best and most underrated actors around.His Cantrell has just the right edge of doubt and underlying racial predjudice as he undertakes Rutledge's defense.

This pair was made in Mexico and after looking for an hour in the store comparing, I decided to try them out. Then the toe box whee it ends closes to your ankle started hurting (knifing) the tops of my toes on both left and right.

It is packed with everything from insites on the ancient religions, traps, escapes, love, Sargon's military genius, the wrath of the gods, and great desert battles and truimphs. Even more importantly, it lets you in on the feelings and emotions of the characters so that you begin to truly KNOW them, and become involved in the events surrounding them.This book is a must-read, and a must-have for anyone interested in Sargon's earlier days, ancient Mesopotamian history, or just wants a good novel to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Civil War: The Nashville Sessions (1998 Studio Cast)","review":"If you've never listened to country music, this is a great way to introduce yourself to the genre.

I don't understand why they call this Nashville Session, a \\"supposedly\\" country music concept album of Civil War, yet they have Linda Eder and some singers, who were not a country music singer. This album is just a cheesy water down version of another Concept Album of Civil War (2-dics)\\"The Complete Music of Civil War\\". Definitely Frank Wildhorn is unreputable the king of concept album.

The songs are heartfelt and captivating...you develop a sense for each of the characters and how each of their lives are affected by the war. This album lives up to and surpasses Jekyl & Hyde and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Linda Eder is wonderful and to quote the marquis in New York, \\"...everything her voice touches turns to gold.\\" Each of the country artists on the album adds his/her own touch to the songs, reminding you of the devastating war.

Just use balancing principals, offset one side heavy pan opposite side heavy pan etc. Very easy. I had to buy extra chain to come down from my high ceiling and had a professional hang it for me so I have no worries of it coming down. He measured it so it would be within my reach. What a joy, and easy to get pots off and put them back on. The hooks hold well, which was another concern of mine. In no way is it an eye sore even with ugly beat up pans.A purchase well spent.

The illustrations are beautiful, and have an antique feel to them.

Equal value for the arts!Although this book is very old (1939), and it's about secular Easter celebration (Easter eggs and bunnies), I wholeheartedly recommend it to EVERYONE and ANYONE to read to their children. This lady bunny is not only a single mother, but she is considered pretty, fast, kind, and wise enough to receive a coveted position in a male-dominated career path!

It's too much work and waste money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money","review":"You're supposed to fill, seal, take out air and store Space Bag. I think most of us had success with that. The problem lays with keeping the bags flat. Perhaps plastic bags cannot possibly keep air out forever. I haven't read a review confirming it works for very long.

Yesterday, in a fit of spring cleaning, I spent $40 on the deluxe pack, thinking maybe they'd improved since. NOPE. Bags rip immediately, or re-inflate after only an hour or two, so you're left with nothing more than very expensive garbage bags. It doesn't matter what you put in them, how much, or what \\"method\\" you use. THEY DO NOT WORK.Seriously, don't waste your money thinking you'll have better luck. You won't.

So I took out 1 pillow and tried again, and the bag was nowhere near being full. It seemed to work all right, but the next morning the pillow had re-inflated! And if you buy the bags with the zippers, the zippers come off easily, they make sealing more difficult, and one even tore a hole in the bag. I purchased straight from AsSeenOnTV.com, but their return policy looks a little weird. I'm not sure if I'll get a refund. Also be careful if you order straight from AsSeenOnTV.com -- I upgraded to express shipping and got my package 12 days later!

This is the biggest rip off I have ever seen. I have called customer service for help but I can never get through because of the \\"high call volume.\\" I sat on hold for 1 hour and never spoke to a live person.

After reading some of the reviews that stated flaws about this product I wasn't going to puchase it. However on the advice of a friend who had tried them I bought them anyway.The bags were easy to fill, but the zipper closure wasn't very secure. I had to secure it by hand since the \\"Sure Zip Slider\\" didn't. The plastic is quite thin, but bags deflated nicely with the use of my vacuum cleaner. Overnight, the bags inflated on their own. I was disappointed, but decided to keep the bags for storage anyway.

However, when I tried using them, they didn't work at all! It was so difficult to get the zipper to completely seal the bags, and even after I managed to get the zipper closed all the way, a lot of air still remained in the bag after vacuuming. If I moved the bags even a little, the zipper would become loose and open again. It was so frustrating, I ended up returning this product. My advice to you: don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Slightest Thing Punches a Tiny Hole in Them","review":"If you have cats, and we do, you have to be able to store the bag INSIDE a closet that the cat will NEVER get into, or they are useless. If a cat even jumps on them ONCE, you are done for. If I had room in the closets to put all this stuff, I wouldn\`t need the space bags. Store under the bed? No way. Cats can and do go under the bed. I even had one stored in a closet where it was doing OK, and opened the closet briefly and the curious cat pounced inside, and -- boom --- there goes the space bag. These would be a fabulous idea if they were a little more sturdy and dependable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bags definitely leak","review":"I purchased an x-large bags and three large bags at Target. I put one of my Mother's bedspreads in the x-large bag, sealed it up and vacuumed the air out. Within an hour it had leaked enough to tell that there was a leak. The bag was not filled up past the fill line. The people on this page who say these bags do not leak must have a vested interest in the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky bags defeat the whole purpose","review":"These bags leak so easily which defeats the who purpose! On one, the zipper got caught on the bag itself and ripped it, so it no longer worked. The second bag, my cat knocked off the bed and the plastic ripped, creating a hole. Very expensive for what you get. I loved the concept, and I could not believe my 4 pillows and a mattress pad cover compressed down to about 1 foot tall, but good luck!

When I went to lift one up, my finger went right through the bag. I am a small woman in my mid-50's and have very weak hands and wrists. On two of the bags, when I tried to zip them closed; the zipper broke through the plastic. I have never been so disappointed with a product that brags to be so great and the price for them is outrageous. My advice is DO NOT BUY!!!!

Nope. They hold the air just long enough for you to stick the bags in your closet and think you have room enough for more things, then the air leaks out and you're stuck with an OVER-stuffed closet that you can't even close the door on!

They seemed okay at first although they were hard to zip even though they were not filled completely. They stayed airtight for about 3 days then i noticed that most of the bags i had stored had leaked. Very disappointing as i was excited at how much storage space they saved. Large ziplock bags rolled so all the air comes out then sealed would probably work as well and cost alot less. Trying to zip these things is a nightmare as the slider keeps coming off and even when you think you have it sealed it isn't.

Then, you never will hear back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying this","review":"Just from personal experience. Don't buy this stuff, it does not work well at all:-1. Does not compress more than 10%. If you only have gigantic sweaters and pillows, maybe more, but for the most part, it will be 10% MAX. For example, the totes don't shrink enough to close! Totally defeats the original intention.2. Very flimsy material. One mistake and it is torn. For all the care you may take, if you rub it against the wall, it pops a hole. Even Walmart plastic bags are more resilient!If you ONLY want to have airtight bags (you don't care about the space savings and treat the bags like a one day old infant) then probably it may make you happy. Otherwise a big big big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space Bag is right...it takes up space","review":"I bought quite a few various sizes at Target and followed the instructions. The zipper was broken on one and had to be manually 'ziplocked'. I'm pretty sure the corner on that one leaked. There were holes in two of them that I had to tape.

I'm using it to shoot dragonflies, other small animals, and birds. Unlike his sister, the 28-135 IS USM AF, it lacks the possibility of doing full autofocus manually when AF is set. This means that whenever we didn't manage to get focus automatically we must shift the operation from AF to MF. In the 28-135 IS USM AF we can make fine adjustments in the focus manually wihthout changing to MF. Otherwise this is a good lens. The USM motor function very well and the IS (image stabilizer) works proper and silently. To obviate its small aperture we can change the digital camera ISO to a high one, ex: 200 or higher. Bigger the shoot speed (above or equal to the focal length) better the photo, this a thumb rule in photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get a sharp photo","review":"This lens was a hand-me-down so please keep that in mind when reading this review.

I've tried it with and without the image stabilization feature, with and without a tripod, several ISO modes, several F stops and shutter speeds... nothing. I thought throwing it on a tripod, turning the IS feature off, and also having a 2 second delay would surely do the trick but to no avail, I zoom in on my photo and it's still slightly blurry.The photos look pretty good when you're not viewing at 100% but that's not very ideal. So, I'm glad I didn't pay money for this. Again, it could be that the lens has just been used too much, but I'd recommend spending some extra bucks on a higher quality lens. If you're looking to zoom in on your subject, I'm assuming that you want it to be sharp and this lens just isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the 70-200 f/4L instead!","review":"At 300mm this lens is VERY soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus. To do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the ISO to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. Of course, the high ISO then introduces other artifacts. The focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on. This is a lens that I have constantly fought with. Don't upgrade to the newer 70-300 IS either, as it's only marginally better.Buy the 70-200 f/4L. It's a far superior lens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seller","review":"I bought a lens for my SLR camera and it arrived very quickly.

I am so impressed with the looks of it! It is a great pan with many uses, love the quality, and it is a great for everyday uses.

Great prices on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely useful","review":"This is my go to pan for boiling pasta water and making soups and sauces...it's not too big to handle, the narrower bottom lets me put it on a smaller burner, and it heats up very quickly.

Not at all recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Customer Service","review":"We have a 4 qt. saucepan of a similar description. The inside bottom of the pan is pitted and chalky. Calphalon has not responded to our request for explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"You NEED this pan!","review":"This little beauty is the tenth Calphalon pan I've bought this year, I love them all. This one is perfect for sauces, vegetables, anything you can fit in it. It's a decent size, and the sloping sides make stirring easy. I have straight sided Calphalon too, but this can be used differently. I like the hard anodized finish, great for mashing vegetables like potatoes, squash, and kohl rabi (does anyone really eat that stuff?). I've thrown all the old pots and pans out in the garage for the next yard sale, only keeping the Calphalon and All-clad. Cleans up with a swish of the dobie or a little soaking. Used the Calphalon cleaner on it and it REALLY works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping up the Calphalon tradition!","review":"I have become such a fan on Calphalon cookware that I pre-ordered this pan even before it became available! After using it a few times I can testify that it is of the same great quality as all my other Calphalon products. The design and shape of the pan is perfect for reducing or boiling liquids. Another feature I love about this pan is its size. At 3.5 quarts, this pan is quite roomy enough to make enough portions to easily feed four or more people, whether that entails simmering a respectable amount of sauce, blanching a large amount of fresh green beans, or preparing my favorite... glazed baby carrots! For everyone who loves or needs to cook, I highly recommend this product for its high quality and fair price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pan!","review":"Such a beautiful shape. Okay, I know that's not the main issue, but still. I got this pan as a gift off of my wishlist and love it! I wrote this review to say that mine was made in Ohio, not China. It is the same quality as the Calphalon I've purchased from Macy's, etc. I know some people worry about things sticking to a hard-anodized surface but I haven't had that problem. Be sure to cook with medium-low heat, your food will get cooked and the pan will be the better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a great text","review":"This is a great entry-level jump into instructional design.

The neighborhood maps with walking trails was really helpful so that i didnt miss a thing. plus they sort of took you off the beaten trail a little too. the only not-so-great thing about the book was that the street maps were a little hard to understand because they are on different pages and some streets are missing (small side streets) so i bought a real street map.... other than that, i plan to use eyewitness books for all my future traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy and and not economical","review":"Get the Rick Steves' books for Paris and France. The Eyewitness books are pretty. They have shiny paper and color pictures. But they are heavy to lug around, especially if you are on foot (which is the best way to see Paris!). And the recommendations for hotel and accommodations are not for the budget minded, in my opion. A much better travel book is the Rick Steves' Paris 2000. Included in this book are walking tours of the neighborhoods and major museums. In those he gives background and history that you might find from a personal tour guide. Steves also makes recommendations for hotels that are very nice, clean and safe and reasonably priced (with excellent restaurants). I bought the Eyewitness book and left it in a hotel room in Paris because I was so sick of lugging it around and it added nothing to my trip that I didn't get from the Rick Steves book. Have I said enough? Skip Eyewitness unless you have a big budget and like to carry heavy books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel guide","review":"One of the best travel books.

We even brought one for New York to help us learn more about our town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful info but almost impossible to use","review":"The book is a cute, appealing size. It lists many good bars, places to eat etc. But it has a major flaw: No matter how hard I searched through the book, I didn't see any mention of arrondissements, which are the various numbered neighborhoods.Everyone in Paris and every map uses these numbers to direct you. \\"It's in the 14th.\\" for example. Well, with this book I had to constantly reference other maps then locate the street and see which arrondissement the place was located in. I'm not just venting. I was really disappointed I had depended on this book as my only resource.Additionally, because it combines neighborhoods - I assume to save space so it can maintain a petite, portable size - that is confusing as well and also prevented me from being able to map the named neighborhood to the arrondissement.My recommendation? Bring this book only if you can bring another. It's really not worth the price considering the hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyewitness Guide to Paris: A+++","review":"I just got back from Paris, and this was the BEST travel book I'd seen.

If you already know that in Paris you will eat croissants, see Notre Dame, and use French Francs, much of this guide will be useless to you.

Other reviewers have also commented on the amount of space that this takes on the stovetop, but that hasn't really been too bad for me (I cook with other large pans routinely so perhaps I'm used to it).

At this price, you can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, lightweight Calphalon","review":"This was actually a gift for my Mom. She uses it regularly for various soups and stews. Easy to clean and easy to handle. Doubles nicely as a ligt-duty dutch oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"I got this pan when the price was about half of what it is now. Knowing what I know now, I'd still get it a the current price. The pan came very quickly, and the quality is better than I had hoped or expected. I use this pan every time I have to cook for more than two people. (I often cook more, then use the leftovers for lunches the next day.) Great pan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth 50","review":"I was looking for a large dutch oven (and could not bring myself to buy a La Crueset for 265$)so I settled for this pan. I love this pan because of it's size...most things no longer have to be cooked \\"in batches\\". The reason I gave this pan a 4 is because things stick to it. I think at retail price this pan would be overpriced but at amazon price....it's a great deal for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply cannot beat!","review":"If you have room for this relatively wide pot, GET IT! It's deep enough for cooking soup, fry chicken, stir fry Chinese, or cook jambalaya. Being hard anodized, it's good for reducing, blackening, or if you just want some bronze. At the price, it cannot be beaten. Calphalon Commercial stuff lasts forever too. I do have to agree with another reviewer that the quality of Calphalon Commercial seemed to have dropped since they switched to be manufacturered in China. The quality of aluminum of this pot is about the same as my other Calphalon Professional pots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calphalon you can never go wrong with this saucier","review":"I love it i have been able to use it for chilli and soups the pot is big enough i am very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"To bad you missed the sale","review":"I found this on sale for $19.89, what a steal. Even though you missed that it is well worth the $40 it is now going for. I've had it for 2 weeks and used it twice. Last week I made chicken & dumplings. This is the perfect pan for that as it has a huge surface area which means you can plop in lots of dumpling dough. In fact almost too much dough. I'm making a pot roast in it tomorrow and I think it is gonna work great. Great pan!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love Calphalon","review":"I love Calphalon but can rarely afford it, so when I see it on sale, I buy it. This pot is wide enough to hold several full ears of corn but not so tall that you waste lots of water cooking it. It will be perfect for soups and chili, and for cooking for a group."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Pan!!!","review":"I love Calphalon anyway, but this is my favorite pan! I make big batches of chili, fried rice, sausage and peppers, etc. for 20 to 50 people on a regular basis, and this pan is the perfect size. Browning up 10+ lbs of ground meat is a snap... the pan is both wide and deep enough to toss your food around without getting it all over the stove, and clean-up is easy, as the anodized aluminum is quite non-stick, as long as you heat the pan before adding a small amount of oil, heating a few seconds more, then adding your food. If you cook a lot like me, you're gonna love this pan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Pan","review":"As I have said in other reviews about Calphalon, I love this cookware, but this pan has a funny shape. It's wide and shallow. I used it for cooking soups and greens.

I even made sure that I waited for the pot to cool off before I washed it or soaked it in cold water. I was careful, but it still warped. So, I was really disappointed at this. Once the bottom has warped, you can't really flatten it.

I decided to go ahead with the order because of the \`great deal'.But after using the saucier 4-5 times in the past week, i am regretting buying it. The food sticks to the bottom as much as for any other ordinary vessel. Therefore now i don't feel like using it now since cleaning is a pain. When i made a stew with milk today, the milk burnt at the bottom, even though i took the precaution of stirring regularly on medium fire.I wish i hadn't bought this item"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookware","review":"I have yet to be dissappointed with anything I've purchased from this company yet.

The story hooks you immediately, and keeps you turning pages until late in the night. Like any Vigilante, your heart immediately goes out to Marcus, and you cheer him on.

I also liked the metal housing, so I bought it. First issue was a leaking jar, received a new one from oster and it leaked too. Bought the glass jar, it worked good until all the plastic tabs on the bottom broke off and the unit thought that the jar was not on top of the blender. Then after a year the cog broke while making ice cream shakes. I have thrown it in the trash and will buy a cheap blender next time.

His Experimental Audio Research moniker was an excuse to dabble in ambient experiments. Kember has pretty much thrown away his song based leanings and dove headfirst into ambient/drone work. Which is a good thing, especially when you make an album like this. The tracks don't vary much in sound or structure, but there is a soothing edginess present here that makes this album more than background noise. Only track three lags behind; it is similar to earlier Sonic Boom solo material but doesn't fit with the rest of these songs. All the other songs are superb for headphone listening late at night, on rainy days, or during space travel. This is probably what it sounds like when you travel down the tunnel to the white light to stand before the pearly gates."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sounds of outer space brought down to earth","review":"The Koner Experiment is a mystery to me. I guess it has to do with using the same basic textures with different minimalist phrases on top. And if it sounds like it wouldn't translate very well to an album, give this one a whirl. The songs may sound the same on initial listens, but repeated spins show something deeper and more intricate. Sonic Boom knows what he's doing. Most closed-minded people will tell you \\"synthetic\\" music can't evoke or express the same emotion as instrument based music. They are wrong. Playing this album allows me to slip inside of myself and find things that have been lost since birth. This music is a distant cousin to Sonic's compositions on late era Spacemen 3 albums, but nonetheless a logical progression of those sounds. A must have for those who know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Guitarist","review":"A spectacular blues guitarist from Edmonton, Alberta.

Thanks, this is the only food product I've ever given 5 stars to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"First of all, remember that they are what they are: sugar-free candies. Sugar substitutes generally create laxative effects, depending on the person, that can range from mild gassiness to, well, let's not get into that. I think more than one piece is safe--at least 3 or 4 in most cases--but it depends on you. And that's not the fault of the candy, it's the territory in general--most, if not all such candies have that effect.That said, this is one of my favorite diabetic-friendly candies. They taste very much like the sugary ones I ate as a child. Everyone will have their favorite flavors, but the selection they have is bound to be most satisfying; the flavors are good, the taste well-crafted.The one drawback I found: if left too long, they will start to congeal or melt in the wrappers. One time I ordered them and it took a month or two for this to start happening; another time I ordered them, they were already starting to go.All told, it's a product I will be buying often over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I was not able to eat all of these little fruit gems. Unfortunately science has not yet come up with a good substitute for real sugar in the baking or other heated process.

The slices are a good effort but just eat a real one if you need a taste of something sweet and adjust your meal intake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"These looked so good, but the sugar free product is very laxative, so eating more than one can be a mistake.

It is a definite departure from classical Saga like Worlds Apart and Silent Knight. For better or worse, Generation 13 is an attempt at rock opera. I found this CD very upsetting as its' theme revolves around a disfunctional relationship between father and son. While listening to the tracks, you start to wonder which band members' childhood was so terrible that it needed to be rehashed in his work. If you're a father (like me), or an unfortunate victim of an abusive father, the content of this CD will probably not be agreeable.

The 3 quart set is hard to find, I only see the 2 quart set in the stores. Thank heavens for Amazon.com that carries both sets and replacement pitchers as well. When my family and friends come to my home, they ask if I have any tea made. Usually I do, being a Southerner, but if I don't they are always dissappointed. I also use about a cup of splenda per pitcher and keep 2 pitchers as one basket of tea (1/2 to 3/4 cup of tea) will make 2 pitchers of tea. I have a poster I made up to give to my friends and family that I call Aunt Beckie's Tea Instructions. That is how much we all use and enjoy this product.

I have read that the change in temperature from hot to cold is what causes a lot of problems but do not understand why the pitchers cannot be made with this in mind. They are also expensive to replace. A few more dollars and you could get an entire new unit. However, the newer ones are shorter and do not hold as much. I like the size and content of the TP3.

They are investigating the death of Roger Cresswell, a wealthy young man whose family has made a fortune building boats. The members of Roger's family are, for the most part, incredibly dysfunctional and vicious people. They are a modern version of the Borgias, with their dark secrets and conniving ways.

Agatha Christie could write a book with a good, tight plot that could keep you guessing to the very end without being 400+ pages long. I'm all for a good read, but I don't have to have the life's story of each character and know every passing mood or thought. This, to me, was character development at its most mind-numbingly boring pace. And I don't like Lynley.

I suppose this book might appeal to the minds that dwell on S & M. However this subject can sustain interest for only a hundred pages or so. There is more depth in any copy of People Magazine than in this entire book.If this review supported a -10 rating that is what I would give it.I read this book only because I was traped and this was the only book available.

However I'm not a great believer in entertaining novels like this being the place for an author to hugely demonstrate ones superior grasp of vocabulary.Maybe the words used are common in Jolly Olde England but a more International approach to vocabulary would make this a less grating experience.That said, it was still good enough for me to try one more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a pleasure","review":"Elizabeth George knows how to captivate an audience.

By the time I got about halfway through, however, it became exceeding drawn out and boring. The author could have easily cut the novel by about 200 pages and still had an enjoyable mystery. There were too many minor characters that the detectives were always visiting. By the end of the book I didn't even care who did it, I just wanted the thing to be over!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So unneccesarily complicated! My head is spinning...","review":"I am a big Elizabeth George fan, but this was just to convuluted a plot with characters I couldn't care less about. So much suffering and angst and so many loose ends. And WHY is George so down on Havers? Too many characters, too contrived a plot, nasty overtones and undercurrents. Yuck.... I'm hoping the next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Genius is nothing but continued attention.\\"","review":"(quoted: Claude A. Helvetius) Elizabeth George shows her genius in this book. If you are an EG fan, or a mystery fan, be forewarned - you may lose sleep, ignore your personal wellbeing and that of your family once you start this book. It begins with Lynley and Havers completely at odds with each other and takes you on a 594 page rollercoaster ride which includes two murders, two suicides, a spin through S&M-land, and more. I was right on the edge of my seat to almost the last page. An incredible story. I can't wait for her next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, shoot, I liked it!","review":"My my MY our reviewers are getting so TERRIBLY upset at the whole Havers/Lynley thing! I find it very entertaining that George can find yet another way to get those two to lock horns while still working together (though separately). George's prose continues to educate me with new vocabulary words -- now honestly, who has had to reach for the dictionary to learn a new word since high school English class? I find her stories, her style and her characters to be thoroughly enjoyable, and while some of her books aren't as marvelous as others I will continue to read them as each comes out. Keep up the good work, Elizabeth! (From an old H.B. fan)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb !!!","review":"The two-year wait was worth it: this book is almost relentlessly perfect.Ms. George always chooses complex themes and in this novel she focuses on the aloneness of self and the essential unknowability of others. \\"In Pursuit\\" roams deeply and widely through the effects of this aloneness/unknowingness on our lives, loves, relationships, and - of course - our deaths.George has created interesting new characters, as she always does, to support her theme, but the familiar ones are present too, though slightly less knowable than usual. Again, a deft touch on the part of Elizabeth George.If there were a ten-star catagory \\"In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner\\" would definitely carry the banner."},{"rating":"2","title":"This woman just CAN'T write a bad book","review":"It was time for her characters to develop again as they do periodically and the all too sympathetic Lynley to have a nasty human side like everyone else. I get the feeling she's setting us up for more developments in her next book, but agree with other reviewers Lynley's nastiness just a tad beyond reasonable for him. However, Barbara got to develop, so bet it's all worth it in the next one. If you have not bought this woman's books, go forth and purchase them all immediately! Nice to have characters that are a joy to come home to book after book. This volume is twistier than most, but I can hardly stand the wait 'til the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth George makes mystery writing seem easy!","review":"With the problems facing Barbara Havers in the comclusion of Elizabeth George's last mystery \\"Deception on His Mind\\", we watch the partnership of Havers and Thomas Lynley overcome the obsticles of the Yard and the mystery at hand. Another treat for the mystery lover and Elizabeth George fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"As an Elizabeth George fan I am disappointed in her latest","review":"I was surprised and disappointed that George's work In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner left me totally bored, dismayed, and repulsed. It seemed to have little saving graces. I couldn't stand Tommy, his pompous inability to see beyond his own vanity was not the Tommy I knew and liked. Barbara is annoying in her hope that Tommy will come around - I wish she would have been less eager and forgiving when he finally did instead of excusing his bad behaviour. (note my English spelling). Because I have enjoyed all of the other novels so much I will look forward to reading the next one. I found the world of S&M not my cup of tea but I appreciate the author's bravery in showing us its degradations. No more of that please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"So happy I was when reading Deception on his mind that when I knew Elizabeth George had written In Pursuit of a Proper Sinner I thought finally some exicitement and love in Barbara's life. The book was excellent as the others, but this really was intense. More so was the stubborness and denial of Lynley and his feelings for Barbara. I identified with his feelings but he should have given her some slack and not just dismissed her because he thought she was in the wrong.As I read each chapter I was hoping more and more that something would happen between Barbara and Azhar. She deserves a little happiness and I think that Azhar is just the man for her, but a little competition would not hurt. Cannot wait to read the next book and hoping to read someting all the readers have been waiting for.Elizabeth, thank you for Barbara, I love her character and hope something exciting and lovely happens to her in your next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sodding Tiresome","review":"I give this book two stars only because it captured my attention enough to beguile me into reading it through to the end. At that point, I wondered why I'd wasted the time. Too long by at least 100 pages, this pretentious Elizabeth George effort starts with a bang and ends with a whimper from the reader who suffers from overexposure to too many extraneous characters doing way too little for way too long and mouthing way too much UK slang in the process. Sodding tiresome if you ask me. When I finally found out who did what to whom, I was less satisfied with the outcome than grateful that it was finally over. Ho hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark","review":"Granted, this was my first Elizabeth George book ever, so I was unaware that Lynley and Havers, et al had a history. I found them to be overly tedious; the book overly populated with characters, many of whom were unnecessary; and the whole thing overly long and overly confusing. Three hundred fifty pages would have been plenty! And I too found Nicola's depraved personality to be simply without foundation and totally implausible. Too bad, Ms. George. Your one chance to impress me and you blew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was in pursuit of finishing this heavy paperweight!","review":"I guess I picked the wrong book to start reading Elizabeth George. I did find the characters interesting and wanted to know more about them, but it went on and on and on..... I continued reading because I was intrigued by the plot, but found it difficult to read more than a chapter at a sitting. I finally gave up about 100 pages from the end, and sneaked a look at the ending. I hate doing that, BUT I COULDN'T TAKE ANYMORE! Ms. George could save herself alot of time and effort if in her next book she condensed the plot by half. I can't imagine who would have the patience to read this thing in a reasonable period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara needs a friend...","review":"...and right away. She is such a good, warm, funny person, that I can't see why she would have *no* girlfriends. And of course, her situation with romance is just too sad for words. I second others who say E. George is just too cruel to Barbara. I just hope she's winding up for some really fabulous life events to happen to Barbara. Goddess knows she's earned them!Another thought...is it really okay/legal to marry your _first_cousin_ in England? Yikes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant exercise but ...","review":"I recently finished Elizabeth George's latest Lynley (now Lynley-Havers) book and found it riveting. But I fail to understand (and don't appreciate) the author's decision to make Havers so terribly unattractive, fat, sloppy and intent on intensifying her obsessions with smoking and eating fat.George has clearly decided to make HER female character different from all the others and I imagine she thinks it is amusing, or gets a charge out of being deliberately politically incorrect. Fine. But the emphasis is such that at least this reader is beginning to find some of her discriptions downright distasteful. I hope the author will cool it in the future and concentrate on what she does so well, weaving one or more tales into a fascinating plot and peopling them with intriguing, interesting and at times unfathomable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"For me, the end of Elizabeth George","review":"I have long been a fan of Elizabeth George, and have been especially impressed with her development of Barbara Havers' character; however, I found this book to be depressing and repellent, relying on gratuitous descriptions of kinky sex as a plot device. These are mental pictures I do NOT want to see. . .and are NOT what I read for. I was SO disappointed. . .and in fact, have hoped that this was just the result of an editor standing over Ms. George's shoulder pointing out that sex is what sells books. I fear that Ms. George is only too willing to buy into that, and I'm sorry to see it happen. It's a waste of a fine talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored me long before the end was in sight","review":"This book has convinced me that I don't like Elizabeth George. Long before the end could be seen, I was thoroughly sick of the \\"victim\\", the detectives, the bystanders and even the English countryside. There is far too much here of Lynley's and Havers' whining about their personal problems; far too much irrelevent detail about the S&M underworld; far too much pseudo-Brit slang. It doesn't ring true to me- maybe because I read this directly after the far superior \\"River of Darkness\\" and \\"The Masters of the House\\" (again). So many scenes had absolutely nothing to do with the plot and so many threads were left hanging after the denouement. This will definitely be the last of this series for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"And one star is a stretch.","review":"I have enjoyed her other books immensely, but I really had to struggle to get to page 33. . .I gave up then. This one is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth George at her best","review":"After reading this latest installment of Inspector Lynley and Barbara Havers I can only congratulate Ms. George for her continuing succesful way of writing one book after another and still creating more suspense from book to book. I love this one, although you should know more about the book before \\"Deception on his mind\\" before reading this great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating look at the birth of carrier warfare","review":"I really loved this one. As a technology person and a history buff, I love it when a book brings history into terms you can relate to. Wildenberg successfully brings the pains and victories of the introduction of the technology and techniques of carrier warfare into easy to understand relief. Nicely done. Keeps your interest as you see how this emerged."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after 4 months of regular use","review":"Not recommended. This would be a great blender - if it didn't break. The gear used to drive the blades is connected to the motor by plastic (or some form of rubber, I'm not sure.) Regardless, the 'plastic' wore off after 4 months of regular use, making the blender unusable. This was a present, without a receipt, so we were worried about the return policy. The good news is we called Oster customer service directly. They were polite and are letting us exchange the blender by mail. They say it will take a few weeks. Until then, we will be looking forward to having our morning smoothies again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked everywhere !","review":"The first time I used this blender it left a large black mark on my counter.

The design was nice and easy to use, you turn it on to the setting you want and it automatically goes off when it is finished. The smoothies did come out nice. It did not a make a decent milk shake though.The big problem I had with this machine was that the jar leakes very badly. It uses a different seal then other Oster products and can't be found without ordering it. When I say the jar leaks I mean that it REALLY leaks. Not just a few drops here and there, but after using for about a month liquid comes out the bottom almost as fast as it goes in!If not for this I think I would love it, but unfortunatley the flaw is fatalI also never recieved a response when I sent corrispondence to Oster about the problems.

What caused me trouble? The clips on the bottom of the skirt snapped off. After they all fell off, suddenly the blender would not go on. I superglued them back on so that the sensor would allow it to start. Now I have three clips missing. As one falls off, I glue it back on. I realize this is to prevent the container flying off the base and redecorating the kitchen, but why so poorly made? This is a powerful motor!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oster stands by their products","review":"After reading the reports and seeing the phone number for Oster/Sunbeam,I decided to call to see what they would do for my wife and I too.We bought our 6700, back 3 years ago and had the same problems that are reported here.( black oil, broken toret wheel, leaks)Exchanged it 3 times and had a different problem each time.But we loved that model and features.Spoke with a gal at Sunbeam, she was very nice,took my information and they are sending us a newer model,of the same type as the 6700, at no charge.So, in the end, even though the unit(s) didn't last,had many problems, Sunbeam/Oster stand behind their product!They have earned my future purchases from them.Regards,John in CT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"We bought two of these - one for our college age son and one for ourselves.

Chronologically reciting life events for a biography is a dry business, and it is understandable for a biographer to insert occasional digressions and speculations about the character's psychology, the times in which he lived, the Renaissance in general, etc.But with Marius (the author), this resource the norm. And frankly, most of them are too extended, without adding much to your knowledge of More.I could only read until page 70 of his 550-page book. Then I decided that I cannot pass judgment about Mr Marius scholarship, because I cannot tolerate him as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biography as novel","review":"This is biography of Thomas More lacks scholarship, and contains a surprising number of passages in which Marius shows his lack of depth as an objective scholar with a broad range of learning in this field.Do yourself a favor and read Peter Ackroyd's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad this is sold separately!","review":"I really like the wok.

The book is generally informative and is interesting to read. I believe that I found at least two examples where the math was simply done completely wrong.

This book was very good, a good balance of strong and weak, but a couple things that are just unbelievable. Probably the only thing wrong with this book is that it goes around showing viewpoints from the Villains, the heroes, the accomplices and others, so you have to read every single small black print that goes for on and on.(ex. \\"Sarah connor's sanatarium-Present\\" , or H/K Mission-2089.)this was a very good book, but the sequel is better. You will have to read this to make all the series click in your mind, but it's well worth it. The last book in this trilogy is T2: the Future War, coming out august 2003. I am looking forward to it. (don't try and search for s.m. sterling; bad results.)They say that some of the elements of this book are going into T3: Rise of the Machines.

As to this book, let me first point out that T2 is one of my favorite movies, and in my opinion, was Schwartzenegger's finest film. This book read and felt like the sequel to T2; the way it started right after the destruction of Cyberdyne, after the death of Miles Dyson, and how it built on themes in the movies to a much better version of the James Cameron story/vision. It was far superior to the film T3.

X's old friend,Zero, that was his friend in almost every game, isn't in it. but I will say this: It was all right, but I think they took half an hour into making this game, so they could just put it in stores so the world would shut up. Even though playstation is meant for 3-D, it should be side scrolling. then they could probably take out the 3-D and give it awesome features. I've bought every single Megaman game, even the ones on the old NES, and bought all of them on super nintendo, and on playstation, and nintendo64.

However, I don't recomand this game for the following three reasons:1) although the simulation is interesting it is not very involving2) the graphics are extremely poor3) the game, after a while, is affected by bugs that make it impossible to go on playing and even to save the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak effort","review":"I was hoping for something like the classic Balance of Power or a strong geopolitical simulation like Hearts of Iron, but this isn't it. Gameplay is weak, with just a number of sliders you move around in some vain attempt to optimize the system. But you aren't given enough information about how the system works in the game or the manuals to make this interesting. It's not that the game is hard -- you can easily get your country in a stable and successful state -- but it's not very interesting. The military parts of the simulation are no better.Even with the latest patches, the game has stability and graphic issues. I also came across several misspellings in dialogs and descriptions, not a serious issue, but it does detract from the overall experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replay value! I like the game.","review":"I had Superpower 1 and couldn't wait for this one to come out. When I first attempted to play Superpower2, the game had trouble starting do to having so many bugs. The bugs were taken care of with a number of patches over the years. I played this game for many hours trying different things with different countries. Most seem to talk bad about this game, but I enjoyed playing it! I would recommend getting the game and see if it's for you. Yes you could go on for days about what the game doesn't do, (like neighboring countries not getting angry for your massive build up of military units). The game is a starting point for other greats to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for the first week","review":"It should be stated at the beginning that this is a Northstar protected game, and that Northstar systems do turn Trojan on you. My anti-virus just recently deleted the game and quarantined the executables.The gameplay is more fast paced than the original, but also a bit more simplified. Gone are the days of setting up Coups in 3rd world nations and controlling their puppet governments, not when you successfully stage one the rest of the world starts attacking you, and the country you over took will just start getting invaded by other countries. Usually Italy, China and Turkey. Playing as a 3rd World nation is substantially harder too as the AI now likes to become imperialistic at random intervals, mostly Poland, China and Turkey, making it very hard to keep a stabilized nation anywhere in Africa or Asia. But its still fun to Nuke the world and watch the fallout destroy continents at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't load!","review":"No idea if the game works - it won't load on two different computers.

It has a great wealth of knowledge about real world countries in it based as of 2001 but thats about it and is great fun to play before the bugs kick in. First bug i noticed was the sound the sound just started to loop could never figure out how to fix that with out restarting the game. Next is saving bug once i alrady saved a game once i like to keep games named the same but doing 2nd and 3rd saves at time really is a mess the game would crash and could never keep a nice game going for more then 6 years in game. Another bug i found is the research bug is still here fromt he orignal at times itll say you have not enough research in a area becuase its grayed out yet you have to have at elast a one in everything when ya start. The final word is they sent out a phase 1-2 beta for sell it should of went through more testing before released to the public and itll probley have lack luster support like the first one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan of Superpower, looking forward to it's sequel","review":"I was a perty big fan of the original Superpower and still play it from time to time despite it's flaws. The major flaw being the bugs which seemed to happen at the worst times. Second, would be graphics, they did do a good job of maps which look even better in 2 from what I've seen and unit availability but not with unit graphics, all things looked alike (Aircraft had one graphic if it were a fighter or a bomber...) but they have fixed that for number 2. Another complaint would be that it was too easy once you get the hang of it as the computer was very simple minded.The bad aside, I do very much so look forward to Superpower 2 and intend to buy it as soon as it's available.

Chose this because it seemed to come close. The first problem was that both the manual and the model tags indicated that this unit was made for sale in Mexico. The model number matches what is advertised, but beyond that it is hard to tell exactly what I really have.The unit is certainly not what I expected. The CHROME discription refers to chrome colored plastic, while the reviews reference a heavy metal base. I am still unclear as to why this discrepancy exists. I read and retread the material on the website, looked through a host of reviews, and can only tell you to be careful if you are expecting a heavy duty, long term model., this is not it.It is one of the most expensive units and there are far less expensive units which clearly indicate the housing is metal. Think carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work properly to make thick smoothies","review":"Very disappointed in this blender, for instance, the first day i used this blender it was incapable of making a thick smoothie, the engine smelled like it was burning up and I had to thin down the smoothie for the blender to work properly....... the blender is fine for making thinner smoothies which is NOT my preference"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Smoothies","review":"I don't know what the other reviewers of this blender are blending...but this blender is junk. I have tried twice to make smoothies with it and this blender cannot do the job. All of the ingredients just sit there while the only part of the mix being blended is at the very bottom.

Some people say it's too loud, but it's a blender. What do you expect? It does alot of work. It's easy to clean and looks good if you leave it out on the counter. The blades are very sharp so be careful when you take it apart to clean. I thought I needed a new osterizer because my old porcelin model seemed to be getting tired. Turns out the blades were dull and the motor was getting bogged down. You may want to try new blades before you buy a new one. I do wish they made a tapper for the bottom of the jar like you see on smoothie machines. Then you wouldn't have to lift the jar off of the base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, tough, retro blender!!","review":"I really did my homework before I made this purchase and it really paid off.

IT'S A BLENDER!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this blender!!!!","review":"I use this blender every morning to make a protein shake, and I use about 12 ice cubes (instead of the 5 or 6 indicated in the product instructions). All of the ice is ground up smoothly with no chunks, and it does it in just a few seconds! I have been mourning the demise of my thirty year old Osterizer blender - it was the perfect blender! I've tried other blenders, but I was very disappointed in the ice crushing ability of each one. The 4125 works like my original blender that I loved. The best part is that this one has more features. It make great milk shakes, and it has done a good job with routine food processing jobs.I don't think this blender is as loud as I was led to believe by reading the other reviews. It is actually quieter than my old one and the other models I have recently tried, and it works so quickly that the noise is not an issue at all for me.I highly recommend this model for anyone looking for a heavy duty blender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool and brilliant","review":"Such a fantastic blender. Simple but powerful and effective. And it looks extremely cool on the counter top.

The story-telling of the movie is poor, and the characters are not well-developed. Its only strength is in the music and the costume drama.Additionally, this 2-disc set is unnecessarily expensive and the second disc does not have much material on it. Other than the 48 minute documentary on early music and viola da gamba players, there is less than 20 minutes of additional material related to this film.The making-of-featurette consists of Gerard Depardieu laughing at inside jokes and getting make-up applied to his face in 10 minutes of home-movie quality footage. There is a 60-second TV interview clip with the director, a 5-minute TV interview which includes a long clip from the movie itself (so it is really only about 60 seconds of new material), a 2-minute TV clip of viola da gamba playing, and the original movie trailer.By no means worthy of a second disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie...","review":"This movie was wonderful.

I give you that. But the movie is simply downright awful. To me this movie is about a man who becomes obsessed with the viola da gamba to escape the pains caused by the death of his wife. His obsession not surprisingly drives hime to be utterly self-centered and bizarre. He is a monster who abuses and neglects his whole family to focus only on himself. He wasn't making music for us or for the world ... he was making music for himself but by luck his music making is also enjoyable to our ears. Otherwise most of us would recommend that he be locked up in an insane asylum.If one were asked what makes a French film a stereotypical bad French film, one feature pops into my mind: pretentious philosophical babbling.

We will have to ensure that every human being is clothed and fed before we can expect them to be concerned about the environment.

He then decides to make it looks like he has committed the crime, because he is convinced he knows who really did it and is committed to protecting that person. After staging the crime scene to implicate himself, Jack then calls the police--and also proceeds to hire an inexperienced lawyer, Mary DiNunzio, of the Philadelphia firm of Rosato & Associates. This turns out to be a huge mistake for Jack, because although Mary is inexperienced in murder trials, she has passion and heart. She doubts Jack's confession from the beginning and begins to investigate the crime. What she discovers about the crime will keep you turning pages all night long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great thriller!","review":"Once again Lisa Scottoline has taken us through unexpected twists and turns in her latest legal thriller! Judy DiNunzio, an associate in Bennie Rosato's law firm, is the heroine! Her client, Jack Newlin, has falsely proclaimed his guilt in his own wife's murder. Who is he protecting?It's a \\"must\\" read -- a true Scottoline thriller! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFUL read","review":"I'm not exactly sure why I didn't give up on this book after the first few chapters. I think I was interested to see how ridiculous it would get. Detailed in all the wrong places and just plain silly in most others. Please don't make the same mistake I made - choose a different book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only book I've ever bought that I threw away.","review":"I kept reading because I was thinking, \\"Surely this book can't be this bad. There's got to be something ahead.\\" Alas, that was not to be. The plot was so full of cliches and leaps of credibility that I was amazed the book found a publisher. Maybe its publication was part of a number/book deal. That would explain it. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. This book went to the recycle bin as I would have been ashamed to trade with my reading friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done","review":"Wealthy attorney frames himself for his wife's murder. Not giving any spoilers away- Scottoline had a few tricks up her sleeve with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprise!","review":"This was my first Lisa Scottoline book and I loved it! It was such a pleasant surprise. From the first page, I was hooked. The book begins with a lawyer trying to frame himself for murder. Imagine that! It makes you keep reading to find out what happens! Kuddos! This was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Scottoline's analogies for the most part were distractingly bad. For instance, describing a man's hair as being like the silver of weathered cedar shakes. Is she serious? And she didn't do her homework on the forensic stuff. Bodies don't stay in full rigor mortis very long. I think it is between 12 and 18 hours or so after death. The body of the victim was well beyond that at autopsy. Also, I don't believe pathologist do autopsies on bodies in full rigor. I found the main character uninteresting and not very bright.To call this woman the female John Grisham is wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial at Best","review":"There is absolutely no depth to this story. One wonders how the murder was solved because each character appeared to be more ignorant and bumbling than the last. I believe all female defense attorneys are probably thoroughly disgusted with Scottoline's character \\"Mary\\" (who appears to be a total ditz), and I doubt police detectives, portrayed as too stupid to be believed, are happy with this story either. This is my first time reading Scottoline, and probably my last. If this book hadn't been recommended and loaned to me to read, I would have thrown it out in frustration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Mary!","review":"Timid and sometimes aloof Mary gets a case of her own and immediately doubts her client. Join Lisa Scottoline for a great story... Great characters and I really like how she includes Mary's family into the story line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read.","review":"A very good story. The ending could not have been known until you finished reading the entire book. That made it so exicting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific reading","review":"Love that Lisa Scottoline never disappoints! Easy reading yet keeps you thinking and intriqued! I recommend \\"Moment of Truth\\" to anyone for an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moment of Truth by Lisa Scottoline","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. Not as exciting as Patterson or some of my other favorite authors but it is a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I HAD GOT UPSET WHEN,THE BOOK DIDN'T COME RIGHT AWAY.-IT CAME TODAY,1/5/13 AND I'M VERY HAPPY THAT IT GOT HERE-IT WAS PACKAGED VERY GOOD.IT WAS IN A THICK ENVELOPE.SO I'M VERY HAPPY THAT I GOT IT-NEEDED A BOOK TO READ SO CAME AT RIGHT TIME.THANKS"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ONE YET!!!!!!","review":"What a book. It is a must read if you like Lisa Scottoline, if you have not read one of hers please start with this one and then read the others. This is the best one yet. Jack Newlin confesses to killing his wife. Nearly, I say nearly, all the evidence points to him but his attorney Mary DiNunzio does not believe he did it. She thinks he is protecting his daughter. Mary sets out to prove he is not the killer. I like the two policemen, Brinkley and Kovich. I hope they are used in other books. Brinkley soon sides with Mary in thinking Jack is not the killer. But who is???? Is it the daughter, her boy friend, an attorney, or was it really Jack and he is turning everything around to look like it is someone else???? The book will hold you attention from the first page to the last. The ending is great. If you like mysteries you have to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, enjoyable read.","review":"This was my second Sottoline book - I've enjoyed both as they are easy, not too many characters to keep up with and the protaganists are women! She develops the plot so that you wonder from one minute to the next \\"who done it\\". Characters are developed fully - easy to picture. A good read for a lazy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it. A waste of money.","review":"Very disappointed in this book. The writing was so juvenile and the plot so slow that it was actually painful to keep reading. If it had been a library book, I would have quit after the first 20 pages, but I hate to spend money on a book and then find it's so bad I can't read it. Sadly, this one was exactly that. The reviews of this book created the expectation of being absorbed in a gripping thriller. Far from it. I should have known better as I have found other Scottoline books to be very amateurish. Wish I had relied on that experience. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was the first Scottoline novel that I have ever read. I selected it based on reviews, and I expected it to be a \\"jaw dropping\\" mystery/suspense novel. Overall, I felt that the characters lacked depth and the story line, particularly the ending, was too \\"contrived.\\" If you want a quick read, go ahead and buy it, but I suggest waiting for the paperback edition or, better yet, borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frictionaly plot with holes more than swiss cheese.","review":"The Female \\"John Grisham\\" Lisa Scottoline is over rated.I can't finish reading the Moment of Truth because I can't be cheated on and keep cheering.Suppose you go home, you found your wife brutally stabbed to death by a butcher knife. What would you think? Would you draw a conclusion right away that your 16 years old fragile daughter must be the murderer?Suppose your father is on way to electrical chair to protect you. Would you lie to father in order to protect your boy friend?The whole story is unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Foul Language","review":"Mystery with an interesting twist. Why not write good stuff WITHOUT all the foul language? The cursing and taking God's name in vain doesn't make it more of a mystery, it makes it low level reading. How about raising the standard and give your characters something new to say when excited and scared??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the price and so useful","review":"My guest bathroom has no cupboards or shelves. This little rolling cart fits under the sink and provides storage for towels, soaps and a first aid kit. The stainless steel is a nice change from coated wire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Little Cart","review":"This little cart is quite compact and relatively easy to assemble (directions are not included). I use it to organize all of the things I use for my dog, such as toys, brushes, treats - nothing too heavy though. Overall a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little storage cart","review":"I bought two of these little carts to help around the kitchen, and they work quite well. I need to be sure that there is nothing too heavy on one side of a basket or they will attempt to tip when moving them, but other than that, I'm pleased with their performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLeAse rEaD mY ReVIeW","review":"Uh-huh . . . I don't CARE what anyone else says about this book. This is a book that belongs on your bookshelf. Actually, it shouldn't even be on your bookshelf. It should be by your bed (or where ever you keep books that you read all the time) and not sit in one place long enough to gather dust. I mean it. IT IS NOT BORING, unless you happen to be one of those blond cheerleaders (if so, you have my utmost and deepest sympathy) who is either illiterate or just can't comprehend such a concept as hard work and hard thinking. The Mozart Season is not only funny . . . it's real, smart, and um . . . soulfully staggering. It is definitely on my all-time-top-ten-books-list. You may not want to buy it just right now. Go to your library (you know, that building with all the shelves and shelves of books) and check it out. After you read it a few times, you may just happen to find some meaning in it. Try it . . . please. It is a good book, I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for musicians","review":"This is a book about a young girl who is playing in a violin competition. It's good, espicially for people who are into music, but it can be boring at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mozart Season","review":"The Mozart Season is about a girl named Allegra and her determination to go to the finals of the Ernast Bloch violin competition. Allegra has playd the violin for a very long time and she is very good at it. Allegra's mother and father play the cello for an orchestra. Allegra's violin teacher, Mr. Kaplan is a very interesting character, he has a pillow that says \\"A teacher is someone that makes yo believe you can do it.Although Virginia Wolff has a point, which is that practice makes perfect. This book is not one of my favorites. I didn't like it because it was a very slow moving book and if you like action books this is not the book for you. But until the end keep your mind open and then you can make your own opinion.~ Ellie"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice read!","review":"This is a really well-written book. It's not what one would call action-packed, but it flows smoothly -- like the piece it describes.As a musician (though a pianist, not a violinist,) I could understand Allegra's struggle with the concerto, learning to make it part of herself (once she finds herself,) and yet not \\"upstaging that nineteen-year-old who wrote it,\\" as her teacher remarks in the book. I've had similar labors over a Mozart concerto myself! It seems to be aimed at teenagers, but I picked it up in my college library and enjoyed it. Worth at least one read. Particularly, I would guess, if you play the violin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intensions boring book.","review":"I had to purchase this book for a class. The first chapter is very informative however the rest of the chapters repeat everything from the first chapter but with examples. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I used this at my mother's house over Christmas and must say that this is not a good blender. There is no noticeable difference in the 12 speeds - only between speeds 1-6 and 7-12 and I had to repeatdly turn off the blender, dig in there with a spoon to stir up the fruit (or ice) and then turn it back on again, then it turn off , dig in there with a spoon to stir up the fruit (or ice) and then turn it back on again... And even then I didn't get a well blender smoothie/milkshake.I personally own the \\"Oster 4093-8O Classic Beehive Blender, Chrome\\" and love it (I have a review there). Its well worth the extra $7.22 - makes SMOOTH drinks on one blending cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck with a piece of junk","review":"My grandmother had the same Oster blender since the 60's and it still works great. I recently bought this and was skeptical when I saw that Oster and Sunbeam or part of the same conglamourate. I stupidly threw the box and reciept out and my blender just went out in a blaze of non-glory. It was frustrating to keep poking at smoothies with a spoon so they would mix but now the whole thing just died after a month or about 5 smoothies. What's worse is I was using crushed ice instead of cubes to cut down on the work the wimpy motor needed to do anyway. Also the buttons were just for decoration I guess because it only had one speed. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate This Blender!","review":"I received this blender as a wedding gift several years ago. It doesn't blend very smoothly -- to avoid lumps, I have to frequently stop blending, stir the ingredients, and start blending again. It also doesn't blend things quickly. The worst thing about this product, though, is the noise: it is ridiculously loud (the disc sander, power drill, and other power tools in my home are all quieter!). The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that it has lasted several years without frying completely (though this may be too generous, as I only use it rarely and the motor smells burnt when operating)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hell with the Fire Out","review":"Mr. Quinn wrote in his Preface: \\"Anyone who regards this handling of the record as irresponsible for a historian should simply read and judge what follows as historical friction; with my blessing.\\" He is right and I have judged his book. At best it is an attempt to write a \\"Creative History.\\" I believe this book is FICTION based on a true story. The only good thing about his book is that it can inspire readers to do a little on-line research that the author seemly has failed to do. The issues I have with Mr. Quinn's book are too numerous to list. The events Mr. Quinn has left out of his book are in fact the tip-off that this is not a historical account of the Modoc War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature","review":"Stayed up until 4am reading this for the third time. Amazed that this hasn't been made into a movie. The nuances, the subjectivity, the history of this region is turned into art by Arthur Quinn. No clue why this book wasn't a Pulitzer Prize winner. Its engaging, witty, ultimately sad. I grew up in Modoc County and there were great grandsons and daughters of many of the people mentioned. To this day, Captain Jack or general Canby can cause an argument in a restaurant or a fight in a bar.This part of California is really NOT the california we've grown up with on tv...this is another world, more rural, bucolic, forbidden, scathing and sublime. There is no place like Modoc County in all of America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very True!","review":"I haven't read this book yet! Yet I am here to give a review on it. I saw this book in the hands of a young lady, who was siting at an inter-city bus terminal with a relative of hers. She was laughing and smiling and laughing and smiling the whole time I was there. Even when she stopped for a while to listen to her relative she was having a smile on her face and then again she started smiling and luaghing. I wondered what was the secret behind her immense happiness. Then I looked at this book in her hands with a finger inside the book as a bookmark. I read the title of the book and it was 'Always Follow Your Dreams'. No doubt she might have always been following her dreams, that's why she was so happy and care free. I at once decided to get hold a copy of this book and here I am to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I got this to give to my mother and mother inlaw. They are very nice. It will be beautiful once they have filled them out and we can read them together with our children.

The comments that Bruce makes are also a bit annoying on a few problems etc... Also I think they fail to capture the real point sometimes as well. If your rated about 800 and wanna make it to maybe 1000. Thats about as far as this book can take you at best to be honest. Try a book like The Mammoth book of Chess, or Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess.

Well, we had it for a week when the \\"ultra-strong, all-metal drive shaft\\" sheared right off: it is actually all-rubber in construction: the metal does not go all the way through!I called Oster, and they agreed to send a free replacement. It arrived today (after a two week period with no blender). My kids got excited and asked for smoothies. I very carefully followed the manual's instructions, filling it with juice and adding one, tiny, pathetic half-strawberry at a time. On the last one, there was a sickening clunk, and, you guessed it! The drive shaft sheared off again! This happened five minutes ago, and I will quite definitely not buy another Oster. There was no abuse or misuse here, folks: this product may be super solid, but the weak link is the rubber transfer coupling, and it WILL break, leaving you fifty dollars poorer.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Designed Drive Shaft!","review":"I must totally agree with the reviewer that called this blender \\"Utter Garbage\\".Same thing happened. The drive shaft sheared off after filling it with water and then dropping in a piece of banana.The really crazy thing is this exact thing has happened 3 times in less then a year. Sure they send me a new blender each time it happens but it takes 2-3 weeks to get the new blender. So no blender in the house for 2-3 weeks each time this happens.The \\"Utter Garbage\\" reviewer left her review in Sept. 2004 and today is March 5, 2008 and it still seems to be the exact design on this model blender.I will just keep calling for a new blender each time the new one they send me breaks, but oh what an inconvenience! Just say NO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointed...","review":"I have owned this blender for a bit over a year now.It is extreamly noisy. The motor is not nearly as powerful as my prior cheap blender. It really struggles to mix any kind of food.Now it started leaking. The support for this blender is horrible. There was no part # for the blade (source of leak) in the manual. I called their 800 number and a recording said they had too many calls and to call back in another time.I will never ever buy an Oster product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking and functional but way too loud!","review":"This blender looks great on the counter and functions well; we use it daily to make smoothies and it chops ice easily.However, I've owned six blenders and this is by far the loudest. I expect a blender to be very loud, but this is truly ear-splitting. My last blender was also an Osterizer and the noise level was much better.We've lived with this one for about four months and have finally had enough and are going to buy a different blender. (I'm going to look at Consumer Reports and see if their reviews cover noise level!)Perhaps I just got a bad one and most are fine, but I'd stay away from this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 years on and running strong!","review":"I was recently in the market to replaced my Oster 4094, mainly because the blades seem to be wearing a bit and my smoothies weren't as smooth as they used to be. (I use this thing 2-4 times a week after a workout for my 'dinner' smoothie). Other then the recent issue of the blades wearing, this thing has never let me down. The 4094 has been running strong for 6 years and is still going strong! I now think I will just replace the blade with an upgraded design and see if I get get it to go another 6 years. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Blend Anything You Feed It","review":"I make Green Smoothies every morning which consists of blending raw veggies & fruits along with wheatgrass, ice, & other things and this blender is great at turning it all into a very smooth drink.

I would recommend this blender to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you, Amazon!!!","review":"While the quality of the blender is not in question, the quality of the shipping leaves much to be desired.

I am thinking of returning my edited version back to the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the way to write a book","review":"Some stories of the book are terrifying, some are boring and many of them are alike, some of the killers are important celebrities, some of them just kill once and some of them kill just a dozen, but when you finish the book you won't care anything about these killers, why? Because when you read 10 or 15 stories you will know how will be the next story in this book. RGJ wrote to many stories just because all of the killers were women and he wanted to write many pages, but he might write just the celebrities or the serial killers, but he went through the past and if he found a woman who kills somebody he just wrote it in the book, that is not the way to write a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !

Definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Routine","review":"In what is a direct sequel to both the forgettable 2001 filler movie Godzilla X Mechagodzilla and the excellent 1961 classic Mothra, Godzilla once again battles Mechagodzilla/Kiryu, only to also end up battling Mothra, who shows up to restore the natural balance of life to the Earth (or something like that).Tokyo SOS is slightly better than its predecessor due to more action sequences and a relatively fun final battle, but, as with all of Masaaki Tezuka's Godzilla films, the direction is amateurish and bland. None of the characters have any development whatsoever, and the suits- as per usual for the Millennium Series- look stiff and rubbery. For die hard fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best Millenuim G-Film Yet!","review":"This film, part of the 50th Anniversary series, has the same specifications as \\"Godzilla: Final Wars\\". This time around a Japanese teaser is included, although it's from when the movie was still in production, so it's mostly made of \\"Godzilla Against MechaGodzilla\\", \\"Godzilla vs. Mothra\\", and some \\"GMK\\" and \\"Rebirth of Mothra\\" stock footage. But from Japan none the less. Although the Japanese audio track and behind the scenes are included, I still didn't find this DVD worth five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renewed my Faith!","review":"This is what gave me hope for the Godzilla franchise now ... i saw previews and stuff for Final Wars which i assume is probably better, but in this to no real fan is let down. Now, people, it is a Godzilla movie ... so it's not a huge budget or super CGI blockbuster, but just a movie true fans of the series love. I don't hate any Godzilla movie, being a fan i enjoy then all. My favorite will forever be Godzilla vs. Destoroyah but this has better effects, but so what, i just think Godzilla is bad a$$. But just like the heisei series, Godzilla looks powerful, Mothra looks poetic and beautiful (as they both should) and Mecha-G never looked better.

Get the DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Godzilla movie that is simply awesome","review":"I got the movie today(will not say from where because I got it early).I watched the movie right when I got home. It is my 3rd favorite millineum series movie behind G Against MechaGodzilla, and GMK. As far as people saying it is the best Special Effects G movie I dont know it seemed just as good as GxMG and GMK. The movie itsefl was awesome. The battle scenes where off the chain. The battle last about an hour. It's a 10/10 Godzilla movie and I definately recommend it if your a die hard G fan.

I realize you have to just suspend reality sometimes and go for the visuals. Unfortunately the first 45 minutes of this movie is tedious as it focuses on two 4\\" tall girls that appear and warn that Godzilla is coming. The 4\\" tall girls sing songs and are about as cheesy as you can get. More mind numbing events occur as the story shows more of Mothra and it's larva then Godzilla. I could not even recommend this movie for children to watch, as the will certainly be board to tears and also *SPOILER* there is a graphic scene where the moth gets roasted alive. So no exactly wholesome fun for the kids to watch. Instead of this movie, I would recommend Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla or Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla both of which have not stop action, incredible special effects and more interesting stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good G film.","review":"I liked Godzilla X Mecha Godzilla. This was a horrible sequel to it. It's real title is G X Mothra X MG: Tokyo S.O.S, they should have called it Godzilla X Mothra AND Mecha Godzilla because in the movie, MG and Mothra didn't fight once in the film.

The characters were pretty good!6. The last ten minutes were kinda tense!7. The f/x were getting more and more impressive!What I didn't like was:1.

Mothra fighting Godzilla. Godzilla frying Mothra. The baby Mothra's shooting webbing all over Godzilla. Etc, etc. Come on! We've seen it already!

It commits the biggest of sins of a monster flic. It cuts away from the monsters to show what the humans are doing. It does it over and over. I want to see monsters fighting.

What make this work for me is that I do the written exercises away from the guitar where I can really concentrate on what I am learning. The pattern approach that this book uses is something I have never seen before, not saying its original to this book, but it works for me. Would highly recommend this for new guitarists that want to understand what they are doing and learn how to improvise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I've been playing guitar for over forty years, and I have a pretty sound knowledge of the fretboard and music/chord theory. This book is useful in that it condenses a lot of what it took me years to figure out in a few pages, and I've learned a couple new tricks. It wasn't quite what I expected (although I can't fault the book for that), but I'd recommend it to mid-level players wanting to raise their chops a notch or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fretboard Magik","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read for guitar. I have always had trouble finding my way around the fretbaord, but after working with this book I have no trouble at all. There are so many helpful tips and exercises that you can't help but become ultra fluent on guitar. And unlike most books, the material in this book is presented in a manner that is easy to understand. It's all connected perfectly, instead of YOU having to piece things together. I would recomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy way to learn the entire fretboard","review":"I have played guitar for about 20 years. I was looking for a book to help a friend who is a beginner as I was struggling with how I would explain 20 years of knowledge. I went through the exercises myself in order to determine if I wanted to recommend this book. What I found was that the exercises really helped me have a better understanding of the fretboard. I can now find specific notes much more quickly and have a complete understanding of how scales are formed. I have only worked through the first 6 chapters but have already become a much better player. The exercises are short,concise, and to the point which maintains my interest. I will continue and complete the entire book. I would highly recommend this book to any beginner student and to anyone who is self taught and wants to \\"pull everything together\\" with a better understanding of the entire fretboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workbook","review":"This is a worbook, it requires you to work through examples with the intention of learning how to recognize and recreate them yourself. Examples include: major/rel. minor scale patterns, pentatonic scale patterns, arpeggio patterns, triad patterns, interval patterns and chord patterns. There are also note patterns. you are responsible for learning or memorizing these. Please note that that author does not show you how to use these, he doesn't give you the context. they are for learning purposes. I would suggest his chord tone soloing book for context.Also, you don't need to know how to read music to use this book. I think he has a seperate book that covers that aspect. It is a very useful skill if you do.Overall this is an excellent workbook for the aspiring guitarist. It will help open the fretboard to the diligent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-thought out and clear exposition on the structure of the fretboard.","review":"This is a very well-thought out and extremely clear explanation of the structure and lay-out of the guitar fretboard that will give the diligent reader the means to both grasp the location of any note on the guitar fretboard but also use that knowledge to produce scales, arpeggios, and other musical forms appropriate to the music they seek to play. Having purchased similar books in the past, what impresses me most about this book is how each chapter is broken down into reasonable 'bite-sized' and digestable chunks of information which both build upon the previous lesson and logically lead to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"VERY informative. Geared towards intermediate level. As a beginner-intermediate musician, I found it easy to follow with lots of exercises to cement the information in your mind. I would have liked more \\"secrets\\" or tools to finding notes on the guitar neck, but still an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"adding to the chorus","review":"Since 1969 when I first started learning guitar, I have accumulated (count 'em!) about four feet of instructional books. Despite hours of pouring over this stack, I STILL didn't have a sense for the fretboard. Most of what I play are chords to sing along with and a few pieces I have memorized.I'm on vacation studying Tagliarino's book and in a few days feel like I FINALLY have a sense for the fretboard. It is rare to find a great teacher, and even rarer to find a book that is thought out to meet the needs of the learner.This book presents in an orderly manner that gives one a sense for patterns inherent in the fretboard a stepwise approach to learning the fretboard. There are multiple 'homework' assignments with an answer key in the back. Tagliarino's suggestions for practice are also exactly what I have wanted for years.So, add this 5 star review to the chorus. As far as I am concerned, if it isn't already, add this book to the classics of instructional classics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Fretboard Workbook","review":"I think when it comes right down to it, learning all the notes on a guitar fretboard, and their various positions, is a formidable task. The author of this book apparently believes that also ... that is why he has painstakingly developed an outline that is well thought out in order to make this knowledge easier to digest than any other method I have seen. The instruction is clear, in detail, and innovative in its approach. I have only had the book a short time, so I can't \\"read\\" the fretboard yet ... but clearly, by following this series of study and excercises, I can see that not only will I have the ability to see all the notes and their positions ... but I will have this knowledge for the rest of my life. And that is worth far more than the modest price.Richard Narrell"},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts it all together","review":"I definitly saw the patterns on the fretboard after, where there was just massive confusion before. If you know just a little bit of theory to start, you should have no problems getting through the excercises. In fact, the book will pretty much complete your theory training by the time you finish. You will end up having the knowlege to create any chord anywhere on the fret board. Pretty cool results for not to much time vested."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the 3 fretboard learning books I reviewed","review":"I bought Sololow's Fretboard Roadmaps, the Fretboard Logic SE book, and this workbook at about the same time. Of the three, this one was the most useful and best written. It would be even better if they released a software version so you could \\"drill\\" practice on the patterns. But for $15 I think this is a great resource and should be one of the first 5 things new guitarists put in their \\"library\\".Update 2011 -- Since my purchase of this workbook, I have added basically ALL of Barrett Tagliarino's books to my guitar library, and a 2nd copy of this workbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fretboard book","review":"I bought this book about two years ago and went through all the exercises. I have a much better understanding of how to compose chords, how play arpeggios, and have gained much better understanding of scales. In essence, this book has been the foundation of music for me. I liked how the author presents the material and later I bought his \\"Chord-Tone Soloing\\" and \\"Music Theory\\" books. I am very analytical and found these books to be clear, practical, and very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasmic","review":"Many people are comparing this to Logic because they purchased that first, however, I bought this title first and I love it, I can finally find my way around the fretboard in a methodic manner instead of just wandering around until I found a note that I'd needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is wonderful!!","review":"This is an actual workbook on the fretboard of the guitar. I enjoy using this book and suggest it to anyone over 13 that is serious about learning to play guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for students to use","review":"I have some of my advanced students use this book as a way to reinforce the fretboard and music theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but a bit boring","review":"This is a great book for learning to really understand the fretboard. It's pure excercises though. To me a 5 star book has to have you learning while you also enjoy what your playing. A lot of this is rote stuff that you just drill til you get it. The book does pay off though and I recommend it to a serious player willing to put in the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"This is classic guitar knowledge you've got to know it you want to jam. Might as well get it in a cool system. We (guitar players) have some cool stuff piano players can only dream about, BUT, we are stuck with an enigmatic fretboard that requires work and study to unravel. There is a lot of material here, especially if you have never seen any of it before. But go ahead and get it and become a player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blank Pages to Fill Out","review":"I understand the principle of making the student's mind work, but this particular book of Tagliarino's has more blank space than it does information. To be sure, all the sparse information is there. The blank spaces are for you to figure out.What I'm opposed to is that Tagliarino could have included far more information in this book. If you are a thinking person, you aren't going to be asked to figure out what the author just told you.A good music instructor will give you just enough information to whet your appetite, all information given, which will make you think, \\"What are the intervals? Where is the root? Why does that work?\\" A good teacher will have given you all the information beforehand and allow you to learn what has been offered to you without sacrificing pages for you to fill out. You can look at what's written musically and put your mind to work.For me, this book was a waste of money. If you got something out of it, good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This book would be a lot better if it explained things more thoroughly and relied less on the reader drawing scale diagrams. Doing the work is fine but the book just doesn't explain the topic very well. Also, I found several errors in the first 30 pages--diagrams wrong, explanations wrong, answers wrong (like, where is E#????), etc. It does a poor job of explaining the relative relationships between scales. I gave it two stars because of the root positions diagrams. These were very useful. Could have been a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Purchase","review":"I started playing a lot of years ago. I am now taking some time to start back up again. I had heard about the CAGED theory. I thought that this would put a jump start into my refresher to guitar. I have seen some CAGED instruction on line that seemed interesting. This book is poorly organized and what there is in the book is too fundamental for an experienced player. I would say it would be too confusing for any one that is starting to learn guitar. I should remember from my years of learning the guitar that practice makes perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important yet BORING - for EXTREMELY super-motivated ONLY","review":"I find his books to be 'comprehensive' yet uninspiring. Way too much ground vs. practically covering the ground well and making practice still at least a little bit fun.I also find his guitar playing extremely boring from listening to his clips online. Had he been a killer player that had emotion and didn't sound like music school noise, I would have been much more motivated to see it past the first half of the book (at which point, I dropped it). Ditto for his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very rudimentary stuff","review":"If you know the very, and I mean very, basics of the guitar and theory then this book is a waste of time and money. I found out the hard way. If your just beginning (like picked up the guitar yesterday or a month ago) then this book may be for you.

I immediately noticed how the pictures and diagrams were so intuitive. It took a lot less effort to memorize the concepts simply because they made much more sense. Tagliarino removed the mystery, and immediately made it easy for me to grasp, and memorize the five root shapes with his diagram in the workbook. Ultimately this is why I bought a workbook like this in the first place. Great job, Barrett!I do not know this author. Just really like his book.-Shane"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Change","review":"Although I am still progressing through this book as I write this review, I believe it is very fair to state that this book is one of the most practical and beneficial any guitarist can use to enrich their mentallity and fluency with the instrument. Its not some magic dust that will grant great chops and accuracy. That takes raw practice; however this book just makes that journey much easier. The material of this workbook just explains the fundamentals in a fundamental way. With over 6 years of experience, I find certain lessons in this book to be very revitalizing and quite engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"this may have some value","review":"but it is definitely the case that I had buyers remorse for not having been able to actually pick up the book and leaf through it to see its potential value.It's possible a beginner or young practicioner might get something from this, but it's not for the experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good way to learn notes around the guitar","review":"I raced through the first few chapters and really enjoyed learning the notes around the keyboard.

I am a collector of any books on Princess Diana and have read them all. In my opinion this book is terrible. The author is using the guise of writing about Princess Diana to bash Paul Burrell, President Bush and Tony Blair and the Iraq war. He begins to tell you something about Princess Diana then the next thing you know he is off on a tanget about something else. This is a very boring and confusing book. It isn't interesting enough to keep the reader's mind alert."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad drivel from a tired man","review":"This latest book by Rorem is a desperate attempt to continue reporting on his witty and sometimes scandalous life. However, the wit is trying and desiccated. Further, what Rorem now hopes we will find scandalous has more to do with his disdain of the words \\"pundit\\" or \\"grunge\\" than anything truly controversial. One can't blame Rorem; his lover's illness and decline was probably devastating. He might have done better to wait until he had some time to heal.

This chapter so clearly and concisely expresses the argument of the second book of his main work that I would go so far as to say it is indispensable for an accurate understanding of his philosophy.No doubt some of the theories Schopenhauer uses to back up his philosophy in this book are out of date, but the majority of cases to which he appeals remain compelling and have not been made redundant by subsequent discoveries."},{"rating":"2","title":"WE CELEBRATE YOU","review":"This is an excellent series of songs, Shannon Wexelberg has a fantastic voice and this is a great group of praise and worship songs.

As others have noted, the jar doesn't lock to the base, which is more than annoying--though if I hold it there, it doesn't feel unsafe.That said, while washing dishes today the jar (empty, disassembled) was gently knocked to the floor from the countertop--a distance of no more than 3.5 feet. Something about the way the jar hit the floor made it shatter into three pieces. The handle came completely off, leaving a jagged hole down the side of the plastic jar.

When I first received it as a gift I honestly thought it wouldn't work because the jar does not fix securely in place. But, it worked and it has been working great until I decided to put some hot liquid into it and I was holding the flimsy top with a pot holder when all of the sudden the filler cap falls into the blender and grinds up with every thing else. So, much for what I was blending, but now I can't use the stupid thing because I no longer have a lid with a cap.

I'm not a lazy reader who expect stuff handed to him on a silver platter, but there just simply isn't enough information in this book to extract what you need.It's ok in parts, but just moves too quickly, it skips over huge sections, including some fundamental concepts.I'm off to find another Java book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Java book","review":"John Cowell has written a fantastic book on J++.

Then, as the year goes by, it's woven in with the tales of eleven other apprentices.

It worked great on everything I've thrown at it so far, from coffee cake batter to oatmeal cookies I've had no problems. However I would advise caution on using it for very light dry mixtures such as strudel topping, it has too much power and things go flying.

He goes beyond the basic concepts to show additional and important information on antitrust laws and international distribution and competition.I would recommend reading this book and keeping it as one of your reference books to consult whenever you're up to consider changes in the distribution system that arise because of competitive pressures, changes in customer behavior, or new product launches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You Need to Know and More","review":"Brilliant!

The materials are not of the same quality as the older machines; stainless steel has been replaced with plastic or aluminum, and the machine feels much lighter, and not nearly as solid.

I shown it to friends who have other espresso machines and they comented that they never saw anything like this and I should return the product.2) Also, not sure it it suppose to be this way, no matter how I grind the coffee (thingly or not so) the watter seems to have hard time dripping through but the system produces increadible amount of steem.

You can use espresso grind for regular brewing, but you can't use regular grind for espresso. You'll get brown water.2. Tamp it pretty firmly. The back of the little measuring spoon that comes with the machine works perfectly.I recently completed a serious search of home machines up to $1,500, and concluded that it makes a lot more sense to stay with the Krups than invest in a unit that will require more cleaning and a lot more cash.

For some reason I literally cannot pour it when near full without the water or coffee sticking to the side of the pot and running down and dribbling off the bottom.

BEING ORIGINAL, not monnotous, RZA cant do every beat, for every song, for every emcee on every album can he??

WHERE ARE YOU!","review":"This album needs the Rza so bad, I can't even believe it. I love the Rebel INS but after just one listen, I can't listen to this album anymore. I tried to like it, but I couldn't! These other producers need to train under the Rza a lot longer because they are horrible. INS's skills are suffering on this album when put on these weak tracks. The Rza is the only one that can provide the perfect backdrop and tailor the music to each members needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell off hard man....","review":"Sorry fellas, but I heard INS on Protect Ya Neck and said he was the dopest in the clan. The guy that comes with lyrics like \\"I crystalize the rhyme so you can sniff it\\" was supposed to hit harder than anyone else out there, but for whatever reason this album fell off hard. 17 tracks on the LP and maybe you can peep 3 or 4 fresh beats. The rest of the album sounds like it was put together by some hollywood studio, not the true dungeon sounds that Wu is known for. Had they followed the formula for earlier success, and had RZA realized that his beats with Deck's words is like peanut butter with the jelly, this album would have gone down in history. Instead, it goes down as one of the biggest dissapointments in a long time. It just hurts, man. When you got easily the number one lyricist in the group, he needs to be heard over the coldest beats they got. That shoulda been RZA."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you kidding me?!!","review":"this album is straight booty! i really dont see how heads are giving such positive reviews. my only asumption is that there are certain heads so dedicated to the wu that they will not allow themselves to realize when a clan album is wack. weak production, laughable rhymes, it's just terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was thoroughly dissapointed","review":"I'm really glad I borrowed the album, cause buying it would be a terrible waste of money.

Look at this album though. This is not the Deck I know. Track 2 is off the hook but after that the production is garbage. Most of Deck's lyrics after the first song are average.

My favorite is \\"The Grand Prix\\" with U-God and Street Life. This CD is nice to bump when you're just chilling in your room or something. Needless to say, it has good beats on it. Wu almost always does.Negatives: No Method Man feature. I didn't think it was possible for a WTC member to release a solo album without The Ticallion Stallion.

As I walked through the door, the employee handed me a free CD. I looked at the cover and saw it said Inspectah Deck. I had know idea who he was, but I saw that it was a hip hop CD so I held onto it. I took it home and listened to it. It was a promotional CD, which had some spliced songs on it. I listened to it at first and didn't really like it, but I gave it another chance. It began to grow on me. After a while, I went to the store to buy the complete album. Ever since then I have been hooked. Let me say, it's hip hop at its finest. The Rebel INS is lyrically sick wit it. His beats would of been a little better if RZA were behind them, but they are still extremely satisfying. Now I am trying to get his new album, \\"The Movement.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful stuff","review":"Without a single beat by the RZA, Deck still manages to surpass all expectations and forges a new sound from the underground. This is possibly Wu Tang' s best rhymer and joints like Longevity, Friction, and Show and Prove make this official. Witness the power of rhyme and hiphop as Wu Tang steps into the 21st century."},{"rating":"2","title":"INS, simply the best, he'll always pass the test","review":"Why the hell do people always try and knock Deck? INS is the most underated Wu member, and he's also the best. Check out pivotal Wu cuts like Triumph, Protect Ya Neck, CREAM, and the soon to be released The Jump Off. Deck kicks off the beginning to all of these tight songs. The energy and lyrical prowess from Deck's conglamoration with the other Wu members is translated to Uncontrolled Substance. Its a great CD. And just because the RZA didn't do the beats, doesn't mean it sucks. INS is a great producer himself, and has learned so much from his debut album. This is one of my favorite CD's in my collection. Don't skip on INS, unless you think you are the best. That rhyme I just spit sucks, but INS can rhyme about 123.569 times better. If Deck decides to cut himself another album, be prepared to have your ears charmed. Deck, the best, time for a rest, I'm out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"'9th Chamber', 'R.E.C.

INS' lyrics will always be on point, but the production is DIFFERENT while still giving you those piano samples and deep bass lines we've come to love from the Wu. Different is good though, and after the sub-par Wu releases we've been getting this album is just what we needed. The album is no doubt a start to finish listen with few songs if any asking you to skip them. This album is more than I expected because INS waited so long before dropping it, and usually the result is a weak release. By far one of the best rap albums of 1999 and one of the most versatile Wu-Tang albums ever. Basically...BUY IT. On the first listen, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is Tight... BUY IT!","review":"This CD is just about as good as any wu-tang solo CD.

The introduction is good in the best sense of silly. The disease entries are not much more than the rainy day musings of a bunch of 13-14 year olds as they sit playing video games.

The sound (although somewhat muted) and picture are excellent. As for the skits, they are, as usual, hilarious! The only complaint I have is that \\"Hoi Polloi\\" and \\"Half-Wits Holiday\\" are virtually indistinguishable from each other, with the same identical story and some exact lines with each other.

But the other five are zany, fast-paced, and hilarious. I think the best one is A DUCKING THEY DID GO. The Stooges join a bogus duck club which hunts on a lake that hasn't seen a duck in years.

The bass player, Willie Weeks, sat on a bar stool in front of his Ampeg SVT (if memory serves) no more than 10 feet from us.What a sweet guy. For the next 90 minutes we watched him play some of the tastiest bass I've ever heard (he was one of the most in-demand L.A. session players at the time) with an ear-to-ear grin that never left his face. He saw us watching him (he was the only one we could see) and he gave us a little show-within-a-show. When their set was over he stopped long enough to say, \\"You guys musicians?

There was a point where it was hard for me to put down near the end. Being new to road cycling this year (generally ride mountain - which I still prefer...)

Everyone was talking about the Tour de France, and this book is exactly what to read to get the feel of the race. The book describes a one-day race on a small portion of the Tour. You are in the author's pocket the entire way. The author is a gifted cyclist, as well as a gifted author (and, in a previous life, a chess champion). He says things about cycling that are infinitely true. Particularly apt was his comment that cyclers love pain. It is the pain that makes each individual experience memorable.

Only 148 pages, the novella is not written in chapters but broken down into kilometres travelled. This is effective in terms of conveying the unbroken nature of the race. The writing is sparse and pared down; in places it felt as hard and real as a bicycle saddle. This clean, efficient prose helps to convey the clinical sense of competition amongst the racers. It brings a strong sense of realism but perhaps at the expense of warmth and emotion. I felt I understood the characters but I didn't form any lasting connection to them. The Rider doesn't try to be something it isn't - its main aim is to give the reader an 'in-situ' 150 kilometre saddle-ride, and it achieves this. Without question, The Rider works as a specific, cult piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic!","review":"I really loved the book. It is for sure in my 10 best books ever list.The book really manages to describe with precision what goes inside a rider's mind (and all the dilemas) during a race.

At first glance I was afraid that the animal theme would become old I soon realized that as with all of her writings I should not have given in to such assumptions. The stories in this collection are mostly quite short, some only a page, but they are not vingettes or prose poems-- each page is as full as any longer story. The stories range from disturbing and sad to winsome and heart warming, but as with Amy Hempel's other works she always touches both your mind and your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read...","review":"I read this book becuase someone compared this book to books written by one of my favorite authors, Chuck Palahniuk. Well, I started reading, and, although I tried, I just could not enjoy it. I mean, absolutely nothing happens in these stories: characters don't develop, there is no action, nobody goes on a journey, absolutely nothing happens. These stories read as follows: a guy gets up, he goes to the store and buys milk, he walks home, he has a bowl of cereal. That's all that happens in most of these stories. Perhaps I'm missing something, and perhaps there's something I don't know that would make this book make sense, in which case, I apologize for this rant.

The second time we used it (on a baked ham) food stated slipping in between the two blades. This is the problem with the EK800, the slicing blade is actually two thin blades that sort of lock together. When we attempt to slice meats, thin slivers of meat get in between the two blades, making slicing impossible. We thought it might be our \\"technique\\", but we tried it on several more roasts nd no matter how we use it, food gets between the blades.

Painfully dull with nothing to interest you in any further interaction with the characters. I kept waiting for the good part and it never got there.

There's more to a book than just an idea. That's the only reason this book gets two stars from me instead of one.With the exception of Xiao Yen, the characters were very flat. There was some attempt at developing Udo and Wang Tie-Tie but they still ended up feeling like cardboard cut outs.Each chapter skipped back and forth between past and present. Not too original and not necessary. The plot, though initially interesting, skipped around a bit too much. It was more like several short stories linked together. So much more could have been done with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre characterizations","review":"The basic plot has already been outlined so I won't repeat it. Overall, the concept is good. However, the heroine was poorly developed as were the other minor characters except for the wicked aunt.

Although it was written in 1990 the ideas are still real today.
