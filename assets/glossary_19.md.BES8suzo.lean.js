It's touching story about 2 teenagers in love. Luke has had a crush on Julie since they were little and finally in high school they are dating. They are deeply in love. Julie notices how Luke seems sick a lot and so she makes him go see a doctor. Luke gives in to see a doctor, he finds out that he has a tumor and has to go on chemo. Julie sticks by his side no matter what.-This book is better than \\"A Walk To Remember\\", which I didn't really like, but the book is better then the movie version at least.-Lurlene McDaniel is truly a wonderful author, who has written many touching books about life/reality of those that face unfair life-alternating situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Die, My Love","review":"THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK I HAD EVER READ BY lURLENE MCDANIEL.

After a friend got me this book for Christmas I was hooked, and you will be too. Read one of her books and you will know what I mean. For a book of it's length it goes by fast I could not put it down. The romace and the trama kept my eyes on the page. I recomend this for anyone who is a softy about true love.

I thought it was one of the most touching books I've ever read. I cried so many times when reading the book. I don't know what happened to my copy of the book, but if I still had it, I'd read it at least once every two months. I found the way Lurlene inserted the information about the illness was brilliant. Most authors would come out and say excatly what the condition was and leave it alone, but Lurlene spreads out the information in just the right amount in the right spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good things turn bad","review":"Don't Die, My Love is a really enjoyable book. You never get bored with it. Having read many books by Lurlene McDaniel, I think this is one of her best works. It truly makes you look at your own life and how you would act during a situation like they were put in throughout the story. The story is about a boy named Luke, who had everything going for him in his life. He has had the same girlfriend for many years. He is a really good quarterback and promising colleges recruit. But while he was on top of the world, horror strikes. He found a lump on his throat. Now is is in real trouble. He then finds himself in the hospital. The doctors start to run many tests to find out what is really wrong with him. Just as things are starting to work out, they end up getting bad again. You will be surprised and very eager to see how the story will finally end. The story is full of many ups and downs. You have to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't die my love","review":"This the best book I have ever read and I have read alot for a 12 year old.

I have read almost all of her books and they have all been great books. They are also some of the only books for teenagers that don't have curse words. And can relate to real life for some people. When Luke finds out he has cancer it is hard for him, his mom and Julie to deal with it. But when Julie has confidence in him that he will live that shows how much she cares about him. And I think that you have a lot of canfidence that they will live even when you know they probably won't. But Luke knows that he wasn't going to make it, but it was sooo sweet whenn he gave her that promise rinng and said that they were going to get married. This was one of her best books, WHICH THEY ALL ARE!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't die, My love","review":"It was SOOOO good!!! You have to read this book.

I can't tell you how good it was. If you like romance you'll love this book. I couldn't put it down and finished it in one night. Trust me, you'll fall in love with this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE EPITOMY OF REDUNDANTCY","review":"If this was the only love story written by this author that I had ever read, I would think it was great. However, upon reading at least three of these short novels (by the same author) I found that the style and even exact context were similar, if not identical. Always focused on death, dying, and sickness, these novels display human suffering and the supposed release of such by the miraculous occurance of a check from an anonymous person. Three times I disovered the same words within different novels. Clearly a strong lack of imagination and unnecessary redundance. Did the author actually get paid for this act of self-plagerism?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's one of the best books I've ever read.","review":"I'm a huge Lurlene McDaniel fan and although I'm not prejudice to her others, this was definately one of my favorites.

When we finally got around to checking functionality, fortunately before we really needed it, it didn't work. Something was wrong and water was spewing from inside the handle and elsewhere. We read the instructions incessantly thinking we were doing something wrong. Upon contacted the seller they wouldn't bother with our issue because so much time had passed - 3 months or so. That was not cool for sure. But dealing with the manufacturer was great. Good customer service. They first tried sending us a replacement handle, to no avail. We then had to send the whole unit in and received a new one that worked just fine. A hassle for sure. But now we have a functioning unit that works quite well, as intended and designed. If this fits your needs regarding volume and portability, we certainly recommend it. Just confirm functionality of the unit when you receive it and don't wait. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate preparedness water filter","review":"a cleanable filter good for 13,000 gallons, buy a couple of these and some carbon replacements packs (not really needed but help with the taste and smell) and your set for whatever happens. Outdoor Pros shipping and packaging was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept Me Healthy in Nepal","review":"I used the Combi for three months in Nepal. The filter allowed me to avoid polluting that beautiful country with hundreds of empty mineral water bottles. Another excellent reason to schlep your own filter is that travelers who must buy their drinking water tend on average to drink much less than the body needs. With a Combi you will spend less, pollute less, and enjoy consistently clean, good-tasting water. I do suggest traveling with a few more activated carbon refills than you anticipate you'll need. The water quality in developing countries can be rather poor. Replacing the carbon often keeps the water tasting good and provides additional peace of mind. Be careful about taking the Combi to cold climates -- the wet ceramic element will crack if allowed to freeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I was very UNimpressed with these makeup sponges.

Bailey is playing \\"unplugged\\" in a very small performance space, evidently a record shop - he barely has room to open his case to remove his guitar. He tells a funny story about working in a music store in his younger days, interjecting tiny bursts of guitar dissonances as he speaks. Derek Bailey was a unique and thoughtful guitarist. If Anton Webern had been an improvising guitarist he would have sounded like this. The only flaw with this DVD is the filmmakers occasional \\"creativity\\" - unnecessary special effects that interrupt the performance here and there are nothing but distracting. However this flaw is not enough to ruin the presentation. For a Derek Bailey fan this DVD is well worth the price... if nothing else it's fascinating to see how he does it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Probably no film captures more realistically and poetically the joy, sorrow, simplicity and freedom of isolation. As well as the yearning for human contact and man's spiritual bond with nature. This is unlike any movie I have ever seen. Sheen is the only person in the movie that you actually see fully. Other characters are seldom shown. Instead we only hear them or see them partially. This brings the viewer to feel the alienation Sheen undergoes in his self-exile from society. The music is beautiful and carries us along gracefully until the climactic and unforgettable ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, great acting","review":"A very well done, yet low budget film, about one man's refusal to fight in the Civil War. I was a 12 years old when it was filmed and spent most of the summer of 1970 on the set during filming. My uncle was a high school friend of Clyde Ware (the director) and many of the scenes were shot on his farm in Blandville, WV. I remember filming the bear scene and how the bear \\"got away\\" for a few minutes -- quite exciting.A piece of trivia, David Nelson of Ozzie and Harriett fame, was a camera man on the film.I re-watch every year of so and always enjoy. Great family film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"This book is 100% build up and 0% resolution. They should have just put book 1 and 2 together as a hard cover because you cannot read one without the other. It's basically character developement and interaction. The plot slowly drags along. I'm glad to see that the DS9 series of books will build off each other essentially creating an \\"8th Season\\" of the show, but this \\"episode\\" doesn't really look that good. If you really like DS9 and feel that there are good and bad episodes but all of them are worth watching, you should probably read this. If you plan on reading Abyss: Section 31, you should also probably read this because they go in order. Look for my review on Book 2 once it arrives and I finish reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent new beginning for DS9","review":"I was one of those fans who was devestated that DS9 had to be over. Then when I saw this book, promising a bold new beginning for the series, I was skeptical. But the author, S.D. Perry, really did a good job. He starts with a timeline, laying out the events from the DS9 tv series' 7 years in just a few pages. Surprisingly, he summed it up pretty well. That prepares you for the book itself. It and it's sequel tell the story of the beginning of the future of DS9. It adds Ro Laren, a Next Generation character many fans like, but doesn't forget all the others you'd expect to be there. I won't go into the story itself, but suffice it to say that there are multiple plots, only some of which are resolved. They will be continued in the subsequent books. I highly recommend these two books to any Star Trek fan, let alone a DS9 fan. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set up for the new DS9 books","review":"I liked how this book tied into other DS9 books. Tiras Jast is from the N-Vector comic series (reprinted in the \\"Other Realities\\" collection availiable ...). Bashir reads Garak's (and Andrew Robinson's) DS9 novel A Stitch in Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !","review":"I'm not familiar with Karen's work since I've only read like a couple of them. But I really like how the main character find that there is other things in life than her violin and how she misinterprets everything in her life as a major disaster. It makes you think at the very end, if both Brie and Jorie found happiness or not at least the main character Brie (Sabrina) grew up and realizes that she needs to listen to the people around her and stop thinking too damn much ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery doesn't love company","review":"I worked my way through this book hoping the situations would finally resolve; at the end I just felt like it was all sexual situations and no romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I found it difficult to follow because the transitions between present time and flash back was very weak and often times not even available. I also prefer to see strong women portrayed--the main character left me frustrated most of the time. I have all of the other Kallmaker books and this one ranks at the very bottom of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Next Time","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The flash backs were easy to follow.I have lived through the pain of loosing a career that I loved and like Bree I made a mess of my person life. She had lost control over the one thing she always had contol over; all she needed was that one woman that could make the pain go away no matter what the cost. She had to pay for what she did by living with the guilt and so did I.As Far as Jorie goes most of us have had to deal with pain of wanting the unattainable girl.This story reminded me of a line from a Nikki Giovanni poem.Why did I give this story four stars instead of five? Because Wild Things still holds that place for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"She knows how to make you feel the depression","review":"Not up to Karen's usually style, but it did keep me interested with the story line. Karen knows how to make you feel dark and depressed, and that takes talent. The characters are well designed, built up with many flaws that we believe every writer should do. When she writes about the violin and the feelings, you believe there is almost something mystical about her feelings. Just received this book and three others, this one was the best of the three. Karen is usually a very good read, but something just wasn't up to pare with this effort, but I'll buy everything she writes anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun..","review":"This has numerous games on it geared toward the younger player.

Since my mom is building her dream house overlooking North Shore, Hawaii I thought she'd get a big kick out of it. Before I gave it to her, I brought it to my men's bible study and the guys passed it around all night - comparing it to New Testament scriptures in our 'regular' bibles. Aside from getting a good laugh from it, we all also noticed that it was actually very accurate, boiling down the scriptures message to it's literal roots before then 'translating' to Pidgin Hawaiian. Once you get used to the Pidgin English being used, you can actually understand it easier than most other bibles since any archaic referrences have been removed. What I also get from it is HEART - the heart of the Hawaiian people, and the heart of our Lord Jesus Christ. It's cute and funny, but it also captures the Spirit of Love perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance! No Grapes!

Katherine Roberts delivers exactly what she promises--a feeling of increased well-being and improved golf. She takes her students carefully through a series of increasingly difficult poses, explaining in detail both the poses themselves and their benefits to a golfer. Unlike some other yoga instructors, she does not assume that her students are human Gumbis. She constantly urges them to go slowly and work at their own pace. If they are not capable of attaining a pose to perfection, she counsels them to do as much as they can and to avoid strain. I particularly appreciate that her pace and her manner are reassuring and non-threatening. You feel that you are in the hands of a friendly and supportive mentor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing-at best","review":"Katherine Roberts seems like a nice, well-intentioned lady, genuinely interested in helping golfers. Her PAR, BIRDIE, and EAGLE level Yoga for Golfers tapes and DVDs are minimalist at best. There really is very little there. I would highly recommend Yoga for Inflexible People or Vinyasa Flow Yoga. These programs are filled with VASTLY more help,information, and instruction at less cost. Or, if you are really serious about helping yourself, look up a local Yoga instructor and have them guide you for a few dollars more."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP!

Put a very small amount on your fingertips, put your fingertips in your hair near the roots, and press down on the scalp while rubbing back and forth quickly over a very small area (like scrubbing). This adds lift at the roots which lasts a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula Has Been Changed - Saying Goodbye to Product After 12 Faithful Years","review":"As other recent reviews have unconfirmed, TIGI decided to change the formula for their Manipulator product, and unfortunately NOT for the better. The current pomade is inferior to previous formula, in that it's not only lost it's wonderful and clean fragrant, but the paste has been made more \\"soupy\\" and water-downed, thus leaving a greasy look when applied to hair, and requiring far more of an amount to actually style and hold one's hairstyle.After using this product exclusively for over 12 years, I've decided to move on.Hope you enjoy your cruise on the S.S.

Dan Swano wrote this entire record by himself in merely seven days, therefore this is somewhat different from the following Nightingale records.TBS is more gothic oriented with lots of keyboards. The second, third and fourth albums are more progressive. The drums are programmed (but they sound awesome!), the guitar work is impressive, the lyrics are depressive and Swano once again manages to impress me with his unique voice. Every instrument was played by Dan himself. Very good record. The follow-ups are even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cult Classic.. and not much else!

I bought the anthology because I am so looking forward to TNT's _Mists of Avalon_, because short stories in this universe by Bradley, Gabaldon and Roberson herself meant I was sure to enjoy it. What suprised and pleased me is that theirs are not the stories I most admired. \\"Black Dogs\\" by Lorelei Shannon gives the real reason that Arthur fell at Camlann. Mordred was only the instrument, according to his favorite dog, the narrator of this story. \\"Greivous Wounds\\" by Laura Resnick has Arthur dying regret-filled and going back into his past to see how much he really has changed the world. \\"The Mooncalfe\\" by David Farland has Merlin begetting a daughter on a scullery maid at Tintagel while Uther is with Igraine. Merlin's daughter gets revenge. These are my favorite stories in this collection, you may have others, it is well worth reading and buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but lacks the true magick of Avalon","review":"Out of Avalon was good but it gave the taste of something that could have been better. The tales that are featured in this book were interesting but some were down right boring. I had fallen asleep on The Castellan and thought Me and Gallahad could have been written by a fanfiction amateur. I was impressed however with the stories Avalonia and Finding the Grail, especially loved the line that stated men go out for treasures both rare and magickal but women are the ones that find it. Overall it is a reccomended read but still could have been done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yawn*","review":"I adore the Avalon series, but this book, quite frankly, sucked.

The authors tell of strange events that were witnessed and recorded on the ranch by NIDS team,yet fail to print any photographic evidence in the book.The shoddy investigation work that is detailed along with listing everyone as an alias and lack of photograpic evidence leads me to wonder if anything is really happening on the rance at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunt for the Skinwalker","review":"Although this book is well written, I disappointed with the final report ... it turned out to be much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"OK\\"","review":"I got this book for my Dad, who listens to Art Bell and \\"things that go bump in the night.\\" He said, \\"It was ok.\\" That's good enough for me.

I'm not saying that some strange things didn't happen, but the telling of this story is just that-- a story, meant to entertain, garner attention, and make money, and I'm sure they have succeeded at all three. Please, don't be so gullible people. It's ok to be a believer, but be smart and discerning about what you believe.

Zero character development, an odd plot line pompous writing style and and a dismally incomplete finish.The historical setting deserved the two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing, surreal tale..","review":"\\"Hawksmoor\\" by Peter Ackroyd was the first one I read by him, and I almost didn't want to read another. I can see from previous reviews that opinion was mixed. I did like what Ackroyd attempted: a story with an eighteenth century feel( The language in that part got on my nerves after a while) with an interesting antihero at the center. The premise that Nicolas Dyer, who designed churches, was a Satanist is both ironic and very original. That is one of the few strong points in the novel. The police detective who is investigating a series of murder is also interesting. Basically, he discovers that the killings are supernatural and echo Dyer's murders years before. The ending was what ruined the whole novel. What was the point of it? So Dyer and Hawksmoor are staring at each other through time, is in a mirror?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evocative foundation on historical London, but little else","review":"I have been trying to read this book, on and off, for nearly ten years. The time could have been put to better use.Ackroyd does an admirable job of evoking post-plague London in both sense-detail and in diction, style, and vagarities of spelling. But his modern London, and the detective who gives his name to the title, are flat, expressionless, and - worse yet - ring false. The detective portion of the novel is especially ineffective, and the police procedures depicted seem shallow and poorly researched. Above all else, the quest for evil, if there was one, was transparent to this reader.The chapters set in London-past are what drives the two stars in this review. Alas, better depictions of the historical city and its people can be found in any of Neil Gaiman's 'Sandman' graphic novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on my list","review":"I have read more than half of the books on David Pringle's list of the best 100 fantasy books (after working through most of his SciFi list). His suggestions include classics and hidden gems and, unfortunately, a few clunkers. Hawksmoor is one of the latter.Slow but evocative, the book moves back and forth from a time when cathedrals are being built by an architect possessed by an evil force to more contemporary times, where we see the shadow of that force's effect.It is a good concept and well written but very slow going. It can be difficult to build a reader relationship with characters when the scene keeps shifting and Ackroyd fails to surmount that challenge here.This is not a terrible book but it is ponderous without being either enlightening or entertaining. There are better books of fantasy and historical fiction to read. If you are not possessed of unlimited reading time, I might give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I have read some of the preceding reviews and I must say that the reviewer from Greece was pompous and insulting. I consider myself very well read in fiction and history and I came away from this book empty. Yes, the 18th century part was well written and evocative of that time and place, but I failed to understand the purpose of the whole. The sections in the 20th century were completely unbelievable. I twigged the business about evil, but it didn't mean anything to me. There was nothing new here. I have enjoyed Ackroyd's biographies but this stumped me. I also found the point of view to be extremely anti-intellectual. For a much better depiction of the stupidity of members of the Royal Society, read Longitude!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully packaged album masks Buckley's disdain for some of songs","review":"I was not particularly aware of Buckley until I heard \\"Hallellujah\\" on a TV show.

Hill papers, a collection of almost every business paper Hill ever handled that is located in the Hill Reference Library in St. Paul, MN. Except for Pyle, previous Hill biographers and railroad historians did not see those papers, such much of what they say is more rumor than fact.

But then to continually put her slave Murad's life in danger, stupid. If I was Murad I just would have quit, she was that annoying.

She is supposedly an expert on the time period she's been transported to, but if she is, this leaves me wondering what people call 'expert'. All Alexandra is good for is saying OHMYGOD and panting. Seriously, any crisis comes along, and it's PANT PANT OHMYGOD PANT.She has this attitude of waiting around for things to happen for her, and when she finally does take action, she does something so completely stupid and hare-brained it would have gotten anyone else killed at least fifteen times before the end of the book.Furthermore, Xavier, the hero, doesn't even think she's trustworthy. He'll certainly hop in the sack with her though. If there was a sequal, I'd guess he'd jump off a bridge because he couldn't stand her anymore. I certainly couldn't.Overall, I think the concept had potential, but Alexandra just ruined it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good read","review":"This book was enjoyable enough to keep your interest, but Alexandra's \\"ohmygods\\" do irritate sometimes. Alexandra falls in love with Xavier before she even meets him and gets to know his personality. Time travel books usually don't intrigue me, but this one was good. However, during a time of slavery in Tripoli, Alexandra did not use a whole lot of sense and did not think about possible consequences to some of her escapades. I was disappointed to find out Xavier continues to think she is a spy. I plan to read the sequel to find out if he changes his opinion and find out more about her handsome servant in the harem, Murad, and his descendent (possibly?), Joseph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This","review":"I was surprised how good this book was.

Both cables work perfectly after about a year of use.The two minor negative points that made me dock a star are:- tough plastic packaging that required a knife to open and wasn't marked as recyclable- slightly stiff, so it wants to keep its original coil shape and doesn't like to lie flat on the floor or follow walls nicely without some tacking in place. For a 50ft cable, you're sure to be running it SOMEwhere, so it ends up being one of those minor things that isn't really an issue but is just kind of annoying sometimes.Overall, though, given the price and overall build quality, I would definitely buy these again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this was a waste of my time and money","review":"How do I put a NO star rating??This book was about 3 autistic co-students \\"grown up\\".It gave me nothing new or even interesting about autism.Then half way thru the book, he goes on a multi-page rant against the evil Republicans, Bush and the 2004 election.

Unfortunately, this is only a small part of what this book attempts to do. The sample code does not conform to basic standards of good programming (in variable names, style, and clarity), making it difficult to read and grating on the nerves. Since Mr. Sphar attempts to teach by example, this is a critical shortcoming. In addition, when the discussion turns to the inner workings of C (I'm thinking here about the section on pointers and function arguments), Mr. Sphar spends too much time on technical minutia and too little on building intuition. The O'Riley _Practical Programming_ books do a better job of teaching C and C++, and I'm going to look for a better introduction to MFC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly laid out, many important points glossed over","review":"The problem with this book is shown in the attitude of Andrew the reviewer that gave it five stars. He says C++ is hard. It is not hard, it is complex. This book glosses over important points like constructors and then wings off in a totally different direction to explain there is an error in the compiler and how to correct it by changing ZI to Zi. He doesn't explain how we would normally do something, but rather jumps right to the 'advanced' way to do something, I assume in an effort to dazzle us with his ability.

As a beginner with only Basic Pascal programming knowledge behind me I could not understand what Mr. Chuck Sphar was trying to say- he spent the first 18 pages discussing HOW TO USE HELP within the MFC environment.

You'll find Hitch's unique sense of humor well intergrated with the suspense in this terrific film about espinoge at the onset of WWI. A recluctant spy is recruited to kill an enemy spy. He is given a false name and a fake wife to keep up appearances. He goes after the target, but does he have the right man? Could there be another who is the real culprit? And what a cast.. John Gielgud stars with Madeline Carroll,Robert Young and Peter Lorre as his very strange accomplice.Other notables to look for include Lilli Palmer and Michael Redgrave.Where's Hitch.....alas, no appearance by Sir Alfred here.A nice VHS copy by Front Row Entertainment of this aging film. It may be purchased as a single or as part of the Alfred Hitchcock 4-PK, which also includes \\"The Lady Vanishes\\", \\"Thirty Nine Steps\\" and \\"The Man Who Knew too Much\\"(the original).

Because of this, it took away all excitement for the following matches, including Rock/Cena (which is still a great match with a surprise ending). The other matches worth watching are Orton/Kane and Jericho/Punk. Orton/Kane needed more time, but I personally think it was a good match with a pretty good ending. Jericho/Punk has a good build up and a good delivery - not disappointed, but not overly impressed. Fortunately there are not matches like Lawler/Cole or Bret Hart/Vince McMahon - nothing is a complete waste of time, however the first match (Bryan/Sheamus) is really short.Overall, this is a very good WM.

Now alone there is nothing interesting about that however, thereis a catch. In Gen 5:24 it states Enoch walked with God. One day Enoch could bot be found, because God took him. The book of Enoch goes on and tells what happened to Enoch. Now no better author could have been than Enoch himself tranformed into Spirit form. There is only one other prophet of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Isreal who did not die, and that is Elijah. Many do not believe that this should be added to the bible as the books of the apocrypha.

Ryan's writing style is mundane if not amateurish (\\"he was reduced to urine-filled pants\\") and the plot is unexciting, dividing its attention between standard Old World vampire tropes and contemporary Anne Ricean chi-chi vampirism. The members of the Securitate (the Romanian secret police) turn out to be either garden-variety anonymous stormtroopers or garden-variety vampires. Adam Chase, our hero, is a poor duplication of Dirk Pitt, with a magic walking stick. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hohner Special 20 Harmonica","review":"This is a great harp.

STan recounts how he was sent to a \\"one eyed battalion\\" at Fort Bragg during WWII, and eventually made it into ASTP at The University of Maine, while Jan became an aircraft riveter during the War. After VE Day, the couple married, raised a family and became illustrators. In 1962, they published their first childrens book, and the rest is history.

Murphy does not get bogged down in great details but simply tells the story from the perspective of a handful of individuals. Along with this, the author provides numerous illistrations and maps detailing the progress of the fire from its origin at O'Leary's barn. The writing is smooth and gives urgency to read just a few more pages. This is the best type of writing to urge younger people to read.This is a great little book for readers of all ages. The author focuses on the young adult as an audience, but his writing style is better than most other authors vying for a more sophisticated reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"enhance children's confidence","review":"great, although my baby is little, she enjoys listening to it while she's playing, I put it every day and she doesn't mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favourite course material.","review":"The authors seem to believe that dumbed down language and bad grammar will be more palatable for some readers. That may be true for some, but in my opinion, it makes it an irritating and difficult read. The perspective is very narrow, and there isn't very much real thought provoking discussion. What I also find off putting is that the authors seem to \\"walk\\" the reader through a situation, telling you what you would do or think. The authors meander aimlessly around the point before finally getting to it, making it pretty difficult to follow. This book reads like a rambling child who thinks very highly of his own intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reviewer","review":"A decent general overview of its subfield, but not exactly well written.

Example: To solve one mystery, Henry had to know not only an Edgar Allen Poe poem (not \\"The Raven\\"), but also the names of the stars in the constellation Perseus -- along with the meaning and derivation of the names.

I compared this translation with several I have at home and was surprise with the quality and how the translator used poetry conveying in a precise manner the meaning of the Gita.Some people complained in other reviews that the \\"translation cannot be a good one since the translator is not a religious person himself\\" (how do they know? just because he is not a HareKrishna or other religious group member?). Another reader accused him of trying to make an easy buck with this translation (Have you ever tried to translate the Gita in a poem form? Do you have any idea of the amount of work involved?) I really don't care about it.This book is a good translation and a good poem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent audio edition","review":"I found the audio edition of this book with a sensitive reading by Stephen Mitchell to be an excellent companion for listening while driving. It is hard to believe you can find inspiration in the midst of a traffic jam but with the tape version of this book it is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritual Book, Not just poetry","review":"If Miller rates this book behind the Tao Te Ching and others as \\"a distant third\\" in spirituality, then he misses the whole point of the Gita. Houston Smith accurately called this a wonder poetic version. Note, he left out any commentary on the real essence of the work--it is a spiritual work. It is far more than just poetry. I still think the best edition of the \\"Gita,\\" and I have seen many, is Edgerton's, from long ago--it is the most faithful to the spiritual teachings of the \\"Gita.\\" If you want good poetry, then this is perhaps better, but not as faithful to the true meaning of the Gita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Miller's translation of the Gita suggests that he simply didn't \\"get it\\". After reading it, I felt that this was a quick cover of the depth and the profundity of the Gita. I also felt that his translation was simply unecessary and unworthy of this spiritual work which must be read devotionally to be truly understood. This rather poor cover of the Gita is similar to his treatment of the Tao Te' Ching, which should only be modified with the highest reverence and sense of submission to it's original intent. Why do what Miller has done when you have scholarly and spiritual works like Edgartons. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disservice to humanity","review":"Although Mitchell has writing talent, he obviously hasn't taken the teachings of the Gita to heart. The Gita must be understood from one who understands its truths, who lives his life by its truths. Mitchell may be able to write nice poetry based on the Gita, but without the devotional attitude Lord Krishna recommends, his poetry is a disservice to humanity and useless gibberish. Though pleasant to read, it is ultimately misleading. For a much better introduction to the Gita, try Carl Woodham's Bhagavad-gita, The Song Divine. Written by one who has practiced the principles of the Gita for over 35 years, its spiritual truths shine through."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Speculations on Bhagavad Gita","review":"This one is a total waste of time and money. He is on the same track as Capra in twisting interpretations to what he agrees with and what he wants it to be, not what it is.

Not recommended like at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction to the Gita","review":"Over the years I have tried to read the Bhagvad Gita in English, but did not find any good translations that held my interest. While I knew the story, and the underlying philosophy of the book, I often found it a bit disconcerting that I could completely comprehend the sanksrit stanzas.Mitchell has taken some liberties with this great epic poem, but the end result is a beautiful rendition of the Gita, and I have read and re-read many of the chapters repeatedly marvelling at the clarity and simplicity of Mitchell's rendition of this great epic.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who want to know more about the Gita and its underlyng philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Introduction to Indic Thought","review":"After having read this three times I can say that Stephen Mitchell provides the reader with a wonderful introduction to Indic thought. Some poetic license is taken in the translation, and some verses seem to be more fabrication than translation, but overall this is a great place to start. The book might be rather simplistic for the more well versed reader, but the beginner will find it rather useful. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"this play sucks","review":"talk about boring and pretentious! but then, i could be describing any one of this guy's plays.... they're all the same. linney doesn't know how to craft an argument... his characters are cardboard and lack motivation."},{"rating":"1","title":"hammer to the head","review":"linney hits a single note (over and over) with his position that god is a cruel host who sets up his party of life with one goal in mind: to make people suffer. a priest is torn between his love for god on the one side and his lust on the other. an unbearable predicament, the priest eventually falls into violent action, action for which linney would have us believe there is no alternative. if you are like me and don't believe in playing the victim, if you believe in taking responsibility for yourself, and if you can think of better things to do with your time and spirit than blame god for everything, then you will find this play slightly infuriating--and no matter what your personal outlook, you are sure to find it boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dimmer was a bright purchase!","review":"Ordered this dimmer to replace one that quit working in a living room floor lamp I purchased several years ago.

It is very easy to attach and comes with foam inserts to angle the mirror to see your baby. The problem is that it is so thin that when you secure it or angle it, it bends and you get a distorted view of the baby. I can make out my baby's face but cannot tell what he is doing and if his head is secure in his car seat. We have also found that to get it at the proper angle, it isn't secured on the seat back very well and moves easily, so half the time we are looking at our baby's feet.

It is ULTRA distorted and all but impossible to position. I thought it was just me until I read this page (bought locally).

It's a mirror, not a rocket ship!"},{"rating":"1","title":"aside from the fact that the mirror sucks,","review":"This thing comes with one of those big clear stickers on it that leaves an awful residue on the mirror. It's really hard to get off and left the mirror looking kind of smudged. Add that to the fact that the mirror is warped/bent right out of the box, and this product definitely gets one star at best.

Really a book for the professional, not the amateur. I love math, as explained in a college textbook, but this book was a bit too Poincaire-brief and condensed for me.

Of course, once you are a master, then less is more.I did give it away to a professional mathematician, who liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bathory's Viking Metal","review":"Quorthon invented viking metal and this his second to last album in that style. Not really anti religous, but as his job he was toying witb the audience. This established Bathory as legitimate and was regarded the most by the critics for his neo classical approach to it and it his very heavy and exotic at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A fairly poor album. Quorthon's guitar is noticeably (and painfully) out of tune in several acoustic passages, and his attempts at clean vocals (as opposed to the harsh guttural vocals of earlier albums) are almost laughable; he is almost unable to carry a tune. The songs are rather monotonous musically, though the lyrics are interesting. The last track (with music from Gustav Holst's \\"The Planets\\") is not a very good blending of metal and classical (if you like that mix, listen to Therion). Overall, this was a disappointment after being introduced to Bathory with \\"Under the Sign of the Black Mark\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"BATHORY","review":"This is my first Bathory cd, and not the last. It's a very heavy album, nice acoustic solo's, that of which Eric Clapton or Santana would be proud of. Nicely done drum set up(someone knows how to play evedently, some drummers in this genre only pound their double bass drums and symbols w/out any rythem, except Nick Barker'Cradle of Filth,Dimmu Borgir,Old Man's Child). Only problem I had with this cd, is that the first three tracks are all compiled onto the first track, and Hammerheart splits into track 5 and 6, 6 being 23 seconds long. Not a problem, if I'm going to listen to this cd, it's either the whole thing through, or Hammerheart(superb song, with nice orchestral backing). If you are any type of fan of Bathory, this is a must for any fan. If you are just getting into them I would recommend this as well, I've heard pretty much all Bathory, but this is my first purchased cd. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Newborns","review":"I used this when my baby was a newborn. It worked great.

Sound is excellent, so is ease of use. I have been moving my pile of old LPs into digital form much faster now I have this. It looks good too. I am very, very pleased with it.I particularly like that it has a setting that does not need a phono input on my amplifier - I could (but don't) feed it directly into my PC.I have only two minor peeves (reason for only four stars).1. The turntable does not automatically stop and lift the tone arm at the end of the record. I wish it did for my own sake, though I know some people don't like such a feature, so maybe this is a matter of taste.2. The supplied software is a big plus, and I use it a lot for converting wavs to mp3s, but I found it easier to use my old software (Polderbits) to do recording and splitting of tracks. Again, this may be just a matter of me not investing time in learning the interface.Very much recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for DJs","review":"I'm a DJ who's going prime time and looking to upgrade my equipment but save a few bucks too. So I bought this turntable because it was close to the standard Technics. Obviously not close enough. I connected the Audio-Technica to my system and started to spin, cut, scratch and back-spin. After 2 minutes I unhooked the turntable, repacked it and shipped it back to Amazon for a refund. The needle weight was off or something because the cartridge scraped into my record. The torque was slow and weak on cuts and spinbacks. The turntable handled like a car without power steering.

This book deviates from Fern Michaels' usual happy style. Romance novels usually provide entertainment and joy. NOT THIS TIME.

Actually, it is a priceless book for a child to have, it would be completely magical. However, for adults, it is still an amazing book, one that you can proudly keep on your table top to show off to guests.

Katya, the main character, was far too whiny, and she never did become likeable. Alex Sheridan, the knight in shining armor, was so over-the-top chivalrous/sucker for a damsel in distress it made me want to puke. The ending (before the utterly predictable part) was one of the most ridiculous and contrived things I've ever read.

Some seem to have issues with the sheath, but I like it and believe I prefer it to leather as some have suggested.For some small flowers I still, however find I prefer my garden scissors for deadheading and of course for heavy duty pruning it is not going to be your tool of choice, but for general maintenance I find its all I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I returned this tool.

The fact that the little old woman is an alcoholic is not amusing or charming, though the author thinks it is.The plot is contrived to introduce the whole crossword puzzle theme to the series and to introduce all the characters to us.

The premise sounded good, but a few chapters into the book I wasn't hooked. I read all the way to the half way point of the book and just couldn't finish it.There were pages where nothing happened. But the most annoying part to me was how the author keeps referring to the main character and other characters by their entire names throughout the book (well, as much of it as I read) I think an introduction of the characters full names once is enough. I don't need to read how 'Cora Felton' did this and 'Cora Felton' did that. I think that is what turned me off the most. Every time I would read an entire name, I would mentally roll my eyes. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I love crossword puzzles and I love books, so when I saw this book I knew it was for me. What a disappointment! The characters were weak and their conversations went on and on without much being said. Cora, who is know as the puzzle lady, is a drunk and knows nothing about puzzles. I only finished the book because I truly wanted it to get better - it didn't.

I must say that it's worth you're time and money if you're a stooge fan. Moe ' Larry, and Curly-Joe do a really good job for their final completed movie. Larry Fine would have a stroke on the set of 'Kooks Tour'. Emil Sitka was going to replace Larry but their movie contract fell through the roof and Sitka never got to work as one of the Stooges. Thanks for all the great work you've done for over 30 years guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warm-hearted family story","review":"Anyone who's ever had to name a pet will appreciate the predicament that this family is going through when they adopt a stray kitty. Everyone, from family members to classmates, offers suggestions: Kabuki, Nimbus and Fish Breath among them. But no one can agree on which name is just right for the black and white feline. As the family goes through name after name, the cat assimilates into the family's daily life. His curiosity gets him into some hot water, but his luck gets him out unscathed.By the end of the story, when he falls out a window and luckily manages to land safely on his feet, a name chooses the cat. (And I bet you can guess what it is!) Pringle, a prolific writer of science and nature books for children, wrote this warm story after his family adopted a stray cat (whom they named Willow.) Potter's colorful pastel drawings are equally warm-hearted. Her playful illustrations of the cat \\"trying on\\" each of the names will please young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bathroom Reader of Catholic Enclyopedias","review":"This is a lovely book of Catholic Factoids - a perfect bathroom reader filled with stories of Saints and Catholic tradition.It is comical, respectful and yet unoffensive guide for anyone interested in the traditions of the Catholic Religion.The only thing missing in this book is the Catholic Guilt..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antidepressant","review":"Suffice to say, this was the 5th (fifth) copy I bought.

Buy it, maybe my sense of humor is rusty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misled by First Things Review","review":"I bought this book having been influenced by the brief review of it in First Things, a review that I took to suggest that the humor of the book was in some sense akin to Chesterton's. Chesterton's humor, of course, is both very funny, but also, and even more, the bloom of brilliant insight. I just don't find this book insightful. While some will find the \\"frequently sophomoric\\" (First Things' word) humor of \\"The Bad Catholic's Guide to Good Living\\" to be amusing, I really don't. This book is not a pint of Chestertonian ale; it's more like a 7-11 Big Gulp of syrupy soda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tore pages","review":"Admittedly, this is the straw that broke....(you know the rest) but I am soooo tired of the rabble that passes for Catholics today I cannot tell you. I hate this book (I don't care what you think) I began tearing some pages after the author thought that a good evening with belly dancers would be a good idea for the man about to give his life to Christ as a priest. Get over yourself Christopher West types. The entire book stinks but I didn't start tearing pages until I came to the garbage above. Unfortunately, I know a priest who would think that this would be a good idea.... He is one of those the Pope goes around apologizing for."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Teng Dynasty Stumbles....","review":"There's nothing particularly wrong with Vienna Teng's third album, but that's not to say that there's anything special about it either. What made here an instant hit, in my mind, is what she has abandoned to produce this sleek release: her scaled-down, straightforward, home-made style of music that managed to tug at your heartstrings.\\"Dreaming Through The Noise\\" is well-produced, melodic and full of wonderful guest musicians who take up quite a bit of the total content of the CD. Vienna's magic lies in her extraordinary voice and honest lyrics. She is ironically surrounded by too much Noise in this album for her true gifts to come forward, and she ends up coming across like any number of other singers out there: catchy and unobtrusive but ultimately bland.No disrespect is meant to her in this, as she is a brilliant singer with a great story, but my feeling is that this release isn't her best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Improving","review":"I have been a fan of Vienna's for a very long time. I have all three of her albums, and have to say, you won't find a more haunting voice, nor will you find music that can reach your soul so deeply. The single most amazing performer currently working. If you get a chance to see her live, you will become a devotee as much as I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing on CD and Live!","review":"I recently had the privilege of experiencing Vienna Teng Live (April 27, 2007 in Moundridge Kansas). I've been a huge fan ever since I saw her on Letterman.At the concert, even though not in the best of venues, Vienna was incredible. She didn't have impressive sound equipment, just a mic and a synthesizer. Her vocals were great and piano playing skills superb.I realize I only had a small taste of her personality by conversing with her a few brief minutes after the concert, yet she seems very genuine and humble.I highly recommend all three of her CDs but DEFINITELY GO SEE HER IN CONCERT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stole the attention away from Madeline Peyroux","review":"I went to Madeleine Peyroux concert two years ago, and Vienna was opening for Madeleine Peyroux. I have never heard about her before that. She completely captivated the audience. This was the first time I saw a performance that was as good (if not better) as the recording. She was perfect; I am sure I wasn't the only one who had goosebumps. So when Madeleine Peyroux appeared with her new album, I had to leave not to spoil the mood.I do prefer this her album over the previous two ones because she sounds more original on \\"Dreaming through the noise\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!!","review":"fast shipping, item arrived in great condition and is excellent quality!! would buy again from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, decent material, but uncomfortable.","review":"The elastic on these is a bit tight for their size, although not quite so bad that it along makes them uncomfortable. The issue is the label that is stitched in the back. The stitchings are extremely aggressive and rub against my backside when walking, making for quite an uncomfortable feeling. It reminds me of wearing clothes where the tags are not fully removed. I'd cut the label off, but I'm not convinced that would solve the problem since it is the stitching itself and not the label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intimo Silk Boxers","review":"Boxers are packaged nicely; however, the solid blue pair has a slit in the side seam where they were never stitched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for ball obessed dog","review":"Purchased this for my ball/toy obsessed Border Collie.

Our OLD balls have held up well, considering the abuse they get. I ordered a new ball to replace the worst ball. The NEW ball lasted less than an hour. Another of my dogs, a 10-yr old Doberman, chewed out the squeaker too quickly for me to even notice what she was doing until it was too late. The seller was unsympathetic.

The old balls are tough as leather but the new balls are just soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless - a large ball with no squeak","review":"Suitable for a large dog to grab, but the squeak mechanism is useless.

I would expect a \\"historical\\" book to stick to the history better than this one. It is undoubtedly good for people who used to learn history from movies like \\"Haunt for the Red October\\" or \\"Enigma\\" and so like.

Most of my collection are places I \\"vicariously\\" visit through the guides ...places I hope to go but have no immediate plans to visit.This guide, however, is a place I am familiar with ... the Pacific Northwest. I have family there and have lived there myself for a short time. It is an area of the U.S. abundent with diverse places to visit and explore, and also some areas that can be pretty boring. Even a U.S. citizen who is fairly familiar with the Pacific Northwest can benefit from a guide to some of the less touristy places.As are all Fodor's guides, this volume is beautifully illustrated with color photos and contains a wealth of information. This is a \\"must have\\" for anyone living in or planning to visit the Pacific Northwest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me want to visit additional places","review":"This is a very attractive book with lots of full color pictures - I found myself wanting to add more towns to my itinerary as I browsed through it. The few areas that I am familiar with had good recommendations so I would trust the rest. I did think that the maps could be improved. Also I'd appreciate a little more coverage of different neighborhoods in the larger cities. Even the neighborhoods that were mentioned were not necessarily shown on their maps. Perhaps I'd need a city guide for that level of detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"My back yard","review":"Being a Portland resident for 17 years, this book was tempting just to see if they had any howlers. I'm happy to say that it's really an excellent guide - trust the recommendations. I guess that after a while, we get to take the great stuff around here for granted, but if you're planning on a trip out this way, I doubt you could find a better general purpose guide.

And McMinnville is in wine country, so you'll have a good excuse ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine.","review":"We are planning a road trip through the Pacific Northwest this summer, so I was excited to see this book come up on my options for reviewing. However, the attractions/sights information offers no more (if not less) than one might find in the AAA guide that comes free with membership.

Individually they are somewhat fun, but of the three I bought, and a fourth set a friend gave me, ALL 4 TRACKS ARE DIFFERENT. That means that I bought 4 sets with the intention of connecting them together, as the boxes imply, and basically they are stand alone toys. Some of the trains wont even move on other tracks. Also, some of the trains don't fit in the Thomas case I bought. Its hard enough keeping toys organized with toddlers, and this incompatibility makes playing with these toys frustrating. Read the labels carefully. Even though the box mentions adapters, 3 out of 4 of my kits are completely incompatible.

It repeats much information, right down to the images, found in other fence books. Hmmm. But what's most frustrating about this book is the copious inclusions of photographs of fences and gates for which there are no designs. I'm not talking about exact designs, but rather guidelines for building the particular kind of fence; for instance, how to have the vertical pickets enclosed within lower and upper horizontal rails. No ideas provided. I actually called the publisher and asked, and got a run-around but no real answers except that because those photos are from private properties, they can't help. So why include them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that helpful","review":"Bought this book to help with the design and installation of a fence and gate across the front of my house.

It is a good book for anyone who likes Elvis Presley and is curious about his movies. It is a good starter book for an Elvis Presley fan. However, it does not go very in-depth on any issue or any movie, and the photos in the book look like they were mostly publicity stills and other items that were relatively easy to get. Considering all of the movies and actors and actresses and directors that Elvis Presley worked with, a book about his movies should be pretty thick, and feature dozens of interviews with people that he worked with."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's cooking, it's steaming, it's makes you shake your...","review":"Two of the worlds finest things come from Colombia: coffee (the best in the world) and this record. Lisandro Meza is a world champion on the accordeon (what we call a 'belly piano') and he shows it on every track on this record. Heavily influenced by African rhythms, spiced up with a beefy horn section, this music is made to DANCE to. Shake your hips and try to keep the rest still, like the Colombians do. A true melting pot of music, this is a recording that makes a family get together into a party that will be hard to top. Anybody with only the slightest interest in Latino music should own this one.

I loved Shel Silverstein as a child and I am excited that my son has discovered him already. I read this book aloud to my son's preschool class, and they laughed out loud! What better review is there than from a class full of 5-year-olds? The only reason I have given it 4 stars versus 5 is that it discusses the rhinoceros opening your uncle's beer can, and your mother hitting you. Luckily my son does not read yet, so in our version of the story the rhinoceros opens a CAN, and he keeps your mother from GETTING you. The rhinoceros appears peering out of a toilet, which anyone who knows a 5-year-old is aware, is pretty darn funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not appropriate for children","review":"I checked this book out at the library for my 3 1/2 year old. Then we read it - MISTAKE! I should have read it alone first. It mentions the Rhino opening \\"beer cans for your uncle\\", helping you get extra money from your father, standing between you and your mother when she is about to discipline you... then it says \\"he is good for yelling at\\" - aren't these nice lessons to teach your children? I don't think so! I couldn't give it less than 1 star or I would have. Mr. Silverstein should have been more responsible when writing for small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't appreciate page with mother hitting child","review":"usually love Silverstein books, and most of this page is very inventive and cute, but the page that says \\"and he is great for not letting your mother hit you when you haven't really done anything bad\\" insinuates that it is actually acceptable for a parent to hit a child - which I totally disagree with and will return this book for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing from a great author","review":"This looks like another great Silverstein book saved from the obscurity of being first copyrighted in 1964, but perhaps it should have stayed there, as one particular page ruins the whole book.

This is little more than an ill-concieved romance novel. The style is so dependent on purple, lush descriptive passages. King is at best, a meagerly competent writer with an extravagant royal obsession. His analysis and observations are superficial.

My cool looking knives were rusting after one washing. Now I take care to immediately hand wash and dry the knives after each use. It seems a shame that the knives are called stainless. If they had been called rustable knives, I would not have bought them. Otherwise, they are good knives.

I only hand wash them and I dry them right after they're washed. They seem to be decently sharp out of the box but nothing to rave about. I've noticed that many of these knives are rusting. This comes a surprise to me as they are supposedly STAINLESS. I've come to learn this is a problem with many cheap knife sets. I guess you get what you payed for. I would avoid these knives.

They have been the a pain though, they are pretty bad at holding an edge but you get what you pay for. I use an accusharp sharpener on them often and it definitely helps. They'll cut but after about 3 years now they are literally falling apart. The plastic that holds the blade in the handle has cracked and broken on several rendering them useless and too dangerous to keep around. Guess its time to invest in some new ones, but I won't be buying more farberware ones. I fish often, and cook quite a bit so I have ended buying several decent quality fillet knives so have learned a little about what makes a good knife and what brands are best.

One would think after spending over $50 for a set of knives that you would be getting some good quality stuff. Not the case here. YES the knives are sharp... and the steak knives do cut a steak... but it just pisses me off that my steak knives started rusting ONE WEEK after I bought the set. If you think you might be putting these in the dishwater or let them soak a little bit in the sink, don't buy these knives. With the rust that started showing up after a week I would be surprised if they would be in use in any household after a year.

They are fine for the person who doesn't need the greatest knives to get the job done or for someone who does as little cooking as possible. The wood block is of poor quality. I ordered 2 of these sets and sent them both back because of major flaws in the block. One had a very visible crack all the way up the back and the other was not put together well. Parts were not glued on straight and the black stain was missing in a few spots. The knives and block are made in China so I guess you get what you pay for. After sending this back I treated myself to a 10 piece set of Sabatier Grand Chef knives and also ordered the Sabatier Grand Chef steak knives. Sabatier also has some cheaper lines made in China, but due to my experience with the Farberware knives I opted for Sabatier's higher end line made in France."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!!","review":"These knives are junk!I have had 2 break off at the handle.

While this Cd does contain many songs that are not on most standard karaoke cds, the majority of them sound like midis, not well orchestrated karaoke songs. For the money I spent on this, I expected A LOT more. If there had been samples to listen to before I bought it, I would not have wasted my money. If you really like Les Miserables and want great karaoke versions of your favorite songs, this is not the disc to get. The only reason I even gave it two stars was for the fact that it had so many songs on it.As a side note, when I received this Cd, one of the cds was missing out of the box, so I ended up having to exchange it.A very disappointing purchase. I recommend getting a karaoke disc with fewer songs but much higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it were possible to give 0 stars, I would.","review":"Let's start with the music quality. There is none. Once again, the Stage Stars Modus Operandi is to use music that is at least a decade old midi technology; this is absolutely inexcusable in an era when a company can buy music samples from philharmonic orchestras. Secondarily, the tempo on many of the songs is too fast. Third, and again, a major bone of contention, is if a KARAOKE company is going to take the time to produce a song with a counterpoint lyric duet, then to not include counterpoint lyric encoding is totally unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste a cent...","review":"I'm a huge royal watcher, big royal collector so when I heard there was a fanfiction book I jumped right on it.

Builds a decent foundation of emotion in both characters, although I feel this could've built to a more riveting and more fleshed-out conclusion at the end. I highly recommend Taboo (undoubtedly her best book) if you prefer more highly charged emotion/dialgoue and an incredibly intriguing historical background that only adds to the intensity.

The story line was predictable, the diaglogue was stilted and unbelievable, and the love scenes were tepid, the author must have thought throwing in four letter profanity would heat it up but it did not help this lifeless storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Susan Johnson book!!","review":"Although not quite as steamy as other Johnson books - for me this was still a very good romantic read. I like Isebella and Dermott as a couple - thought the chemistry was good. Always love the hero to have a tortured past and loosing your wife and son certainly make Dermott that kind of brooding rouge. I think the only thing missing was some of the steaminess we come to look for in Johnson books! I would totally recommend this novel!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychologically disturbing","review":"A perusal of other reviews with a 1-star rating pretty shows that my opinions are widely shared.But I have one thing to add. The so-called hero ridicules and insults one of his servants. This passage does nothing to advance the plot nor does it have anything to do with the storyline. What does the author believe this passage accomplishes other than to make us revile Dermott Ramsy even more?Does the author herself believe it is permissible to behave in this manner? It makes one wonder......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry","review":"Dry best describes this one from Susan Johnson. It's not often I pick up a book and I'm not able to immediately gain a sympathetic insight into the characters and their plights. Like a good soap opera, I expected to ride the tides of trials and tribulation along with the main characters. That didn't happen here. In the end Isabella (or whatever her name is) comes off as a ..... waiting to happen. Dermott is first displayed as a man of depth, but in the end he's wooed by a piece of #$#@$...that has nothing special about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money & your time!","review":"One dimensional characters, ho-hum sex scenes, and a formulaic plot, all adds up to a GIANT waste of time. In contrast, the NOTES section at the back of the book are more well written and interesting than the novel they footnote. It is fairly obvious, that Susan has written this book under duress of \\"Breach of Contract\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"first time","review":"I agree with almost all the reviewers in the fact that Temporary Mistress is big fat flop. Isabella Leslie is a dimwit I mean if she is a person of brains couldn't she think of another way of saving herself from her scrubulous relatives in order to keep her new fortune, other than becoming a mistress? Second, Dermott Ramsay I understand why he was such a rake, but I do not buy his I have to have her, the heroine, and yet sleep with every woman except for her. Even after he let her go he still continued to sleep with other women. That is not a knigt in shining armour but a lusting brute. Then after Dermott told her to take a hike and took his time she let herself fall to his feet like pudding. What a disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"I've read some bad stories in my time and this one rates as one of the worse. The love-making is as sexy as a bucket of cold sick. Neither of the main characters are very pleasant. Dermott is a ho. There is nothing worse than reading about a hero who sleeps with other women despite supposedly involved with the heroine. And as for Isabella, her behaviour as a virgin beggars belief. I would avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I have read much better and worthy works of Susan Johnson and this must be one of the worst. The story was so flat and ridiculous. There was little character-building and the plot was too predictable. I find it hard to like and respect the lovers, well, we needed more convincing that they were in love because all we read was their lust towards each other. And talk about lust, even Susan Johnson's trademark erotic sex scenes were lousy and sloppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable and poor","review":"Poor is the only appropriate word I can come up with for this book. Most romances require that we suspend our disbelief to a certain extent, but some part of the story has to hang together or we can't do that. The characterization in this book is completely incredible and unbelievable to me -- the actions and personality descriptions of the main characters do not match. Some of the historical details may be accurate but not the aggregate or the overall picture. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that I did read it all the way through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've read several Susan Johnson books, some of which I enjoyed and some of which I did not. This book definitely falls into the latter category. The plot was strained and unbelievable, the dialogue poor and neither the hero nor the heroine were sympathetic. Save your money.

It took me three days to complete unlike others which i couldn't wait to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This book is often intriguing, with strong characters, but it veered into the crass rather than the romantic. The relationship was more about sex than love. Dermott was really bad to her, hurting her deeply. Isabella is just as sex-driven. Implausibilities abound, and terms and sayings are just too modern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Memories","review":"I spent the summer abroad and this brings back all of the crazy nights I had on the coast of Spain in Almunecar.

Ms. Fernando seems to have spent a great deal of time filling up her pages with tangential nonsense rather than exploring the heart of the matter. Alchemy is a fascinating subject which is entirely capable of filling modest libraries with its centuries old wisdom. This book only gleams the surface and makes inadequate simplifications. Various mystics throughout history are given brief bios generally ending in \\"and he was an alchemist.\\" Several of these are incorrect (i.e. Maimonides) and seem to have been inserted to gather historical support. Alchemy's history is rich and doesn't need this infantile form of scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"buggy ftp service","review":"Manual is still in Chinese, though an English translation was attempted.Cavalry did not even go as far as 'branding' this product.

I usually don't like to throw words like 'genius' and 'masterpiece' around, but, I'm beginning to wonder about Jan's vision and construction of this film. The more I see this work, the less fault I can find with it. It's a brilliant venture into surreality with the classic story of Faust set as the dreamy backdrop, the outline to a strange nightmare that is as much humorous and odd as it is eerie and frightening. I highly recommend this film to any fan of the surreal... if you like Lynch's stuff for example, you should enjoy this. It's one of those movies that keeps you flashing back to it the day after."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure poetry","review":"This is such a wonderfully imaginative blending of various Faust stories, a kind of commentary on Faust as cultural icon. Amazing that such a thing could appear in the late Twentieth Century when few could reference all the references, when even the Faust phenomenon is fading. The use of puppets and stop-motion--the imagery overall-- is exceptional. This is Svankmajer's \\"Late Quartets\\" or \\"Missa Solemnis\\"--a grand uncompromising statement by a great artist. Recommended to those who have the patience, maturity, and good fortune to be able to appreciate such complex and demanding works of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I like animation and the Bros. Quay as much as the next guy, but when I saw this in the theater I found it overly long, self-indulgant, and the dubbed voices obnoxious.

Consider that this guy is now a sacred cow and reviewer-proof before you buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse movie ever","review":"I watch a hour of this movie before cutting my losses and speed watching til the end.... thank goodness I didn't waste my time watching the entire movie! I saw all the good ratings for this movie and figured someone should sound the warning not to waste your time... you can watch this movie without sound as it is almost entirely visual... there is some minor dialog, but it's all nonsense (trying to pose as intellectual philosophy)... really, don't waste your time...

This movie sucked and you should not waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual madness","review":"Jan Svankmajer's delirious take on Goethe, and Marlowe's Dr. Faustus. A visual attack of absurd situations, fusing live action with stop motion/puppet animation. Faust was the tale of a man who sold his soul to Satan's lieutenant, Mephistopheles. The naive doctor was promised a lifetime of alchemical powers and esoteric knowledge. This film showcases a modern day scenario of one man's struggle against the banality of our existence, and the lengths he will go to transcend it. It is the focus of one man's decision, and the consequence he must face for his foolish choice. Abstract, sinister, philosophical, and darkly humorous. Another classic from the master Czech surrealist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power Cord review","review":"The cord would not fit my Braun model 5612. I had to return it.

Since they both agree on the principle of desert (that justice consists ingiving peoole what thye deserve), they have a common starting assumption.

Pojman makes a good case for the deterrent effect of the death penalty.Awell argued book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing arguments","review":"I'm dissapointed at the arguments brougt forward by the philosopher in favor for the death penalty, Pojman. Even if you ignore the content of his arguments, the logic on which the argument was built didn't hold much water. Even though I'm myself against the dead penalty, I have seen others make a better and more coherent case for it. Pojmans last argument, that people that are against the dead penalty and pro choice are somehow immoral, is gratuitous and has nothing to do with an argument for the dead penalty.

I am in a big leap of faith period myself and I found Robin's stories inspiring. Or rather..I chose to be inspired by them. Robin has a good sense of humor and the book moves along in a lively, spirited fashion.That being said, the book is really quite flat. Most of the wisdom is not original to Robin. Most of it is very obvious stuff: Be persistent, plan ahead, take risks, and so on. The book is basically Robin's life story, and it reads a lot like a VH1 behind the music special.I think musicians would enjoy this book.

It's nice seeing the beater used car challenges done with cars I've heard of, seen, and in some cases, owned myslef back in the day. This is a welcome improvement over the UK version. It's also nice seeing cars road tested that I could actually buy in the US.If you like cars and like to see people have fun with cars, this is a fun show.

I can't type fast with the splint on so I take it off and on several times a day. I can't do a lot of things while wearing really, but I guess that's the point, to give your injured area time to heal. The lining is shredding a bit at the top, but no big deal.

I've been living in the US for a year, and I still can't believe how this technological, modern society, has transformed women's mentality. It's not my intention to offend anybody, but from my experience, the American woman (not all, of course) is the less intuitive person I've ever seen in my life. Things that have always been normal in most parts of the world (even in developed European countries)like giving vaginal births without medical intervention/pain medication, or breastfeeding, are all an issue here. Many women have degrees, or run business, but they still need to be educated at the most basic levels.

If you are like me, and want a lot of perspectives and research before making a decision as important as childbirth, then I strongly recommend you read this article. doula dani's blog is called \\"what ifs and fears welcome\\".

It described my experience as a laboring woman down to a T. The people who didn't like it are either not women, or they were fortunate enough not to be treated like heart attack patients instead of laboring women. Out of all my friends almost all of them were induced, had pitocin, and ended up with csections.

Really?!","review":"Since when was Ricki Lake a reputable or respected journalist?! Since never. She's ridiculous. She produced this documentary and it is ridiculous. This is a completely one sided documentary. It presents a lot of opinions as though they are facts, and seems to try to demonize women for making the choice to have a \\"traditional\\" hospital birth.That being said I do think women should be educated about the processes and facts of giving birth, which this film sort of does. In a totally biased, opinion-based, limited facts way. It confirmed my beliefs of disagreeing with home births 100%. The goal should be to have women make an educated choice that's right for them, not a baised choice that's what Ricki Lake wants, as this documentary would have women do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too graphic for my taste","review":"I thought this is a video about how a child is born. It isn't. It's a video about the birthing industry in the US, with a few live births thrown in. The documentary is biased towards home births, suggesting that hospital births are unnecessary except in emergency cases. It also suggests that hospitals are profit driven, and often perform excessive procedures to increase their profits. Basically, this video does not describe birth, it describes the business side of birth. Good if you're undecided between hospital and home birth, but not good if you, like me, were looking for a scientific documentary instead.I give it only two stars because I was very turned off by the graphic nature of the births filmed. The women are naked, and the camera is at the business end.

The children are dressed and act as if directed by Pedophiles. Whats with the underpants, bare legs etc As a mother of a three year old I was appalled. Not to mention the racist casting; all the toddlers of color were either maids, servants or porters. I don't care if this was a sign of the times, its still very insulting.

I wasn't even sure which women they were!

The experiments described are the average run-of-the-mill kind that family magazines print for children to try at home. In this less ambitious forum, they succeed in describing the universe in a scientific manner. However, the book comes nowhere close to showing any power from a great creator. The experiments are described, and the following text might as well say \\"God didit, cool hey?\\". There is no flow from experiment to an explanation as to why it gives any evidence for a god. For this reason, it fails on the cover. These are *not* science experiments showing anything other than magnetism and how the planets orbit the sun, to name a few. God does not enter the logical flow at all, but rather watches from the sidelines.

I hate to admit to identifying so greatly with fictional people, but it seemed Byatt had forgotten the lives she created and was thoughtlessly butchering the intricate world she had built.The final novel does not contain enough social and academic theory to satisfy the thirst Byatt so thoroughly quenches.If you love the series, don't read the final book.

Mayle always manages to transport the reader with his evocative passages. I particularly liked the chapter where Mayle goes to visit a school of perfumery and instructs the reader on some of the ways of the ancient skill. Even a trip for a corkscrew is a joy for him.

It's little more than a potpourri of events from his previous work. The only thread they have in common is France. A single entertaining episode involves a playboy butcher who went to Provence and seduced local wives. Their irate husbands murdered the meatcutter. And the whole thing went down long before Mayle even went to Provence. Finally, even though Mayle pulled his punches this time (perhaps to atone for past slights), he wrote with two pens. True to form, he was critical of the yokels in Provence. Yet, he managed to play it up as a paradise (especially compared to the USA) from which he'll never want to leave. It all seems as though Mayle wanted simply to crank out another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale comparison to its predecessors","review":"I enjoyed Mr. Mayle's previous books on Provence. He has a wonderfully witty sense of humor, and his portrayal of human foibles is accurate and at the same time warm-hearted. However, not much of these qualities appeared in this book. He has flashes of the brilliance that appeared in the previous books, but those flashes are few and far between. Instead we get a lot of rambling thoughts and story-telling based on speculation rather than actual incidents, resulting in a watered-down version of the previous books. It appears to me that Mr. Mayle is counting his previous successes to carry him through this one. It may work this time, but I'll be a little more cautions before I jump at the next book he puts out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly his best","review":"This seems one of those sequel books that an author sort of throws together to make a buck.

However, Encore Provence definitely lacks the warmth and engagement of the first two books. I will not recommend it to anyone.Take the second chapter for example - it is unnecessary and very distracting (I found myself taking a second look at the book cover, half not believing that Peter Mayle wasted an entire chapter talking about the newspaper article.)

With the new writers coming along to describe with delight their experiences in Europe, Mayle makes a poor showing. My excitement quickly turned to dismay.

There was little depth and warmth to the stories, little of Mr. Mayle's brilliant humor and a general feeling of lack of enthusiasm. The stories are more in the nature of reports than humorous tales.

When I saw this title listed a few months ago, I pre-ordered a copy and when it arrived last week I settled down to pick up where I left off last time. However, this book seems to be written at a distance--actually, I found it hard to really understand just how the Mayles returned (for a visit, to live, what?) I'd describe this book as a cross between the first two and his collection of essays, \\"Acquired Tastes.\\" The chapters don't hang together, his style overrides the content--I don't feel immersed in Provence but instead find his writing and opinions the stronger 'voice.'

It's a nursery story for grown ups. Don't get me wrong - I like it! But the fact is I can't help feeling that Peter Mayle is writing to formula. His previous career was in advertising,so he's VERY well aware of who his target readership is, what they like, where they like to go on holiday - and what kind of life they aspire to. Mr Mayle pushes all those right buttons to draw people in to his fairy-tale, safe and sanitised world. Somehow, I just feel he could have written this anywhere, anytime, anyhow. Come on! If you want this kind of stuff, why not jump on a plane to some sunny haven and write your own book. Encore Provence is light, bright, funny and farcical, but for me just a little too false."},{"rating":"2","title":"More! More!","review":"Once again reading Peter Mayle is the next best thing to actually being there. Most of the book covers brand new territory in the South of France including the perfect corkscrew, an olfactory lesson, and the joys of olive oil, while also revisiting many of his favorite topics including the wonder of truffles and of course the wine and food.In fact my only slight beef with the book is his need to revisit some topics already covered in previous books, but it's so slight it hardly detracts from the overall joy the book manages to evoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The stories are strained, the subject stale.

I even flew to Provence (Because of his books) in July, and even after he told us in the book that it was a \\"folly\\" to live in the States, I asked about him, and some people told me that he went back to the states... But after all - Peter is Peter, and his stories are full of humor and charm. If you have to buy one book - Do not buy this one. buy \\"A year in Provence\\". But if you have the all series of Peter's books, Buy it. it's worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"the author has burned out on this subject","review":"It is unfortunate that Peter Mayle's gentle humor did not continue in this book. It sounds as if the Provencal tourist bureau took offense at his satirical comments in previous books, and he felt obliged to write an apologetic rebuttal. I was most disappointed, since I thoroughly enjoyed his first (\\"A Year in P.\\") and somewhat less its sequel. But this book could have been much more interesting and enjoyable if he had not reworked his old themes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Year in Provence all over again, without the freshness","review":"This book is a perfect example of all that is wrong with the publishing industry. They've now milked three books on Provence from this dry,empty author without said author saying anything different or new. You need only read A Year in Provence to get a sense of the author's recurring themes and subjects; indeed, you need read only one paragraph. Here is is: Provence is quaint. The pace is slow. The focus is on food. The French think they know everything. Weather is a factor. There. I've just saved you time and money. Now can Mr. Mayle please move on to something new? ANd keep it brief?"},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad I returned it after 3 chapters","review":"Skip this one. I am very, very disappointed.

So it should not surprise anyone that I reserved my copy of 'Encore Provence' already half a year ago. But now that I've read it, I'm disappointed. 'Encore Provence' is only a shadow of what 'A Year in Provence' or 'Toujours Provence' brought to the mind. This is no story-full-of-life, it's a collection of short pieces that lack the spirit and emotions of Mayle's former work. It may well be that Peter Mayle's body is back in his old Provence, but the writer left his mind elsewhere. I miss the empathy and the lively descriptions. Reading 'Encore Provence' is like tasting a 'seconde maison' of a fabulous wine-estate: you like the taste, but you know that the original you have tasted before, was so much better. I can't get rid of the feeling that the author wrote 'Encore Provence' because he 'had to deliver'. Still I am impatient to get my hands on his next work of Provencal Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent Resource","review":"This book provides younger students with information in smaller bits than other books I have seen.

Sure enough, it was. Landvik's tale is a heartwarming one, and well-written enough to keep me turning the pages while on the beach, before going to sleep, while sipping my tea in the morning, etc. The cast of characters is engaging and their development is thorough; the laughs are plentiful; and the twists and turns of small-town life (and life in general!) are portrayed realistically.

The Tall Pine Polka reads like a caricature of her earlier novels -- also with quirky characters, but who were treated with respect, and whose stories were developed.

I don't know if I would read Landvik again after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"Don't waste your time with this one!

There was not one character that I could cheer for; I wanted to slap Fenny more than once and tell her to get over her self pity. And Bill, what a loser! Compared to Your Oasis on Flame Lake and Patty Jane's House of Curl, this is a dog. Lorna, stick to writing about the Minnesota you know - anywhere SOUTH of Brainard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypes & dullards abound","review":"It was unfortunate that Ms. Landvik decided to portray all the characters as one dimensional stock characters.

A real bust if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my time on this one.","review":"The characters were quirky and definately had potential. But the novel read like one great long trail of gossip that I heard but didn't really care about. At mid-point it seemed like it should end and I still had 200 pages to go! It went further downhill from there with some really sappy and/or silly scenes that bordered on being pathetic. It was MUCH longer than it needed to be and I'm surprised that it made by any self-respecting editor. I'm very, very sorry I wasted several hours on this novel when there is much more enjoyable material out there. (Would recommend Plainsong by Kent Haruf as a far superior read. Not much by way of humor but a wonderful and moving story of small town characters.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tall Pine Polka plays off key","review":"Lorna Landvik's latest novel is not in the same league as her first two: Patty Jane's House of Curl and Your Oasis on Flame Lake. Having read and enjoyed both, I could hardly wait for Tall Pine Polka. I was sorely dissappointed. I wish I'd at least borrowed it from the library rather than rushing to buy a new hardcover. I could have returned it early and not been out not a dime.None of the characters are people I would ever care to meet and in fact would even dislike if I ever did. Moreover, these characters are not even close to a realistic portrayal of small town residents in Northern Minnesota or even Minneapolis for that matter. Some of them are far stranger than the Hollywood types that invade the small town as the mainstay of the plot.I would not recommend this piece to a friend and will wait for paperback or a library edition to come out before trying her next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amiable Cluelessness","review":"This book contains a set of amiably quirky characters from upstate Minnesota and Hollywood. The author's insider knowledge gives the moviemaking scenes (a considerable portion of the book) a degree of verisimilitude.If you by some chance actually like this book then I would recommend a Jon Hassler novel to you in addition. Begin with his \\"Staggerford\\". It has a similar setting, range of unusual and well-drawn characters, and even shares at least one key plot element. It would be worth your while to determine why his book has an enduring depth that Landvik's clueless novel lacks (and it's not just that as a college English professor, he possesses a sounder grasp of the language)."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and predictable","review":"I enjoyed reading earlier Landvik books, and felt they were good vacation reads. This one could be too, being a very light read. However, when I finished it I felt like I had wasted my time. All the way through it seemed like I was reading a made-for-tv movie script--everything was trite and predictable. I found myself skipping paragraphs of boring dialogue just to get to the ending (sort of like watching a sitcom--I could tune out parts I wasn't interested in very easily). An okay book if you really don't want to think about anything, but not something that will keep you on the edge of your seat or even laughing all that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I have loved the characters in her previous books and enjoyed the humor of her stories.

I'm on my way now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought the Title was the Only Clever Line","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading Landvik since I had heard many good things. Alas, my fellow amazon reviewers misled me. Yuck. I thought the book was pitifully underwritten, with shallow and extremely contrived characters. I found most of the humor to be insulting and the overall plot to be vain and simpering. I am hoping that \\"Patty Jane\\" is better, but I don't think I am up to reading it, just in case. I am deeply disturbed that Landvik is recommended in the same group as Michael Lee West. West is so superior to Landvik--as a story teller, as a satirist, as a slice-of-life writer--that the two should never be mentioned again in the same sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not on par with other Landvik novels","review":"I wanted to like this book but didn't.

This one was a huge disappointment The heroine, Fenny, was totally unlikeable, selfish, self-centered, self-serving --- and it was hard to really invest too much in any of the other characters. Back story was needed for several, particularly Slim. One of the few likeable characters was killed half way through the book and I couldn't help wishing it had been Fenny I also thought Frau Katte's accent was stupid and hard to read. Finally, the story line seemed to go nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not good...","review":"This was the fourth book I've read by Landvik and it was a real disappointment. I'm not sure what she was trying to do with this one. The story seemed to be all over the place, with nothing to connect it together that made sense. It was like this story was part Richard Russo, part Fannie Flagg, part Nora Roberts.I never felt any real connection to any of the characters, especially the too good to be true Big Bill and the innocent, but fiesty Fenny. The \\"love triangle\\" between Bill, Fenny and Lee never seemed realistic and Fenny becoming a movie star was just too ridiculous.

I dragged through this book, picking it up and down for over 2 months. It was curosity only that got me through the book; I wanted to see what else she might throw at the characters. The events that affected each character's life seemed very contrived and not story driven. Not a recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Distraction, Fun Characters","review":"For me, a good fiction novel is one that provides a pleasant distraction from everyday life, as well as a story interesting enough to keep me eagerly coming back to it until it's finished.Although the story contains a few sad parts and some difficult times, those things are more than compensated for by an overall 'feel good' read, as well as many splashes of humor thrown in here and there.Before I choose a book to read, I first check out some of the five star reviews, some of the one star reviews, and maybe a few in-between. The one star reviews had me a little hesitant to read this, but the preview on the book jacket won out, and I checked it out from our local library. I am SO GLAD I did. I liked the odd characters, the story was interesting, and I am happy I found another new (for me) author to read. I will definitely be going back for more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too crazy and predictable","review":"I was looking for a light and easy read while vacationing and this was a good book for that. I enjoyed the first half and learning about all the characters and their relationships, but then it just got too crazy and predictable. The bad ex-husband comes back for revenge of course and I knew that Lee was pregnant when she took off. The \\"pooping\\" line was funny the first couple of times, but was pathetic by the 6th or 7th reference. A happily ever after ending was slapped in quite abruptly I thought after so much tragedy that seemed to never end. I also tired of the message: Hollywood bad, small town folks good. I loved Patty Jane's House of Curl, by the way, and look forward to reading her earlier book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Loved her other books, but Landvik was somewhere else when she wrote this. Because I enjoyed the others, I kept hoping for something redeeming, but it never happened. I should have not wasted my time with this book. Didn't particularly care for the characters, or what they did to one another in the name of friendship. Just not believable. I think she wanted to write a 1930's Romantic Comedy -- but set in today's world, it just didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I read Patty Jane's House of Curl and LOVED it and so I thought Lorna Landvik would deliver another winner with this book - NOT SO!

I couldn't wait for it to be sent from you so I rushed out and bought it{and it cost me $25.00.} What a huge mistake! The book {for want of a better word, as I hesitate to call this a book} seems to have been written by a child, the plot is weak, the characters are totally unbelievable, and the grammar is questionable to say the least. I read and buy a lot of books, and I certainly will not be reading anything else by this author. I also think the publisher should be bought to task for allowing this book to be published as it was. I only hope that Ms Landvik was under extreme pressure to write this book, and this is not her best work or else I don't see many people purchasing her next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the fun?????","review":"This book is such a disappointment to me.

The author takes us into well-covered territory: a movie crew invades a small town full of lovable eccentrics.

Still, when you're stuck on a long flight, you could do a lot worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing the Tall Pine Polka","review":"As a devoted Landvik fan, this is by far my very favorite of her works, including her newest, Welcome to the Great Mysterious. Life in Northern Minnesota is accurately portrayed, her trademark quirky characters and locales are at their very best. I laughed out loud, I cried, I rejoiced in their accomplishments. Landvik has created a truly joyful and sorrowful dance with Tall Pine Polka. Would love to see this tale of movie-making made into a movie.

When the last case, you wish to hear him a bit louder, but this can be a matter of taste. A fine cd, not only for guitar lovers.

The instructions say that when the sprouts are ready you can fill the jar with water and the seed hulls will float out the lid - the openings in the lid are too small for this but I just put them in a bowl of water and they float to the top.

Play these CD's and you'd be forgiven for thinking that these are the tunes of the moment, the selection is of such quality.Oakenfold's magician's touch though is sometimes let down by a few suprisingly sloppy track mixes, something which doesn't show on his later (and superior) work such as the tour-de-force that is GU007: New York. But don't let this put you off, though this may have been crafted 'way back' in 1997, CD1's Drum & Bass & CD2's trance mixes make this a welcome addition to any dance fan's collection.If you've already got alot of the Global Underground CD's this is really worth getting, especially if you liked Oakey's GU007. If you're new to the GU series however, this might be a good starting point to give you the general flavour of the series..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never fails","review":"Dickey never fails to deliver a different book than the last! This book was awesome. From the careful selection of names and the non-selection thereof, to the truly surprising ending, this book had me turning page after page after page.

I swear this one would win an Academy Award!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordinary","review":"This was an ordinary story. It had some real EXOTIC scenes and an unpredictable ending. It was just nothing new, we see this stuff everyday on the soap operas. David Lawrence was a bit on the wild side and his wife Jessica had some real problems. I was looking for a bit more relationship therapy or what really happens when a loving husband and wife have an affair in the marriage. Nothing, except the affair, was realistic, so I guess it was just more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Eric Jerome Dickey's best book","review":"I have read all of EJD's books. This is the best one yet.In this book you are introduced to Freckles and she is married to Charles. Freckles has a very demanding career whereas Charles is a school teacher whose job is not quite as demanding. In Freckles mind everything in marriage seems to be ok until she meets Charles.Charles informs Freckles that her husband is having an affair with his wife. After learing this information and then confirming it with Charles, Freckles loses the stability she thought she had in her marriage.I found it amazing that even though Charles cheated he still tried to blame it on his wife.This is one of the best books that I have read this year.Buy it you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is Eric Jerome Dickey's best book. The emotional and psychological suspense this book provides, as well as the ability to leave one thinking about one's life and relationships, makes this book an excellent creation. If you ever wanted to know about the intricacies as well as the devastion of an affair, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man...It's a must-read!","review":"I was completely taken aback by this book. The writing was so conversational that I kept trying to become Freckles. Of course we've all been in a relationship plagued by infidelity, but the decisions we make as a result of a broken heart never seemed soooo terrible until you read this book. So okay, it's about the other woman (hence the title), but it's about more than that: lies, deceit, betrayal, scorned lovers that you always figure will find their way back to one another. Yet, Dickey is not about happy endings. He's about the truth, and this book came so close to it it was scary. I don't want to give it away, but buy it, read it, keep it forever. I PROMISE you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great on!!!!!","review":"As always I have love reading Eric's writing and this book was another great one.

If you are not ready to fully commit...then don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Read","review":"As usual, Mr. Dickey writes a book that you will be able to relate to in some way. \\"The Other Woman\\" shows how infidelity may lead to total destruction. Everything starts with Charles and Jessica (both married to other people) begining an affair and Jessica's husband, David, finds out. Her infidelity causes David to start his revenge against Charles, where he (Charles) learns how it feels to have someone to break up his marriage. This book has twists and turns that ultimately ends in tragedy.

Thank you, thank you and keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a fan of EJD, have read and enjoyed all his books.But this one was disappointing.

T.M.I. :) but then the story heats up and it gets good. i anticipated what would happen between the lovers triangle and was so shocked at the ending that i actually cried. i think the female, who by the way is unnamed, should have made a different dicision in the ending and felt it could have ended a little better. but overall a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be a movie","review":"This is a great story! I am just getting into reading novels by male authors, not at all what I expected.I am amazed at how Dickey is able to tell the story through the eyes of the wife and it be so reflective of the turmoil that we feel after a spouse has been caught cheating.If you have ever been in a situation as such, you WILL be able to relate to this story.Jaw dropping climax! I would love to see this on the big screen. So many genuine, raw, true to life emotions.I look forward to reading more from Dickey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This is one of EJD's best books to date. An incredible page turner, and too irresistable to put down. This is a multi-faceted book that goes beyond the reader's expectations. If you think the \\"the other woman\\" is the only plot...think again. This book has plenty of suspense, surprise, and shock value to last for a while. It really delves into the age old statement, \\"What goes around comes around,\\" as EJD makes his characters ultimately responsible for their actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Main Character with no name","review":"\\"Freckles\\" as she was called throughout the book gets a strange call from a man who kept saying his name was David. What the hell?The Other Woman was so well written that you could literally SEE the characters. It was intense, electrifying, funny, and satisfying. The ending came as a big surprise I might add.Dickey, who by the way was NOT one of my favorites until I read The Other Woman, takes his readers into the antagonizing life of \\"Freckles\\". Her perfect world took a turn for the worst after receiving the call from David where he finally requests to talk to \\"Freckles\\" in person. After learning the unthinkable from David, Freckles not only gets mad, but gets even too!!!!!! I loved it.Dickey is the bomb!!!!! This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Darkside of Comuppance . . .","review":"EJD I have always been a great fan of yours. Your writing is excellent! However, your last book \\"The Other Woman\\" was good writing but, in my opinion, very dark material. It left me feeling somewhat depressed. I still look forward to your next book and I hope that the story is a little more up beat. I have always credited you for finding humor in the worst situations. Even though couples had done the most unthinkable things to one another, you gave them their comeuppance in creative ways not lingering on the negativity of the relationship but rather capturing human flaws and faults with comedy. That's what I really like about your writing and hope to see again in your future books. Thanks for another good read. Hope to see you again on your next trip to Waldens Virginia Center Commons."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good read","review":"This is one of the best books out there.

The main couple could resemble any couple in America. EJD showed the shattered trust,working different shifts and initial denial. The mental pictures and emotions were strong in this book.

Oh boy did it pick up! As I read it was like I was in the middle of the room watching these people lives take place. I although I predicted it I still coulnd't believe what happened towards the end. I had nightmares about this book the night I finished it. Freckles was caught in the middle/involved of all the madness. My heart hurt for Charles even though he made a stupid mistake. My heart ached painfully David Lawrence the most. He loved his wife so much...The whole tragedy was her fault any way.Great book EJD.You really depressed me with this one.

His books have a way of pulling you in, allowing you to feel all the emotions of the characters in the book and this is no exception!The way he can describe emotions from a woman's point of view so well is truly amazing, this book will make you laugh, cry, feel all the emotions along with the characters as if you're feeling for an old friend..I have recommended EJD's books to all my friends, no matter if they are male or female, neither can deny his gift for writing!I would highly recommend this and all of his books and am looking forward to the next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD READ FROM BEGINNING TO END","review":"Listen, I really don't have to repeat what most of the other reviews here say, I get tired of typing the same plot, when you can read about it in the editors review.

I took it on my vacation to PC Beach, FL. I read the book in less than a week and thought WOW! Can't really tell you if I wanted her to stay or not?????? I don't like uncertain endings-and i feel like I do not know if she is coming back. My favorite character was 'TYRA THE TYRANT', I appreciate him showing her human side. I bet we have all had a boss like that:)! In the end, I enjoyed the storyline and this was my 2nd EJD novel. and I would be ok if I don't read another one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric is back!","review":"I am a big EJD fan and wasn't too impressed with his last novel Thieves Paradise. However, EJD comes back swinging in this one. This is a novel about infidelity, deceit and adultery and one woman's attempt to deal with it and keep it all together while maintaining her career. I think EJD does a very good job of looking at relationships and some of the causes of cheating from the male and female perspective. The dialogue in this book is excellent and sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. This one is similar to Liar's Game because it is written in first person narrative and in the voice of an unnamed lead character. Also, similar to Liar's Game, this book takes an interesting new spin on the love triangle.

I reviewed this book for my book club ARAROJAX. Eric Jerome Dickey is just one of those authors that gets better and better the more he writes. I had wished for a different ending for the two couples involved but the ending was quite different and a little unexpected. Although two wrongs don't make a right, I was glad to see the wife not take her husband's unfaithfulness in stride. I think that readers will enjoy this book.Reviewer: Rae B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Like Fire","review":"If your looking for a good mix of sex and drama then The Other Women has got what your looking for.

Collins creates wonderful, believable characters that will keep you coming back for more. I loved Abby's disguises in this book, they were hilarious. I also am quite fond of the cat Simon, who Collins seems to work into every story, which I appreciate. I love her descriptions of the flowers and Abby's banana colored convertable.

The patch on my leg is very painful, with huge weeping blisters.I actually went to the doctor for an unrelated issue and when he saw my leg, he asked \\"how did you burn yourself so badly there?!\\" He was shocked when I told him it was from exposure to a \\"safe\\" pesticide.I will not be using the rest of the doses I have - I can't imagine something that would hurt me this badly is good for my cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"still have fleas","review":"I have used this product for two months now and we still have fleas in fact I believe they are worse now then before I wasted the fifty dollars.

While Stephanie can't help evoking memories of June Christy, she is her own talent with phrasing that comes across as \\"Nakasian\\" and as easy as pie. O'Brien is one of the many unheralded, yet, excellent pianists who can swing and stay within himself without over-reaching. His piano compliments Stephanie very well. Delightful to hear. Phil Woods plays very nicely on this set and doesn't try to take over the limelight. Excellent music.

Examining both the reasons why 10 to 15 percent of newly ordained priests resign (loneliness, feeling unappreciated, problems with celibacy and disillusionment are among the main causes) and the advice that active priests have for those seeking to serve in ministry, The First Five Years Of The Priesthood is fascinating and strongly recommended reading for anyone considering becoming a Catholic priest or who has an interest in contemporary trends within clergy of the Roman Catholic Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful fifties west coast jazz that holds up today","review":"Doris Drew a jazz vocalist in the fifties made this great recording with some of the finest west coast jazz recording and studio men of the day.

I did not expect the comic timing of the cast to be perfect after such a long layoff but the script was so weak it would have taken some colossal acting efforts to save it. There were some occasional good moments but they were few and far between. Personally, I believe that most Red Dwarf fans could have come up with a better script. ** Spoiler Alert ** Just off of the top of my head, when the crew is in the \\"real\\" world seeking out the actors who portray them, I would have like to have seen them meet (for example) Chris Barrie portraying himself as the \\"Ace - Smoke me a kipper\\" Rimmer persona and Danny John-Jules as Duane Dibbley. All in all, a most disappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speechless...","review":"I think the writing was on the wall when Grant left, as RD after that showed signs of tiredness and lack of originality. I only watched the first episode of 'Back to Earth'; but that was enough. They may as well have put brand new actors in the roles, as at least they may have injected some new life into this travesty. When will comedy writers learn that VERY few shows have a shelf-life beyond about a dozen episodes (even the great Cleese realised that Fawlty Towers couldn't ride on the crest of a wave forever). I LOVE Red Dwarf, but honestly, after Rimmer left, the crucial momentum had been lost (much as I enjoyed Chloe Annett as eye-candy).

Only very few funny parts, a lot of confusing things-we have all the episodes on dvd and have watched them many times, but I still felt as if I missed a big part or a critical episode.

It seemed to borrow too much from the classic series and from Blade Runner. But on subsequent viewings, I really liked this return to the Red Dwarf universe. It holds together nicely as a story and, if seen more as an homage to Blade Runner and the Red Dwarf series, it's actually tightly written and fun with many references to enjoy. There are some great gags and quite touching moments, as well as the more traditional sci-fi themed zaniness. If you're a fan, this is definitely worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Inconsistent with the TV Shows","review":"I am a huge fan of the series. Comedy science fiction must be a difficult thing to write well because you rarely see it done and even more rarely find it written well but the television series was a hit on both accounts. The Back to Earth movie, however, was at best a lazy attempt at reproducing the magic that was Red Dwarf and at worst a malicious stab at the heart of everything that made people love the show. So many things I liked about the series are corrupted. Its other-worldliness is gone by having it on Earth; the relationship with Kochanski is over; the postulation about the future where Lister and the cat are all that is left and which is surprisingly hopeful, suddenly becomes farce when the Red Dwarf characters find the reason for their existence. Where is the laugh track? Where is the music?If you are a fan, get this because you will want everything Red Dwarf but do not expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"I am sorry to say this was a very large disappointment. I had high hopes for it and the boring mess it turned out to be was terrible.

So as many other fans, I was excited when this came out, but disappointed when I seen it. There isn't a lot of comedy in this one. It seems the writers want to do drama now instead of comedy, but still want to do Red Dwarf. Result: you get a stupid Red Dwarf. Instead of continuing on from where the series left off, it jumps nine years latter with no explaination of how our charaters got out of the mess they were in when we last seen them. And the special effects were crap too. But it wasn't all bad. The actors are as good as ever, and there are some good and funny moments in it, but just not enough. In all, I would not spend my money on this one if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shedding tears","review":"I love Red Dwarf, and I think that it's one of the best comedy shows around. I was so excited to see the release of this DVD. Unfortunately, the show was just awful. It could have and should have been so much funnier. The writers did a huge disservice to the characters and to the show, and as a consequence, to the viewers. I thought that Robert Llewellyn, Chris Barrie and Danny John-Jules were great in their respective roles, but Craig Charles' Lister of today just did not strike me as the Lister of yesterday. He wasn't bad, he just wasn't Lister-y enough for me! Maybe as Lister would be if too mellowed by age?I thought the laughs were few and far between, and again, the story itself was just miserable. The main good thing that came out of it is it got me to pull out season one again, and that reminded me why I love Red Dwarf."},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite back in the red.","review":"Although you have the original cast and one of the original writers. It's still hard to get the feel of the old school red dwarf. Besides the movie feeling like nothing more thatn a plug for itself. You lose alot of comidic timing without the live audiance, or laugh track, which ever they used in the show. but I don't want to seem all negative about it. There are still some classic one liners, some off the wall situations, and alot of ripping on rimmer. If your a fan of the red it's a must. If you stumble upon it and just watch the movie, You'll be wishing for an hour of your life back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it Real?","review":"The perhaps final episode of Red Dwarf takes the boys back to Earth, but the whole episode is devoted to the question of whether their previous adventures were just stories on television.

The example source code never have comments next to them....so you may not even know how comments are writeen in VB...I mean not that it's difficult to find this out, but this is how poorly the book is written.

In almost all cases, I'm able to get more specific and detailed info from the online help included with VB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emm.. A bit poor","review":"In all fairness to the author this is a good book if you are new to the development scene. The publishers and the author do fail some of us by suggesting that this book is VB 6 orientated. Its not! What you do have is a general VB reference manual that is very simplistic and does not tackle any issue in depth. Unfortunately if you are looking for OLEDB, COM/DCOM or SQL Server interfacing using ADO/RDO then look elsewhere - these issues are not covered. Not for the pro's amongst us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Totally Useless Book","review":"This book contains nothing you can't find elsewhere. When I have a VB problem I consult my various books and have never found anything of use in this book. It is just a rehash of the same stuff available anywhere. I am baffled by the reviews that praise this book. It is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed.","review":"it only helped as much as help index that came with the VB software. not enough detail or explanation to really learn each function in detail( or useable level). basically it comes down to....how to execute C++ from VB... look page 1234page 1234: here is the sample code. copy this code to visual C. copy this code to VB. that's it! next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reference, but short on details","review":"I have bought and exchange a dozen VB book since I started programming and I'm not thinking of exchanging this one any time soon. It has been the best, and most reader friendly reference I have ever had. There are two huge indexes that help you find any topic quickly and it's one of very few books that actually cover the chart control (but with little detail). Sometimes it starts talking about a topic and then stops short, so you ask yourself \\"okay, what then? Why are you stopping now? What about this and that?\\". Other than that it's a wonderful reference, but it's not an organized course or tutorial, so I wouldn't recommend it for the beginner (unless you like reading a 1000 pages from end to end)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohhhhhhh Yes!","review":"This book cuts to the chase and gets down to business with great examples, which don't drag on like most other books on the subject.

I recommend this book without reservation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD BOOK","review":"Actually quite good - I learned a lot from this book about taking care of my self and body. If you follow their regimen, it definitely works and feels great. I don't necessarily feel the need to purchase only Dr. Hauschka products in my skin-care regimen, but the information really hits home for any products that you decide to use. It's about creating rhythm in your life and being gentle with your body and thoughts. I recommend completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Awakening A Whole Lot To Be Honest","review":"Essentially one large advertisement for the Dr. Hauschka line, combined with a poorly written self-love motivation, I found this book to be rather blah.

Like the majority of us outside the Pacific Northwest, I was turned on to the Melvins courtesy of Kurt Cobain in the early nineties and I bought Houdini. Houdini is good, but this would have been a more appropriate introduction to their music and I'm glad to finally hear their music from the ground up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick Beast Metal","review":"Dark, Heavy and Loopy can describe the Melvins from WA State. They combine Iommi's guitars with a drunken, demented lyricism over a drummer who stops and starts and breaks up the backbeat like a jazz trapman. Ozma is slow and low with enough devestating riffs to occupy any fan of Kyuss or Pantera but there is something screwy going down. Buzz ain't right in his head. Gluey Porch Treaments is Ozma's predecessor from '87 and you can tell by the intensity of Eye Flys that this is not a mentally healthy rock and roll disc. I add both albums on this disc to my favorite rock albums list right next to Master Of Reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"These chairs have a very big visible screw and washer holding the arm to the back.

You don't want to get tired and step on the coral in a protected nature reserve!Depending on the type of shoe, I typically wear a men's 10 and my feet aren't too wide. The large size fit perfectly and stayed on without any fear of slipping off.I used them for hours over multiple days and they're in great shape even after practically folding them in half while walking out of the water to the beach.

On the 2nd day of use, one of fins developed a 3/4 inch tear where the toes come out of the fin. I returned the pair to amazon and was sent another pair about a month later. The new fins are now unusable as they have ripped so much along the foot. I am an older swimmer who uses them periodically through the week and I now believe it's a manufacturing issue that are causing these fins to rip. I have recently purchased the similar Finis Fins and will hope they hold up much better than the speedo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size Problem - Rectified?","review":"A sizing chart is desperately needed for this item. Based on other customers guidance (in Amazon reviews) that these fins run really small and were numbered according to women's sizes, I ordered a pair of large 8-9, since I wear a size 8.5. The fins were huge on me, both in length and width. Sadly, if I ordered them again I wouldn't know whether to order one or two sizes down. As of December 2010 the Speedo website does not provide a sizing chart which relates fin size to men's and women's shoe sizes. For that reason, I will not try to order these fins again, even though I liked the look and feel of the pair I ordered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic fins.","review":"Have had these fins about a month now and have no complaints. Am using these for snorkeling and swimming in a local lake. They are comfortable during my 30-40 minute swims. The blade is fairly large and provides good propulsion, but also requires a lot of leg strength if you want to push them hard. For easy swims they seem to be about right and you will still work your legs plenty. I have a size 12 foot with a high instep and do fine in the XXL size (green). These fins do not float. I think they are a good item for the price provided you order the correct size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for training","review":"Hi everyone!!!

From funk to blues and rock to piano ballads, this CD doesn't get old.My whole family loves it, especially Zombie Me, Sweep the Leg, Girl From the Sea and Old Man Walking.

You won't see anything overly unique or original in this movie, but it IS actually a pretty well made film. The antagonist does his job quite well, and despite the.... obnoxiously over-endowed female lead, she too does a pretty fine performance.

To say the least, I had added this to my queue one night on a B-movie spree, but was pleasantly surprised with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"P2","review":"I would have given this movie 5 stars but the reason why I did not was because it is the same kind of movie that I have seen in the past a dozen times.

I found myself knowing what was around every corner, but it didn't keep me from peeking anyway. I did enjoy the parking lot setting and I'm sure we have all been a bit nervous walking through one at one time or another. There is also one gruesome and gory death, so if your squeamish you may want to pass this up or close your eyes, like my wife did. I have seen much worse, but this is really pretty standard stuff.

I went into it expecting major cliches and a not so thrilling thriller. But this one had me and a group of friends watching it on the edge of our seats, with several ear-piercing screams of fear even rocking the living room at some points. The two stars gave phenomenal performances, and the movie even through in its fair share of teeth gritting gore and wince-worthy moments. P2 will, surprisingly, satisfy horror movie fans as well as those just looking for a fun thrill ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little film","review":"You can still make a great movie with 2 characters and a shoestring budget. It's not as strong as Misery but... Wes was incredible in this movie - I felt his pain and believed his character from the 1st moment of the movie. Angela was a realistic character - when i first saw her I thought - here we go again - a bimbo with big breasts and no sense... but she was strong and we never got the \\"why me why me\\" crying scene.. The final scene is strong - good special effects and quite gross.. A great movie that you probably never heard of... Worth the rental fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadistic and predictable in roughly equal measure","review":"Forget Halloween. For makers of slasher-movies, the holiday of choice would appear to be Christmas, with its glittery decorations and overall atmosphere of jollity and good cheer providing an unsettlingly incongruous backdrop for all the death, bloodletting and mayhem that are standard-issue elements of the genre.In \`P2,\\" a beautiful, young corporate executive is held hostage on Christmas Eve by a deranged killer posing as a security guard in the building where she works (P2 is the parking lot level on which she is kidnapped and held).This theme of a helpless ingénue being held against her will by a homicidal maniac is as old as the hills, and \`P2' brings nothing of note to the scenario. It's all stock situations and unbridled sadism with very little in the way of actual drama or suspense.Check out 1965's \\"The Collector,\\" William Wyler's fine rendition on the theme, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually bought this","review":"This movie would have made a really good short. I mean cmon he should have killed her in the first five minutes and made us all feel good. This girl is a total you know what and a total waste of screen time. Very few movies do I root for the killer but this one I do. The only other movie that comes to mind like that is Captivity. Kill them in the first five minutes and lets watch something else.

I think it was only in theaters around my area for two weeks.First the postive. I did like the Christmas and parking lot setting of the movie, but that is where my praise ends. The main problem I had was with the villian. Wes Bentley wasn't scary in the least and often came across as a whiny little wimp. In no way did this guy ever creep me out. Say what you want about No Country for Old Men, but the crazed killer in that is what I constitute as scary. On the other hand, I thought Rachel Nichols was a little better in her role (or maybe it was just her impressive cleavage on display throughout). The movie also felt a lot longer than 90 minutes, with the chase scenes being drawn out to extreme lengths.I like cheesy horror films as much as the high calibur ones at times, but P2 was neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!","review":"Total garbarge. Total waste of time. Another movie where a seemingly bright woman is portrayed as a bimbo who left her brains at home. Tits partially exposed, as if a thriller just can't be a thriller unless we see half naked women running around. Next, we have her holding an ax, but yet somehow doesn't quite understand the concept with regards to how to USE it!Reminds me of another movie I saw just the other day called \\"The Resident\\" starring Hilary Swank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Chick, Not Much Else","review":"I was excited about 'P2' beforehand knowing that Alexandre Aja(director of 'High Tension' and 'The Hills Have Eyes' remake)had written and produced it. I don't know what happened.Plot: hot lady with big, um, talent gets trapped in a parking deck with a psychopathic security guard on Christmas eve. Nothing amazingly original, but a decent enough setup. Unfortunately not much really happens. The film is basically one long cat and mouse game, but it really has no suspense or tension.'P2' isn't a bad film. Its just a boring one. My advice: go check out 'High Tension' instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindless Thriller","review":"At the end of a long day, sometimes I just want to be entertained. P2 does the trick. It's a fun little popcorn thriller, with a claustrophobic setting.I've always felt that parking garages were creepy places. Now I'm absolutely convinced of it.Besides the thrills and twisting plot, Rachel Nichols is eye candy of the highest order, and plays her character with believable strength.If you're looking for a mindless movie to wind down at the end of the day, P2 is a great selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underground Christmas mayhem","review":"Okay, parking garages are creepy enough so now I'm going to be too freaked out to ever park in one again. Or go in an elevator in the evening. Or ever trust parking lot attendants again. Or see security cameras without wondering who is watching at the other end.Great psychological thriller! I wasn't expecting a lot - low budget thriller with only two actors, for goodness sakes. But great, clear camera work. You can actually see what happens in the movie - they don't try to hide poor acting with low lighting.Rachel Nichols (even with the blatant boobarama display) was very credible as the victim who ended up kicking butt. And Wes Bentley - the best psycho since Hannibal Lector.

Since I started to learn chess only a few months ago (at age 69), I assumed I would be able to make no sense at all of the various chess games, but GM Schwartzman's chatty analyses and inclusion of the notation letters/numbers along the edges of the diagrams mean that I cannot only enjoy the chat and but see that with a little effort I'll be able to get beyond it into the details of the games (a little, anyway). I liked reading the accounts of people such as Bobby Fischer, Garry Kasparov, Carol Jarecki, Florencio Camponmanes, Frank Camaratta, etc., whose names are familiar to me from internet browsing and/or chess fame.

It conveys the real athmosphere of the time and gives a chance to see the human nature of the king and his courtiers. It is not just fights and drama, it is also love and beauty. The movie can satisfy any Dumas fan. This movie is much better that the one with Di Caprio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good movie","review":"I've never read the book, so this movie seemed really good to me. I don't know if it's accurate to the book or not, but I liked what I saw. Richard Chamberlain did a wonderful job, along with Patrick McGoohan as the evil Rouquet. It's very exciting and at the climax of the movie when the true king must be chosen, it's very nerve-racking. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes historical fiction and excitement. This was a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the movie very much.","review":"I paid for the Man In the Iron Mask because we like Richard Chamberlain, but it had an error.

In the opening credits it states: Based on the book by Alexandre Dumas - Yeah VERY VERY LOOSLEY based! The Characters were completely changed around, and in some cases completely left out. The lowest rating available was 1 star; but I'd like to give it a -5 stars. I do NOT recomend this movie - although Richard Chamberlain did a good job playong the dual role, I have yet to find a good movie adaptation. The more recent verison with Leonardo DiCaprio was just as farcical- although more of the characters were there, the storyline was WAY OFF! All in all the book was by far the best. My suggestion: Don't waste your money on either movie version - buy the Book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad print","review":"First of all, I like tv-mini series with Richard Chamberlain.

The actual show deserves 4 - 5 stars. However, this product deserves one star, if any, for the following reason: ABC is releasing the Season 1 DVD while at the same time it is considering canceling the show! If you buy this DVD, you could have a story with no ending. You will be stuck at the climax and you will never know how the series ends or how the footage is found. To me, that is a waste of money for consumers and a money making scheme by the studio. I would encourage all River fans to avoid purchasing this product until ABC commits to finishing the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best, blatant ripoffs and horrible plot at worst","review":"I went into this with high hopes, but the pilot episode was a huge let down. The entire 'hanging dolls' scene in the forest was obviously a direct ripoff from 'Blair Witch', and too many of the 'shock' moments were due less to compelling suspense than to the usual clichés attributed to this genre.The absolute worst moment came in the season finale, with the shooting of one of the main characters. The plot of the show involves the fact that there are 3-5 cameras in every room on the ship, but apparently everybody on board seems to have forgotten that they could just check the tapes to see exactly who it was who did the shooting. Of course, that would have meant there was no 'mystery' to fill out the episode.I can't imagine this going to a second season (most of the first season seemed like 'filler' as it was); and if it does, I certainly won't be among it's viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"edge of your seat in spots","review":"I really like it.

I told a friend about it and she said it didn't work for her. I thought maybe because she was a bigger person and I'm half her size. When my baby came home I was so excited to use it, but what a disappointment. The pillow was too high, too hard even for my preemie. Unable to nurse I went back to my regular pillow...much better. The only hope for this pillow since I can't return it is to use it for my baby when he starts to sit up. NOT WORTH THE $40.00 DOLLARS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Original much better.....","review":"I have the original Boppy and received this as a gift-decided to keep it. I really don't like the added fabric part that the original doesn't have(Original Boppy owners-you know what I mean). Every one uses their Boppy differently-I personally like to wrap it around my waist while I nurse and you can't do that with this one. It is very plush though, but not soft enough. It would need a lot of breaking in. This one is not for me-i'm stickin with the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"I received the Boppy Nursing Pillow as a gift, but found it just did not work for me.

Dave Duncan is one of the five best fantasy writers ever and thankfully he is still at it. An author with his talent, who actually keeps producing books, is a rare treat these days. Thank you Mr. Duncan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A perfectly absolute waste of a series!","review":"This is book two of Dave Duncan's 4-book series, \\"A Handful of Men\\", a sequel series to his wonderful, \\"A Man of His Word Series\\". I really enjoyed the first series and the way that it ended, but when I read this series, I was disgusted! Mr. Duncan changed for the worse. The first three books probably deserve 2-3 stars each, but book four, \\"The Living God\\", is SO bad, that it lowers the entire series's level. Don't start reading this series, I promise you that you will be disappointed in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I picked this up, from a local bookstore's sale rack. I did not realize that it was the second installment in a quintet, until I finished reading it. Mr. Duncan does such an excellent job of writing that the story can nearly stand alone, and in the context of the series the book gains even more depth and vision.I have since tracked down and purchased all of the novels in hardback, since I consider them an essential part of my fantasy collection. As I said in my review of the first book, this book is a shining example of the high fantasy genre, on par with, if not surpassing Tolkien.Combining lively, likable characters, a grand and tangled plot, and a vivid world this book is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a series","review":"While I loved the light touch and deft humor of the first series (Man of His Word), this series has a much darker and heavier tone. Duncan pulls it off in the first book (Cutting Edge), introducing more nuanced characters than the first series.But he goes completely off the rails in this book (and its successors). First of all, the first 20-30 pages are almost an exact retelling the of end of the first book. Next, he bounces us from character group to character group never allowing the reader to get involved in anyone new. Characters that we knew in the first series act in strange ways. And finally, the series takes dark turns and with the lack of sympathetic new characters, the turns are fairly pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early television classic","review":"Fans of James dean or anyone in general will enjoy this program. It is set on a farm and the cast is wonderful, esp. James Dean, playing a \\"true to life\\" role for him as a farm boy, that wants to leave the farm. This is really a \\"Thanksgiving\\" special and orginally aired the week of that holiday in 1953.There is a really neat scene of Jimmy playing with a little boy; he's tossing him up in the air and catching him. That's more than worth the low price of this wonderful videotape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great beginning","review":"The two hour premiere is one of the best episodes of the Andromeda series. It takes off quick, and even allows for some characterization, which many series seem to miss. Though, as soon as the premiere ends, the series seems as if it is going to be a failure. The third episode, \\"To Looses the Faithful Lightning,\\" is a ridiculous episode to be put at the beginning of the series. But do know, that episode three isn't at all like the rest of the episodes. Four and five are descent episodes, and they both help illuminate the character of Tyr, the Nietzschean of the crew. If your unsure of the series, be sure to start here, at the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable!","review":"Great charracters, great set up & premise, fantastic acting and sets. This is a show that I think Gene would have been proud of. Great job to Majel and everyone else involved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"Since the main character is from \\"Hercules\\", I had my doubts. I picked it up anyway, because Gene Roddenberry's name is on it. I am glad I did.The show does have some weakness- 1. Special effects are always interesting, but look fake sometimes 2. The premise seems to be a little bit shaky: why would those crew decided to join the idealist Captain? They are obviously not the noble type.Despite those two flaws, it's still worth watching. The concept is original (in the sense that the variation of classical theme done well), the story is good (I think \\"double helix\\", the last episode of Vol 1. is the best so far), acting is adequate. In sum, the series has a promising start. It's certainly not Farscape or Star Trek, but you'll enjoy Andromeda if you like this type of sci-fi shows.As for DVD itself:Good-Many special features (alternative takes were interesting).Good picture qualityBad-No subtitles..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to give story details here","review":"I won't give details of characters and story in this review, since those are more than adequately done in other reviews.

Also included are extras like character profiles, bloopers, behind the scenes, TV teasers, and more.And for those who haven't seen Andromeda, it is faster and funnier than the politically correct and sanitized Star Trek (TNG), more realistic, and more believable. Sure, there is some cheese thrown in for good measure, but it makes it even more fun.Highly recommended, but then again, you probably already knew that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is he spinning in his grave yet?","review":"Andromeda is just another mind-numbingly meaningless show from the posthumus Roddenberry Empire of mediocrity.

Regardless, this DVD is worth it, and I would ignore the comparisons to Star Trek. The only thing really common between the two is that they both involve great storytelling! GR Andromeda employs dynamic characters, imaginitive technology, and very good writing for the most part. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Andromeda","review":"This is a great show. It goes along with the star trek type of genre, but is different. Instead of a world of order it is chaos. A sole ship with a crew of six are trying to pull a universe together against greater foes.

Spiritual salvation awaits us through the Ancestral wisdom as translated by Baba Ifa through the Ifa tradition. Some years ago, baba Ifa was given the charge by the Yoruba Elders to \\"bring the people\\" back to tradition and that he is doing. This book serves as yet another testimony that this wonderful child of Obatala is someone to listen to and follow in this day and age of spiritual regression. The sacred Odu Ifa tells us that there is no child-bearing woman that cannot give birth to Orunmila. Could it be that Orunmila's spirit has been reincarnated in Chief Ifa Karade.

Sabine, a girl blessed (or not) with psychic abilities, tries to live a normal high school life, but it proves to be difficult, if not impossible.As I finished Book #3 in The Seer series, I was wary over Sabine's impending move back home. The move was not a disappointment, however, due to continued involvement from the series' other main characters. Additionally, the glimpses into Sabine's former life serve to develop her character even further, and getting to know her sisters has the same effect.As I tend to become emotionally attached to favorite book characters, I continue to be concerned about Nona's health and hope that Sabine finds the fourth charm in Book #5.

Apparantly, there's an unhappily married woman (Theresa Russell) who keeps fantasizing that the son she gave up for adoption has come looking for her. He appears in the form of Oldman, but he acts like a bratty three year old, and the sequences involving him and Russell are just too odd to explain. And then there's her husband (Christopher Lloyd), who has this weird fascination with trains and masochism...but that's a different story.

I'm also a lover of all things sugary and sweet. This, however, was a bit much for my stomach to handle. I think all those years of American processed sugar may have made my tastes a tad weak. I could only eat about one and a half solid before giving two to my dad (which he did not like. Said the same thing--too sweet) and melting the rest for a molding cast test. Where they were not my cup of tea, they might be just the thing for someone else. If you're in to super sugar sweet, they're just for you. If not, you might want to stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"The snore of the year.","review":"From the lame Vaughn-Oliver ripoff cover art right down to the Tom Petty middle of the road sound, Pistolero is a real disappointment. I've already sold my copy. The inspiration that was evident in his first three solo cd's has all but died. What's left is a boring rock effort with small glimmers of what could be--- checkout the intro to \\"I Switched You\\" and the intro to \\"So.Bay.\\" The rest just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me..","review":"It's so strange nowadays when I look at all these great reviews albums are getting by so many people but just can't find myself liking the music. It's so strange that musical gods always flicker really bright in their first few showings and then fade off into repetition and egotistical nonsense in latter ones. 'Cult of Ray' gave me some hope that this Pixie could still keep it together, but I think there was some magic having the great talent of Kim Deal running basslines and Joey whining his axe, pretending to be a rock guitar god. Now all of that's gone, and the magic's getting harder and harder to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Retire","review":"Frank Black is gettting OLD!

With Pistolero (the best of the three), the big man has shed the ghost of Kim Deal et al and established himself as a great modern rock songwriter. The Catholics not only add consistency to newer Black offerings, they are an incredibly tight band who can manage anything Sir Francis throws at them. The album's standout track, \\"I Switched You\\", should put to rest any worries that there isn't life after the Pixies, and will long be remembered as a classic standout during Black's no-nonsense, intense live shows. All of Frank's trademark pop-surf-thrash offerings are here, void of any rules and with enough key and tempo changes to keep everyone happy. Best of all, the Catholics keep up...and keep Black on course..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Frank Black is God, I cannot be an atheist!","review":"If you havn't already converted to Catholosism, I recommend the \\"holy ramage\\" of Frank Black.

This eclectic sampling offers the listener several thoughts to ponder, ranging fron the space born phenom billy radcliffe to the utopian so. bay. If frank black were to retire tomorrow, he would be remembered for putting out a definitive, raw masterpiece as his farewell album.....long live frank black and the catholics....long live spin art for signing on a musical genius....let's hope this is a long-standing relationship with many albums to come in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's not the Pixies front man anymore","review":"When I first heard this album I was blown away! I am a huge pixies fan, but the only album I've really listened to of his solo stuff is \\"Cult of Ray\\" (an experience in mediocrity). I was wondering what this new band could do, well now I know Frank has the old magic back. This is a collection of 14 excellent songs. Frank Black could have gone in about 50 directions after the pixies, the sound he has chosen works. Totally grounded in a rock sound he manages to get the energy and unique song writing that made the pixies so captivating to listen to. Some of the standout tracks (hard to find when the whole album is so good) are \\"I Love Your Brain\\" \\"85 Weeks\\" \\"You're Such A Wire\\" and my personal favorite \\"So. Bay\\" I can not say enough good things about this album, it is up there with his work as Black Francis in the pixies.

The new \\"Catholics\\" configuration sounds tighter than on the previous album. While \\"Pistolero\\" doesn't reach the peaks of his first 2 solo albums, it is also his most consistently solid album -- every song is superb, and many are simply gorgeous (and very, very loud). Like the best of his work, this album demands frequent and exclusive listening over a very long period of time. FRANK BLACK IS THE MAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, this guy is great!","review":"Frank's first album with the Catholics was good, but \\"Pistolero\\" is really great!

The book was very entertaining and kept my interest from chapter to chapter. It had just the right amounts of paranormal happenings, romance & mystery to keep me wondering what was going to happen next. It was long enough to be able to provide background info on the main & secondary characters which allowed for the reader to become invested in their outcome. A great read, the only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star was I felt the ending after the fire was so abrupt. I would have liked to have a bit more of a peek into Chris & Rita's happily ever after."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was interesting...at first","review":"The book started off interesting, a mix of an intriguing mystery and a daunting romance while some might say the dash of paranormal was to much I felt it pulled the reader in making them ask more and more questions(as a good suspense should) like a high speed chase that only got more dangerous as it continued and then it stopped. I'd hate to spoil it for people interested in reading this book but a little more than halfway through the book I felt as if between all the twist and turns the author had gotten lost and in an attempt to stop from further confusing herself took a u-turn and what should have been a stunning and dangerous reveal was cliche,annoying,disturbing and at parts downright childish. Now you may ask how can a book go from a high speed suspense to downright awful well to find that out you'd have to read the book but here's my advice instead, why don't you save your time, your money and just read another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me guessing","review":"Great book, great storyline.

Jaime Rush (Tina Wainwright) paints a first-rate picture of New Orleans during Mardi Gras, including long standing family traditions that surround the festival.The paranormal vision Rita experiences while in a coma is very minor to the storyline. Being a one-time occurrence, it could have been omitted without hurting the overall story. The simple desire to meet the man she believes she has fallen in love with online is enough motivation to send Rita to New Orleans once she learns he has tried to commit suicide.(Thankfully, the author works in the realization that online personalities and reality are not necessarily the same.)The identity of the murderer is well hidden. While I guessed early on a pertinent fact about the killer, I did enjoy trying to pin down their exact identity.I look forward to reading more books from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Usually when I can figure out a story before the ending, that immediately drops it by at least a star.

It's surface is all 1950's naivete and blustering innocence, but the March wind quickly blows the surface away. This is really a play about lonely people who either don't have a home to go to, or would rather face a cold road than a cold room. It's full of characters who make us laugh while they work out how to find warmth (in friendship, romance, or self-respect) in a dingy Kansas diner. It's worth the time. Enjoy it with a cup of cocoa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kanji and budo","review":"Dave Lowery uses shodo in basic Kanji vocabulary to gives us insight into budo and zen. Shodo is the Way of calligraphy.

As a paramedic student, the topic of ECG's and cardiology is already complicated and confusing enough as it is. Anyone who is new to ECG's will not understand this book at all!

I highly recommend picking up this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Masterpiece","review":"This album is musical literature. The production and track quality is of superb quality, and the soul-warming vocal harmonies accompanied by the tantalizing piano grooves leaves me salivating.

This is an entire of CD of that experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The other reviews are misleading - Stay away!","review":"I picked this up due to some of the hype and the positive reviews here... I don't know *what* the other reviewers were thinking! There was nothing original or new here, and the music, apart from being trite and unoriginal, just wasn't very good. I found myself forced to skip past certain tracks on several occasions because I couldn't take it any more. Definitely not worth picking up unless you want to satisfy the sort of curiosity that killed the cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Overall this album was disappointing for me. While some of the melodies were agreeable, the lyrics lacked originality and were often trite. The most lacking part of the album, though, is not the lyrics but Spencer's voice. He seems determined to push his voice beyond its capabilities and this results in an almost painful nasal sound on several songs that forced me to change tracks. The slower tracks are more pleasant to listen to, but overall there's really just not very much here to merit a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh, stay away","review":"I've heard four of the tracks on this album. They're produced well, but it's the kind of music you'd play if you were a highschool kid with minimal keyboard skills to impress vacuous girls. Don't let the slick production fool you, these tired chord progressions and the mediocre singing make the... lyrics even less tolerable. Do not buy this album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Your Valentine","review":"Romance - going well or going out the door - is the inspiration for poetry set to music and performed by Spencer Bates. Most of the tracks tell intensely personal stories with a longing, lyrical voice well accompanied by keyboard and occasional drums. The title track, \\"Everybody Has a Song,\\" emphasizes the universal nature of Bates' work."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Godzilla book","review":"I am 7 years old.

My mistake. I bought the super sized and they are HUGE! They are at least a 1/4 inch wider in diameter than the super plus tampon of another major brand. I would have been scared of these things if I hadn't had two kids. I would not suggest these tampons to anyone with a light flow. The tampon itself is rectangular and is not comfortable when you remove it (even when saturated), plus the string is quite flimsy. The applicator is alright, but it can scratch when you insert it. The only good thing about this tampon is that it didn't leak. It's back to the old tampons for me!

I had never even strummed a banjo before buying one. I purchased this Murphy Henry DVD at the same time. I could not be more pleased with her teaching method and with my playing success in such a short period of time. I would recommend this DVD to any aspiring banjo player.

What I found was that the author and his family founded Son-Rise not based on any real knowledge of autism, but on New Age beliefs. The book is full of pseudo-Buddhist writings about the power of positive thinking, but contains very little accurate information about autism.From what I have seen, the Son-Rise Program is very much like a cult, promising the impossible (\\"recovery\\" from autism) to people who attend their workshops and pay for their services.

They are made of cardboard, and not resistance at all...plus they bend easily too. This one is exceptional, and the figurines are made of plastic, so no worries there. The characters are all on the board as well, (Tiko, Isa, Swipper, ect) and make the game slot more fun...the other canday, to me is boring. This one is worth any extra you have to pay and it's good for boys or girls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all","review":"I have always heard of Candy Land, but as a child, I never played that game. I did decide that it was time for my kids to learn about playig board games. They loved it. I got it for my three year old daughter (A big Dora Fan) and all she cared about at first was the big Dora picture on the box. I set up the game, and didn't have to tell her anything except: pick a card and move the amount of color spots that you are told. She understood right away. This is the perfect game to teach kids the main concept of playing board games. All of my other children love it (her twin brother and my 5 year old son). They all decide when they want to play, and each have their favorite game piece (the boys alternate between Diego and Boots). I can't help but play this game with them too. I highly recommend this game for children. As long as your child knows the main colors and can couunt to five, he/she can play this game. My only regret is not getting it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game for little Dora Fans!","review":"I just recieved this game in the mail today and played it with my daughter that is 3 1/2 years old, She loves Dora! She was very excited to play this game and it was hard to keep her from wanting to move the pieces in the wrong places. She wanted to play with all the characters but had to realize you can only use 2 of them when playing with just 2 people. She liked that at the end of the game Dora (or whomever you choose to play with) gets to go to a party at the end of the game. It is a fun game for little kids. I don't think this game is very educational for my daughter since she already knows all her colors. But, if it teaches patience, that might just help in the future. The figures that come with this game are pretty durable and can make nice little toys if your child became bored with the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could get this game","review":"First time I ordered this version, I received a different version--the one with the cardboard characters as the pieces, which sells for $12.99 in Toys R Us.

I wrote to the vendor and was informed that it was Amazon who made the error. I'm sending this one back too.

It is not. The tips it gives you at the beginning are ok, but it goes downhill from there.In the English section, questions seem all right. But in the Math section, some of the questions have no answer which is correct, and some just make no sense at all. The Reading Comprehension section is decent, but the Science Reasoning sample test is simply AWFUL. The answer explanations make no sense at all, and at many points, they omit diagrams that are needed to answer the questions.

I first borrowed it, along with other books, from a local library. I liked it because it was the newest book that I found, and it also had many great pictures, including a section that shows how to bathe, comb out, and properly trim a Bichon. I also learned alot about breeding, and the birth process. The only thing in the book that I don't think that I agree with is on page 96. It starts out \\"Dogs do not understand words\\", and refers to using different tones of voice for praise and reprimanding. Overall though, the section on training was good, and also the chapter on health care and possible diseases was enlightening. Of all of the books I have seen, this one is my favorite by far. The biggest reason I purchased the book was the colored picture section on how to bathe, comb, and trim, with step-by-step instructions. It's a winner!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work--especially in these trying times","review":"This is a fine volume of work which all leaders should read--especially in light of today turmoil.

As a reference book, it's too incomplete to be of use. Harkness's own assessments of the various winners are too brief, perfunctory, and devoid of wit to be of any real interest. Maybe the writing of too many capsule reviews for NOW magazine has turned Harkness's mind to mush. It's hard to say which more amply demonstrates the \\"great\\" man's dearth of talent or intellect, this book or his weekly reviews, but either way, it's pretty obvious Harkness isn't exactly the William Hazlitt of film critics.

It keeps promising that it will show you good stuff but after 400 pages I am still not sure what it wants to explain. The first three chapters are an idiotic attempt to explain the difference between XML and HTML. Then at the end of each it always says it will become clear if you keep reading. Apparently the authors are not knowledgable enough to write a technical book and they haven't grasped the essense of XML. Sure they can write a lot but all the pages are made of long paragraphes that don't make much sence. I will be much better of just reading the spec. This book is a waste of time and money.

The authors constantly repeat material. The whole of the book is only about 40 pages, repeated over and over and over. In several instances, they even used the same EXACT text, they just cut-and-pasted to make the book look bigger. The book contradicts it self so many times I gave up after only 249 of the 788 pages. This book was obviously written by people who know nothing about XML. It reminds me of those papers I wrote in school when you had to stretch a 1/2 page paper into a 5 page essay. To be fair to the authors though I have read reviews on the other XML books in Amazon, and it looks like they are pretty much all below-standard quality.

Perhaps not the best book for beginners, but I think the assumption is that if you know about XML, you are not one.The book is readable, well designed, and best of all they use my favorite format: They discuss a particular feature until every point is clear, then show an example in the 'Immediate Solutions' section. You can actually learn XML by reading this book and trying the examples. What a concept!I have read and returned a few XML books by the so-called masters, including the one by Goldfarb, and found them to be poorly written, obscure, or overpriced marketing tools(e.g. the XML Handbook.)The XML Black Book is the only XML book currently available that won't make you feel like you wasted your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never buy another book by this publisher again","review":"Clearly the authors of this book were paid by the page and not by the content. The book rambles on repeating subjects over and over throughout 600+ pages.

There is no coherent logical structure to the book. Each chapter seems to have been written in isolation to the others. As a result, simple material covered in earlier chapters is repeated again and again, and some material that should be presented early in the book is left until far too late (e.g. XML entities are left until after XLink!). Simple to grasp ideas are constantly re-explained from chapter to chapter, while more complex issues (e.g. some of the DTD syntax) are skimmed over are not explained at all (one suspects the authors did not understand them).There is also too much \\"selling\\" of XML.

I think Eggnog is one of the better Melvins albums to throw on that will make you, the listener, feel completely satisfied and make those idiots down the hall run for cover.

Then a bizarre scream erupts and you get the feeling that he's either going to die or.....well, die. The bass and drums rock out behind this for a few seconds, then...ah! a return to the pounding drums from the beginning. Then it's all over. If this sounds intriguing to you, then pick this cd up.

The two situations where this tripod may still be useful for me are (1) taking very long exposures - shutter-induced vibrations may not play a significant role then, and (2) using the tripod velcroed to some other support - this may work, but I'm a bit worried about entrusting camera to the velcro.All in all - this tripod is not very useful for the type of camera I'm trying to use it for.

Errors were found in the text and end-of-chapter problems. The extreme scarcity of worked problems and review questions with answers made it difficult for a student to test his or her grasp of the concepts. There is no study guide. Furthermore, the problems at the end of the chapter often relate poorly to what was stated in the chapter's text. As a result of these shortcomings, I turned to other, more established spectroscopy texts for clearer descriptions and understandable examples. Perhaps later editions will improve upon the first; however, I would advise against buying this text and recommend a more established spectroscopy textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I'm using this book in an introductory organic spectroscopy class, and have found it to be both mildly obscurantist and riddled with minor errors.

This being their latest studio CD, I expected a lot. The biggest problem I found was a lack of exciting or even catchy songs. And the playing isn't bad, just a little boring. Supposedly (source from Rhombus Web forums) the producer was going for a \\"pop\\" feel, which is accomplished in a polished sound. The problem is, by polishing away the instrumental sections in which the Wu excels, you place the burden on the songwriting. And to reiterate, the straight songs aren't bad, just a bit unexciting. To the album's credit, song 2, \\"Minnesota Moon\\" has a real swinging feel to it, which I really enjoy. I'd like to also add that in the context of the band's natural setting (a live performance) some of these songs such as \\"Boxing Day\\" are given new life. Still unless you're a die-hard Wu fan and have to own every CD, put this one at the end of your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Song review","review":"I don't actually have this album yet, as it came out today, but I do know all of the songs because they are all live songs. 1)Angie O'Plasty - cool song, not amazing but a fun listen. 2) Minnestoa Moon is an awesome bluesy tune. 3) Boxing Day - a great ballad, one of my favorite Wu tunes. 4) Two Person Chair - old song, another fun one. 5) Oxygen is even older, another cool song. 6) Elani is pretty weird but once again it's fun and bluesy. 7) Kensington Manor is one of the best songs on here. 8) House of Wu is a cool bluegrassy song. 9) SOS is amazing. I'm sure they shortened it a lot for the album but the jams in it are great. and finally...10) Shantytown is the most upbeat of all these songs, it has a sort of ska feel and overall excellent.

Did not even want to give it one star..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Staps","review":"I bought this rocker for my second child and returned it the next day. First, I thought it would rock on its own based on the price, but it does not. Second, a five-point harness may be the safest way to go, but does not seem necessary for this item. It takes too long to strap my child in and is very complicated! I will continue to use the two inexpensive ones I have from my first child. They do exactly the same thing and are easier to manage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"I registered for this item and got it at my baby shower. I used a very basic one in the beginning and my daughter absolutely loved it. So I tried her in this seat and it is terrible. The seat just stopped vibrating on its own. None of the buttons work on it anymore (after using it once), the batteries dont last long and the toys hanging barely got noticed by my little one. Don't waste your money on it because it stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Life Saver!!","review":"I cannot say enough nice things about this rocker - it has been a life saver. I ended up having an emergency c-section, so I was unable to climb the stairs to my and the baby's bedrooms, so he slept in this rocker (the back of the seat goes down) as a bassinet on the floor right next to me on the couch. Now that he is more aware of life around him, we lift the seat into the chair position and he just has the best time watching everything that is going on. The fact that it rocks and has the vibrating motion has also been extremely valuable. He has spent so much time in this chair - I am very happy that I got this as a gift. It's also great that you can hook a CD player or tape player up to the speakers as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This rocker has been great for our daughter. She just turned four months and has been using it since she was just a few weeks old. Now that she is bigger, she loves to use the adjustable foot rest as a kicking place and gets so excited. We use it all around the house - while I am taking a shower, when we go outside, while we are eating dinner and while she is watching videos. Also - the vibration is great and she loves to be rocked (a nice option that you don't see too often). While the colors may be a bit boring (as another reviewer commented), she really does not seem to mind. I just wish they made one of these in my size :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not crazy about it","review":"I chose this rocker for my baby shower. It's a nice looking one, no crazy colors as the others (that's one of the main reasons I chose it). My son is not crazy about it. He keeps on sliding down on it, the vibration and the 3 attach toys does not calm my baby either. Save your money and buy something well worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lemon!","review":"I bought this for my daughter and she didn't care for it. I was not impressed with it either. It's not easily portable from one room to another, it's heavy and I found it to be a pain to fold up. It just proved to me that spending more money on something doesn't mean you get what you pay for. I had to return it to the store because the vibration wouldn't work on low speed and most of the time not at all on either speed, so I exchanged it for another one only to have the same thing happen to that one as well. Needless to say I decided to try a different brand. I got a Fisher Price bouncer, paid sixty dollars less for it than the Combi and my daughter loves it, the vibration works every time and the toy bar with music is wonderful too. I don't reccomend the Combi bouncer to anyone, it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"As a new mom of twins, I received this along with many other similar items at my baby shower. This is by far the worst product of it's kind. It is almost impossible to get a baby into the harness. Once the baby is in place, all the rocker does is vibrate - fast or slow. Being advertised as a \\"rocker\\", I thought it would rock automatically. You can rock it with your foot, or with your hand, however, it isn't even inclined enough to really rock smoothly. Additionally, it doesn't play music, and the toys that are attached are dull and boring. My boys did not like being in this rocker at all. If you are looking for such a product I highly recommend the Fisher Price Baby Papasan Bouncer. It is comfy, it vibrates and plays music. My boys loved that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Work","review":"The concept of this rocker/vibration chair makes sense. However, the vibration part broke after two weeks. I had to keep pressing the low/high buttons to turn it on even with a brand new battery. Sometimes, it wouldn't even start with a new battery. I think it would be perfect if they made the vibration more reliable. The rocker part is awesome. My first son had a bouncer, this time I have the rocking bottom and it is definetly a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I did not like this. I ended up giving it away. It was just nothing special. Plus it was awkward getting the baby in and out of it. The only thing I liked was the color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Rocker","review":"Although I haven't used the rocking and vibration feature on this rocker yet, my 3 week old baby sleeps very comfortably in this rocker. The fact that it lays flat for infants and then converts to a sitting position for toddlers is an excellent feature. So far my baby loves sleeping in this rocker throughout the day, sometimes for 3-4 hours straight, which is why I have time to write this review. I gave it 4 stars since it seems to be serving it's purpose so far. However, I have only used it for three weeks. Hopefully I won't be disappointed as time goes on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit 92A1","review":"I'm sure this fits a Beretta 92FS just fine, but it does not fit a Beretta 92A1 at all.Product description says \\"fits most Beretta 92 and 96 models.\\" It definitely doesn't fit a 92A1.Not the end of the world... I've used a heat gun to heat the kydex and reshape it to profile around the slightly different frame dust cover and accessory rail on this gun that makes it different than a conventional 92/96. It was only a $20 holster so minimal risk in comparison to investing $70 or so into a Comp-Tac or Blade-Tech holster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle Mike's did it again!","review":"I recently bought this holster with thoughts in mind of how I wanted it to work for my gun. It stood up and exceeded my expectations! I would recommend this holster to any one who wants or needs a holster for a Walther P99 Compact. It's a great holster from Uncle Mike's.....great for any one, from civilians look for a slim holster to law enforcement looking for a holster for there service gun. Thanks again Uncle Mike's!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain","review":"I purchased the Uncle Mikes Kadex holster for my 1911 and I'm very happy with this purchase. The gun fits perfectly in the holster and it appears to be nicely made. I use this holster in a practical pistol league so fit and function are very important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Tight","review":"This holster is supposed to fit a G-30. I loosen the tension screws until they were about to fall out and the gun will not go into the holster without pulling the slide back and out of battery. Maybe it just needs broken in and some fine fitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Holster","review":"Good Holster especially for the money. Good speed with adjustability.

The rivets turn on the back side and I can't loosen in enough for my Springfield to comfortably release. So I am pretty frustrated because I have not been able to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fit","review":"Following the adjustment instructions, I have it just right so my gun clicks in place but can be drawn when needed. I did not give it 5 stars because I think the paddle could be improved. It is difficult to just slide on like other holsters. It takes some effort to put it on your hip/waistband but I guess that helps with retention when the gun is drawn. On the plus side, you can adjust the angle of draw. This was the best Kydex holster that I could find that did not carry a warning about accidental discharges. It must be a better designed holster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great holster","review":"Great holster at a great price. Half of what I would have paid locally. I have a lot of paddle holsters, but this is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"liked the product had to send it back","review":"this product stood out too far from my body to be well concealed. had to send it back. it is a fine product wish i could of used it"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good instruction.","review":"i have never done yoga before. This is my first time doing yoga. I was struggling between paying money for classes or buying a instructional video and doing it at home. I am glad i chose the later. This video/dvd shows you steps by steps to learn yoga. i have been doing it for 1 months, and i feel better every time after i have done it for 1 hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I totally disagree with the reviewer that said these dvd's aren't really for beginners! I just started doing yoga and first I tried the CRUNCH brand dvd's for beginners and they were IMPOSSIBLE! I almost decided against yoga after that, but figured I'd try one more different brand. I chose yoga zone on a whim and am SOOOOO happy with them. The instructors start you from the very beginning and always tell you what you can do to make it easier if youre struggling. I would recommend these tapes to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not REALLY for beginners","review":"Each of the DVDs included in this set are labeled \\"For Beginners\\". Unfortunately, none of the workouts are completely for beginners. I have been doing yoga off and on for a year now, and I still was not able to get into some of the poses included in the workouts. Was quite frustrating because I was following along pretty well, then all of a sudden there came a pose in each of the workouts that I was completely unable to do, with no instruction on how a beginner might perform a modified pose. Also, no instruction included on how to breathe, or get into poses correctly. Each workout is 20 minutes or less, which was also discouraging. NOT a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"mainly, it's for the birds","review":"The Birds enjoyed considerable success when it was first produced in the 1920s, but I'm guessing that was essentially due to the opera's built-in need for imaginative staging, as most of the characters are depicted as birds.Thus it is with this Los Angeles Opera production - clever costumes & sets supported by good singing from soloists & chorus.But The Birds must fly or flop by the quality of the music, & the music never really takes off, fluttering erratically from one style & mood to another. Braunfels evinces no stylistic voice of his own, & the score is a hodge-podge of echoes of other composers & even other centuries.Was it intended to be a serious symbolic drama? Or a semi-serious satire? Hard to tell, but should we care, one way or another? I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Book 4","review":"Queen Betsy. Need I say more? Well probably. I really enjoy these books. They are quick reads and I feel like I really know the characters. This book was better than the last and leads you to wonder what is in store for Betsy during the next book! Will she get married? Will she rule all the vamps forever? Glorious stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Vampires, sex, love and danger. I have been reading this series and it just keeps getting better and better. You do need to start with book one as these books are a series and Betsy's story develops in each new book. If you like the Sookie Stackhouse novels by Charlaine Harris, you will love this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first 4 were a lot better","review":"I haven't enjoyed book 5 very much. It feels as though the author lost her steam...the first 4 were great though!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Betsy Series","review":"I read the whole series and can't wait to read the next book. I liked it so much I started reading her Fred mermaid series. She is hilarious! Some of their conversations sounds like something out of my own journal not that I am a vampire or would want to be. I caught myself laughing out loud.If you like Betsy try FRED! I liked them so much I am buying the books for my home library so I can read them again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stupid","review":"In a genre pretty much beaten to (un)death, Undead and etc. tries to exhume the moldering corpse of a cliché and breath some life into it by merging with Shopaholic and Brigit Jones-ish chick lit. But it's all as derivative and DOA as you might imagine. With its heavy-handed Harry Potter cribbing, this might qualify for low grade YA reading if not for the (boring) sex scenes.As it is, the characters are at best uninteresting and/or annoying. This is especially true of the lead character, Betsy, Queen of the Undead. I haven't read any other of the series, and so can't imagine what makes her worthy of her title, but then I certainly don't care enough to find out. Not the worst book I've ever read, but not that far from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of brain candy...","review":"I always view MJD's books as brain candy. They are fun, short and effervescent with a simple plot. However this one fell short of even brain candy. I couldn't discern a recognizable plot in this story. I'm holding out for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undead and Unpopular","review":"I adore Mary Janice Davidson. Her heroines are sassy and smart, her heroes are Hot and her plots are quirky!This book in the \\"Betsy, Queen of the Vampires\\" series was fun, fun, fun. I can't wait until the next one comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly bad book.","review":"There is a fine line between witty, sexy and funny books and books that are so overloaded and busy in an attempt to be witty, sexy and funny that it all turns into gray mush. I have finally realized that every Mary Janice Davidson book is a crap shoot as to which side of that line she will land on. This book is mostly gray mush. It's busy, boring and because MJD never establishes a flow for the story, it's all very staccato. And Betsy is getting more bitchy and schizo and not-cute bratty. If you want to keep pace of things, buy a latte, curl up at Borders and read it right there. Trust me, once you're done, you're not going to want to take this one home for a reread."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the meat!!!","review":"Each successive \`Betsey' book seems to be getting shorter and shorter. This book qualifies more as a short storey or novella rather than a novel. Ms. Davidson, this is not the way to keep your readers happy! Character growth is nonexistent, and what's with the Zombie? Big build up...then nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this author smoking?","review":"I'm returning this book. The main character has become a BIMBO to the Nth power with no common sense. M.J. Davidson's writing is weak, underdeveloped characters, and reads like a diary of a 15 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing that spark","review":"As another reviewer said, this book was very thin, in plot, in characters etc. Betsy is starting to become annoying, with her 'it's all about me' attitude. As for her being queen of the vampires-Why!!, she doesn't appear to be stronger(if anything she's weak and just mouths off alot-She's just plain rude to everyone.) When this series first started MJD said she was only going to do five books, maybe she should have stuck to that. I won't be buying anymore hardbacks that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I liked the previous books of the series, but this one was very disappointing. All the characters, including Betsy, were unsympathetic. The very short novel (novella?) rambled from one idea to another with no real plot. And WTF was the zombie all about?While there were a couple of amusing lines, I didn't find any laugh-out-loud moments. The smug mention of Undead and Unwed was annoying instead of clever.If you've read the other Undead books, by all means read this one. The next one might be novel length and focused. If not, the next one will be the last of the series for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undead and unpopular","review":"The book just wasn't up to standards of the others. It was ok but I would not save it to read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing I got it at the library","review":"Okay, I'm a huge MJD fan, but. . .I would have been seriously pissed if I paid for the hardcover price, because it is. . .A short read without much depth or action. Nothing, absolutely nothing happens in this book.What a waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & Confused","review":"So I am the typical MJD fan. Love everything the woman wrote UNTIL this book. Can't even call it a book. Just random thoughts and sentences someone out there edited into a book. Shame on that person! No shame on Maryjanice because I still love her. Everyone is entitled to a miss and this miss is huge. MJD can redeem herself by making this a \\"set - up\\" book and making this book pay off huge in her next \\"Undead\\" novel. Come on, MJD -- Betsy would throw her Prada Loafers at you for giving her fans this incomplete assignment the publishing company greedily bound into a hardcover. Then she, Laura and Jessica would calmly sit in Jessica's kitchen and make Mango Margaritas because we all know that Mango is the new Strawberry."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the bucks","review":"I was really disappointed in this latest edition of the series. It was short and boring....'nuf said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undead and Unpopular Needs a Plot","review":"I usually love MaryJanice but this book was seriously missing a plot. She left too many things unsolved. This felt more like a novella instead of a full novel. MJ please finish out these plot lines and stop dragging them along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undead and Board","review":"I was really looking forward to this book comming out,i really wanted it to pull my attention back as i thought the last one was lacking something (a real Plot). All the right elements where going to be there, zombies, unknown european vampires, and a friend with a possible incurable illness. However the polt just did not deliver for me.Sorry MJD but you just aren\`t grabbing my attention, and i loved the first three books.Betsy just seems to be going no where in the last two books, no character developement no suspence no anything. Lets have a few more pages for our money and lets see an enemy thats worth fighting , and lets have our Betsy do the fighting insted of some one else!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time and/or money","review":"I have enjoyed all of her previous books. However, she must have written this one in a day (or less). It feels as though she put very little thought and energy into writing this one. I was very sorry I spent the money to purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series takes a flop with this one","review":"This series was very enjoyable in the first couple of books, light-hearted, fun, and a quick read. Then, the publishers did what they frequently do: they figured if it was popular as a paperback original, now they could start it out as a hardcover and get more money. But this series just isn't hardcover material, folks, particularly in this outing. The story is so fleeting, there's just nothing to it. I agree with the poster who said it was more of a novellla than a novel. A dead (no pun intended) giveaway? A large type font and big white margins. Don't waste your money on this one, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost and Confused","review":"1st of all, I am a big fan of the Undead series so it hurts me to write this review. But it was horrible and confusing to read. There were so many characters from previous books and ones I have no clue where they came from that there was no depth into the main characters. Why bother writing about characters who have zero meaning to the story. The main storyline is a great idea but little was written about it and there was so much going on you never got a sense why the European vampires were there or if they hated Betsy so much that if they were going to kill her or accept her. The main character who was such a funny strong woman in the first three books has a major ego problem, self absurb, and too wise of a mouth that she can be quite annoying. I hope MJD's next Undead book gets more focused on 1 storyline and back on track to why people love the Betsy character so much. Otherwise, this series is dead to me.Finally, can someone explain the zombie in the attic?"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!

I've stayed up till all hours of the night reading this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Undead and Unpopular","review":"A slightly more serious side of Betsy emerges in this installment of the series. I absolutely love Betsy humor and the way she makes sense of things. It was interesting seeing a serious side to her. Ultimately she's determined to give up drinking blood, which I find hilarious, but boy does it make her cranky. In the end, Betsy takes care of the things that need taking care of and it also seems she decided fighting the urge to \\"drink\\" is not worth it. She's much happier with her fangs planted in Eric's neck and his in hers. Perfect match if you ask me.Can't wait for the next..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed by this entry in Mary Janice Davidson's Undead series. Undead and Unpopular lacks any real tension. It suffers from too much exposition and dialog. They are talking in the kitchen. They are talking in the parlor. They are talking in the bedroom. There really didn't seem to be much actual action at all. The menace implied by the European vampires never really seemed all that menacing. When I got to the end of the book I had to go back and check. I couldn't find a real climax to any of the action. I think that's the point. The action in this book was sorely missing. Betsy's self-centered whining is starting to get old, and there seemed to be a chapter I missed somewhere along the line. Probably some short story in an anthology. I dislike when authors assume you'll read every anthology they contribute to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undead and No Plot.","review":"This book is an example of a publishing house capitalizing on MJD's fan base. Instead of making one larger book, with a true plot line rather than the meager substance in Undead and Unpopular, they put out this small book IN HARDBACK to get more money.I am strongly disappointed in this book, its almost as if MJD's notes were slopped together in hopes of a last minute book.I have enjoyed the previous books, but this one was severely lacking.The zombie thing was totally random, and unmemorable. I can only hope it is building toward something in the next book. The quick tie up of loose ends at the end of the book, left me apalled.Again, I can only hope that the next book will improve, and that the publishing houses will not worry so much about capitalizing on MJD's works and more about the quality of the book, and how many people will stop reading when the writing gets too bad or expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"undead & disjointed","review":"There were few plot revalations in this book, lots of random events that weren't tied together well, and not enough progression of character or plot to make it worth a full entry in the series. And worse, it wasn't that much fun to read (which is the whole point of these books). I hope the author takes a lot more time producing the next in the series (and that she jumps straight to the wedding, which at least promises some intrigue). I took it out of the library; if I had paid for the book, I probably would be entering a single star -- NOT worth the hardcover price at all!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fabulous Somnolescent","review":"In case you aren't up on your medical/pharmacutical jargon, a somonlescent is a sleep-aid.

You lay out the cards and see if you have any \\"joined\\" pictures. Then you look up the meaning in the book.The book and the meaning of the cards are written in a down to earth style, It is also spiced with Russian folk sayings such as \\"Love isn't like a potato, you can't throw it out the window\\".If you are looking for something that is a bit exotic, but easy to use and follow, order this. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good cards","review":"These cards are the most powerful i have experienced.BUT,they are thin and get flimsy after a very short time.This is the third time i have bought new ones within a year.They should do something with the quality of the cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with purchase","review":"My purchase was received quickly.

I have multiple copies for gifts and in case anything should ever happen to my original deck, I have another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good parlor trick and evening entertainment","review":"The cards are truly beautiful in the way a mosaic pattern is created in the layout. The book is easy to understand and nicely packaged with the cards. I highly recommend this as a gift which is why I purchased the set. This is something to pull out after a nice dinner or later in the evening with a group of friends, enjoyably passing the time. Very entertaining.On the other hand, being a professional reader for many years, it would not be my subjective pick as an intuitive card tool, especially for a beginner learning to read for others. (And, if you are a true intuitive, you won't need cards at some point any way, other than for a very nice show.) If you are looking for Tarot deck, be a purist and go with the Rider-Waite (and/or derivative) or the Connelly deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!!!","review":"I was really looking forward to getting these cards - the concept seemed unique and fascinating. However, when I got them, I was very disappointed. There are too many gloom and doom cards (it would almost make you dread a reading) - and the explanations for the cards are very narrow as compared to tarot cards. There wasn't any room for interpretation, imagination, or getting that '6th sense' feel for the question you asked. If you love tarot because of the never-ending learning and twists and turns that comes with each reading, you won't like this method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian gypsy fortune telling cards","review":"My friends and I were not experienced card readers.

The other two I depend on are the Medicine Wheel cards by Jamie Sams and the Morgan Greer Tarot. Most of the others I had (other Gypsy cards, Cat, Dragon, Woman's Medicine Wheel, etc) I ended up giving away because I just couldn't get out of them what I can get from this set of Russian Gypsy Fortune telling cards.

I would have to say that I am a long way from quilting like Ricky Tims, but I have learned some practical techniques along the way and have some ideas I would like to develop furthur as a result of watching this DVD.

For example, any non-chemist will not care for the IUPAC names included, and may not have the scientific background that is assumed for some of the explanations. However, someone with a few years of chemistry studies under their belt will find this to be a gloss-over, and entirely unsatisfying. I have returned the item.

Most new Loebs I've examined have this same problem, and I've seen them fall out of the binding in less than a semester of use.

Elsa sees opportunity on every side (finding the ideal husband is one such opportunity), and outwits her sharp white competitors in the booming cotton business.

I understand that we're a bit into the weeds on Crusader history for most, but even for someone like me that has a genuine enthusiasm for the subject matter, this book is a drag, and is obviously written for a purely scholarly audience.

Weis and Hickman's superb characterization goes far beyond convention, and unlike most other Fantasy authors' black/white version of good and evil, Weis and Hickman create a universe in always changing shades of grey. Dragon Wing begins the Death Gate Cycle in Arianus, the world of air where war always threatens the mench (elves, humans, dwarves). This makes Arianus the perfect world for the patrons (a major Weis and Hickman addition) to conquer. This book is full of unbelievable twists that you will never expect.

The same goes for a good bit of punctuation where i's and exclamations frequently end up as italicized slashes. If you've read the book before, you'll likely pick up on issues quickly and be able to substitute as you read, but if you haven't you may be confused by terminology \\"changes\\" that happen sometimes even in the same paragraph.Its painful to believe that the publishing company (Spectra) didn't even bother having someone read the Kindle version before sticking it up on the Amazon store."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first book in Weis/Hickman's newest seven book series.","review":"Dragon Wing introduces readers to mysterious Arianus, World of Air, where isles of land float amongst the vast expanse of air, and where water is so scarce, that man, and elf, are willing to bring about a world war to obtain it and learn about the wonderous machine called the Kicksey-Winsey.

DragonLance (AWESOME), DarkSword (NO) and DeathGate (NO).This is a seven book set and if you can think the first books in this series are good then you may like them all. I thought this book (and the rest) were not even close to the stories of Dragonlance, and read all the books in this series thinking the story would get better. My friend also is a big fan of DragonLance and the LOTR an he agreed this series was a BIG disappointment.Read this book if you want, but don't blame me when you finish all seven and go..what a waste of my time, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman went from telling possibly the greatest story with the Dragonlance series to having writers block and producing seven volumes of blah!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring!","review":"This book is very boring. The characters are mildly interesting but there is very little development of the characters. Very bland. The book takes over 300 pages before anything gets interesting. I do give it credit for being different from your standard fantasy but it just doesn't have good content to keep one interested. Reading never felt like such a chore before this book. A word of warning as you go through these reviews, beware that some reviewers have given away some spoilers without warning. Read these reviews with caution if you do not want the ending of this book ruined for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally boring !!!!!","review":"This book has to be the worst fantasy I have ever read. At first I thought that the action would pick up eventually, but after I got half way through it I knew that I made a mistake. This whole book was about politics, I don't know about you, but if I'm going to read a book about politics it is not going to be about a situation that doesn't really affect me. I don't even think there was one GOOD battle scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Wow. I was amazed at how much my friends enjoyed this book. Actually, most of my friends liked the series as a whole more than this one book. I liked the whole series also, but the first book was not even worth reading. As one of my good friends put it, this book was just a set-up for the rest of the sequels. As advice to soon-to-be readers, skip Dragon Wing and start with the book Elven Star, the second book in the series. It was much more entertaining, and didn't even have the same characters as in Dragon Wing, so you will have not missed much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typo Wing","review":"Like other people have posted, the Kindle version is full of very distracting typos.

This book is quite disappointing. The content is superb but the presentation is horrendous. The publisher did a very poor job. Ringbinder is bulky, impossible to open quickly and flip through pages, pages are too thin, and font is ridiculously small. There are large portions of the pages left blank for \\"note taking\\" but ink bleeds through the \\"tissue paper\\" pages (You're lucky if you don't poke a hole through it first with the tip of the pen).

It covers every medicine topic, gives the information you need to know, and it's small enough to carry around in your coat. Perhaps most impressive is that it actually includes references to key articles! The references are in the text, they are unobtrusive, and if you need to read up on a topic, you know where to start. This book is perfect for medicine clerkship (and residency, according to the residents with whom I worked)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly complete and thorough.","review":"At my institution, virtually all of the students and housestaff that use a pocket manual use this one.

It had either the \\"Harrad Experiment (edited version)\\" alone or you could purchase the \\"Boy in the Plastick Bubble/Harrad Experiment 1976.\\" So, of course I thought this was the 1976 unedited version of the Harrad Experiment. WRONG. The 1976 was for the Boy in the Plastic Bubble only. the Harrad Experiment was 1973. I didn't even want the Boy in the Plastic Bubble.Oh, and by the way, it says unclut version for the Harrad Experiment on the back of the DVD once I got it, yet there is very obvious cuts, and of course no nudity. That is because it is the 1973 uncut version, which didn't have nudity in it.Live and learn. [...] I had always been happy with them up to this.I do have to say though that the movie was interesting. I'm glad I have it. I just wish I had the true unedited/uncut version."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more censorship please","review":"When I first viewed the film \\"Harrad Experiment\\" it was on VHS, the not censored version.

That version contains absolutely NO nude scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and switch","review":"I just purchased this DVD set and expected the original uncut version of the 1973 Harrad Experiment. It is not what you get. It is more like the R-rated version, 90 minutes long, and no frontal nudity. I have the original uncut version on VHS tape from Wizard Video and it is 95 minutes. About the only thing that was uncensored about this tape is the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harrad Experiment Still Censored!","review":"Despite the claims by Marango Films that they have restored this movie and now provide the unedited version, there is still no nudity in this version.

I can't make it through a chapter a night. I think I have to quit. The characters are boring (I'm halfway through); it's definitely not plot-driven - the reader can't hardly trudge forward.Ms. Cornwell had to have been experimenting when writing this book. I applaud anyone's attempts to stretch themselves, but this book should have just served as back-story for a real novel. What was her editor thinking? I am definitely not buying another one of her books just based on her name; I'll check out reviews in the future.As for this book, don't even pick it up!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stunning Disappointment","review":"Readers of Patricia Cornwell have come to expect suspense and excitement, strong female characters, clarity of content, and creative manifestations of evil. Isle of Dogs offers nonsensical digressions, obscure plot lines and motivations, simpering idiots for characters--male and female, slapstick and ridiculous scenarios.It might have made more sense for Ms. Cornwell to create a collection of creative essays based loosely on local history for entertainment purposes only. If her name wasn't on the cover, I would never have believed this was written by Patricia Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"Isle of Dogs truly is a DOG! Cornwell's previous works have been enjoyable but this effort was a great challange to complete. It was stupid and uninteresting.

Book totally misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is going on?","review":"All the avid fans of Cornwell's wait a year in-between books because of the wonderful story lines, great detail, and spine tingling thrills. This is the biggest disappointment of the year. Where is Scarpetta? This book is lame, boring, and drags on until you want to end up throwing the book out the window. From the remedial conversations between underwater sea life and idiotic police officers you will have a hard time getting through this one. Bring back Scarpetta and the quality of books we are use to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time/money","review":"I was so excited about the debut of this book and pounced on it the second it was available. I confidently shelled out the dough for the hardbook, knowing that I would love it as I do all of her books. I even bought my sister in law a copy for her birthday!What a disappointment! At page 146 I had given the book as much of a chance as I could and closed it for good. I thought it was supposed to be a glimpse at the comical side of Cornwell and I hope that is not so because I never once cracked a smile. The characters were weak and I did not really care about the plot in any way. Very boring storyline and zero action. I can't even say it was well thought out or particularly well written. I hope this is not an example of what is to come from one of my favorite authors. I had to take back the gift to my sister in law - it would have been an embarrassment to give her a bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the REAL Cornwell?","review":"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for many years and have watched her writing decline in her most recent books, even the Scarpetta books. But I was not prepared for this book. Try as I might, I couldn't finish it. The intended humor wasn't even humorous to me; rather, it was tiresome.

What a mistake! I read the whole thing since I didn't have anything else with me, and it didn't get funny, believeable or interesting even at the end. Since the other reviews here did a fairly good job of describing the book, I won't go into all the details, except to add that I was surprised that in this day and age any publisher would publish a book that relied partly on black dialect, in the vein of Amos and Andy, for humor. Cornwall also ridicules poor rural whites for more \\"comic\\" relief. I've liked some of Cornwall's other books, but this is very different, and just plain stupid, not to mention offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"A few pages into this book and I had the sensation of turning into Alice and slipping into Wonderland!

Perhaps she is running out of steam. Perhaps she was under pressure to produce. Regardless of the circumstances, the Isle of DoGs is disappointing. Save your money and go to the libary if you feel compelled to read it. It appears that Cornwell tried a \\"light hearted\\" approach to this book. The humor is heavy handed and produces more grimaces than smiles. If the author was not Patricia Cornwell, this book would not have been published.

I wondered if PC's latest offering was subtle beyond my understanding, but no, it's just garbage. That's the trouble with being a formula writer, step outside your formula and you're lost.

The catch is, Cornwell isn't in the least bit funny. As a result her readers got suckered.

Is she going to end up treating Kay Scarpetta the same way?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I own (in hardback) every book she's written.

Unfortunately, the animals are much more intelligent than the human inhabitants of Richmond. At the end of this rambling attempt at humor, I knew no more about any character other than most of them, while they can't pronounce even the most common words correctly, are all computer literate. I'm glad this wasn't Patricia Cornwell's first book or no one would ever have heard of her and we would have missed some great fiction. Not everyone can write humor and that's the best lesson here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Probably the worst book I ever completely read.

The publisher should be ashamed and refund everyones money.Save your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, I eagerly awaited the latest Cornwell novel, having read everything else by this author. Although I prefer Scarpetta, I'd enjoyed the previous Hammer/Brazil offering and was looking forward to renewing the acquantance. I managed only four chapters before I wondered whether I had the wrong book in the cover. I rarely leave books unfinished, but this one will sit and gather dust for a long time before I give it another try - if ever.

I applaud her desire and attempts to write stories about people and places other than her much loved Scarpetta series but, she should just stick to what she does best. It was the first book in a long time that I just could not finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a typical Cornwell novel would be an understatement","review":"Usually I finish one of Cornwell's novels within a day and it requires all my willpower to not finish it within one sitting. Not the case with this one. I am left wondering where the plot is headed with every page and what I am supposed to be laughing at if this is in fact a comedy. The switch between blind govenors and angelic serial murderers has me wondering whether it is worth finishing or not. But still, I trudge though hoping to find a glimmer of what I find in her previous work. I definetly DO NOT recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate!","review":"This book is a dud for this reader.

It will be a waste of your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Style -- and it Shows","review":"Patricia Cornwell is an undisputed master of the crime/mystery genre; her Kay Scarpetta series in particular is wonderfully executed. In \\"Isle of Dogs\\" Cornwell tries her hand at the dark comedy genre, in the vein of Carl Hiassen, and does okay, but no more. Perhaps Lloyd Bentsen would say to Cornwell, \\"You're no Carl Hiassen\\" and he would be right. Some gifted mystery writers can change genres (such as John Gisham and David Baldacci) but Cornwell seems to be trying too hard to be funny. It just does not really work. The reader is mildly entertained -- Cornwell does write well, and is easy to follow -- but ultimately we just do not care that much. So this reader requests: go back to what you do best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I have been the consummate Patricia Cornwell fan for as long as she has been published. If a new Cornwell appeared on the book rake in my neighborhood store, I would be one of the first to purchase the book. So without thinking when I spied \\"Isle of Dogs\\", I picked it up and was ready for a good read.I was terribly disappointed with this book. Certainly not up to her pervious efforts. The story lacked excitement. The characterizations were shallow and undeveloped. I kept reading the book in hopes it would improve, alas it did not. At the conclusion of the book, I didn't give a hoot about the characters,locale or storyline.I will certainly examine more carefully future Patricia Cornwell books before I waste time and money on a hardback novel. Suffice it to say, I felt I wasted my money,my time, and lost the opportunity to enjoy what little spare time I have, by losing myself in a GOOD book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of the Dogs","review":"Not one of Paticia Cornwells better novels.

Patricia Cornwell tries to reinvent herself --- or just try something a bit different than her usual Scarpetta cut-em-uppers --- and fails miserably. Her attempt at Carl Hiaasen style crime humor falls flatter than a lead pancake. Funny? This isn't even cute. What was she thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Purely Pitiful","review":"I bought this book because I trusted it would be on a par with Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series. Boy, was I mistaken! If you love Kay Scarpetta, DON'T read this one; it might turn you off to Cornwell forever, which would be a shame! Her talent is so much better than this! I've never seen so many ignorant, rude, angry, backstabbing, stupid, outright hostile, unlikable characters taking up space in one book in my entire life! I guess it's supposed to be witty and amusing, but I wasn't amused even once. I kept reading, hoping to see The Real Patricia Cornwell poke through somewhere and praying for even one character I could find sympathetic, but it didn't happen. <sigh> Don't waste your money or time on this one, gang!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia - How could you??","review":"I have read a number of Patricia Cornwell's books. I find them interestng and usually real \\"page-turners\\".As I read this one however, I was more and more disappointed. I managed to trudge forward thinking it would get better, after all this was Patricia Cornwell. Finally, when the trout and crabs were having a discussion in the trunk of the car I was rolling my eyes. But, when a protaganist began to talk like a pirate (it was genetic you see).... AAARGH... I could go no further. My book went in the trash... Sorry Patricia. I couldn't, in good conscience, even give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time reading this book!","review":"This was described as being some sort of black comedy. Unfortunately, there was no humor beyond what a third grader could think up. Not clever, not funny, not ironic - just stupid. I regret spending the time to finish this book.I have read plenty of her Scarpetta novels, so I would not have guessed that this turgid mess was what awaited me. I agree with another reviewer who said that if this book were written by anyone other than Cornwell it would never have been published. Having just suffered through 'Port Mortuary', I am afraid that Cornwell may be becoming incapable of writing another good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I ever read...almost","review":"I would say this was the worst book I ever read..... except that I couldn't make it thru more than a couple of chapters. Not even good as a sleep aid, or if you're low on paper in the outhouse. My condolences to the trees who were sacrificed. Why won't Amazon let me give it a zero....or a \\"-\\"?And yes, I was a big fan of Patricia Cornwell, back in those halcyon days when she could write a good mystery.... (Could Ms. Scarpetta do an autopsy and see if this is the real PC..... or some sad lookalike contest winner?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted a refund","review":"There is a certain betrayal that comes from loving an author's work for YEARS then having this lemon tossed in your lap at full price.

I have been trying to read this book for over two months and have had to make myself sit down and read just the first half. I am only half way through the book and am wondering what happened to Virginia West? The only reason I am going to finish the book is to see if her absence is explained. I hope that when I get to the end of the book, I won't feel like I have just wasted two days of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain absurd","review":"What a waste of time. The characters are ludicrous. The plot non-existant. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!!","review":"I have read EVERY Patricia Cornwell book, and this is absolutely the WORST of the bunch. She must have a contract to produce a certain number of books per year, because there is no way a publisher would ever print this book for a first-time author. A sophomore in high school would write something like this. It is horrid. It is garbage. I can't figure how I even finished reading it - I was hoping there would be something good about it. But no! It is a genuine stinker. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.And my wife didn't like it either.

I even enjoyed Southern Cross and Hornet's Nest, but where did this come from? Was it supposed to continue with that series? It was so drawn out and jumbled that I couldn't even finish it on Audio tape. Maybe it's just me but what happened to West? Things had just started heating up at the end of Southern Cross and now she is gone..what happened?

I can usually finish a Patricia Cornwell novel in 1-2 days. This time it took me 2 weeks. I couldn't not finish it - it's a matter of pride I suppose. I just kept thinking - it's got to get better right? But this was like drinking vinegar - yuck! Was this a cruel joke that some 5th grader turned in and got published using her name??? I wouldn't even donate this one to the goodwill - throw it in the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a real Dog","review":"I couldn't even finish this book it was so bad.

I agree with most everyone that we expect blood and guts from her and I have every book she has written. This wasn't my favorite but I still enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I feel compelled to defend this book. True, it's not like any Patricia Cornwell I've ever read, but who says you always have to be \\"nose to the grindstone\\"!I totally agree with another reviewer, that said this is a MUST LISTEN to book. The audio version is HILARIOUS. My husband and I listened to it on a vacation we took and both of us were laughing out loud at the outrageous characters that populate this book. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was for the slow start. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise from a favorite author","review":"Patrica Cornwell writes very well, and the forensic details and law enforcement trivia add a great deal to her usual books about Kay Scarpetta. I've read them all. But they are a *tad* on the dark side.I was pleased to discover that she can also write such a delightful book as Isle of DoGs, and I hope she'll write more along this vein.The characters are fun, the plot twists keep coming, and the dialog is fresh and interesting. You won't be able to put it down.My only objection was the plot point provided by a dog giving advice to her kidnapper. Talking crabs and trout are a pleasant conceit (what they say to each other is hilarious) but it's irritating when the story is affected by a clearly unbelievable piece of business.But it didn't seriously affect the outcome, so the bottom line is, this is a fun book with a plot worthy of Hiassen, but with more believable characters (the humans, at least)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit different, but fun","review":"I have just read all the bad reviews of this book and I have to disagree. I have to admit that at first I was disappointed that it was not the usual crime mystery series, but as I got into the the book I began to appreciate the humor in it. In fact, I must say that I have really enjoyed this book. It is really funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Doesn't Work","review":"I've read most of Patricia Cornwell's books and find her a compelling writer. I started this book and couldn't finish it - and I seldom give up. Some professional reviewers have given positive reviews of this book. I can't help thinking that it's out of respect for the author.As mentioned, I've not been able to put down some of her other books. Despite that, I've often wished she could 'lighten up' a bit. The angst and paranoia of her lead characters becomes a bit wearying at times. (Surely there must be a ray of light somewhere in their lifes). However, this book is not the way to go. The humor sounds forced and false. It doesn't flow naturally nor does the plot hold the interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who did she see as her audience?","review":"Once I start a book, I finish it. That is the only reason I finished this. I kept wondering who she thought her audience was. Teens? Pre-teens? Or did she think that she had an adult audience that liked spoofs of government and history? It certainly was not written for thinking readers of good detective fiction. Having read all of her older, good material, at least my reading this has saved me from wasting time on any more of her novels. I would have rated this book as a half point if that choice had been available."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 1- because there is no Zero!","review":"Patricia Cornwell has certainly had many story ideas, this 'novel' is many story ideas loosely thread together. Characters are introduced and then not developed. The 'plot' is not comic it is insultingly absurd. It reads as if it were written by a group of Jr. High students taking turns at alternating paragraphs. I finished it just to see if it could possibly be redeemed.It couldn't. It wasn't worth the time, money or effort.This is my first negative review ever but I had to....It is the most ghastly drivel I have ever suffered.Jim Dennis"},{"rating":"1","title":"hard read","review":"I made myself finish this book even though it was very hard to follow the story line.

We'll see....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell is coasting on her laurels","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's novels and have eagerly awaited each new story.Unfortunately her Last two novels, Isle of Dogs and her Portrait of a Killer (Jack the Ripper Forensics) were so bad that I was unable to finish either.I hope that Ms. Cornwell takes a note from one of her well educated fans. There's no doubt you've made your fortune on these excellent novels. It's better to write nothing than to publish such poor books as your last two. One misstep in a writers career may result in more caution from fans who previously bought new offerings without research or hesitation. Two in a row will cause many to be unwilling to take a chance a third time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly awful attempt at humour","review":"I love reading Cornwell's books but I was shocked at Isle of Dogs.

What a waste of exceptional writing talent !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was Cornwell ??","review":"If this book was written by Cornwell I'd be very surprised. In her non-Scarpetta books at least she was developing the Hammer and Brazil characters but the people by that name in this book don't even resemble them.

While her earlier Hammer/Brazil books were different from Scarpetta, they were accessible to fans.Somewhere there is a readership for this kitschy blend. Postmodern literature, the \\"no-rules genre\\", the gritty parody of contemporary social commentary and fanciful historical invention, sells widely internationally.How easy it would have been to publish under another name and then let it be known that this was another face of a well-known author. It would have seemed less a betrayal to her fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess !","review":"I've enjoyed the first two books in the series featuring Virginia Hammer but what on earth happened to this one??Was this churned out because of a book deadline?

This book had a few elements of what could have been an amusing and interesting book but I hope that next time the author gives Virginia and Andy something better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I am a huge Cornwell fan. I have read every book that has Kay Scarpetta in it. From Postmortem which had me walking around my house making sure that my windows and doors were locked. I can never wait for a new Patricia Cornwell book to come out. I got this book as a present and was so excited until I opened the book. Every attempt that she has made to write a book that doesn't have Dr. Scarpetta in them are terrible. I was getting my car fixed and sat at the dealership for 4 hours and couldn't even get through the first chapter. I thought maybe I just wasn't in the mood to read so I picked it up again, another day. Nope the book is just horrible. The charcaters are boring, the plot is boring, the whole thing is boring.

When we bought this book my husband read it first and put it in the trash pile. I thought that was a little severe and tried to read it.

Quite naturally, I embarked on the book with an open mind, free of the high expectations or deep prejudices that often tend to color a fan's opinion.

It seems as if Ms Cornwall had prepared outlines for 3-4 books and then ran out of time so just amalgamated them all together to produce a total mess. In some parts it is a history of Jamestown and surrounding islands. In others the characters are poor attempts at the Carl Hiassen genre of weirdos. Then we have a bit of Stephen King type supernatural influence. Surrounding this are the previously enjoyable characters of Hammer and Brazil. I have been a fan of Ms Cornwall since the beginning but this time I think I should ask for a refund. This is not a book that is worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Dog","review":"If you're looking for a good mystery story - this isn't it. The biggest mystery here is how this book ever made it to print.Having read all of Patricia Cornwell's books over the years, I was anxiously awaiting this new release. As usual, I started it as soon as it arrived, but soon found myself having to re-read the first chapter after having realized that it wasn't a dream sequence or being narrated by some psychopath. After I had endured nearly half of the book, a morbid sense of curiosity as to how bad it could get, compelled me to finish it. Believe me, this curiosity was not disappointed. The plot actually was not that bad, unfortunately it was the lack of support by the characters, situations, dialogue, etc. that ruined this story.In closing, if you enjoy finishing a book with the desire to read the next in the series, not the desire to send the author a bill for time ill spent, stay off the \\"Ilse of Dogs\\".MDS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Infantile humour","review":"I like Cammy Diaz's review but I hated this book. It was painfully boring, slow to start, slow in the middle, slow to end. The attempt at humour wouldn't even have made a 4-year-old laugh.A couple of the positive reviews attempt to portray this as a continuation of the Judy Hammer, Andy Brazil series. What a crock! Hammer has about 4 paragraphs in the entire novel and Brazil's character has no reasonable relation to anything in the previous books. Something like \\"find and replace\\" seems to have been used to change to the main character names so this book could be falsely advertised.It seems very much like Cornwell had been doing some recent research into Virginian history and wanted to find some way of incorporating it into a novel. The end result is the book is interspersed with childish monographs that fall as flat as the infantile humour of the entire novel.A hugely disappointing waste of time and I really tried to give this novel a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has she seen her neurologist?","review":"This book represents such a total departure from Cornwell's previous books that it makes me wonder if she has had a stroke or a brain tumor. Has anyone noticed a drastic personality change?I finished listening to the entire book looking for some redeeming value, some reason for it's existance. I failed to find it. The situations are unbelievable, and just barely funny. What is she trying to say?This book would never have been printed if the author was an unknown."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a long wait for a colossal disapointment","review":"I have read each of the Cornwell series and enjoyed every one until this one. I pre-ordered this book in March of 2001 and have been reading other writers works to occupy my time until this one came out and it took me over twice as long to read this one as most. This should have been penned under a different name so the readers would not associate it with her other works. I will not blindly pre-order another book until I hear that the next one is better. The 2 other books with Hammer & Brazil were not as exciting as Dr. Kay's but they were entertaining books. This book is just plain boring ! It wanders ! It is hard at first to even piece all the events together ! My copy is available for free if buyer will pay for shipping and handling ! I do not want it in my house !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth even the used book price!","review":"This book has many of the same characters that appeared in Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross, but they have different personalities and pasts than they did in the previous books.Carl Hiaasen and Tim Dorsey have proved that Florida is funny, and Janet Evanovich has proved that New Jersey is funny. Patricia Cornwell's Virginia, however, is not funny. The \\"humor\\" in this mixed-up book is less over the top than off the mark. Potty humor and cold-blooded killing and vapid historical insights - sigh. I just did NOT get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"After the first chapter or two, I kept reading only because I've enjoyed all other Patricia Cornwell books. I finally stopped reading when I realized that this book was so bad that it just could not be redeemed. What drivel!If it was meant to be funny, it missed the mark. I can't fathom what else it was supposed to be, though. The author owes all of her readers an apology! Frankly I am embarrased that I wasted so much time reading through double digit chapters. Please take my advice - don't waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book deserves NO stars!","review":"I have read ALL Patricia Cornwell books before this one. I liked the author enough to get on the list for hard covers at my bookstore. I only do that with one other author.

Yes, I too prefer Kay but Judy Hammer was OK until now. If I was the Gov. of Virginia, I would sue! Perhaps \\"Popeye\\" wrote the book while he was being held hostage.

I have been a fan of all your books for years and cannot believe how awful this book turned out. If you're trying to emulate Hiaasen,then don't try again!!! You failed miserably and let down your loyal fans. This plot has no suspense, no \\"what's going to happen on the next page?--I can't stop reading now\\" feeling to it.

Patricia stretched a bit TOO far on this one but I'll give her credit for trying. The class book this season for Cornwell readers, IMHO, is Hickam's Sky of Stone. A great, magnificent book that Cornwell fans will absolutely adore. It has a wonderful heroine, one of the first female mining engineers who is bound and determined to show she can get underground against the superstitions of the day. A great love story, too. Mr. Hickam, best known for October Sky, is definitely \\"mining\\" for Cornwell readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep....it's bad !","review":"I really enjoy the Scarpetta books and have no problem with Cornwell branching out into another series, but the three 'Andy Brazil' books so far have been hugely disappointing. 'Isle Of Dogs' has to be the worst of the lot so far. It's awful, has a stupid plot and characters that I failed to relate to or care about. I couldn't finish it, there was no momentum to the storyline and no suspense to keep me turning the pages. It's a shame because I was excited by the prospect of another series of books from Cornwell....but she's lost the plot with this one.I feel that she is losing a bit of credibility after this book and the 'Ripper' book which also mainly got panned. Hope she get's back to her top form soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It -- Evanovich It's Not !!","review":"It's tough to say something original about how bad this book is. I thought Cornwell's other two Judy Hammer/Andy Brazil stories were pretty good and a somewhat welcome departure from the ongoing saga of Kay Scarpetta and her niece. But this one is like dumb and dumber -- an assinine plot, little character development, a weak wrapup; basically the whole book is an attempt to prove (NOT) our usually great author could be as funny as she usually is serious. I totally agree with whoever said that if this were a first novel, it would have been rejected by one and all. Suggest you, dear reader, do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful.","review":"What the hell was that? I don't think I'm as well read as many here, so I don't know many of these authors being referred to, but to me it felt like a very poor attempt at writing like Dickens. It had the quirky characters, the serendipitous meetings of the characters throughout the book, the bringing together the characters at the end of the book, and even a character that makes some odd noise every time he speaks. (The pilot who always says \\"woo\\".) If that was the attempt, it failed miserably. In fact, whatever the attempt, it failed miserably. I don't care how stupid Windy is supposed to be, nobody gets every metaphor incorrect. It's not funny. And how the hell did Trooper Truth get so popular? How did anyone know to look for it on the internet, and if they happened to stumble across it, why would they ever read the idiocy twice? I could go on forever, but I'll spare you."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, bad, bad","review":"I used to like her books. I also like Carl Hiassen's books.This one isn't near Hiassen. I had to stop reading it after page 85 - this is trash. How could this book ever become #1 New York Bestseller? It must be the pull of the authors name. Don't spend your time or money on this book. It doesn't even deserve 1 star, it's a turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"at the top ten for worst books of the century.","review":"This book reminded me the scenario of Misery, the Steven King book where a crazy ex-nurse captivates her favourite author and turns him into his pet writer, going extremities to make him write the book she wants to read. I think this is what Mr. Cornwell suffered with this dupe. I cannot think any other way that a well-known and reputable writer can churn out this terrible garbage. Who was your Misery, Ms. Cornwell? Are you under the threat of death penalty? How could you or editor allow this pile of S---T to be published? After the last two very poor Scarpetta books (Trace and Predator), I am finally done with Ms. Cornwell. PS: Don't misread the review: MISERY is a suberp novel...only Cornwell's case suits best to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty - Bad - Horrible","review":"There are no words to describe exactly how bad this book really is. I was astounded that such a piece of writing could come from one of my favorite mystery writers. She must be taking a vacation & trying new things -- better to try & fail, I guess, than to wonder. Well, wonder no more! This is awful. One of the few books in my life I didn't bother finishing. Don't waste your money --"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising Disappointment","review":"After reading almost all of Patricia Cornwell's other novels, I was sorely disappointed in this one.

I really enjoy Patricia Cornwell's writing, however this time the humor escaped me.

Fish that talk, Trooper Truth, wow! I have been a loyal fan of Patricia Cornwell's for years, but since Benton died things have gone from bad to worse! Why no more Kay Scarpetta? Readers just love (loved?) her! Why, why, why did Benton have to die? Ms. Cornwell should bring them both back if she wants to sell any more books. I, for one, am done with her if Kay Scarpetta is a thing of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of What?","review":"I am an extreme fan of Pat Cornwell and when she went from Scarpetta to Hammer I was leary to make the switch to the Judy Hammer. The first two books in the Hammer were great and I would have given theses two books between four and five stars. The Isle of Dogs on the other hand I would have given a lesser rating to this book than one I did if you had a lesser rating available.While it is a bit funny, that is not what I expect of her in what she writes, I expect to look at the \\"who done it\\". I could only get a third of the way through and then that took almost two months to do. I found that it was a book that I found Hard to Pick Up versus her others books that are hard to put down.I may find it difficult to pick up another Judy Hammer book in the future. All I ask is that Pat stick with what got her here.Sorry Pat, this one Your Weakest Link!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with the others","review":"We, too, have read all of Cornwell's novels (and would buy a new Scarpetta volume in a heartbeat). This is at least the second of the Police Chief Plays House novels I have read--and the last to be sure. The first was mildly amusing--but this was an embarassment to an accomplished novelist like Cornwell. Just why she--and her editors--thought it was worth the time and effort I fail to understand. Cornwell is, in this sense, writing as two separate persons, one who understands mystery writing and one who fails to understand either humorous writing OR police procedurals.

If given the choice, I would rate it a zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"ISLE OF DOGS lives up to it name","review":"As an avid Patricia Cornwell fan, I am exceeding disappointed. This book is dull. Cornwell's last three books have been steadily going to, dare one say, the dogs. This one has arrived at the stated destination.It seems Ms. Cornwell has taken herself and her academic posturings to the limit; one is not reading her materials to be educated by someone who with so few historical/linguistic credentials.One positive note: I totally agree with her position regarding the 'politically correct' Pilgrim conspiracy--Virgina WAS first permanent English settlement in New World."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad, So sad","review":"As many others, I felt this book was a real waste of time.

The story jumps around so much I kept wondering if she was under the influence of some mind-altering substance while she wrote.

Unfortunately, this attempt at comedy does not do well. It's been a very long time since I have been unable to finish a book, especially one from an author I otherwise like.

I kept reading Isle of Dogs hoping it would get better or that I would get whatever it was I was missing. Neither occurred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"If I had a choice, I would rate Isle of Dogs -5 stars! This was Cornwell's worst books ever; pure commercial pap. She should stick to what she does best, serious forensic thrillers, rather than venture into so-called comic relief. The woman has absolutely no sense of humor, and her attempts come off as amateurish and inane. Forget the ridiculous unfocused plot, and the dialog was generally absurd. And, worse, she made that policewoman sound like an idiot; what happened to her \\"strong intelligent women\\" stance??? Now, don't get me wrong, I love Cornwell's Scarpetta books, but this piece of fluff (Isle of Dogs) is going straight into the trash. I wouldn't deign to pass it on to a friend, as I do with all my other good reads.

There are only two possible reasons why this book is so bad: 1- Patricia owed the publisher one last book on her contract and wrote this to laugh in their faces; 2-She wrote this in high school and added the name of the female police chief to fool her fans into thinking this was \\"new\\" material!

The dog thinking was one thing, but when I got to the anthropomorphic plotting of a bucket of crabs (and a trout) I could not go on. This was not funny, or even amusing.

The first one, Hornets Nest wasn't too bad but it wasn't up to her usual standards. The second one Southern Cross was even worse, But the last one, Isle of Dogs, was definitely one of the worst books I have ever read. I am absolutely amazed that this was a Patricia Cornwell novel. If it had been the very first book of hers that I had ever read, it would have also been the last.

She won't see ANY more of my hard earned dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I Ever Read","review":"I cannot believe Cornwell would write this garbage much less anyone would publish it. This was the biggest disappointment I have ever had. Did she forget how to write and entertain her audience. What happened to the wonderful writings with Kay Scarpetta? A bumbling governor, thinking and scheming animals on come on now. Do not wase your time or money on this one. This may have totally turned me off of Patricia Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who really wrote this book?","review":"This book does not deserve a 1 star rating it should be a negative 5 at the very least. I find it hard to believe that this book was actually written by Patricia Cornwell. The storyline is all over the place and probably cannot even be reffered to as a story\\"line\\" but rather a story\\"meandering.\\" In this book the bluecrabs, trout and dog talk - is Ms. Cornwell on some kind of hallucinogenic medication? If you have not purchased this book - DON'T! If you are curious, buy it at a used book store, however, it's not even worth using your valuable time it takes to read it let alone throwing away your money. Try to borrow it from some unfortunate sucker (like me) that purchased the book expecting it to be on the same level as Ms. Cornwell's earlier writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidest book I've ever read.","review":"This was the biggest waste of my time this year. It is boring and nonsensical. A few times I thought Cornwell was trying to draw quirky characters a la Larry McMurtry in the Lonesome Dove novels. If so, she failed miserably. I tried to like these characters but they were just too stereotypical and silly. Having visited Tangier Island and finding the people there quaint, friendly and very interesting, I wondered what Ms. Cornwell was smoking when she went there."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the pits!","review":"There is no doubt of Patricia Cornwell's huge talents- the Scarpetta novels prove that. There is also no doubt that a writer of her talents must go beyond the bounds of a single character and format. But, as Ms. Cornwell has apprently decided to make satire her new field, she needs to grasp that it is meant to be FUNNY, and is meant to make a POINT. This book is miserably unfunny, uninteresting and pointless. I've been a big fan of this author's in the past, but will certainly not buy another of her books based solely on seeing her name on the cover. I feel gipped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Money","review":"In the past I have been a big fan of Patricia Cornwell. This book is a cure for any addiction. It has convinced me the next time I spend money on a book by Patricia Cornwell I'll be buying it from a garage sale!! It was so boring I didn't even finish it. I loaned it to another avid Cornwell reader and she said the same thing. Couldn't finish it. Save your money and don't purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DIDN'T GET IT!","review":"I struggled through this book hoping to find that one shred of information that would tie it all together. I initially thought the book would take me down a path of crime and forensics, then the path split into bizarre, tongue-in-cheek events and personalities. Characters were introduced, mildly developed, then dropped without ever helping to develop the plot. Basically, I was very disappointed and I won't be so quick to pick up the next Patricia Cornwell novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like I had to finish this book because I never...","review":"quit in the middle of one, but now I wish I hadn't wasted my time. What can I say that the other 600 reviewers haven't?I'm not easily offended, and I think we've gotten too PC, but I thought this book was offensive to pretty much everybody, blacks, Virginians, rednecks, Nascar fans, etc.The dialogue was so annoying to read. I guess not one of the characters in the book had anything higher than an 8-yr. old's vocabulary and grammar skills. I take that back. Brazil, Hammer, Scarpetta (however briefly) are evidently geniuses alone in a large city.Anyway, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carl Hiassen she ain't","review":"First of all, I'm NOT assailing her for varying from her Scarpetta series. I've only started reading her, so I'm not one of those who is upset that she veered from her formula.It's just that she's not funny. Her extremely detailed way of describing things, which may work great with forensic details, totally kills any potential humor. It's like she's saying, \\"Here's a situation. It's funny. Let me explain why it's funny...\\" It's overkill, and shows a complete lack of understanding of the timing required for effective humor writing. The characters are not even wooden - they're styrofoam. And the Trooper essays are just bizarre - she's either showing off her trivia knowledge or using this as a platform for some unusual prejudices. Whatever they are, they don't work.She simply can't compete with the Carl Hiassen/Dave Barry/Elmore Leonard school of humor mixed with action and suspense.I guess she should stick to being the Female Joe Friday: Just the facts, ma'am."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really disliked this book.","review":"I usually like Patricia Cornwell's books, but I really disliked this one. I did finally finish it -- hoping it would get better. It never did.Don't waste your time or money. There are plenty of good books to be read -- this just isn't one of them.I hope she returns to her former style. I will be sure to read the customer reviews before buying another one of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of valuable reading time","review":"I've never written a review before, but appreciate this outlet with which to vent my frustration over this poorly-written book.First, let me say to those that were looking for a Kay Scarpetta novel, do not look here. Scarpetta is mentioned only briefly.Second, the characters are poorly developed with ridiculous-sounding names such as: Windy Brees and Uva Clot.Lastly, the story line is greatly lacking; what it does have is a hodge-podge of characters thrown together for an overall ridiculous story.Overall comments: Why bother? There are plenty of other good novels out there to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"There are precious few books that I can't finish and this is one - I simply could not make it to the end. It wasn't worth my time and it was quite painful to read. I was thankful that I got it from the library and didn't waste a penny on this horrendous book.I love Carl Hiassen's books so I thought this book would appeal to me (more than the latest Kay Scarpetta books which were pretty bad as well). It isn't in the same league. If not for the famous name behind this book, it probably would not have passed muster in any publishing house. The humor is forced, the characters are unappealing, and the plot (such as it is) is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor has No Clothes!","review":"I've learned a lot about tough women and forensic medicine from Patricia Cornwell. Then I read Isle of Dogs. From this book I learned that if an author makes the best-seller list enough times, the publishing house and the critics will not dare tell her when she's produced a real gosh-awful stinker. I'm afraid I smelled this \\"wonderfully sophisticated romp\\" from fifty feet away. Next time, Patricia, let me read it first. I promise to level with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the Worst!","review":"I was, and I emphasize the word was, a big fan of Patricia Cornwell until this book came along. I bought the audio version of this book on Ebay and am at least grateful that the full price wasn't paid. This book is absolutely the worst book I have ever read (listened to). I kept holding out hope that somehow this book would get better (or perhaps less stupid), but it never happened. I felt like a prisoner in my own car as I listened to this horrible, horrible, horrible book. I couldn't wait to get rid of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please say someone else wrote this!","review":"I love her other books and I think this must have been someone else writing under her name. It was the worst things I have ever tried to read. I could not force myself to finish. I tried and tried and it has beaten me. Maybe the next will be a return of the real Patricia Cornwell we know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have pitched this in the garbage, but I borrowed it.","review":"I am insulted. I have read bad books by well known authors, but this is the worst. She should stick to writing about Dr. Kay Scarpetta, even though those are diminishing in quality too. Do your friends a favor, don't loan it to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"To think I paid Money for this book","review":"I just wanted to say that I bought this book because I have enjoyed all the others that she wrote. However, I think that it was one of the worst books that I have ever read, I do not like talking animals or fish. At least it taught me a lesson not to judge a book by its author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever was she thinking?????","review":"I cannot express my extreme disappointment in this book. It was so bad that I could not even finish it and just threw it in the garbage! What mindless, incoherent drivel. Obviously after chasing Jack the Ripper, Ms. Cornwell felt she had to get another book out and this was it. I hated everything about it, expecially Andy and his stupid website!!! I want my money back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and Dumber","review":"Like someone else posted, it's hard to believe Patricia Cornwell wrote this garbage. Either she owed the publisher a book and wrote something intentionally bad, or cranked it out over a long weekend. After reading the fine Kay Scarpetta series, this is a joke played on the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diehard Cornwell Fan Disillusioned","review":"I had never read a Patricia Cornwell book I didn't like; I found each story to be fast paced with deep character development and twisting plot lines, then I picked up \\"Isle of Dogs\\". Simply put, it was horrible! I knew that it was supposed to be a comedy but it was so corny that it became difficult to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing. I love the Scarpetta books, and Kay does make a brief appearance in this one, but it is a totally different type of story. I found the characters annoying and boring. I didn't care what happened to them; I just wanted it to happen soon and for the story to end. I forced myself to read the whole thing, but it was a chore. Bring back Kay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb book...","review":"This book is really dumb. I realize that it's supposed to be comedic in nature, but I found it impossible to achieve the suspension of disbelief necessary to actually enjoy the story.Every time the island people's speech was represented, I just cringed. Nobody could speak that stupidly! The people on the island sound too dumb to be alive. (No offense to the actual residents of Tangiers intended.)Bottom line: dumb book! Don't waste your time reading it.Sorry Patricia - Love your Scarpetta series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I am a huge Cornwell fan. I have read every book she has written and liked them all - even Jack the Ripper, but I can't even finish this one. The style is not one I enjoy and the story has not yet grabbed me 4 chapters into the book. I'm putting it in the garage sale pile. I hope someone else enjoys it better than I. Please Patricia ... I know Kay is boring to you after all these year, but we love her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Love her other books, but not this one. Her writing is almost childish and the characters are so unbelievable. Not her best work, I am sorry to say!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I have always enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's books but couldn't get past one third of this one. So boring. The govener and his wife were a real drag. So was the absent plot-----couldn't even finish it. Sorry Patricia. I was really getting tired of the lesbian ungrateful niece any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"In my lifetime of voracious reading, there have been only three books I could not finish. This was one of them. The author implies that these people, her characters, are worthy only of condescending amusement, at best. Neither the people nor the story had the kind of depth and willingness to explore private human emotion I have come to expect from Ms. Cornwall. Perhaps the story improves as you read along, but I will never find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"A terribly poor show from Ms. Cornwell! Deus ex machina crabs? Puh-leeese! If she is planning on writing more books in this vein then she ought to be fired by her publisher. And in case I wasn't clear, I hated this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star too many!","review":"I'm sorry, Ms. Cornwell. Up until now the only book that I had refused to finish was \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\\" Now there is one more - \\"Isle of Dogs.\\" I would recommend this book only to fans of the Three Stooges. After forcing myself to read half of the book, the first fifty pages with an open mind, I gave up the effort and moved on to something more interesting. The comedy seemed to be forced and the continuing characters of Brazil and Judy seemed lost in a maze of insipid characters with stupid names located on a fantasy island of bad dreams. Give the readers back what you do best, Ms. Cornwell, a well-written novel that makes sense while it entertains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"The Isle of Dogs has to be one of the worst written books I have ever read!!! It is nothing like the author's other books. I am so disappointed in this drivel. If it is supposed to be humorous, the author missed her mark. If she continues with this vein of writing, she will also miss her audience. The book was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because the trip was long...","review":"I only finished listening to this stinker because the trip was LONG. Otherwise, I wouldn't have bothered. Other reviews have called it a dark comedy, and it certainly tried to be. A few times it succeeded-- I laughed out loud at the counseling center for gay Baptists-- but for the most part I was left thinking how stupid and implausible the whole thing was. I generally enjoy Cornwell's novels, and I understand that this was a departure from her usual style. But really, don't bother with this one-- wait for something else or check out one of her previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Carl Hiaasen!!!!!!!","review":"This is the first Patricia CORNBALL novel and it really is! This governor is an insult to the most remarkable politician of our time, \\"Skank\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"What a great idea for a book. What a great opportunity for a departure from her usual writing style. What a hideous pile of [garbage].I was really looking forward to this book, but it is truly awful. It is way too contrived and completely implausible to be passed off as 'quirky' (for instance, the idea that all of Richmond was talking about Trooper Truth's meaningless essays). It's not witty at all; the 'quirks' are delivered with a very heavy hand. Parts of it were so poorly and simply written, I wondered if Cornwell even looked back over it after she wrote it.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I should've read the reviews before I wasted my money on this one! I normally love Cornwell's books, but this one is terrible.Save your money, and check this one out at the library. Better yet, save your time and don't read it at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"I've ready every book Ms. Cornwell has ever written and enjoyed each one - until this one.There was nothing wrong with Hornet's Nest or Southern Cross - they were a nice change of pace. I have NO CLUE what this was supposed to be. This book was painful; I couldn't finish it. I got as far as the \\"Dentist\\" being held hostage - I bought this book the day it was released and didn't get to the \\"hostage\\" part until the beginning of December!Good luck to those of you trying to sell your copy; I doubt if you'll get anyone to bite.By the way, why wasn't Virginia West is this book? Or was she and I didn't get to that part?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"I thought it was me! I managed to get through 46 pages before I couldn't take it anymore. What an absolute disaster. This book truly does not deserve even the one-star rating.Thank goodness I resisted the urge to purchase this ridiculous book. I am returning it to the library as soon as I finish this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened!","review":"As a Patricia Cornwell fan, I couldn't wait to get her latest book! Halfway through, I couldn't handle one more page. It was with great effort that I read each page of tedious, nonsensical writing, hoping I would find on the next page the quality I was expecting. The book jumps back and forth between unbelievably dysfunctional characters. That was when I checked the reviews to find out whether it was me or others shared my opinion. I'll be more careful before I purchase another of her books. I'm so disappointed - her first books were wonderful. Will there never be another Patricia Cornwell book of the Kay Scarpetta quality?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"This book was incredibly disappointing. Ms. Cornwell should stick to what she does best, writing about Kay Scarpeta. It took me forever to get through Southern Cross and I mistakenly gave Isle of the Dogs the benefit of the doubt and decided to read it. It was a mistake to do this as this book was just as bad. The plot was silly, contrived and unbelievable. Trooper Truth, what the heck is that about. Please Ms. Cornwell, for the sake of your remaining loyal fans, go back to writing about Kay Scarpeta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I definitely should have read the reader reviews before purchasing this book. It was very, very disappointing not because it was a departure from the Dr. Kay series but because it was nonsensical and in my opinion not funny. I plodded through it hoping that it would get better but it didn't.This book was not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Painful Mistake","review":"I snapped up this book because it was by Cornwell, one of my favorite authors until now. I was surprised to find all the characters irritatingly foolish, and the story disorganized and unfunny (I assume it was intended to be funny). I laid it down, disappointed and bored, a third of the way through. Cornwell can't have written it. The person who wrote the Jar Jar Binks character in \\"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\\" wrote this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"could this be a hoax?","review":"I don't believe this was actually written by Patricia Cornwell. This must be the result of a twisted bet she made with some friends that an 11 year old could write a book and if Patricia sent it in under her \\"best seller\\" name it would get published regardless of merit. If this were a first novel being sent around without her name on it, it would never have gotten published.In order for a book to be satirical, it has to have some wit and intelligence. A book about nothing can be saved by excellent writing and a poorly written book can become a best seller if the plot is original and riveting. This is the worst of both worlds. Snoopy's \\"It was a dark and stormy night...\\" puts this to shame. I've never been so disappointed in the work of well known author. Many seem to ride on their automatic fan following from time to time, but this is in a class by itself. Isle of Dogs is a \\"dog.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Toss It","review":"This book 'Isle of Dogs' is perhaps the worst book I have read in a very long time. If it was intended to be funny, the author missed by a wide mile. Perhaps she had just watched a 'Dukes of Hazzard\\" marathon. Forget this book. I'm sure Cornwall wishes she had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silliness is not Satire","review":"Cornwell's attempt at comedy has gone awry. A nicely tangled plot of various mystery strands developing throughout the novel seem to promise the straightforward thrill of suspense that readers associate with Cornwell's books. In Isle of Dogs, the effect is marred by an ill-advised comical overlay of faux-native Virginian characters with repulsively stilted dialects. The author mistakes exaggeration and silliness for wit. The book is hard to slog through, the tape is nauseating to listen to. Cornwell, stick to hard-nose crime! Readers, stick to traditional Cornwell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world was Patricia Cornwell thinking?!","review":"Patricia Cornwell has been one of my favorite authors for years, but this book was just terrible. I actually didn't have much of a problem with the talking crabs (or trout, or dog.) The crabs aren't this book's problem. This book's problem is the book itself. It's BORING, and the plot is so incredibly stupid. The people in this book were so unbelievable and unlikable - all of them - that it was really hard to finish this book at all. I also don't understand what it was about the Trooper Truth website that got everyone all riled up. I also couldn't stand the way people spoke. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never did! Honestly, if this was the first Patricia Cornwell book I had bought, I wouldn't have ever read her books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"This book was horrible. The plot was lifeless and confusing, the jokes were lame and the characters were ridiculous--and not in a funny way. Not to mention, the author's racist stereotypes were awful. If you read this book, prepare to be insulted."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was her editor thinking?","review":"Thinking, no doubt, that you have to let the 800-lb. gorilla get a certain amount of bile out of her system before getting back to business as usual--churning out Scarpetta best-sellers. No one would have published this dreadful book had it been sent in by an unknown, or even a \\"midlist\\" author. And Cornwell should have known better than to send in a compendium of silly names, fart jokes and feeble attempts at Mike Meyers comedy. Humor is not her strong suit, as I hope she has learned by now. Leave it to Carl Hiasson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"This book is horrible. Like the title, it's a \\"dog\\" alright. I am an avid reader of all of Cornwell's novels,and this book is the first book I've had to stop reading after 3 chapters. It was sooooo boring that I couldn't finish it. While I was reading this book, it felt like the writer was a totally different person than the talented, awesome writer of the Kay Scarpetta novels. Don't waste your time or your money buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog Day Afternoon","review":"It took only an hour or so of reading this bizarre story before I threw the book in my trash can. As a fan of Patricia Cornwell's, I've always looked forward to reading a new title, but this one is disappointing. Isle of Dogs might appeal to those who enjoy talking fish, conversations of crabs, dog's thoughts and computer skills, and seeing-eye mini-horses, but for that sort of thing I prefer Peter Rabbit, Uncle Wiggly, Winnie the Pooh, or science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading this...","review":"This book was not good. It was hard to get through - a real departure for Patricia Cornwell who usually writes books that are at least interesting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe I bought it!","review":"I am a big fan of Cornwell's. I love Kay Scarpetta and even enjoyed Judy Hammer in \\"Southern Cross\\", but this was truly disappointing. My read time for most of her books is about 2 days (one weekend), but this book I have still to finish and I have had it for 2 months! I can't get into the characters. I have read some of the reviews that say that the characters develop as you get into the book, but I can't get past the first couple of chapters to see what lies ahead.While I think it is commendable for Cornwell to spread her wings and try something different, but this will not be one avenue she should try again. Not unless she does not enjoy success, because from now on, I will read through the book jacket and a couple of chapters before I waste my money on anything other than her Scarpetta series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Believe She Put Her Name on this Book!","review":"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell for several years buying all her new books and acquiring older ones that I missed. I thoroughly enjoyed her work. However, this book doesn't seem like it fits in with her prior work. I have no idea where her head was when she was writing it. I am still struggling to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An enormous disappointment","review":"There is a definite difference between Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta books and her others. Her others stink on ice. The characters are unbelievable, the plot absurd. I understand the need for a writer to try different things, but Ms. Cornwell's editor and literary agent should try to keep her ego in check. There was no reason for this book to be published, unless she was trying to write a parody of Hiassen or Leonard. If that was the case she had me fooled.The most frustrating thing about several of Cornwell's books is that she just seems to end them with no real resolution. She must give herself a number of words as a minimum and when she hits it she stops. There are ten characters in this book about whom we have no idea what happens to them.Kay Scarpetta is one of the most compelling characters in popular fiction. I will continue to read the books about her. I will not make the mistake of chasing Ms. Cornwell off the reservation the next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I have loved all the other books but this one is sooo bad I can't believe Patricia Cornwell even wrote this. She needs to stick to Scarpetta or something similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Reading","review":"This book was horrible. I could not endure past the first few chapters. Terrible dark book with that stupid language and all the explanation of what they really meant. Very disappointing from Ms. Cornwell. Reader beware, it is nothing like her past novels and, hopefully, nothing like her future ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD GRIEF!!","review":"Can you rate a book minus 5 stars? Either Patrica Cornwell has taken leave of her senses, she has gone off the deep end, or aliens have invaded her mind...maybe all three have taken place. Of course, she now thinks she has solved the Jack The Ripper murders, so who knows? This is a HORRIBLE book, one I could not finish and ended up throwing in the garbage. I will not waste one more penny of my hard earned dollars on any more of her books.... even if she brings Benton back from the dead in a Scarpetta novel. You owe your loyal readers better than this, Ms. Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!!","review":"Normally, I wolf down Cornwell books. This was waste of time and money. I will be more careful about selecting her titles in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Parody","review":"Not subtle enough for satire, not realistic enough for irony, this dark comedic parody purple-treats a scum upon fans of Cromwell. Her imagination went into freefall through cyberspace, and the whole thing was captured on digital film. Virginia, Scarpetta, and near every stereotype imaginable is maligned. In the immortal words of Trooper Truth, \\"Be careful out there.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs is a Dog","review":"I am an avid book-on-tape listener, and read a lot of hard cover books, as well. I love fiction, and have some favorite authors I seek when a new book comes out. Patricial Cornwell has been one of my favorites. I purchased the 4-cassette abridged version of \\"Isle of Dogs\\" looking forward to another Cornwell adventure. I am so grateful I have the abridged version, as I don't think I could have made it through even the first tape unabridged. I listened to the entire tape one, both sides, and could not justify wasting my time continuing. The plot (?), character development, names of characters, etc., etc., were so far beneath Patricia Cornwell, that I wonder if she is hospitalized and someone else has ghost-written for her. I have begun to recommend to my reading friends that they avoid this book, at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had my money and time back from this one!","review":"This was my first go at a Patricia Cornwell novel, and it will also be my last. Acting on a newspaper snipet about the plot, I decided to give it a whirl. It took everything I had to get through this unbearable read. What could have been an intelligent plot line was muddled by thin subplots, inplausible characters and painfully taxing dialogue. Nothing about this novel resonated with me at all, and from what I hear, I'm not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Bother..","review":"This may well be my last Patricia Cornwell purchase. I can't believe how low she went in this one...calling black children 'nidgettes' repeatedly, portraying all the black characters in the book as uneducated, backward people who butcher the english language ('we's done' and multiple mistakes like muscular dysentery instead of dystrophy). And yet she wants the reader to believe that a dog is capable of taking a pencil in it's mouth and typing on a computer keyboard??? Come on! It's a ridiculous story with little respect to the reader or black people. And what's her problem with the citizens of the Commonwealth of Va.? Hmmm..they can't all be blind, bumbling, inbred or redneck race fans! She's collected my last dollar. The only reaason I gave it one star is because Amazon wouldn't let me leave it blank!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great author gone bad","review":"I wish I had read the reviews; however, I was so excited to see another book by an author I have enjoyed in the past that I bought it immediately. I was sadly disappointed. I have always had trouble putting her books down - this one I have trouble trying to finish. The names of the people are so fake you laugh at them, I mean Trish Thrash, Trooper Truth, Major Trader?! I'm will be reluctant to purchase any future books by Patricia Cornwall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cronwell misses the boat","review":"dous succes of previous Scarpetta novels. Cornwell has made a sad mistake in this novel which, can hardly be rated it is so bad. Yhe dialect, the actions are totally unnecessary, the plot is trivial, and one must wade through pages of dialect to get to the meat of the problem. Unless she goes b= ack to preious types my buy rate is going to be zero where it has been 100%. It rates with Grishams' \\"Painted House\\" which is equally bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointed!","review":"I too am an avid Cornwell fan and can hardly wait for her next book to come out. But unfortunately this was a terrible disappoitment and a total waste of time and money.I love a good satire as well as anyone and must admit this is not one. It didn't make me laugh and it only made me want to get finished so I could move on to a good book. As I write, I am forcing myself to finish the last 50 pages.I will wait for Patricia's next book,but I might not be as quick to buy and wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it.....","review":"I never thought I would say this about a PC novel, but I couldn't get through it. I am a Scarpetta girl. I did like the first two in the other series, but the third book, Isle of the Dogs was just boring. I couldn't get through it. I thought the first two books in the Andy Brazil series were amusing. I liked the idea of Andy and Virginia West. Without Virginia in this latest novel, the novel was lacking the humor she adds. The book is lacking in itself. Sadly disappointing that I could not bear to get through it. That never happens to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointed but Loyal Fan","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers, I didn't enjoy this book at all. I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books From Postmortem to The Last Precinct, plus her cookbook. This book leaves me wondering why. Oh well, Lsle of Dogs doesn't get my vote,so what, I'll get over it and move on. I'm still a huge fan looking forward to Cornwell's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst!","review":"I usually can't wait to get my hands on Patricia Cornwall's mysterys but this one was the worst! I couldn't finish it. She should stick with Dr. Scarpetta!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where in the world is Patricia Campbell?","review":"What happened? I couldn't wait to read her next book...the truth is: I can't read her next book...it's TERRIBLE, BORING AND SENSELESS. Where in the world did Campbell go? This book is NOT Patricia Campbell."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is she doing?","review":"I have all of Patricia Cornwell's books and wait with baited breath for the next release. I'm always wary when she steps away from Kay Scarpetta. This one was another disappointment. I thought Southern Cross was outside her element, but she seems to have gotten a better grasp of things with Isle of Dogs. Unfortunately, it is one of the most ethnically insulting books I've read in a long time! It takes us immediately back to Amos and Andy and Stepin Fechit. If this is an example of her only exposure to African Americans, then she might want to get out more because it is extremely stereotypical and casts all African Americans in this book in a bad light! The result is really insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"oooooohhhhh, it's supposed to be humorous!","review":"What can I say about a book I had to look up on Amazon to find out what the heck I was listening to? I know authors sometimes become so melded with a character they've created, it seems as if the character writes the book and the author is along for the ride. I have for a long time liked Kay Scarpetta a lot more than I like Patricia Cornwell, mainly because I don't believe Ms. Cornwell can sustain a narrative or develop a storyline without Ms. Scarpetta's presence. But, I did buy this one with an open mind. After listening to two tapes, I thought maybe this was some elaborate joke on the author's and publisher's part, and that my refund would be tucked in with the last tape along with an award for slugging through to the end of this....thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are you, and what have you done with Patricia Cornwell","review":"I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this book. I could not get past the 8th chapter, and now I will not be forced to read about the talking crabs and fish. I too thought it would get better, now I don't have to endure the painful process of trying to finish a real DOG of a book. ... Why write and publish a piece [that is not up to her standards]such as this and suck in us loyal readers, who up until now bought everything with her name on it. Has greed reared it's ugly head? How convenient that Cornwell's website is not currently available. I'm afraid, the only redeeming feature of this book will be as a kindling starter in my fireplace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of the Dogs","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and in my honest opinion this is the worst book that she has written. The plot was rambling and hard to understand, seemed it had no rhyme or reason. It was a hard read. I normally finish one of her good books (The Scarpetta Series) in one day, it took me two weeks to read this book, as I kept putting it down to read other books that held my interest. Being an avid reader, I can get through about any book, especially one written by one of my favorite authors, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I hope tht Ms. Cornwell is not \\"burnt out\\" as so happens to authors who turn out books too fast. I am looking forward to her next book to see if she goes back to her \\"old\\" style."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Comic Romp\\"...more like a humorless trek","review":"I am not sure what I expected...maybe a plot, characters you cared about,a mystery to unravel, something like that. What I found was a silly, senseless waste of time. I always finish a book, if the author took the trouble to write it, a publisher believed it worthy of publishing, I believe I should read the entire thing before forming an opinion...I am considering changing my policy....this actually hurt to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Cornwall","review":"I have read almost all of Cornwall's books and this one is, without a doubt, the worst one! There is no reason to the story, no suspense, no common sense thought process involved - just N/G!I am certain I will not finish it and only wish I could get my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I am a Patricia Cornwell junky, could not wait until her next book came out. This is not Patricia Cornwell at all! This is her worst book ever. This is nothing but silly and she even has the crabs about to be cooked with quotes, that keep popping back up with opinions. This book was a real chore to even finish, I kept reading thinking it would have to get better, but never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars, my charitable contribution to Ms Cornwell","review":"I have read and enjoyed all of the Patricia Cornwell books, but let me tell fellow fans, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK, from the needlessly inane plot twists, and the characters that frankly I couldnt give a damn about <I ended up hoping the dog would get killed just so I wouldnt have to read about it any more> This has to be the worst book she has written to date, and makes me view any future books by her with extreme suspicion and mistrust. If this was the first book of hers that I read, I would never have read any others thats for sure....Here's hoping that she gets back on track (or at least on the train) with the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I too am halfway through it, and have put it aside several times.

Very please with them and would use them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"Strange, bizarre book. Reader should be aware that it has talking \\"trout\\" and \\"crabs\\" (as in seafood) and just weird characters. Not to mention , Kay Scarpetta doesn't make an appearence until page 300. I forced myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I am so disappointed in this book. It is poorly written, not at all interesting, dull as can be. And ridiculous to boot. Patricia Cornwell used to be one of my favorite authors. I will never read another book by her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!","review":"I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for a long time, but I can't imagine what she was thinking! Intelligent crabs? Cute names for intestinal problems? Completely idiotic characters with annoying accents and long essays on uninteresting subjects that have absolutely nothing to do with anything! All this narrated by someone who sounded embarrassed at the words she was forced to utter (as well she should be). Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten Up -- It's Weird but Fun","review":"Yes, it's true that Isle of Dogs isn't like most of Patricia Cornwell's mysteries. But once I got into it I realized that it has merit on its own. Yes, it's bizarre and weird, but it all comes together in the end and is enjoyable in between. While parts of the story could have been better written, this is a new style for Cornwell and it will undoubtedly improve with practice. Just don't expect something totally serious and go with the flow. Love those talking crabs and the miniature guide horse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself for better things","review":"This book is beyond dreadful. It depends for what plot it has on improbable coincidences, impossible dialect, and the readers willingness to believe that no one in the state of Virginia has an IQ that rises above room temperature. It's a shame, because the Kay Scarpetta books are invariably entertaining. Don't buy it, don't borrow it from the library, don't waste your time reading it if someone gives it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting audiobook, dull reader","review":"The book is definitely a departure for Patricia Cornwell, and I probably would have enjoyed it had I bought the book instead of the audio version. The reader even makes pirates dull. It's very difficult to stay awake on a long drive listening to a droning monotone. Chris Sarandon read this book's predecessor Hornet's Nest. Get him Back"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books, but this book is unbelievably awful. It doesn't qualify as a mystery or thriller. Maybe it's supposed to be an attempt at humor, but it fails miserably. The main cast of characters are base, incompetent and repulsive, including a governor whose world revolves around his bowel problems. The scenario is predictable and trite, with no surprises and no depth. I kept reading only because I thought I must be missing something somewhere, but whatever it was, I never found it. I'm sorry there isn't a zero-star option, because that's what I would rank this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was a time when Cornwell's books were interesting...","review":"but it seems now she has run out of interesting ideas. This book like all the books about Chief Hammer is boring. As I read the book it occurred to me that Ms. Cornwell might be trying to be humorous or satiric. If that was her idea she failed. Absurdity is not the same as humor or satire.Midway through the book she describes her Governor's policies as idiotic. She should have used that word to describe the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands Down the WORST Book I Ever Read","review":"Why did I feel compelled to finish this book? I kept thinking it would get better, it did not. It actually got more stupid as the book progressed. DO NOT waste your money. I'd rather read a cereal box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous to Your Health","review":"Absolutely do not listen to this book while driving. While on Tape 4 at 7 a.m. in the morning I dozed off, but managed to spring back awake again to gain control of my car. I promptly turned on the radio. Then I just had to see if my perception was on target that this book is absolutely horrible, and sure enough, most other reviews out of 630 were one-star, and as at least one person said, would have been 0 stars. If I want mystery humor and pets with human-like qualities, I will stick with David Handler and his Stuart Hoag and Lulu series.And the female narrator on the audio tape, though great with accents, was decidely very bad with male voices, of which there are many, like most of the main characters...part of the problem with putting me to sleep. I think this book would have faired better with a male voice.It is comforting that Patricia Cornwell has apparently written better novels, so I won't totally write her off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I coudn't get through it","review":"I picked up the book on tape version of this to keep me awake on my commute, so it didn't need to be a literary masterpiece, but in spite of gritting my teeth and trying to tough it out, I couldn't finish it. I've never read anything else by this author, and I assure you I won't. Her characters are shallow and unsympathetic, animals (dogs, crabs) are smarter than people, and she manages to insult just about every kind of person you can imagine in this novel. Bad writing and offensive, hateful attitudes just made me angry rather than making my drive more pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Ms. Cornwell...","review":"I am an incredibly devout fan of Ms. Cornwell, from her Ruth Graham Bell biography to Dr. Scarpetta to Judy Hammer. That said, I found this experiment into postmodern literature asinine and mind-numbingly boring. I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book (it's already been a week, a record for me and a Cornwell book) but if I keep waking my husband up with my groaning, he just might hide the book before I can finish it! While the parody might have worked with different characters (and a little more fleshing out), Cornwell has already introduced us to Hammer and Brazil - which makes it rather difficult to match these their caricatures with the characters we already know. Brazil's essays, while interesting, make room for plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. Hopefully the esteemed Ms. Cornwell will return to her roots: fast paced, well plotted and thoroughly researched novels about strong women and the mysteries of the criminal mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is patricia smoking","review":"If this wasn't written by an author I respect I would have closed it and gone on. It seems she is dreaming and writing what she sees.

I have to admit I approached this book hoping it would be a good old fashioned Cornwell instead of another deposit left behind on her speed of light talent skid, but alas it was not to be. I for one have crossed Cornwell off my list of possible reads. I just don't understand how a writer can change, her dialogue has gone from gripping to inane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talking Crabs?","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. This is an awful book. It's nice to see P. Cornwell lighten up and try to use humor, but a dog that can type on a keyboard is just bizarre."},{"rating":"1","title":"not your aver5age p.cornwell","review":"I missed Kay Scarpetta. I read 190 pages of this book thinking it would get better and I would become interested. I could not. Then I quit. Too many vast differences in story lines. Hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. Even though I knew it was not going to be like her other novels, it was not what I expected from one of my favorites authors. I actually only read half of the book and then dropped it. My patience ran out when I came to the part where the fish and crab were having a conversation. Many other well known writers in this field have written novels that are light hearted or not their traditional books. I have enjoyed these (Painted House,Skipping Christmas for example). I think Cornwall should stick to what she writes best and future frivolous books like this should be written under a pseudo name."},{"rating":"1","title":"whacky","review":"The only good thing i have to say about this book is that it has enough plots running through it to keep me entertained.the story line is just to whackyI am hope ms.Cornwell will return to writing books like The body Farm which was excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"I thought it was just me when I started reading this. I gave up after 3 chapters. It's silly - plain and simple. It's not funny, and it's poorly written - jumping all over the place with infantile characters. Maybe Cornwell will resurrect Scarpetta. If she does, I hope Scarpetta has gotten over her \\"attitude\\" and imperious manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Patricia Cornwell is going the way of John Grisham and forgetting to give us what we liked in the beginning. They both have opted for social commentary and exploration of their pet subjects rather than what they started with. I had to force myself to keep reading thinking it had to get better. Kay Scarpetta come back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hours of my life I will never get back","review":"Please note the only reason that I even gave this one star is because zero or negative numbers were not an option. I want the hours that I spent reading this book back! What a piece of garbage. I cannot believe one of my favorite authors produced this. What was the point of this book. After this experience I will never again purchase a book by Cornwell without first reading the reviews. The moral of this story is she should stick to the Kay Scarpetta novels, clearly she has no idea how to write anything else.What was with the talking fish? And truly who cared about any of the characters. I think if Popeye really could speak she would have yelled, \\"Get me the hell out of this nightmare of a novel!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"a dog of a read","review":"very glad to have received this book for christmas - would have been upset if i'd paid for it with my own money. was extremely surprised and disappointed in the dialogue ...very English 101. example: an african-american police officer who starts and ends almost every sentence with, \\"wooo.\\" the story was disjointed and unimpressive. left me wondering, \\"who REALLY wrote this?\\" again, the dialogue poorly written and distracting. \\"plot\\" is far-fetched and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years, and have rated all her other books with 4 & 5 stars. I also have a personal rule that I give every book 10% of its pages to hook me. Being a Cornwell fan, I struggled through this book for more than 20% of its page total, but final gave up at the end of page 96. Nothing hangs together, the prose and action is totally contrived, and as a fan, I'm feeling ripped off. If you're a dedicated Cornwell fan, wait for the paperback or buy used, or trust me and skip this one altogether. Here's hoping she gets back on track with the next offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"My only reaction to Patricia Cornwell's \\"Isle of Dogs\\" is to ask \\"why did she write this? and why did I read it\\"? Certainly I could have done other things with my time. I continued reading through this truly boring, stupid book only because I kept thinking \\"it's got to get better\\"...no, it doesn't. I am a fan of the Kay Scarpetta novels and listened to one of the Andy Brazil novels on tape and that was so-so but this... If only I had logged onto Amazon and read some of these reviews before I bought this book. I won't read another one of Patricia Cornwell's novels unless it's a Kay Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book - Bad Author!","review":"I have worked through several of Cornwell books and felt that this one would be at least as good as the others....Boy was I wrong. In addition to crabs talking to fish, I think her display of Virginia is a very poor choice. She must have made a good living in Richmond and enjoyed some of the \\"ole Richmond\\" as most of us have over the years, but to write such a \\"childs book\\" with an audlt cover is poor taste. Based upon this book, and after reading 3 others, I will not purchase any other books she has written.Patricia, hope you enjoy New York, because, you're not welcome in the company of other Richmond or Virginia people.Love, Jack from Key West x Richmond, Vaps:Hope you get this message, in addition to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"What a huge disappointment. This is without a doubt one of the worst books I've ever attempted to read. It doesn't even sound like Patricia Cornwell. I've read most of her other books including the NON Kay Scarpetta Hornet's Nest, but Isle of Dogs is the worst. A waste of time and $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid, Vacuous, Tasteless","review":"I am generally a Patricia Cornwell fan, but this book is absolutely terrible. Her attempts at humor are at best stupid, and are often tasteless and even racist. Black comedies are supposed to have some believability and creditability but this one has none. Even the character's names, while supposedly funny, are just stupid puns (Major Trader, come on, you can do better than that!). And talking fish and thinking dogs! What! Please Ms. Cornwell, drop this ridiculous style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I thoroughly agree with the majority of reviewers.

Isle of Dogs is....well, it's a dog. Any book that has characters with names like \\"Windy Brees\\" and \\"Unique First\\" should be filed in the reject pile.Cornwell's attempts at humor with Windy's malaprops is just not funny. The book is just really really really awful. Perhaps Ms. Cornwell should concentrate on quality rather than quantity.

I mean, Right? It's got to get better. It doesn't get better. I've never been so happy to finish a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is she thinking!","review":"Patricial Cornwell is a true writer. Even if I gave this a one star, it's because she missed the boat when she tried to translate a native spoken word and action thru her eyes. didn't work. Failed miserably. I am from Maine and people do that with us at times and unless they are extremely good, which almost never happens, they fail. The Isle of Dogs makes no sense what so ever, and what was meant to be funny (I think) simply dropped like a lead balloon. Didn't like it. HOWEVER I give Cornwell KUDOS because she continues to test and probe her work, and I find that she is walking into true thriller territory now. But not with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dog of a Book","review":"Patricia Cornwell's latest book in the Andy Brazil series is a real dog. The characters are unbelievable, the plot is weak, and there is no real climax. This is a sad departure from her normal writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an entirely disappointing book","review":"I didn't even finish it. It tries to be funny and just falls flat. I read Patricia Cornwell's books for suspense. Her other books, particularly ones involving Kay Scarpetta, are wonderful. I guess that's even more reason to dislike this book because it is not up to the caliber of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why????","review":"I realize that this book is supposed to be funny, witty and a complete departure from PC's usual fare, however, she should have saved herself the effort. Not only did I find it particulary NOT funny, it was flighty and disjointed without even a hint of cohesivness. Should have been billed as sci-fi fare - the animals would at least have had a purpose"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"beach book\\"","review":"I agree with the review by \\"iqhope\\" but must say to those of you looking for a suspense, that this book has none of it. It's just basically a story, not a mystery. I will not discuss other points mentioned in other reviews but would like to mention a bizarre part of the story. Unique, one of the road dogs, is described as having a Purpose and a darkness inside of her. She commits a murder or two and although the reader knows this, the cops never figure this out and we never learn what the deal is with her Purpose. This was the only bit of mystery I was able to find. Maybe there is a sequel that will explain these loose ends. I'm not sure if I would read it though as I had to force myself to finish this one, and I am a huge fan of the Kay Scarpetta series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of LOST dogs","review":"SAVE YOUR MONEY !! Ive read every one of her books and really enjoyed them but was stunned at how this book is such a stinker. Ms Cornwell, what happened?

I think Im off of Ms Cornwell for some time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real dog of a book","review":"I have liked or loved Cornwell's previous novels, both those with and without heroine Kay Scarpetta. Here she tries more of a change of style by attempting humor, which is commendable. Unfortunately, I HATED this book and wanted to give it no stars. Cornwell is AWFUL at humor--unless you appreciate sophomoric jokes about bodily functions and heavyset people, her two favorite homor topics in this book. I found the humor both not funny and offensive. I did finish the book, hoping it would get better. It didn't. It's the worst book I've read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"an insult to readers","review":"i have read all previous works, and enjoyed them. this one must be made up to fill a contract or else the author just decided to insult the intelligence of her readers, now that she has made so many millions. this pastiche of carl hiassen and elmore leonard is embarrassingly facile and trivial.do not buy this book and if you have, ask for your money back"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she THINKING??","review":"This was AWFUL! I felt like the author was playing to inside jokes and using caricatures instead of characters. More tangents than plot. Was it satire? If so, I didn't get it. To bad there's not a zero-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Listened to the WHOLE THING!","review":"So many writers have said they could not finish this book! They were the smart ones! I actually listened to the whole thing, hoping against hope that it would finally make sense. I was wrong! It is a book that doesn't know what it wants to be! Is it a crime book? Well. . . not really! Is it a popular presentation of regional history and lore? Maybe, but that's not enough reason to listen to or read it. Is it a comic romp? Most assuredly, no! Is it a carefully crafted novel of forensic investigation starring Dr. Kay Scarpetta? Hah! Scarpetta appears as a very minor character. . . and she was probably embarrassed to be there.People will buy this book because it's by Cornwell. They should read all these reviews before they part with one cent. And Cornwell should go back to doing what she does best: giving readers more of Dr. Scarpetta and her pathology lab!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am (or should I say was) an avid Patricia Cornwell reader. But let me tell you, this book was horrendous. Who wrote it? It certainly doesn't seem like she did.Although some of the characters from previous Cornwell novels were involved, Scarpetta was not, except for one mention somewhere before page 130 or so. That's where I stopped reading it. I think my two year old could put together a better story.Even her details don't add up. The governor's wife is 70 years old, but her four daughters still live at the mansion, whining like babies, with the parents searching for husbands for them. OK, even if she was 45 when she had the last of the four, the youngest would still be 25. Ridiculous!I don't think I'll be picking up another Cornwell book again, ever. If you ask me, this was a lousy attempt to cash in on her name as a good author. But my guess is, she's lost a good percentage of her readers forever.I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs IS a Dog","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwells books with the exception of her cookbook. If this were the first book of hers that I read, it would also be the last.

This one is BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"An atrocious experiment","review":"I am an avid reader, and I wait impatiently for my favorite authors. Patricia Cornwell used to be in that group. But, after reading this complete waste of money, I doubt I'll ever read another of her books. I struggled, literally, through about one third of this trash until I slammed it shut and threw it off the balcony. It is the most poorly written book I have ever had the misfortune to open. I don't know what she was thinking, but whatever it was, it sure didn't work. The writing is barely beyond a sixth grade level. The extreme use of dialect is barely understandable. The \\"Trooper Truth\\" rants are reminiscent of Dennis Miller. Save yourself the money. Don't even think of buying it. Go to the library and open any page. At least you won't be able to throw that one off the balcony."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking","review":"Did Patricia Cornwell really write this or let a child use her name?I too have loved all Patricia's book and very much looked forward to the latest installment of Judy Hammer, Andy Brazil, and Virginia West.

I do believe I'll wait until the paperback of the next novel comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was embarrased for a great author","review":"The reviews calling this book a \\"dark comedy\\" aside, I felt embarrased for Particia Cornwell. The more I read, the worse I felt. The chartacter development is lacking, there are too many spotty, unresolved story lines, and nothing that reads as if it were meant to cause you to laugh. It felt more like going to a movie and finding that everyone was laughing AT the movie rather than wITH it. Ms. Cornwell has written so many better books. If you must read this, buy it used or wait for the paperback. You'll probably want to pass it on rather than keep it. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs is a DOG","review":"Love Patricia Cornwell, look forward to each new release. However, Isle of Dogs is terrible! I would never have thought it was written by Cornwell. It is boring, poorly written and basically hard to follow. Normally I read a Cornwell book in a few days, I have been trying to read Isle of Dogs for nearly a week and haven't gotten past Chapter 10. My advise is save your money, don't buy the book. It is a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Cornwell must be suffering from stress or boredom!","review":"I'm a faithful Patricia Cornwell follower. I always buy her books without even reading the cover. This book was a shock! I thought that using existing characters was a mistake. Maybe this form of humor would have worked with a fresh cast but these were characters that I thought I knew. I hope she returns to her familiar style of writing. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to Cornwell's former creativity?","review":"I am having trouble even finishing this book which I couldn't wait to get my hands on! Did Patricia Cornwell really write this piece of garbage? It certainly is not up to her former standards!! I definitely cannot recommend it. All her previous books were credible and spell-binding; this one is ridiculous. Has she reached the point where she thinks people will buy anything bearing the Patricia Cornwell name? I sure hope not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this book-it's the perfect kindling!","review":"Cornwell courts the unusual here, and I don't mean unusual as in the latest twisted killer or another gore flecked Scarpetta autopsy scene. I mean the quirky inhabitants of an isolated island. Did I care about the characters? Nope. They seemed forcedly strange, too bizarre, too crazy swampfolkish. Did I laugh? Nope. The jokes were heavy handed. Plot? Argh, matey. It lost my interest. Excuse the pun but she is way out of her depth in this island based allegedly humorous tome.

I've made myself read half of the book hoping it would get better and then decided to look at the reviews to see if I should stick through to the end. I too think she must have had to come up with a book in a hurry - or else she is suffering from a brain tumor. The Trooper Truth stuff is so lightweight and there is an endless list of details that she doesn't even begin to bother making fit. Very sloppy, BORING, insulting, mindless, etc. It's hard to believe that Patricia Cornwell actually wrote this herself - compared to her last few books which were so brilliant - it's stunning to see such a mess that this book is.

The names of her characters are inane such as \\"The Clot Sisters,\\" \\"Hooter,\\" \\"Major Trader,\\" etc., and the vivid descriptions of the Governor's gastrointestinal problem is so unlike her previous books! I appreciate the research she did regarding pirates, the use of languages by pirates, but this book was not her usual excellent writing.

Normally Cornwell will wrap everything up in a nice package that makes sense.

I'm sorry, there's just no other word.","review":"It's hard to believe that the creator of Kay Scarpetta wrote this. The humor is lowbrow, the situations and characters are crass and unbelievable, the plot is weak. Cornwell's created a universe where everyone is on the decline, or never got high enough to have a decline. They are ugly, stupid and rotten except for the shrinking Hammer and the irritating Brazil. It's tough to read a book where literally every piece of action requires someone to be incredibly stupid. It's beyond farce, it's even beyond slapstick. It's just stupid.

Find they are becoming cookie cutter. Isle of Dogs is one of the worst books I have ever endured. She must have written it as an adolescent and just now published it.

A dog who types on the internet only makes the criminals more senile. Ms. Unique who mystically changes into a Nazi and loves to cut people.

But I was on a trip and didn't have a replacement book to listen to, so I plodded through it. And I foolishly kept thinking that it had to get better. It didn't.The characters are cartoonish and the plots - if you can call them that - are mind-numbingly unbelievable.

The attempted mixture of satire, humor and crime simply doesn't work. I bought this Isle of Dogs eagerly anticipating a great mystery story, hoping for another Scarpetta tour de force, and instead found nothing that remotely resembled her past books. A passing reference to Medical Examiner Scarpetta was the best I could find. And her attempts at satirical humor? Give me a break! Instead of searching the twisted minds of her criminals, now Cornwell tells us instead of the content of the minds of blue crabs as they attempt to escape from a crab pot. All in all, a waste of time and money. I shall find it very difficult to ever trust another Cornwell book. Please, someone, tell me that she will never do this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Ms. Cornwall's first works were clever page turners. Over the years she has replaced intrigue intrigue with horrific, brutal and grotesque crimes which are of little interest. Isle of Dogs was a rambling and disjointed piece. The introduction of historical detail went nowhere. She could have taken the many threads introduced in this book and used them as the basis for several novels. Sadly, I have no incentive to ever purchase another one of her works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind Numbing","review":"I can not believe this book was actually written by Patricia Cornwell. I bought this novel knowing it was not a Kay Scarpetta series but I assumed it would be well written. The HodgePodge references to Nascar; Tangier Island and the unlikable charachters made this book a chore rather than a page turner. The only redeeming quality of the book was the tidbits of history about Virginia revealed in the equally mind numbing columns penned by Trooper Truth; and I am begining to believe this book was more about using up any reference materials Ms. Cornwell discovered in her writing career than to actually entertain her reader. Do not waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"More fun reading the reviews...","review":"I borrowed this book with prior understanding that it is a departure from Cornwell's Scarpetta series, and is supposed to be darkly funny. I managed to plow through about half of it before I turned to the customer reviews in desperation. I'm happy to see I am not alone in my disgust. In fact, I laughed out loud reading the reviews, because the review authors DO seem to understand humor -- something Cornwell does NOT.

Naturally, I snatched up \\"Isle of Dogs\\" expecting her usual 'psychological intrigue' but was SORELY DISAPPOINTED! I found her attempts at humor blatant, mediocre, lame and tasteless. Her writing style was immature and overly simplified. most importantly, there were too many characters, too many flashbacks/regressions/etc..and too many threads to follow. I was unable to relate to or identify with any of her characters. Despite detecting these faults early on in the novel, I still managed to finish it but was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I highly recommend that you read her SCARPETTA novels (they are AMAZING) but you should avoid this one. \\"Isle of Dogs\\" is an experiment gone wrong and was a waste of time (to write and to read)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written to Fill a Contract Obligation???","review":"This latest Patricia Cornwell novel must have been written by a ghost writer. I cannot believe that the lady that has given us only excellent novels in the past actually wrote this. If Ms. Cornwell actually wrote this novel, she must have been up against a deadline and hadn't been able to come up with new believable ideas for her characters, so she just wrote a joke. The title should have been \\"Isle of Dogs: A Farse\\". Then, the unsuspecting fan might have had an inkling that they were about to spend money and time on something totally different from Ms. Cornwell's normally excellent mystery novels. This novel had the names of some familiar characters, but this story must have been about their distant country cousins, or perhaps people in a parallel universe where everyone are dopes. One star is too much. Don't waste your time or your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad no matter how much I tried!","review":"No matter how much I tried to like this book, I couldn't even bring myself to endure it. Being a person who never, never fails to finish a book, Isle of Dogs caused me to break that streak. Flat out this is an awful book. There are no characters to like. No wit or humor. No story to keep you coming back. And no reason to have wasted the paper printing the book. I can't believe Cornwell or the publisher would even put this on the shelf. This product is an insult to any reader.

This one is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond disappointing","review":"Do I have to give this book even 1 star?I've read that Agatha Christie tired of Hercule P. and only continued to write mysteries featuring him because her fans demanded it. Ms Cornwell may be feeling the same boredom and thus attempted to stretch her literary powers in Isle of Dogs. It didn't work. Although she certainly is free to write whatever she pleases, we don't have to read it (and I found this book virtually impossible to read). Isle of Dogs is a sad attempt at some sort of humor which fails miserably. Carl Hiassen does not have to worry; Ms Cornwell simply illustrates how very bad what he does so well can be when done poorly!

I failed. So, I tried again; and, yes, I failed again.I knew from the Kirkus review that this was not the usual accomplished Scarpetta novel, but I was prepared to give it a go. I found the plot(?) ludicrous, the characters so flimsy that they didn't last the length of the novel and ... Well, I guess you can say that one of my favourite authors let me down.The writing was difficult to follow at times and the story seemed to lurch from scene to scene. Often, when an author tries to capture dialect you can see failure laid before you on the page (the most notable for me is Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte), and Cornwell's attempt to capture the inbred, closed dialect of the inhabitants of Tangier Island left me bemused, not amused.That being said, there were a patches of truly well observed behaviour that presented true farce: regrettably they were too few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of the Dogs","review":"Ms Cornwell would do better going back to her original best sellers and following their lead.

An example of why she needed a good editor would be the \\"Trooper Truth\\" Website that presents dull essays and somehow alarms people. I know Ms. Cornwell uses the Web, but doesn't she know that if a Web page is boring, most readers will leave the site? I wonder if Cornwell is too powerful because of her bestsellers to listen to editorial advice or if some publisher said, \\"What the hell\\" and wondered if they could make money by publishing garbage.

I don't know how such a talented author could put her name to such garbage. I just wish it was like bad fish in the grocery store - you could return it and get your money back. Never again will I subject myself to her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Times a Loser","review":"Ms Cornwell's latest offering, Isle of Dogs, is perhaps the very worst of her forays outside of her Kay Scarpetta novels. \\"Hornets Nest\\" was a let down, \\"Southern Cross\\" even more poorly written. However, for the first time I could not read past page 64 of \\"Isle of Dogs\\". Characters are really bad. The character names are trite and absurd. One gets the feelings that these books are dashed off in a matter of days with no real thought or substance. I am a huge Kay Scarpetta fan and have all I can do to put them down once I start. These other offerings can scarcely hold my interest. Ms. Cornwell has also returned to her compulsion of extensive discriptives of colon disorders, which is pretty distasteful. If you truly want a good book pick up any of the Kay Scarpetta novels but avoid spending your money on these other offerings, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks!","review":"I would recommend not waisting your time with this book. It was juvenile and poorly written. The dialog is truely stupid. I couldn't believe it when the author actually had fish and crabs with conversation and actions.

I'm amazed at the difference between the Scarpetta series and this turd. Even though the last couple of Scarpetta books haven't been up to the standards set in the early books, they still had some class to them. No such luck here. I got the idea that Ms. Cornwell wanted this to be a humorous swipe at someone, but it comes off as anything but humorous. It's like reading a junior high kids snotty send up of his teachers; done without class, without humor, and worst of all, without heart. It's obvious that Ms. Cornwell has some axes to grind, but I can't say I care to do the research necessary to figure out why. If you haven't spent your money on this yet, by all means, don't. Amazingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh...wow...Completely Sucks?","review":"I have never before not finished a book I started.

The characters weren't memorable (in this book).About the only thing I giggled at was the confusion of VASCAR with NASCAR.The only consolation was I picked this up ina used book sore in the last chance bin -- even at that it was too much money and time.

In Hiassen's books the stories are real and the characters are absurd. In this book the plot line is missing and the characters should be in a home for the depraved. It is impossible to review the book because it makes no sense. It seems Ms. Cornwell had some characters she wanted to explore, then tried to come up with a story to tie them together, rather than telling a story through the characters.

I went romping through it, laughing all the way.

Nonetheless, Cornwell shows the same mastery in \\"Isle of Dogs\\" in her description of her characters, each of which in this case are wacky to the extreme, and her departing of esoteric information, which in this book is about archeology and the history of the Chesapeake Bay area.Read this book for the absurd imagination of the writer and give Dr. Scarpetta some time off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"A different type of writing than Ms Cornwell usually constructs for her Scarpetta novels.

There does not appear to be any focus on a particular storyline.Should the Governor be removed for incompetence?Should Brazil give up as a police officer? He definitely can't write.Should Hammer continue working as the Chief of Police when she can't meet with the Governor in over a year?Should the people of Tangier give up because they are inbred?This book does not carry any suspense.

I've never been moved, positively or negatively, enough to write a review on Amazon.com about a book. But I just put this book down with the express purpose of doing so for the first time. The book probably wouldn't have been so bad if it were set in a fantasy setting, but Cornwell attempted to integrate her pre-existing characters from the \\"real\\" world into a bizarre world of talking crabs and political lackies who suddenly succumb to genetic pre-dispositions towards pirate-speak.

I have read every one of her Kay Scarpetta series books, and enjoyed each and every one of them. When I saw that she had also written a series of three books, about the men and women in blue, I was eager to read them. The first one, Hornets Nest wasn't too bad but it wasn't up to her usual standards. The second one Southern Cross was even worse, But the last one, Isle of Dogs, was definitely one of the worst books I have ever read. I am absolutely amazed that this was a Patricia Cornwell novel. If it had been the very first book of hers that I had ever read, it would have also been the last. The plot, the bizarre characters, the backwards language, it was nothing but a mix-mash of confusing drivel.

Cornwell was recommended to me as a good writer of mysteries. I think she wrote a book that I read, based on forensic evidence of Jack the Ripper, which was pretty good. This book, however, was amazing. Amazingly bad, that is. Or amazingly bad for a well-written book. The writing style was fine, the editing fine. It was just that the characters, the story, the attempts at humor, were horrible. (Well, I did giggle a few times, mostly in bemusement.)

Goodbye Ms. Cornwell...and never forget that if you go on writing such silliness, you will not find a single reader in future even if you give away your books free.And another point: if this goes on like that, this book will be the first single-star rated book on Amazon (at least the first one I will see) and it truly deserves that status.

These characters have no type of personality and some have no reason for being in the story. There was one character, Unique, who could have really been made interesting if she had been fleshed out more. Then she tries to tell a story within a story through a series of newsletters that are confusing.

I had much difficulty putting the story line together. The initial character that started the book turned out to be a postscript. I kept waiting for this character to have some real substance...did not happen.I kept waiting for a real story line to develop...did not happen. Near the end of the book it sounded more like her writing and then it just ended. I talked a friend who also reads Ms. Cornwell with me to read this one and to stay all they way through.

BUT....I cannot believe Ms.Cornwell wrote Isle of Dogs. The worst of it all is that some critic has compared her new style with the brilliant black humour of Carl Hiassen. Sorry... but I entirely disagree. Hiassen together with Elmore Leonard are perfect in this style, and Patricia Cornwell, perhaps trying to copy it, has completely lost her shot. I feel very free to say it because I like Ms. Cornwell's books, but this narrative does not fit her style and Isle of Dogs is a disaster: bizarre but not funny; absolutely pathetic because you follow the building of an episope which should make you laugh and you just have to read it again just to find out that you're not the one who didn't understand the joke... it's just a bad joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Job","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read by an author of notable acclaim.

If I wanted to read Carl Hiassen or Elmore Leonard, I would.Explanations of the governor's lower intestinal distress, Major Trade's lunacy, and this band of pirates are not only totally unbelievable, but frankly, not very interesting.

I wouldn't have at all if it weren't for the fact that I bought it at the airport for 26 dollars.....learned my lesson there....!Anyway, the book is somewhat disorganized, the plot totally outlandish, and is so poorly written that your mind will wander while reading it. There are so many plot lines going that you just don't know where you are going. Missing kidnapped dogs, serial killers, insane governors, plotting servants, and web columnists, any of these might have been an ok story line on its own, but put together it makes for a childish plot.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her first book","review":"It's a good thing \\"Isle of Dogs\\" was not Patricia Cornwell's first book, because there likely would never have been a second, and the mystery genre would be infinitely poorer without Kay Scarpetta and Judy Hammer.I suppose you have to admire Cornwell for going out on a limb and trying a completely new style. Unfortunately, her try at a Dave Berry-style farcical romp fails miserably. A good comic writer can make a preposterous situation hilarious. Unfortunately, Cornwell only makes preposterous situations embarrasingly impossible.You can squirm through the first hundred or so pages, like I did, until you're convinced that it's only going to get worse. If you do, though, I recommend you handle the book carefully so it shows no visible signs of use, and you can return it to Costco and get your [money] back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Gee, I wish I had read the reviews before I ever read this book. In all honesty I did not read the book but listened to the audio book on CD that I got from the local library (I couldn't find anything else). Little did I know that this was an absolutely horrible piece of literature. I think it was mean to funny, but the humor was so forced and contrived was just so plain bad. The last coupele discs were scratched and skipped a lot, and in a way I am glad because I was able to get to the end faster. I have never read anything from this author before but I had heard she was good, after this book I'll never touch anything she has written with a 10 foot pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just rubbish","review":"Spare your time and money. This is just rubbish. After already wanting to throw this book against the wall several times, I've got as far as the crabs that talk and decided that enough, is enough.

Don't start it, best way to avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be \\"0\\" if I could","review":"As so many others have already said, this book is absolutely terrible!! I don't know what possessed her to write this piece of garbage. She should stick to Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! I'm not alone....","review":"I too wondered what drug Patricia Cornwell was on and actually twice shared that thought with my husband . I've read all of her other books and found them good but this was painfully disappointing. Trooper Truth? The speed plan on Tangiers island? The Governor? And the email exchange between Trooper Truth and Major Trader: \\" ......I suggest you tell me what you know this minute. Don't make me warn you again. And where her owner lives is none of your business.....\\" Seriously??? I'm about to chapter 10 and think I'll trash the book and go purchase a magazine in the village to get me through until I return from vacation. Definately not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever finished?","review":"I seriously contemplated giving this book a single star but decided that since I finished it - why I'm not sure! - it must have some redeeming quality.The official blurb describes this as a comic romp. Well at least I now know what it was supposed to be! I must admit part way through to thinking it must have been written as a comedy but, unfortunately, it seriously fails. This book just isn't funny. Excruciating? Yes! Abysmally written? Yes! Funny? Not a jot.I cannot comprehend how an author of this caliber could seriously write a book this bad. Does she believe that comedy means you throw out all rules of character, meter, pace and motive?Probably the worst thing is that this novel could have been great. It had some potentially great elements: Corruption in the Virginia governor's office, modern day pirates, a Chesapeake island who's inhabitants have their own language patterns and a severe distrust of the outside. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"My rating is really Zero. I agree 100 percent with all the other unfavorable customer reviews of this book; it was a major disappointment and I quit reading after the 3rd chapter; I should have stopped earlier or better yet, should have never bought the book. It was so unlike Ms. Cornwell's other books..this was amateurish and definitely not a \\"dark comedy\\" or \\"comic romp\\" in my opinion. It must have been a struggle to write, and it was an even bigger struggle to try to read. Boring, boring, boring! Ms. Cornwell should not attempt to write \\"comedy\\" and should just stick to her successful Kay Scarpella novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could write better!!!","review":"Does Miss Cornwell read these reviews by the Amazon readership? It would be a wise thing for her to do so that she can learn something from them and apply what she has learnt in her next book. IMHO, the book is so but soooo terrible that the publishing house should recall it from the market so that innocent readers like me are not gulllibly lured to the nice cover and somehow mysterious title. But the content? Oh My God, it stinks! How I wish that I had read these reviews before I bought this waste of poor Amazon trees!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piling On","review":"I hate to pile on, but this book was so bad that it needs the maximum number of bad reviews. If an unknown author had submitted the manuscript to a reputable publisher it would not have been printed.Trooper Truth was obnoxious.The people of Tangier Island were dissed as were nearly every citizen of Virginia. Cornwell should be run out of the state.If you like low high camp - buy the book. No. Save your money and waste your time and check it out of your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed by this Hammer/Brazil book.","review":"Let me say, I am a new Cornwell reader. I have read a few of her Scarpetta Novels and the two previos books in this series. I was very disappointed by this entry.It lacks what made the first two books of this series interesting, The intertwining of the three main characters. As a matter of fact, Deputy West is not in the book and is only mentioned once. Cornwell forces the humor in this book when in the previous two, the humor was more subtle. The minor characters are too over the top and in this book unbelieveable. And finally, while these books are not on the same level with the KS novels, the main thing that made them work for me is lacking. As I said before the interplay between the three main characters is missing.If you do want to read the books of this \\"side\\" series, stay away from this one. Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Scarpetta please","review":"When Cornwell writes a Scarpetta novel I can't put it down until I finish. When she writes a non-Scarpetta novel I read a few pages and can't wait to put it down. Why does she mess with a great concept by writing a mediocre novel such as Isle of Dogs. All three of her non-Scarpetta novels are pure drivel and not worth my valuable time!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother","review":"This book was written with little reference to Dr. Scarpetta and had references to dialog not necessary to book. Whatever has happened to Patricia Cromwell? She needs HELP before writing another book. It appears she had to put something on paper for her publisher by a certain date and just wrote a bunch of garbage to fill the pages. Don't get me wrong, I truly love most of her other books and anxiously await each new one, but this one's story is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs is a Dog","review":"The review said 'its not your regular Patrica Cornwell'...The author decided she would do something different...blah.I loved Scarpetta books but I'm not limited to this kind of novel. I thought Isle of Dog really stretched the boundaries- in a bad way. I'm sorry I bought it. It was hard to follow because the story line went from funny to stupid. It was like a funny 50 page story crammed into 300 pages.I can appreciate an artist trying new things - but please don't try this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and enjoyed every one of them. I purchased Isle of Dogs because I felt sure that I would enjoy it because Patricia Cornwell is a superior author. I was very disappointed. After 1/2 of this book, I could not endure, or spend the time on this any longer. I feel it is offensive to intelligence of her avid readers. I may be missing a message in this writing of Cornwell, but I could not suffer through the entire book. Any and all response to my review is welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author can do much better - and has","review":"Patricia Cornwell is usually an excellent storyteller, and her characters and plots are well-crafted. The main characters in this novel have appeared in earlier books as somewhat quirky but fundamentally intelligent and capable professionals. By setting them down in the farcial situation she creates in \\"Isle of Dogs,\\" Cornwell gives them no choice but to become farcial themselves, their intelligence diminished and their training of no use. By allowing her characters to lose their earlier identifies, they become mere puppets in a bad play. If you've never read Patricia Cornwell, don't buy this book; if this is only Cornwell you've read, don't judge her by this dismal effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone to the Dogs","review":"I have also bought all of Cornwell's books in hard cover and saved them - This book was on my Christmas list and I couldn't wait to read it.

What a waste of my son's money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This is the stupidest book I have ever tried to read. Patricia Cornwell should be ashamed to present this to her fans and readers. The characters are ridicules and the story line is a joke.

Shame on you Ms. Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I just finished Isle of Dogs and never have I had to MAKE myself read just to finish a Cornwell book - but there's always a first. I am such a HUGE fan of hers and was excited when I received this as a Christmas gift. Never have I been so disappointed in a book in my life. Talkin' crabs and trout, pirates, too much slang- bordering offensive, overweight lesbian children, the list is endless.Again, I must ask....What was she thinking - When she sat down to write this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel that I've been had.","review":"After having read the other reviews, I have little to add.I , too, did not read it through. Her other books, with one other exception, keep me up through the night.I just removed my book mark, placed it with those to go to my used book store, and felt taken.She owes it to us to warn us before we buy them when she knows, full well, that we are to be disappointed with her \\"wild hairs\\".I've sworn off before, due to the sadness seeping from the soul of the Doctor. She surely must recover sometime from her lost love.Is our dear author like this in her own soul? I trust not.She's such a talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE A PATRICIA CORNWELL FAN. You will be as disappointed as I was when I finally sat down to read it; it seemed that it was written by Cornwell's enemy. Usually when an author is writing about a subject that is a complete departure from the books she or he has written before, the fans get a warning about it. Imagine my surprise! I bought the book as soon as it was published but did not read it right away. So when I finally had a few days off work and sat with several books written by my favorite authors I did not expect the kind of story depicted in Isle of Dogs. Its a crazy story, with unbelievable characters and, frankly, I don't know if it falls into a genre at all. Big disappointment! I will be more careful about buying her books in the future. If it were up to me I would give it a zero star but I am forced to award one star to it; it doesn't deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone to the Dogs","review":"Farce is not Ms Cornwell's forte. If you have read other Cornwell's and loved them, as I had, please save yourself the time and disappointment by simply not bothering with Isle of Dogs. It is bad.If I had never heard of Ms Cornwell I would have thought this to be a first novel and vanity published.The plot is weak, the characters absurd and the whole novel is an insult to a reader's intelligence and Cornwell fans' loyalty.If I could have rated lower than 1 star it would have given me pleasure to award this a -5."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't take this too seriously","review":"The book starts out great. Interesting and quick moving. Then something happens! I realize that I am no longer interested in these characters or what happens to them. I do like Hammer and Brazil. They are the best characters in the book. It's silly and not even funny if that's where Cornwell was going with this. I am a serious Cornwell fan and have read all her books and I was disappointed in this book. She is known for her detail,descriptiveness and emotion and I didn't find any of those in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book - Should be Refunded","review":"I have liked Patricia Cornwell's other books and bought this one based on that opinion. My wife and I were both terribly disappointed. We have since hesitated in buying another one of hers as we might be burned again. Unfortunately, this seems to be a trend with many of the popular authors today, whether its a release of an older book or one that is published just to meet a deadline. Its hard to believe that this is a serious work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pleasant experience...","review":"I must say that I've enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's previous books, so I was looking forward to this (particularly due to the comparisons to Carl Hiaasen).It was an incredible disappointment - it was the first book in recent memory that I finally had to give up on halfway through. And the only book in my life that I have ever seriously considered trying to return for my money back.The storyline was incomprehensible (even after 200 pages), none of the characters were likable or even interesting. Even the 'protagonist' Andy was an annoying 'too good to be true' know-it-all.I suggest you save your money and purchase Ms. Cornwell's earlier works or try Carl Hiaasen if you're up for some dark comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"I was an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell and especially loved her Dr. Scarpetta character. Isle of the Dogs was one of the worst books I've ever read. I was insulted and offended by the characters, their situations and reactions to each other.

I've given up on Patricia Cornwell and I'm off to find a new favorite author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprised","review":"Southern Cross was a sad take off from Hornet's Nest.

Most of the characters are just cookie cutter stereotypes of Southern life, and the plot is just a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest literary disappointment of the year!","review":"I LOVE the author's Kay Scarpetta novels, so I was especially disappointed by this one...even tho' it started off suspensefully, it rapidly descended into an inane, deadly dull, hard to take work. Not to give anything away, but when the crabs in the pot began to voice their POV to the reader, I had to check the back cover to make sure that it was, in fact, an actual work of Cornwall's. What was she thinking!? What was I thinking by sticking with it to the bitter end--which was a challenge. There wasn't even a rewarding pay off. I'm sticking with Kay Scarpetta, who would be (if she weren't fictitious) embarrassed by her own cameo appearance in this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, again","review":"with an author that I counted as one of my favorites.

Corny, unimaginative, and boring are too kind of words to describe this book from one of my favorite authors! (Next time, I'll read Amazon reviews BEFORE I purchase the book).

I guess the joke's on us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative stars here!!!","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers. I am on page 48, and I cannot bear to go on. This reminds me of the plot of The Hook by Donald E. Westlake that involves a famous mystery author and his ghostwriter. I just could not bring myself to believe that Ms. Cornwall wrote this book. The stilted dialog was excruciating. The characters were flat and unappealing.I was really insulted that a reviewer compared this work to the extraordinary Carl Hiassen. I also bought this book at the airport, and by coincidence the man sitting next to me on the plane was also TRYING to read it. He was having problems getting through it too.I want my money back. How can Amazon.com's reviewer be so off??????? TO sell books maybe?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad, I Threw it on the Floor!","review":"I agree with 480 of the other 500 reviewers. I have read just about every Patricia Cornwell novel. A while back, I remember thinking that Hornet's Nest, a departure from the Kay Scarpetta series, was just not as good. Why, why, why didn't I remember that when I shelled out my hard-earned dollars for this abomination? One night recently, I picked up Isle of Dogs for the third time, got to about page 75 (yes, I lasted that long!) and threw the book on the floor. My poor slumbering wife was startled from her sleep, and I heaped my indignation on her. I'm sorry , honey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even for Dogs","review":"This is a disaster. I have admired and enjoyed Cornwell's books, but this effort is a catastrophe, the editor should be shot, and the publisher ashamed. Her brand of scatalogical humor went out in Junion High School. A major theme is a Govenor's Press Secretary feeding him chocolate cookies laced with ExLax, followed by lengthy descriptions of the result in graphic detail. This is for adolescents who want to gross out adults. Badly written and badly conceived, Cornwell is the reverse of the Clown who wants to play Hamlet. The loving descriptions of sadism do not help. Awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I was very disapointed. I have been a great fan of Patricia Cornwell and have enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta collection. As I was reading this book I wondered if the same person had done the writing. The plot moved around so fast you could not get to know the characters or care about them. The attempts at humor fell flat for me. I also think the book was an insult to the people of Virginia that they would elect a Govenor with no leadership ability and such a disfunctional family. Again if this was supposed to be humorous it fell flat. Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical Cornwell","review":"I picked this book up in an instant thinking it was like her others which I have read all of them -- this is nothing like her style and it jumps around so much I could hardly keep up with it - I couldn't even figure out a plot - Go back to Kay Scarpetta - they were enjoyable and you couldn't put them down - this one I'm having a hard time finishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I've read nearly everything written by Patricia Cornwell and look forward to each new book she puts out but this book was a tremendous disappointment and insult to my intelligence.

Back to Kay Scarpetta please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not even a chuckle","review":"I believe this was Cornwell's attempt at a black comedy, but I couldn't even muster a chuckle. It was horrible. I concur with previous reviews in that the plot wandered and when it got back \\"on track\\", the reader sure didn't know it. As an avid Cornwell fan prior to this read, I could never have imagined she was capable of writing such a thoroughly disappointing novel. She should stick with Scarpetta; that's why we all (used to?) read her anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I have bought and read every book written by Patricia Cornwell and am an avid reader of many other authors. This book was pitiful, just pitiful. I read 2/3 of the book and quit -- it was just too tedious. Too bad there is no money-back guarantee for this waste of time. Hopefully Ms Cornwell will get the message -- I will surely not blindly buy her books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"E for Effort","review":"There is only one word for this book: Ridiculous.

Fortunately, I got the book from the library, and did not purchase it. I have read all of her books, and although Scarpetta is my favorite, I have even enjoyed other books with Brazil and Hammer. But this one is a mess! I get the impression that she did it in a hurry to fulfill a contract agreement and just wrote off the top of her head, without a plan or a plot. True Cornwell fans will be very disappointed at this effort (or lack of it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the author and enjoy the book","review":"Most of those who have reviewed this book so far have focused on the disappointment they experienced when they expected something different. This is *not* your normal Cornwell, so drop your expectations and I think you will enjoy this novel.The plot itself is not particularly complex, but the fun for me was the collection of bumbling misfits who are at crosspurposes. Who, for example, could read this book without howling at the antics of Virginia's almost-blind, digestively-challenged, and most obtuse Governor Crimm?It does have its flaws and sometimes she pushes the envelope with her weird characters, but I had fun with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best, but kind of grew on me","review":"I agree with Lynne D. Mellinger's review of Patricia Cornwell's recent attempt at humor. Most readers are totally turned off by Isle of Dogs because they expect a Kay Scarpetta novel. (I must admit that I didn't read the jacket blurb myself.) I initially thought that the book was stupid and had a totally improbably plot. I stuck with it, however, and I finally got the point. Towards the end I actually was beginning to enjoy the humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"This is the worst book by Patricia Cornwell that I have read.

I honestly couldn't even tell it was supposed to be...it made me think of something a 6th grader would have written in Creative Writing. I have no idea who the hero or villain is supposed to have been as many characters seem stupid and evil but none are remotely likeable. There is an asinine relation drawn between each of the characters that is far beyond the realm of believability, yet not interesting enough to be funny. I have read almost every other Patricia Cornwell novel and am a big fan especially having lived in Richmond once, but I am severely disgusted by this book. This may be the last Cornwell novel I ever pick up. I appreciate that challenge of staying fresh, but Patricia Cornwell really \\"jumped the shark\\" with this one. She's lucky if she isn't sued by the residents of Tangier Island for her abuse of their home and culture in this cruel joke. This is an insult to Cornwell's loyal readers and a phenomenal waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird but OK","review":"I am a faithful follower of Patricia Cornwell's books but I have to tell that that the whole time I was reading this book, I kept questioning myself as to what the heck I was doing? It IS a weird book - no where in the realm of what Ms. Cornwell has written that I've read -- yet why couldn't I put it down? It's o.k. this time, but let's hope she goes back to writing in the style we are so accustomed to and where we hang on every word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Scarpetta","review":"I really enjoy Patricia Cornwell's books and have even read all three of the \\"Hammer and Brazil\\" books. They haven't been as interesting as the Scarpetta books, but have been somewhat entertaining. Isle of Dogs was a little \\"out-there,\\" but was still entertaining.

I have found their scientific approach appealing as well as the way Ms. Cornwell wraps the storyline. I find it hard to believe that Isle of Dogs was written by the same author. I am not completely sure what the central story was about because there were so many detours. At one point, there was a conversation between trout and crabs. I knew at this point that there was little hope in the quality of the book improving. The book was not only dull, but way below the quality of novel I have read from Ms. Cornwell in the past. It was very disappointing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of valuable reading time","review":"I've never written a review before, and appreciate this outlet with which to vent my frustration over this poorly-written book.First, let me say to those that were looking for a Kay Scarpetta novel, do not look here. Scarpetta is mentioned only briefly.Second, the characters are poorly developed with ridiculous-sounding names such as: Windy Brees and Uva Clot.Lastly, the story line is greatly lacking; what it does have is a hodge-podge of characters thrown together for an overall ridiculous story.Overall comments: Why bother? There are plenty of other good novels out there to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chumming the Waters","review":"I always feel for an author whose fans won't allow her to experiment, to grow, or to change, but PDC must hold up her end of the bargain as well. This book is just \\"odd.\\" Talking crabs, broad farce, dire circumstances, tons of bathroom humor, a nearly perfect trooper (Andy Brazil) and an equally intelligent boss (Hammer) lost in a sea of one dimensional Virginia morons.I'm willing to let Kay fade away and Judy and Andy to flourish, but this book is poorly written, poorly plotted, poorly paced, and is neither in the humor camp nor the police reality fiction camp. It's just plain odd.Worst of all, I feel cheated. I bought this book without checking the reviews and, worse!, in hardback. Cornwell's just chumming the waters for her money machine with this title. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it used","review":"Patricia Cornwell is always worth reading, but I recommend that you buy this book used. Her story lines bounce between what characters (including fish) are thinking and what is really happening to the character using vague allegories involving elevators, submarines and faithful mini horses. Even Trooper Truth can't seem to stick to the subject. The only thing that is clear is her love for helicopters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Reader","review":"Like so many others who have written reviews for this book, I am an avid Patrica Cornwell reader. This book indeed is a departure from her other books. I am just a little over halfway through it and have to force myself to pick it up and read another chapter.

I cannot believe a publisher would have accepted this book if submitted by an unknown author. NOT an enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up!","review":"OK -- I tried. I've read all the others, and this is the first time I've ever been motivated to write a review. This book does not rate of \\"review\\"; it's definitely a \\"pan\\"!

I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even someone who's never read Cornwell. Satire is one thing; spoof is another; silly doesn't follow either. (I haven't read any of the other reviews on this site.

I'm suppose to care what a blue crab is saying? Or a trout? It is hard for me to believe that Patricia Cornwell wrote this mess. The action never gets started but sort of 'burps' along. Her description of the characters was the only thing that gave me hope that the next chapter would be an improvement. It was not. I feel like I slogged along uphill to complete this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointing surprise!","review":"I bought this book because I had read and enjoyed several of Patricia Cornwell's earlier books. I can honestly say that I do not remember reading any book that was so disappointing. I lost interest in the storyline and characters early on, and pushed myself to finish it, hoping that somehow it would redeem itself, and show at least some of the excellence of the author's previous work. But no! The subject, the style, the absurdity - this is not a work worthy of the author. How did it ever get published? If this is the new style of Ms. Cornwell, she has definitely lost a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"A re-run of the Dukes of Hazzard??","review":"Patricia Cornwell has resorted to humor as she makes a change from her Kay Scarpetta novels. I read one half of the book before I gave up. Stick to your day job: writing good mystery/forensic science.The only character in the book that I thought was a real person type was \\"Pony\\", the butler. Everyone else was right out of Dukes of Hazzard. Even my seven year old wouldn't think this is funny. By the way, I'd give five stars to the Scarpetta novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a total waste of money","review":"I bought this in an airport to read on a flight and with nothing else to read, STILL couldn't read past page 50. This book is truly awful. Cornwell may know forensics but a comic writer she is NOT...I wish no stars were possible in this review, but as it is, one HAS to give at least one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad for the Trees","review":"It's too bad that all of those trees were cut to print this waste of time. I couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a kidnapping?","review":"This is a book about a kidnapping... many might assume I'm talking about the rotten dentist who is held on the island by his patients after they discover what dreadful things he has done to their teeth. But, I'm talking about the apparent kidnapping of one of my favorite authors, Patricia Cornwell. The Patricia Cornwell I'm talking about always drew praise for the reality of her work--the detail that took you into the story and made you believe you were there. I'm afraid that my kidnapping explanation is much more believable than the talking seafood and a dog that can read and type on a computer. If anyone hears of the safe return of my favorite author, please let me know and I will again feel compelled to read anything new that appears with her name. Until that time I just hope that she has not been harmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes a Publisher Should Just Say NO","review":"I don't care if a revered author finally DOES dedicate a book to you. That's not rationale for a publisher and friend (as Cornwell calls her in the dedication) putting out a book so obviously banged out in a few days to meet a deadline. Calling it a \\"dark comedy\\" is an extreme kindness. The characters don't even rate as parodies. If you love stupid slapstick, this might work for you, but I have the feeling few true mystery readers do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Stinker","review":"I've been a Cornwell fan since she began writing. The books featuring Dr. Kay Scarpetta are beautifully written, suspenseful and keep me glued to my seat. The Isle of Dogs, on the other hand, was like a very cheap imitation of Carl Hiiasen novels. It just does not work; I was embarrassed for the author. How can such a wonderful writer write such [stuff]? I hope she got this out of her system and goes back to what she does so beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I loved Patricia Cornwell novels until I read this one. This is the most boring book she has written. I could not believe the talking animals. I kept waiting for the book to get better and to deal with Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Finally in the last 1/3rd of the book she brings her into the picture. This book was a waste of money and I advise others not to bother to read it. It lacks in quality and taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone to the Dogs","review":". I bought this book expecting a good weekend read, but this book is so confusing that there was just no getting into it. I was so disappointed because I have always enjoyed Cornwell's books, but Isle of Dogs is a waste of time and an insult to Cornwell's reputation. I feel I was cheated!! Stick to what you know Patricia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I enjoy reading Patricia Cornwells books but this one \\"isle ofdogs\\" is the worse book i have read in a long time. I kept reading thinking it would get better but half way through I quit.When animals started to talk that was enough. Sorry but this onedoesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best use - lining the litter box","review":"This has to be the worst book I've read in the past ten years. Maybe the author was trying to mimic Lundlum's \\"The Road to Gandolfo\\", but after 100 pages, I was ready to kick myself for wasting my time reading such drivel.If only the pages were larger, I'd use it to line my cat's litter box."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snooze!","review":"As most loyal fans of Patricia Cornwell, I anxiously await any new stories she publishes. After reading her latest, Isle of Dogs, I can honestly say Cornwell needs to go back to writing the Scarpetta novels. Isle of Dogs was one of those books you can pick up or put down and forget about it. The latter is where I was with it.Isle of Dogs is a continuation of the Judy Hammer series, but I found very little about Hammer in this book. There are several new characters introduced in this title, instead of Hammer being the main character, and that was quite disappointing. Cornwell seemed to focus a little too much on the character of Andy, as well as providing a history lesson about the area, which was incredibly boring. The storyline goes as most of her novels do - people get killed, butchered, and eventually a lone perpetrator gets a conscience and confesses. End of story. That is how boring this book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle is a big tease","review":"The book does not live up to our expectations of this author. Although, elements of the story line offer some hope, they ultimately are disappointing and go nowhere. The resolution of the book was unsatisfying and appeared as if Corwell just ran out of steam. This book is a DOG.."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there's a rating less than one, this earns it!!!","review":"I have read every book that Patricia has written, and have loved them all with the exception of Southern Cross. That one I was just ok with. BUT, Isle of Dogs, however, is so totally not Patricia Cornwell that I would NEVER recommend it to anyone; they'd think I was nuts!!Whatever she attempted to do here was an absolute failure as far as I'm concerned. As I kept reading, I could not believe it was actually written by Patricia! That's how bad it was!I'm hoping this book was just \\"a little crumb\\", so to speak, that she threw out to us while we are waiting for her \\"greatest of all\\" Scarpetta mysteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently written by and for a 10 year old","review":"I feel fortunate that I read this book from the library so I didn't waste any money buying it! I approached the book with an open mind since I am a fan of Patricia Cornwall and of good writing. I had read a review comparing this book to the writing style of Carl Hiaasen -- PULEESE. This is nothing like the creative, humorous style of Mr. Hiaasen - and I've read all of his books as well. The plot is stupid and the language is simple yet confusing and a BIG waste of time. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why force yourself to finish a book","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and eagerly awaited this one. What a disappointment. At first I kept reading thinking that at some point it would begin to make sense and finally decided that no one was forcing me to finish this and put it aside thinking I would start again another time. The book still sits on my shelf, unread, and probably never read. Does anyone want to buy a \\"like new\\" copy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Cornwell --no way","review":"Actually, I haven't finished the book...I'm not sure I will. The Tangier Island residents with their backward language and the governor's \\"submarine ailment\\" have just about turned me off. I don't think the residents of the state of Virginia will want Patricia Cornwell to move back to Richmond. I'm sure they are humiliated that their state is being portrayed with such inept characters supposedly elected or appointed to uphold the law. Perhaps I'll try to get through another page or two tonight before it puts me to sleep........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Scarpetta","review":"This book is a mess. It never takes off, the plot is jumbled and incomprehensible, and the characters are sadly unbeleivable. Cornwell is trying to be Carl Hiaasen, but ends up like a bad junior high school creative writing assignment.Pick any Kay Scarpetta novel, avoid this one. If you want good crime/comedy, read Hiaasen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Having read several of Patricia's books I never hesitated in choosing Isle of Dogs knowing that it would be a book I would enjoy. Boy, was I wrong. This is a poor excuse for a author of her caliber. Since I have a long drive to work each day I enjoy audio books and I checked this one out at my local library. I couldn't finish the first cassette, it was that bad. Since then I have spoken to several other people and they all felt the same way. I'm just glad I didn't spend money on it, then I would have really been mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stranded on Isle","review":"I agree with other readers. This is not Patricia Cornwell's forte. I suggest she leave the dark comedies to Carl Hiaasen.Give us Judy, Andy AND Kay back again, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Police Academy -- The Book???","review":"As a screen play for a grade B movie -- perhaps. The humor is forced, the plot is impausible and the characters are silly. I bought this latest at the airport before a 14 hour flight -- what a mistake. I read the first page or two and wrongly assumed I was getting the usual thriller. I stayed along for the ride which is as bumpy as the helicopter landing in the finale. What a waste of paper. Hope Ms. Cornwell can sleep at night after this embarassment of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Doggy Book for Sure","review":"Very disappointing. I have enjoyed Ms. Cornwell's books in the past however the last three that I tried to read have not been to her earlier standards. I struggled through Black Notice but gave up trying to read The Last Precinct. There are simply TOO many impausible events in this attempt at humor. Shame on Ms. Cornwell and double-shame on her editor who let this attempt slip into publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I am a huge fan on Cornwell's work, especially the Kay Scarpetta series. However this was awful. Try as I might I just couldn't finish it.Please Patricia, stick what you know best..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DOG - FOR CERTAIN!","review":"I have for many years enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's work, this book, however, is a real disappointment. Stick to the formula that works! Kay Scarpetta is a believable character. None of the characters in Isle of Dog's are the least bit interesting or believable. The entire premise is ridiculous, disjointed and not fitting in an otherwise enjoyable body of work. Better luck on the next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black humor ? More likely a brain tumor!","review":"If ever a book deserves a zero---THIS IS IT!! I feel angry that I actually paid for this dismal failure and positively retarded to have invested the time it took to read it! I kept reading it (even though it took over a week to make myself finish it) because I was dumbfounded with the horribly inept writing style. It seems incredible that the person who wrote her previous novels also wrote this book. I noticed that there appears to be tears in her eyes in the photo on the back cover. If I had the talent and skill reflected in her previous works and this waste of trees is the best I could produce, I would cry as well. Then again, perhaps it was tears of shame for ripping off her loyal readers. It will be the last book written by Ms. Cornwell that I will purchase or waste my time reading. I don't think it was an attempt at black humor--- more likely a brain tumor! Please, for your health and safety, Ms. Cornwell get a complete neurological workup at once!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I enjoy all types of books, including most of Cornwell's books. I bought this book expecting a good weekend read, but this book is so confusing that there was just no getting into it. I got to page 123, then threw it down and said no more. It's the first time in many years that I have not finished a book I started. I was so disappointed because I have always enjoyed Cornwell's books, but Isle of Dogs is a waste of time and an insult to Cornwell's reputation. I feel I was cheated!! Stick to what you know Patricia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"I own every book that Patricia Cornwall has written, including her last one. It will by MY last one. It is a cross between \\"The Dukes of Hazzard\\" and a Dean Koontz novel, both of these being far superior to Isle of Dogs. I can not say how utterly disgusted I am with myself for having purchased such tripe. I regret having to give it even one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper","review":"I'm a Cornwell fan. That said, this book is awful. Apparently no one in Virginia is capable of speaking proper english. That includes the talking blue crabs.The device of essays posted on a website only serves to distract. The protagonist is incredibly dull and lacks the depth of scarpetta at al. Hold out for the next Scarpetta book."},{"rating":"1","title":"...only because I couldn't select \\"Zero Stars\\"!","review":"Others have said it better, but I just feel so cheated by Ms Cornwell. I have thoroughly enjoyed her Kay Scarpetta mysteries and I don't remember Hornet's Nest being of this ilk, but Isle of Dogs is really cr*p. There's no other word for it. Was she trying to be Douglas Adams? If so, she failed by a country mile. Was she on drugs? It certainly comes over that way. Unfortunately, I'm the sort of person who refuses to put a book down once I start it--how I wish I weren't! I've now just started Southern Cross, and it looks like more of the same. Come on, Patricia, we all know you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"I wanted to like this book. Really...I did. And I definitely have a sense of humor. Honest! But sadly, I made it through just eight chapters and had to admit that this was just about one of the worst books I'd ever read.The characters are shallow and silly and as much as I tried to stretch my imagination, I could not fathom why the these characters, indeed the whole state of Virginia, was captivated by Trooper Truth's website. Granted, I'd never be invited to join MENSA but I'm not a stupid guy. I just didn't get it.This is the second book Ms. Cornwell's written that I've haven't been able to finish, the first being the \\"Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper - Case Closed.\\" That book was all over the board and as a result, difficult to follow. If I'd have made some of the assumptions and leaps she's made in her work, I'd have been fired a long time ago.Goodbye Ms. Cornwell. At least I have my memories of what used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so surprised!","review":"What a big disappointment! Patricia Cornwell is one of my favorite authors, so to go on a camping trip with a brand new book by her was something to look forward to. I couldn't even finish the book, though I tried, day after day. I finally just gave up. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Is Very Generous","review":"Mindless drivel! It's sickening to see writers resort to such inane and worthless nonsense, capitalizing on their reputations, but it seems to be happening more often than not. I can't believe I'm actually going to finish reading this masterpiece of ineptitude, were I not somewhat of a masochist, I would have incinerated this piece of garbage long before now.And so, I join the group with a one star rating only because zero is not an option. Anyone wants my copy, let me know. It's up for grabs until the toilet paper runs out here at the farm."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO MORE HAMMER!","review":"As with the other books featuring Hammer, I thought this one was horrible. Cornwell really needs to give up this character and line of books and stick with Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insult to readers","review":"Like another reviewer, I listed one star only because there is no choice for no stars. You can work at reading this book as dark humor or whatever, and no doubt produce clever deconstructions of it. It still sucks. In Canada hardbounds cost [$$$]. I'd been a Cornwell fan up to now. This isn't just a bad book. Cornwell had to work to make it as bad as it is. Three friends, all previously Cornwell fans, blasted the book, so I thought I'd write this to help get the word out. Too bad; Cornwell brought me entertainment pleasure in the past. I've kept all her other books, but won't be buying the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disaster","review":"I am a passionate Cornwell fan - but this book almost changed that. The intertwined plot was silly - a speed trap on Tangier Island, a character with supernatural powers - and I found myself bored. There are some wonderful characters, but they are drowned in the heavily contrived story. Regretfully, I bought this book in hardcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs is a dog.","review":"After reading all of Patricia Cornwell's previous works, I was looking forward to this latest book. I should have saved my money and time. Her previous works were marked by scientific accuracy and suspense. This book is totally unbelieveable and is seriously marred by hocus pocus and nonsense. If you must read it, get it at the library or wait for the paper back version."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mess","review":"I eagerly awaited new characters as I grew tired of Dr. Scarpetta in the last book. That book was all about feeling sorry for oneself and reviewing everything that happened in earlier books. What a waste.However, Isle of Dogs is so boring. I read about a third, then decided to check Amazon to see if I was missing something. Seems about everyone agrees with me. Some of the humor is interesting. Especially since it is new for Cornwell. The plot is so silly. Cornwell's first four books were great. After that, beats me what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell's abusing her readers","review":"Isle of Dogs is yet another Hammer-Andy Brazil episode valued only as proof that Cornwell is a bored author writing for her own amusement instead of her readers'. This alternate series of books is as bad as the Scarpetta series is good -- and Isle of Dogs is the mutt of this litter. The plot is asinine, the writing infantile and the intended satire woefully un-Swiftian. I suspect this manuscript would have netted quite a collection of publishing house rejection slips had it not been from a prize-winning author with a ready-made readership to fleece. Frankly, I feel abused -- if Cornwell no longer finds Scarpetta entertaining, she should just be honest and quit writing instead of resting on past laurels. As for me, I won't be paying hardcover full prices again for another of Cornwell's non-Scarpetta efforts. I'll either await the paperback, or skip it entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than 1 star","review":"I assume this book was meant to be humorous, however it is no joke. If it were possible to rate lower than 1 star.....the plot is nonsense, and the dialogue banal. There is nothing \\"funny\\" here except the irony of paying good money for one horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"godawful","review":"The line \\"every body knows, that the world is full of stupid people\\" is just a lyric, not a story line for an entire novel. I was unable to finish it, and completely overwhelmed by the ongoing and absolute abundance of unbelievable stupidity. Not to mention, sincerely disappointed, as I usually enjoy her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"isle of dogs","review":"BORRING, BORING, BORING!!!I didn't care about any of the characters. A slow read. Read many other of Cornwell books and enjoyed them. This one I couldn't finish - skipped to the last chapter and could have skipped that! Wish I had read the reviews on Amazon.com before I purchased the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst pieces of tripe I've ever read.","review":"I normally enjoy novels by Patricia Cornwell, however, either this book was written by someone other than Patricia Cornwell as a grade school essay, or the author has discoverd hallucinogenics since her last novel. The dialog was horrid and did nothing to develop the characters, which were one dimensional. The plot was not only thin and disjointed, but I believe the author forgot what her plot was supposed to have been in several places judging from its unexplained changes in direction. There seemed to be some hope of all the unrelated and irrelevant characters coming together at the conclusion of this novel in some coherent manner; however, the author missed her one opportunity of redeeming this hopeless waste of a novel. I would call the ending anti-climactic had there been any building of plot, but the novel was just one flat embarrassing stumble through a miasma of mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Cornwell at her very worst","review":"The only reason I gave this one star is because there isn't an option of no stars. Absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read. I normally love Patricia Cornwell and have every book in her Kay Scarpetta series, but here she's humiliated herself beyond words. Her editor and publisher should be ashamed of themselves. I will be attempting to sell my copy of this book. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"I have never had this happen to me before, but as I was looking at this book in the bookstore a woman walked over to me and said about the book, \\"Horrible. Absolutely horrible!\\"Talk about bad word of mouth!And she was right! Yikes, what's up with the editors at this publishing house??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isle of Dogs","review":"Yikes, I couldn't even finish it. I loved her earlier works, even the non-Scarpetta books were enjoyable. I can understand how she might get sick of her characters as many authors do and as she's obviously done with the Scarpetta series and I'm grateful she just took a break instead of killing the rest of those charaters off, but this is just awful. Someone please tell her she's not funny. Flat characters and bad tempered stabs at humor, don't bother, wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Forensics","review":"I could not complete the book...a rarity for a Cornwell novel. I bought the audio book for this, and went through 3 tapes complete believing it had to get better, and then tried to get to better sections, but finally gave up.Start with characters: most of them unbelievably morons...too extreme for public officials & professionals...and that's not easy to say.Trooper Truth Monologues.....go on and on and on in most cases.In most cases, what do they have to do with the \\"trooper\\" idea?They sound like methods to just expound upon some personal research: \\"Patricia...write a non-fiction book instead, please!\\"Plot: oh yeah...I got real excited about such a quick \\"secession\\" over 1 1/2 striped lines...plot - best place 6 feet down under. And the killings....no development...no reason...6 feet under also!Stick to your forensic tales, Patricia. Most of them have been GREAT! Let Judy Hammer tales die!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring to be Cornwell !!","review":"This is the MOST BORING book I think I have ever read. Characters that are not to be believed, lack of plot, too many tangents - need I say more. Sorry Patricia, but this is a bomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone seen Patricia Cornwell???","review":"Has anyone seen Patricia Cornwell???Without doubt, this was the WORST book I have ever FORCED myself to read. Cornwell could NOT have written this piece of junk. I have LOVED all of Cornwell's previous books and am appalled at this work. Don't waste your time and money. Frankly, I want my money back. It really deserves NO STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Effort From a Favorite Author","review":"Sadly, of all this author's books I've read, this was the most disappointing. The plot was uneven. The connections between the characters were weak. The book felt disjointed and the attempts at humor fell far short. I did not like the character developement of Andy or Judy Hammer. It was disappointing.I did get through it because I was loathe to quit and kept wishing for a strong ending that would help it make sense. Alas, it was not there.My apologies to Ms. Cornwell whose work I have always enjoyed tremendously. Your work has educated and even moved me in the past. I will not give up! I will remain a loyal fan and hope for the better we all know you are capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of trees!","review":"I couldn't get past the first third of the book. Tedious, boring, convoluted, contrived. It is dreadful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish the scale would let me rate this a negative 5","review":"I have never written a review before but this book was so bad I just have to vent. I am a great supporter of Patricia Cornwell and have read (and own) every book she has written. I fell in love with Cornwell's books because they were intelligent. I have to admit that I like the earlier books more than the latest. The focus of the earlier books was putting the pieces together to solve the puzzle while later books have focused on dysfunctional relationships and writing thrillers. In spite of that change, I still continued to buy each new Cornwell book because, as unbelievable as the story line might be, there was still a thread of intelligence. However, this is just about the straw.Isle of Dogs is stupid. The characters are stupid. The storyline is stupid. It's almost like it was written to dumb it down for the readers. Maybe stupid is funny but not when stupid me paid real money on this book. I will not make that mistake again with this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cornwell Book Ever Written","review":"As a loyal Corwell reader, I purchased this book with the same enthusiasm as with all former reads. What a disappointment and I'd love to get my money back. I read the entire novel despite willing myself to quit after the 1st 100 pages. My advice to Patricia: stick with your successful format. You have an intelligent following -- please don't disparage us again."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!","review":"Briefly, too many great books constantly being published, this is not one. Don't bother. I'm usually one to read a book to the end, no matter what. This is one of the few novels I could not complete. After 100 pages, I still found the characters and plot implausible and not sufficiently imaginary to interest me. Simply, not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell gets corny","review":"Having read most of her books it's hard to believe that she hadanything to do with this one. The first few pages would lead oneto believe that this could be a great read. Unfortunately the plot(is there a plot?)and the characters are so unbelieveable.The dialogue reeks of a 12 year old with a creative writing assignment. Maybe it's all a joke on us, perhaps this was a comedy. I feel bad for Kay Scarpetta. She got dragged into the this poor excuse for a novel and came off looking like an idiot as well. If by chance you read this book and can't get beyondpage 50, do yourself a favor and read an earlier work. I wouldsuggest \\"Potter's Field\\" as a good place to start.A short note to her editor. You should be fired!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Cornwell's Gone to the Dogs!","review":"Major disappointment. 1 star rating too high. Unfair to fans when author makes a radical departure from previous excellent works without a warning on the cover! Let's hope this book gets remaindered off quick and Patricia Cornwell returns to what she does so well (and I don't mean cookbooks, although that's probably better than this book - wonder if there are any dog recipes in it?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"I'm new to Cornwell's novels. I read Black Notice and The Last Precinct and became a Cornwell fan. I looked forward to reading Isle of Dogs then couldn't read beyond the 30th page. Shame on you Patricia! Go back to your straight forward Dr. Scarpetta mysteries. That is where you shine! Your attempt at \\"humor\\" comes off as silly, silly, silly. When you came up with the character \\"Windy Breez,\\" I gagged and stopped reading the book. I'm sure this book will be a disappointment to all your faithful readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Dog Writes Better Than This!","review":"After reading all of Cornwell's previous Kay Scarpetta series, I was obviously overly excited at purchasing this book before carefully reading its contents. From the ridiculous character names to the lame attempt at creating any type of coherent storyline, this book was an all out failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"My sentiments exactly!","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift because I have usually enjoyed this author, or at least the Scarpetta series. About a quarter way through the book, I started reading a different book and cannot make myself start reading Cornwell's book again! I decided to read the reviews to see if anyone agreed with my assessment and found out that practically all the reviews to date have duplicated my thoughts. It's really sad to see such a reknown author produce this kind of literature. If I wanted to read this kind of sick humor, I'm sure I could find a MADD magazine at a much cheaper price."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVEN THE CRABS ARE DISAPPOINTED!!","review":"By far, the absolute WORST book I have ever read in my life. I normally don't like to write bad reviews, but if I stop even ONE PERSON from wasting their time on this book, it will be worth it. I had to see what else Jamie von Becken had on his \\"Best\\" list so I don't accidentally pick one of those at the library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wardman's work offers fantastic insight.","review":"For those who's aquantance with ancient Rome could be described as introductory, Wardman offers steeped insight to the relation of religion and the State. He paints with a relatively broad brush in order to span the Roman experience, but still manages to offer keen specifics to support his points of interest. As you make your way through the text, Wardman slowly demonstrates how the texture of Religion in Roman society shifted throughout the centuries of it domination. Most importantly, Wardman addresses the misconceptions put forth by prior scholars with regards to civic polytheism being replaced by monotheistic Christianity. He clearly demonstrates that the process has a clear precedence in Roman history and also revels the miscues of past historians who claimed that civic polytheistic 'faith' died out due to its inability to respond the the religious needs of individuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting Peppy Powerful Different Fast-Paced Rolling.

It is Uplifting, Peppy, Powerful, Different Fast-Paced Rolling. A DaNce Great for SURE! There is so much electricity and energy in \\"Unspeakable Joy\\" song #3 on the CD it's incredible. \\"Unspeakable Joy\\" is also kind of a cool contradiction in itself in that the LYRICS speak of JOY, yet the song has a somewhat evil beat. The BASS is the best of any song I have heard ... Dance, or otherwise. The song twists and turns in idiosyncasies, with great interludes. The Beat goes up and down. I also love the the main Lyrics: \\"Unspeakable Joy, as they did not give it, they cannot take it away\\". The song says you got to make your own JOY in life. I don't usually Dance.... but I do to this one! I give it 6 STARS out of 5 possible STARS! C.

I will continue listening to this track as much as i can now and suggest it to any one who wants to be lifted up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RIGHT-ON!","review":"This is simply one of the best dance tracks I've heard in a long time. The lyrics are very uplifting and positive, and the music is ahead of it's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor & Guido, powerful Diva Vocals, Clubland's #1 track?","review":"Easily one of 1999's best club tracks. With some of the most pounding beats we have heard in a long time. Tons of breaks and build-ups to put you into a tizzy. Razor & Guido have re-worked this track into a clubkid's dream. The single also includes the remixes of Bobby D'Ambrosio, which have been sorely overlooked. Also a great mix of the song, but not as hard, D'Ambrosio takes a housier spin on this one, and keeps it light. It still works, and it works well, but it does not have the power that the Razor & Guido mix does. The lyrics on this song are uplifting and the vocals are fantastic. I had heard other Kim English tracks before (\\"Nite Life\\" and \\"Supernatural\\" come to mind) and they had done nothing to make me a Kim English fan, well, this one is changing my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy dance track with a deeper message","review":"I used to hear this song in the clubs and on dance compilations all the time and I loved it. I recently became a Christian and one day this song kept running through my head. I began to think about alot of Kim's lyrics which seem to have some very spiritual sounding themes. So I did some research, and in an article written a few years ago Kim spoke very adamantly about her faith in God and that He inspires her lyrics. I dont think this song is about making your own joy, as one person who reviewed this suggested. It's about finding joy and strength from the source, from God. Joy that can never be taken away.I think it's awesome that there are artists out there who are sharing their faith openly in their music, not judgemental, not ramming it down your throat, but just sharing that unspeakable joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is ABSOLUTE POWER! Raise the Roof! Bring the Noise!","review":"I'd never heard anything like it. I get more requests from club fans to play track number 5 on this single than any other spin on my list. Razor N Guido really did justice on this one. I recommend the Unspeakable Joy [CD-SINGLE] to any DJ, professional or bedroom. This is the power house fans have been starving for. Absolutely awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal - but 3 songs short","review":"For those like myself who are looking to replace their vinyl collection with CDs, this is a great deal. But there was no notice on the Amazon info page that there were 3 songs omitted due to space limitations. The minimal sleeve info on this CD reissue does indicate this, but doesn't say which songs.Chain Reaction (10 songs on vinyl) is missing the last song from side 1 - Rainbow Visions (6:15) and the 4th of 5 songs on side 2 - Sugar Cane (2:31). Southern Knights (7 songs on vinyl) is missing the last song on the record - Feeling Funky (3:00). Since SK has far less songs, I can understand the decision to drop only one from that album. Personally, I'd rather have seen the SK song Keep That Same Old Feeling (5:36) - with band vocals - dropped in favor of keeping both Sugar Cane and Feeling Funky, but no one consulted me first. To me, Chain Reaction is the best Crusaders album of this period. There isn't a weak song on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chok Rock - Big City Loser","review":"Although the start of \\"Give It Up,\\" the first track on Chok Rock's _Big City Loser_ EP, might not sound as if it has much rock, by the end of the track, after the electro-funk has faded, blues-rock noodling takes over, albeit punctuated with electronics. \\"Buzz\\" has much more of that rock/electronic crossover feel, with some Prefuse 73-style cut-ups and rhythms (but with a French accent that takes a moody turn towards the end). These tempo-morphing tracks keep the listener surprised: \\"Happy Man\\" gives up some cool, Gallic funk before moving upbeat (with electric guitar) and back again, while \\"Take a Plane\\" comes the closest to pure rock, starting a strummed guitar riff melded with synth sweeps and some skeletal drum hits, all smothered under fuzz and distortion. Everyone's a winner with this \\"loser.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfaction","review":"I don't live in America. But I am satisfied with the short time delivery.

I thought it was too dark, and I didn't think the melodies were very catchy. A few years later, I decided to listen to the album again to see if my opinion of the album would change considering my perspective had changed over the years. The more I listened to the album the more I came to appreciate the production, the songwriting, and even found myself humming those very melodies which I found unattractive before. Now I am a definite fan of Harcourt's music and I am recommending to most of my friends that they buy his music and so should you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I was very dissapointed in this CD and do not recommend it. The songs are uninspired and don't compare to other artist/material in the genre. I forced myself to listen to it several times to give it the benefit of the doubt.....no use. Invest your money in other artist. Like another reviewer noted, the best songs are the first five and they are mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjustments required all the time","review":"Great idea for a mirror. But, I put it on a 2008 Tundra and the mirrors need to be re-adjusted every time you open and close the door as well as after short periods of time while driving. Too much tolerance as a universal mirror I guess. I do like the two mirror idea...but way too much continuous adjustment required on my truck to recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch for fit problems","review":"If your vehicle's mirrors are a stationary fairing or housing with a pivoting mirror inside, you need to make sure that the mirror is well recessed in the housing on both top and bottom. The clips in the arms of this mirror need to extend into the housing about 1/4 inch, and they are fairly thick.When attached to the mirror on my 2008 Pathfinder it restricts the adjustment of the Pathfinder's mirror, forcing it to point down as the mirror is nearly flush with the housing on the bottom edge. I also found vibration to be a problem, perhaps partially due to the problems with the fit.On the plus side, it appears to be well constructed with plenty of adjustment in the straps, and my fit issues may affect other brands as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind","review":"This book pretty much has it all in the way of visual communication. From flags and signets to symbols such as the dollar bill & scull and xbones. The image of St. Benedict the Moor is quite telltale. The images of West Africans Baptising their child much like Batismals in the States (very interesting). The selection of royal and national flags will come as a surprise to many. The sign of the serpentine will crop up throughout the entire book. This book should be of special interest to all as they say \\"drummers and traveling men\\". This book gives you visual ques from the mundane to esoteric. A fine piece of workmanship. At an affordable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great singing and band , but similar styles can get boring","review":"I'll take a chance here and say that most listeners will come to this album after getting a taste for Sam's style and maybe hearing most or all of his big hits .This is not an album for dancing , as the songs aren't romantic in the least .This album does set and maintain a mood - we had it playing in the car the other night and it was perfect for that time .However , there is not a lot of diversity in the songs and that was one of the great things about Sam .The last song is a departure and almost feels out of place - nothing leads up to it gently .The sound is wonderful but I recommend you listen to it at a record shop first to see if you like the whole thing ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five-Star Soul","review":"This is the definitive Sam Cooke album, which is unfortunate considering that it was released just prior to his untimely demise. It is a late-night R&B set of well-known standards with a couple of originals penned by the late great soul singer himself. Every track on this album is pure ear candy, made even more so with gorgeous remastered sound. Not only does Cooke's voice ring loud and clear through a good set of speakers, but the little instrumental nuances of the session musicians are also enhanced for greater effect, a good example being the \\"barks\\" and \\"howls\\" from Billy Preston's organ on \\"Little Red Rooster\\".It's a real blessing to see this classic soul album reissued for the new millennium so that generations of music lovers both young and old can sample it for themselves and admire the exploits of a highly gifted, yet tragically short-lived talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it in SACD","review":"Sound better than the CD version, this guy is a terrific singer, has the emotiuon and soul like Marvin Gaye. But only 37 minutes is a bit short on material especially in teh $30 SACD version CD lots cheaper but DSD/SACD is the best format around. Maybe Amazon will get teh SACD version so you ain't gotta spend $30 from the otehr online Acoustic .... place.

There's good interaction between Agent Roy Parmenter and high schooler Jeff Grant whose parents are \\"sleepers\\". Great suspense as Roy and Jeff and parents play a cat and mouse game with the Soviet assassin. This is one of the last \\"true era\\" cold war movies to be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold War Classic","review":"This was indeed one of the last cold-war films that I can recall. The premise, that Soviet sleepers of many years could be called up for espionage, is played out with Mr. Poitier as the FBI agent working to foil the Soviets. I have only seen River Phoenix in this movie, yet he is masterful; it's such a shame his personal life was so tragic. I hadn't seen this movie in more than 10 years when I purchased the DVD. I found myself transfixed as I had in the movie theater originally. The two actors playing the sleepers were terrific, though I can never remember their names. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real turkey","review":"Fortunately, I borrowed this DVD from my local library. I like Sidney Poitier and saw River Phoenix in \\"The Mosquito Coast\\" years ago, so I thought the teaming of the two actors would be wonderful. I like stories of espionage and intrigue as well. This film, however, was a huge disappointment. I wasn't for one moment convinced that Jeff's parents were Russian spies, that Sidney Poitier was an FBI agent or that the older Russian guy was a real threat. In addition, River Phoenix's character isn't very likable and it's so obvious that River Phoenix is acting. The plot is choppy and there are very few suspenseful scenes or thrills (I don't consider a car chase scene a thrill). Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting","review":"this compilation of Nick Totton is a great job for enhance the work of body-oriented therapist and similar areas. this book integrate diverse views, all and each valuables"},{"rating":"2","title":"Approachable","review":"This Naxos release of two fine compositions by English composer Arthur Bliss (1891-1975) is a real delight; I would recommend it highly to anyone who has even the least hint of affinity for chamber music. Both pieces are quite approachable, with plenty of pleasures for the ear, so you need not be daunted by the dates of composition. If you enjoy the music of Vaughan Williams, for example, you should find these pieces quite to your liking.

Sean Bean was great- I loved his curse words...very original... Paul Bettany did a great job as the douche bag prince of orange...and the two gay guys did a great job portraying two gay lover/soldiers/tag team...It was really cute how they died holding eachothers hand.

It is a shame, because the songs are beautiful and the album is impeccably produced. This is just an example of marketing a pretty face to a public ( a la Britney Spears and countless latino actor-singers, etc.) which is, in general, easily impressed by a person's looks and is immensely ignorant about what good music really is.

None of the characters in the film have any depth or purpose. Some die--who cares? None of the actors can read a line. The thin plot could have been forgiven if the pace were reasonable, but it drags on like an earthworm crossing a sidewalk. Editing was terrible.

If your expecting to see frontal or rear nudity, forget it! The nearest thing is teenage guys running around in tight calvin Klein undies. However, if your someone who likes to use your imagination, this might be for you. One good thing about this flick is a pre Charmed hottie Drew Fuller rubbing himself all over in his undies.

Frankly, I find doing my grocery list more exciting. Surprisingly enough, the production quality is halfway decent, though.Those of us, who like high-concept horror, will hate this one. There's barely an attempt at plausibility, and the level of horror tends to bend more towards cute than scary. Those of you who like homoerotic, this is about as erotic as a PBS film.

His parents' marriage is falling apart, he hasn't had much luck with girls and he finds himself falling for his best friend, Gretchen, who iis very fond of beating people up. Brian struggles to fit in, struggles to make friends, struggles with his feelings for Gretchen and about himself, and finally realizes who he is and what makes him happy.

That is, if your high school experience was being the person that didn't fit in, and wanted nothing more than to do just that. There are parts in this book that are almost hard to read it's so much a slice of teen expereince.

Hairstyles of the Damned filled me the bittersweet nostalgia, but also made me glad that I've moved beyond those drifting teenage years. As written by other reviewers, the story is typical teen angst, but the realistic voice and the central motif of music reflecting and creating identity helps this novel stand apart from many of the rest in the same genre.I'd recommend this one to fellow readers in their late 20's/ early 30's who'd like a light and occasionally touching and funny trip back to high school. After reading it, I passed the book along to a 10th grade student of mine who has recently become interested in 80's punk.

There are about 70 short 'segments' ranging from 1 to 5 pages, each dealing with a particular location/personality, which makes for easy reading. Enough detail to keep it interesting interspersed with with good large scale insights about how the actions taken (or not taken) before the battle affected it.

Why this is worth reading: if you wish to know about the sixties and the counterculture in NY and LA and SF, and if you want a (mostly unreliable but entertaining) eyewitness, this will inform and intrigue. Someday, this will be made into a film-- if they can make a movie of Chuck Barris' \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,\\" they can film this hodgepodge of fiction and fact as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polemic to the People!","review":"A number of people have told me how much they enjoyed this book when it first came out; none of them had re-read it recently to give me an idea how well they thought it had stood up to time.It almost begs for a sound-byte: Hero/Antihero in the Summer of Love, bearing sorrow having fun...or something. Emmet Grogan was not a man for sound-bytes however, and his tale goes on and on. I liked the parts where there are glimpses of the streets and the people, what was going on. Unfortunately he can't stop there but provide an overlay of how he sees the true meaning of it, a truth that, oddly enough, revolves around the ego of Emmet Grogan. The further into his story, the more alone he seems to be, the fewer people who hang out with him, listen to him, be a friend.This could have been an evocative picture of the people and sensibilities of the times, but it's overwhelmed by the Digger loggorhea that Grogan fell in love with and felt compelled to wrap his history in."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American classic?","review":"Each time I read this book, I'm more amazed and amused by it. There is never a dull moment, and I still can't figure out when or whether it crosses the line from fantasy into reality. It has a voice as authentic and American as \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" and Woody Guthrie's autobiography, and it stands as tall as they do in American literature, no joke. One of my favorites of all time. It captures a place and time, and delivers an unforgettable character, as charming as he is unreliable. I hope it will be rediscovered and recognized someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Community action","review":"Ask a hippie in Boulder who Emmett Grogan is, and they will shrug their shoulders. Sad. It is sad so many leaders of the 60's have been so easily forgotten. I like the Diggers. I love their idea of community action. Instead of protesting Vietnam, they were busy stealing and cooking up free stew for the young masses of the Haight. I also like how the Diggers stuck it to the HIP community exposing them for the capitalist frauds they were. But with Grogan, there was no compromise. I think he only saw things one way... his. Also, for a guy who said he wanted to be behind the scenes, he writes very highly of himself. Ringolevio is highly entertaining. However, I thought Kenny Wisdom/Emmett was going to start walking on water with Jesus by the end.Bar Stools and Bus Stops"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music...weak vocals","review":"While the vocalist sounds a tad like Peter Gabriel, I'd say he sounds more like Cyrus, of Citizen Cain fame. Nowhere near the range and pitch-perfect intonation of Gabriel at work here. With stronger vocals on this CD, I'd give it five stars, and quite possibly classify it as a top-tier prog classic. The music is THAT good. Not a weak track on the entire CD, with tons of interesting, classic mini-moog and oberheim synth solos. Overall, a heavily keyboard-oriented CD that would make a great addition to any prog collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-original and dull","review":"For starters, any band with a name like that would not make it very far in non-German-speaking world. The music is good only on the strength of being a Genesis clone, albeit not a great one. They tend to get into repetitious melodies and progressions, and the arrangements are not very sharp either. Any comparison to Genesis are only superficial, as they lack the compositional depth and sophistication, and chops to pull it off. Sounds like some of the recent neo-prog bands, who imitate Genesis. Anyway, not a bad album, pleasant sounding, but not worth the trouble and expense to add to your prog collections, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper locally","review":"I love the chair, it's perfect for camping or lounging in the backyard.

I had a hard time following the story lines. I couldn't get to where the author needed me to be in order to find anything remotely humorous.

This book is indeed surreal. Saunders sets his stories (as far as I can tell) at some unspecified time in the future when the world is on the ropes and technology isn't helping human beings communicate. Saunders adds to this disconcerting effect by stringing together words and sentences that I found utterly confusing. For a lot of the time I did not understand what either he or his characters were trying to say. The words lifted off the page and then started fighting each other before they reached my eyes. Perhaps my mind was in neutral the day I tackled this collection.

As I understand the history of this album, Mike wanted out from his contract with Virgin records. Virgin would not release him until he had completed his contract (one more album). Mike really does not have a good singing voice, and usually he has left the singing to those (Maggie Reilly) who could. Not on this album though. He actually tries to sing his own work on this album. Mike's forte has always been the complex instrumentals, but the instrumental on this album sounds like a bunch of samples which he tried to tie together with a musical bridge. It even sounds like it was done in one take. It appears obvious to me that Mike had no real interest in this album, and the only reason I awarded it one star is that there is no provisions for negative numbers of stars. If you are new to Mike's music, avoid this album like the plague!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SERIES DETOUR TO VAMPIRE LAND","review":"Let me start by saying that so far I have loved the series.

This book however, was like hitting a pothole in the middle of a highway. Don't get me wrong if you like vampires it's a very enjoyable, readable book. However, if you ask me it has nothing to do with the series.

This book is about vampires--a subject that current society has become enamored with and which is totally over-done. Personally, I am sick of seeing and hearing about vampires and this book is totally about them. The author has personalized them so who could ever think they are evil?

If not, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Area 51: Nosferatu","review":"This manuscript involved too many iconoclastic ideas. Most people do not believe in \\"vampires\\" and the key to the invasion of the different humanoidraces lies in the the chambers that allow rejuvenation by imprint from a disk that is updated until a new clone must be used. (A possible idea).The off the wall idea is that some of the aliens have a factor in their blood that allows them to extend their life by infecting a non-alien, and utilizing that bloodperiodically to extend their lives.This makes the whole manuscript have a bad image after a few chapters.I think Mr.Mayer needed to publish or perish and this was the result.

The only miss is Fermium, which starts interesting but never really goes anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Culmination","review":"This album is the apex of Autechre's journey through uncharted musical territory. There isn't a single song on this album that doesn't evolve beyond everything you thought you knew about Autechre, and it finishes with an ending that trails off leaving the listener wondering whether the trip is finished or just beginning. Blending elements of every previous album from 'Incunabula' to 'Confield', 'Untilted' is all about the contradictions of those previous albums and finding the delicate balance inbetween -- fast/slow, intense/relaxed, cold/warm, alien/earthy. For this reason, fans of certain albums who were turned off by others will find that this album ties it all together, giving hindsight into what was previously seemingly abstract and nonsensical. This album is the key to understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonic Fractals","review":"\\"Draft 7.30\\" proved Autechre could still lay down their high-frequency calculus while making it at least somewhat musical. This is just a regression back to cerebral noise. The reviewer who suggested people ignore this if they want \\"old IDM\\" is perfectly right. Call it what it is but don't call \\"Untitled\\" IDM. The old Autehre was musical. What the new Autechre has been doing for the past five years is more akin to slapping a high tension wire with a conceptual physics textbook. People who enjoy their recent material rarely speak of it in emotional or even sentimental terms. More power to them if that's not what they enjoy.

The music is relentless and if you search for rhythm or harmony, you will be sorely disapointed. However, maybe that's why people enjoy this album. Because it is being listened to with the presumption it is \\"music\\" the mind is constantly working during listening to it to try and find \\"music\\" within. Which doesn't happen.

Animal has always written in order that the reader does not get his butt kicked. The first couple of chapters are nothing more than a condensed version of his other books. But the later chapters are what makes this book work.Animal does a great job in giving you tips in leaving a scene in a hurry, especially if you are running away from a gang. Some require prior actions, liking feeding neighborhood dogs, but most do not. He also discusses how you can counterattack your pursuers.Lastly, Animal talks about how to stay away from those seeking you out. First he tells you how to hide away from the police and organized crime. Then he tells you how to avoid the local yokals.All in all, a fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars actually","review":"This book is very long-winded and tedious.

I gave it four stars because, some of the originals (of course) are better. I feel that to truely appreciate \\"the other side\\" of Godsmack, you should definately listen to the other three albums too. Completely worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Side...Possibly the Best CD Ever?","review":"This is an excellent CD and I would definately suggest it to anyone. I got it yesterday and have memorized every single song on there, I listened to it so much. True, there are only seven tracks to memorize, but thats not the point. The lyrics are deep, soulful, and definately describe my life. As an experienced guitarist I can say this CD has excellent acoustic guitar work, and some great guitar solos. I especially like the rough vocals paired with the very poetic lyrics. Buy it NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sully is Amazing","review":"This CD is a very good break from Godsmack's typical hardcore sound. The acoustic guitars and soft drum playing throughout the album are mesmerizing. This CD is actually very touching and you can feel their every emotion while listening to it. I owuld recommend this CD to any fan of Godsmack or anyone that is in need of a CD to listen to and relax."},{"rating":"1","title":"AliceSmack","review":"First off I would like to say that some of Godsmack songs at one point in my life sounded ok, but being that the lead singer tries so hard at sounding like my favorite singer and in my opinion one of the most brilliant human being of all time, Layne Staley R.I.P. it makes me sick. Sully could never come close to Layne, no one will ever and thats a given fact. Isn't Godsmack the track on Alice in Chain's album Dirt? Oh I'm sorry it was God Smack. Even if the band started as a AIC cover band it really makes me sick that they try to pose or atleast Sully after two albums. This album to me is almost an insult and smack at the late Alice In Chains. Actually every album of this band to me is. I'm sorry,but being a die hard Alice In Chains fan it just annoys me when I hear this band. I wonder how many more lyrics of Laynes is Sully gonna try to swindle. If you want a real great albumthan try anything from Alice In Chains, Madseason, or any other great band that emerged from the Seattle scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST! in every audio library!","review":"Another Kick@$$ acoustic heavymetal album. A must in every audio library! Sound quality is superb! They must do an Mtv unplugged version! Another level for this awesome band... well done"},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer rewrites and awsome new stuff","review":"First off, T. JASSO left a total unworthy review. Just because a band jams their songs acoustic does not make them any less heavy. I bet most of your favorite heavy songs were first played on an acoustic guitar. Honestly, this does show a little bit different side of the band and sounds similar to Alice in Chains acoustic work. The cd shows that Godsmack can actually play more than just heavily sustained guitar riffs. I often find myself listening for inspiration to play and fits in good with any type of mood you would be in. A great buy if you ask me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The otherside is good to!!","review":"Great album, im glad to see more acoustic versions of songs are coming out. I think every heavy metal, hard rock band should come out with a acoustic version of there greatest songs.

It's content can and should be appreciated by all rock fans alike. Yeah there's only 7 songs on it, but all of which are great quality. Not like they are charging full price like everyone else. Personal favorites are Voices and Running Blind. I'm not one to listen to a CD over and over, but The Other Side changed that for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is awsome.","review":"Godsmack has had three sick cd's in the past, but this is the most instumental of all. the harmonies they laid down on the cd are picture perfect.

However, those inevitable comparisons shouldn't lessen the strength of the well done songs contained here in, the coolest of which may be a campfire version of \\"Awake\\" entitled \\"Asleep.\\" Godsmack may not be subtle, but they know a good song when they hear one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Let me start this by saying I am not a huge Godsmack fan. I bought this album just because it was different from what they normally play and it's different from a lot of the other SACD's out there.With that said, wow. I was very pleasently surprised. Great album. The acoustic guitar sounds great, bass is there but not over powering. Not much I can say bad about it. If you are interested in Gadsmack and can find it for a decent price; buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is with all the hostility guys, chill out","review":"This is a good EP, I'm not a big Godsmack fan, all I know is what I heard on the radio, my friend let me bum this and I fell in love with it, I really love the singer's voice, the guitars are great and the allman brothers type precussions really work, especially in \\"Re-allign\\" and \\"Keep Away\\". One thing I want to point out about that review in which the guy said that this is a Chains unplugged rip-off, um I hate to tell you this but them both being hard rock bands, during acoustic sets they sound alike and there is another difference, the Godsmack singer can actually sing and wasn't hooked on smack and on the verge of dying like Layne Stanley was, OK?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"I was introduced to Godsmack during their recent tour with Metallica. I liked them in concert and bought this album randomly. I really like most of the songs, although some do sound alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jar of Flies (revisited)","review":"Took me back in time, errhhh.... 10 years?!?! Sounds just like Alice in Chains (unplugged + choirs + melodies) and felt really good to listen to this album. Not a must have for music lovers but indeed a must have for Godsmack fans. If you enjoyed \\"Dirt\\" and \\"Jar of Flies\\" don't hesitate, buy this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mindless review","review":"My review is a pointless review. Just like some of the others. I am a lamb in the masses of an ignorant flock. I haven't listened to much of this cd, however, since people are saying that Godsmack mimics Alice In Chains, I as well will join in and agree. As we all know, Sully sounds DEAD ON like Layne Staley, and their songs all sound like a rip off of the stuff on dirt. Their style and playability that earns them the priviledge to be on great movie sound tracks like the Scorpion King means nothing to me. It means nothing to me because I'm ignorant and I don't know what good music is. I agree with what you have said because like you, I am mindless."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 Stars If I Could","review":"All I can say is this is just a disgrace to all Godsmack fans around the world. How can they give us this slow acoustic crap when were use to their heavy guitar riffed songs? This album just isn't them at all. Godsmack will always be known for their heavy crazy headbanging rock/metal. If your a true Godsmack fan, you WON'T buy this!

Godsmack have founded their career upon ripping off Alice In Chains and The Black Album. In fact sometimes I wonder if their goal in life is to become a Alice In Chains-Metallica cover band. If so, they've come one step closer because they just half way successfully ripped off Jar Of Flies. I know what you're thinking, those mother f*ckers who can't even play a power chord right made a decent acoustic album?! Yes, even I, a proud hater of Godsmack and nu-metal in general have to admit that. Do I recommend running out and buying it? No, I'm just giving a heads up that you may not want to turn the dial the next time a Godsmack song comes on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXACT copy of previous book","review":"This book is an EXACT copy of Mann's previous book, The Labyrinth of the Grail.

One way to test the practicality of research is to look for applications of it, outside the field.Which is this book's subject. Protons and muons can be used as probes into various macroscopic materials. This is distinguished from physics research where those particles are used as probes at the microscopic level, of unstable particles. Here, you can see descriptions of Rutherford Back Scattering. Techniques from the dawn of modern physics. Now very useful as probes of materials. Likewise, muons can also be used as probes.Aside from probes, they can also be used actively in processing steps. For example, to anneal a heterostructure at a precise depth, where you can adjust this depth by varying the kinetic energy of the incident protons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"When I bought these boots I was very excited to receive them and wear them out...BUT I was so disappointed.

It gives the basics such as type of cook ware that are needed & a few simple techniques that an average Joe can do at home.

If you are a worshiper of heavy,few match this great release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best......song ever?!!","review":"On their last album before going major, the Melvins created, arguably, their best....song ever. Originally titled \\"Lysol\\", its one track is actually six songs fused together as one lumbering beast. They are: Hung Bunny, Roman Dog Bird, Sacrifice (Flipper), Second Coming (Alice Cooper), The Ballad of Dwight Fry (Alice Cooper) and With Teeth. Though the majority of the material on the album is not theirs, the Melvins sucessfully make it their own with crushing precision. Like a huge, lead wrecking ball being lowered upon you from above, you start to feel the weight of these songs about midway into it and by the end you are choking and gasping for air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"This book is a general discussion of life's hardships in a heavily scriptual context. It has very little to do with the problems encountered by singles in day to day life. The author apparently considers herself an expert on being single due to a recent break-up with a fiance in her mid twenties. Unfortunately, her experience is not particularly relevant to people who have been single for many years or are single in their 30's or 40's, which is significantly different from being a single 20-something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Recipe Organizer","review":"This is a competent recipe organizer.

We originally watched each episode on BBC America and would recommend the entire series so much so that we bought the dvd's and have watched each episode over and will do so again. There are some truly memorable individuals, but the one that stands out for me is the grizzly old sargeant that is played to perfection in the early episodes by Pete Postlethwaite.

I was sorely disappointed. The sites are phenomenal, but the shows are mostly about someone trying to pull off a dangerous stunt. The stunts aren't to learn anything new about the sites, or to do research. Very little history or science is conveyed.I personally think that each episode could be better done in about 10 minutes.

Although \\"The London Years\\" contains some top-notch B-sides, it deletes a few of the tracks a hard-core Stones fan would miss. Unfortunately, in order to obtain these hard to find songs, one must collect all of the Stones album; a challenging feet at best.

She just loves it and wears it every day. I ordered this for my younger daughter and it came today...it is NOT the same necklace. It's not even the same one pictured. The sides of the pendant are not filigree- it's solid and not very pretty. The chain isn't the same as pictured in the item description, either. Also, it did not come with the velvet pouch.I'm very upset that the descriptions (pendant, chain, pouch) are completely wrong. The quality also seems to be quite low compared to the first one I bought.I was looking forward to giving my youngest daughter this necklace for Valentine's Day. She wanted one just like her big sister, and I was hoping that it would be something she could keep forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"I found the piece to be small but she loved it.

This is, however, a quintessential Joe Preston record. You can see the shape of things to come: the drum machine excess, the creepy samples, and the slow, dynamic low end drone that he's been perfecting ever since. Listen to what he's done with Earth, SunnO))), and even the first part of the Lysol album and then listen to the third track. The other two songs are reminiscent of Sperm Whale era thrones. This is Joe Preston doing what he does best and I'd like to give it five stars but, as an ep, it doesn't have much going for it beyond the third track. The shorter songs are good and fit in with the rest of the melvins and even early thrones catalog but they are short and in a way seem to compliment the longer track rather than stand on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy music videos!","review":"This DVD was very disappointing. Not only is the title misleading (It isn't a group of hits. Nor does it include YO SOY AQUEL.), but the whole thing is just poorly shot, poorly staged music videos.

While it only has 6 videos, this one only has 10, and costs more. Or better yet, buy it used. What a disappointment!

Feuchtwanger accurately and sometimes painfully depicts the very feelings of people astonished at what was happening in their own country, and it's the novel's gripping reality that provides the reader with a fuller, more personal perspective not available in history books.This edition includes an introduction written by someone who knew Feuchtwanger and also a reprint of the first review of the novel by the New York Times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A psycological testimony of the begining of fachism","review":"This book gives you the authentic voice of an intellectual feeling the buds of oppression and fear anouncing themselves with the rise of the fachistic regims in Europe of the 30s.

I love the interaction between Tristan and Zoey as they battle their growing feelings for each other and try to get over past experiences in their lives that leave emotional scars of insecurity on them today. But what intrigues me the most is their tough outward appearances that keep them from getting too close to each other, and at the same time, keep the readers entertained by their sarcastic comments to each other.

Zoey and Tristan hate one another at first sight then become friends, then decide they like one another, but neither will admit it. And anyways, Tristan is doing the polished and sophicasted intern, Summer. How very Dawson's Creek. None of the characters are sympathetic, and I could care less what happens next. One character falls for a terminally ill patient with no explanation or romance. Summer may be cheating on Tristan. I was especially annoyed by girl-next-door type Zoey, who kept \\"psuedo swearing\\" (saying fluck instead of f**k, etc...).

The language was choppy and stilted. It was supposed to appeal to teenagers, but I am a teenager, and it just sounded fake. I don't think anyone actually talks like that unless they are in Beverly Hills or on TV. It was a soap opera in book form. Just the names of the characters would tell you that -- Zoey, Tristan, Summer... The plot was choppy and I didn't feel like the characters were developed enough to feel any connection with them. There also wasn't very much actual medical drama...the book focused more on the interaction between the SCRUBS and the mean doctors.

Her Hall of Man collection which is chronicled in this book, is now dismantled, damagaed and scattered around two separate museums. In a world of political correctness gone crazy, there is a paranoia that her work is racist because it dares to typify races of people.

The problem is that the characters are underdeveloped, the settings mundane, and the book itself never really picks up any momentum.

Characters had a lot of depth, and except for the one true villain, all, even the supposed bad guys, had some redeeming elements, making them seem all the more realistic. Although I'm not big into sci-fi, nor a disciple of Von Daniken, I was certainly enough of a Star Trek fan to enjoy venturing into the \\"what-if\\" territory posited by the story line. It was extremely easy to suspend disbelief and become fully immersed in the book, to the extent that it was really hard to put it down.I'm just waiting to hear of a sequel, a movie, or better yet, both. And I have to say -- I love my Kindle Fire, it takes me back to reading with a flashlight under the covers, only SO much more convenient.By all means buy or borrow this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great storytelling","review":"Complex story about favorite topics, pyramids and aliens. Easy to follow even across time lines. Satisfying. I want more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hidden Gem !!","review":"Well written. Kept my interest. It has a unique story line and was an enjoyable read. I was sad when it was finished because books this good are hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"A highly unlikely story, rather strange and implausible.","review":"This story is surely inspired by Daeniken, it is highly implausible and makes no sense. Apart from this the book is heavy (think paper) and bulky, not the sort of stuff to read on the beach on on long-haul flights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 'Ol SciFi","review":"This was a good old fashioned SciFi story, with a good plot and a definable start middle and end. It's not Dune, but it's readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sci-fi","review":"For adults who like fiction and mystery without unnecessary gratuitous sex and Gore. Arwen keeps you guessing; a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Can I Say That Hasn't Already Been Written?","review":"I was totally floored by this book and that is a rarity for me. I usually like books and enjoy books but I feel like this book completely caught me off guard. I picked it up as a Kindle Lending Library book and was almost immediately drawn into it. The author writes very complex and multifaceted characters. Almost ever character, including minor ones, seem to have depth. I loved the story and all the technology. Initially I thought the FTL drive had been ripped off from an episode of Stargate: Atlantis but then realized that this book was published in 2001, suggesting that the Stargate writers might have ripped the author off. I loved this book and am desperate for a sequel. I would love to see what else happens in this wonderful universe the author has created."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost interest","review":"I bought this book for $0.99 back in February. I think it was a Kindle daily deal. I read 41% of its 5800+ locations and finally just gave up.I came back to it several times. Once I start a book I hate to just give up on it, and this one has a bunch of 4 and 5 star reviews.But in the end, the book just did not interest me enough to finish it so it got 1 star.Given the number of 4 and 5 star reviews the book has, others found it more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow pace detracts from promising plot","review":"Well established characters but for so so long nothing much happens, scene setting galore with minimal action. And the book is self-spoiling--you already know the outcomes for lots of the characters, because the author tells you, then its just a long drawn out saga of how it happened. I tried and failed to get all the way to the end. A pity really, because the universe described is interesting, the characters show promise, plenty of potential for drama, but those nuggets of action are just too hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-fi at it's best!","review":"I'd read a brief review in a local paper and thought I'd give this book a try. I'd never heard of the author and didn't know what to expect. This book grabs hold of you and won't let you go! It is a fantastic blend of sci-fi, fantasy, romance, adventure and drama. It takes theories of people like Erich von Daniken and Zechariah Sitchin and weaves them into a truly believable story that spans vast oceans of space and time. The book is full of characters you love, and others you love to hate.Heroes, villains, aliens, Pharoahs and ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses all combine with very imaginative and completely believable science fiction into an amazing saga. I'm waiting to see this one made into a movie or a TV series. Pruit is a great heroine. Watch out Lara Croft, here comes Pruit Pax!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I like sci fi and read a lot of it. This book had a plausible story that was very well told. It is a real shame that the writer did not continue to write other books. She is talented and I would be happy to read anything that she wrote. In fact, I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased it even after reading it in the Kindle lending library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent... no filler","review":"Excellent book without any filler. Every page every paragraph was worth reading. I could not wait to read the next page. Good job. If only authors learned to deliver their stories this way, trilogies would become a thing of the past.Thank you for the great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I read fiction for entertainment. This book filled the bill. Loved the settings - if you are going to chase aliens on Earth, Cairo is the place to do it! Good to know that murder, greed and lust will be with us for ever otherwise fiction would get quite boring. My only problem was the ending, which I thought was a bit too good to be true. Didn't stop me looking for more by this author - I really enjoyed the storyline, and especially the \\"explanation\\" for the pyramids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected, spell binding story!","review":"I didn't quite know what to expect and don't read a lot of sci-fi but this looked interesting. After the first few pages, I was hooked and didn't want the book to end. It was awesome and I hope the author will grace us with a continuation of the excellent characters in their new quest. Thanks for a wonderfully linked story between the ancient past the distant future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book that draws you into the story","review":"I cannot say that this book has great literary merit, but it drew me in so I could hardly put it down. The author did a good job with her characters, so I cared about them. I enjoyed the ancient astronaut premise. I was reminded of Battlestar Gallactica, which I enjoyed immensely. This novel would make a good movie or mini-series. I can recommend this book, especially to people who like to make an occasional foray into science fiction like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sci if I read in a long time!","review":"Excellent read. Great story line. Recommend it to any Sci fi fan. This takes you on journey into mankind's unanswered questions through a fictional scenario. The characters are realistic and you are pulled by there conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book!!!","review":"This was a terrific book. It grabs you from the first page and keeps you interested to the end. Egypt, gods, aliens, what could be better and maybe reality instead of fiction!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New World","review":"I was fascinated The way the author started the story. It kept me wanting to continue to read late in to the night. It's a good thing That I am retiered. Iam hoping the author comes ou with another book or two with the same theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable reading.","review":"If you like a little Sci-fi once in a while this is worth your time. Starts off a little slow with the long travel to Earth but I loved the main idea and the special tricks in her suit. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light sci-fi story","review":"I just finished up this book on my Kindle(I grabbed it as a special of the day), and it was a nice light Sc-Fi read. It had a nice backstory and moves at a good pace. I think this book would make a good Cable Channel mini-series, as it would have to have some length to capture the feel of the book.The only real critque I have is that the Author's writing is not quite fully developed. There are passages where she could have really taken it to a higher level, but did not. Being that this is only her second book, I think she has a good potential to develop and become a good quality Sc-fi, so I won't hold it against her much.I think it would be interesting to write a prequel or a series of stories set in the world she has created. Or even prehaps a sequel, as I think it would be interesting to see where the story goes.Overall, a good read and a solid 4 stars out of 5. I am interested to see what this author has to offer next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all happy","review":"I ordered this item and when it arrived the glasses were broken because there was no packing at all between them."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Benson","review":"Love his music and would not rate this any lower rating.

It provides knowlegeable help in selecting the correct hardware, software and add ons for a student's technology package.The authors have a great feel for the questions and difficulties encountered by students and their parents as they begin the collegiate journey.Parents will be reassured as they read the comments and suggestions presented to the students - good sound technology advice. In fact, as a school administrator, I plan to share many of the helpful ideas with my faculty and students.This book will guide even inexperienced users on their way to success with technology in their college careers. I plan to give this book as a gift to several students embarking on their college journey in the fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive technology advice for ANYONE entering college","review":"As an advanced user considering majoring in Computer Science, having just graduated from a high school where laptops are required for all students, I was initially doubtful that I needed any technology advice. As I read this book, however, I did indeed find myself taking note of many useful suggestions that I simply hadn't thought of. Even if you've been using computers at school for as long as you can remember, the college environment presents its own new set of challenges and obstacles to overcome and avoid. What better way to prepare yourself than with a guide based on input from current college students who are just like you except that they've \\"been there, done that.\\" This book is so comprehensive that I would recommend it for absolutely anyone entering college: technophobes and technophiles, History majors and Computer Science majors alike.Best of luck at college!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As close to Paris Hilton as you can get!","review":"Unless you know her daily iterniery, this is as close to cheeky Paris Hilton as you can possibly get!Far from being a rich, spoilt brat, Paris has got natural talents as an entrepreneur. That I admire.She's a natural actress, very comfortable in front of a camera, very cool, calm, cheeky and captivating.I enjoyed this fun-filled movie from it's beginning.What I like about the themes of this particular movie:-> Paris' character of being a faithful friend to someone unfortunate.I wonder if Paris Hilton can stay in any long-term relationship in real-life?-> Paris' philosophy about the human soul vs body and how we look on the outside.-> The revealing \\"flashback\\" story-telling technique that is used to explainpresent relationships in relation to the past.If you want a good laugh and a little learning philosphy in how humans judge others,watch this movie. I also recommend the movie \\"Shallow Hal\\" which is just as good.Recommended viewing:Shallow Hal [Widescreen]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it and stop your whining.","review":"I loved this movie. Yes it is fluff but really, what movie isn't? Someone mentioned it's a reason to parade Paris Hilton around, I say, oh you mean like, Brad Pitt, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling etc? All the pretty boys? If there were death, destruction, blood and guts maybe it would have been more widely accepted. It was fun, that's it. Watch it and like it. You don't always need to be so serious to enjoy a movie. Sometimes it's just lighthearted, silly and pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG. I LOVE YA PARIS!!!","review":"Paris Hilton again amazes the audience with a truly masterful performance. she shows us why she has the determination and the talent to become one of Hollywood's finest actresses.next, i'd like to congratulate tom Putnam for showing us that he has the leadership and skill to rise among the ranks of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.i can't remember the last time i laughed throughout the entirety of a film. this movie gets two big thumbs up for originality, and the best acting in 2008 so far. move aside Indiana Jones, make way for one of the all time greats in the movie industry.cheers Paris"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actors, Writer, Director & Financiers Deserve A Place In Hell","review":"What a great way to get rid of an un-wanted house guest.

With that, it succeeds.But lacking a decent script, plot and acting, this is one bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't like Paris Hilton - don't see the movie. It's that simple.","review":"This movie was great.If you're looking for something with depth that will make you think, then don't see this. The Hottie and the Nottie is a bubbly, upbeat movie, and it doesn't try to be anything else. It's fun. It's funny. It's something you can watch with a bunch of friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"Out of all the movies that I've ever seen this past year, this is definitely one of the worst and most pathetic movies I've ever felt like I wanted to go away. Paris Hilton gives a very unconvincing performance as she tries to do whatever it takes to make her friend a better attractive woman to men. Sadly, for someone who really never learned her lessons and lied about giving back to others on Larry King Live, Paris Hilton showed no effort of changing her ways, and also showed she really doesn't have the drive to act. Not even die hard Paris Hilton fans would even come close to being interested in this movie.Story: FOverall: F-"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars may be cliche, but this album still deserves it!","review":"To start, if you're expecting the metal Bride's famous for, you won't get it here. Sure, this album is heavy...but not compared to their other work. Now, is this album worth buying? Absolutely. The songs here are very bluesy and more layed back, but they're spectacular in their own right. Get out of your time warp and learn to appreciate something other than metal. If there's one thing I've learned, it's not to have preconceptions of what a band's new album should sound like. If you buy this album expecting something, you'll be disappointed. But if you expect nothing and stay open to good music, you'll love it straight thru.

Which, with time and effort...anyone can find. But it IS worth just looking through...and it IS worth having just as reference, or when you want to say to someone \\"look, see what some of your money is paying for!\\". But that's about it.

Read 'Alien Rapture' by Brad Steiger and Edgar Fouche. Steiger has written and published over a hundred books and novels, many in this conspiracy/paranormal/UFO genre. Fouche worked Top Secret black programs for over 25 years and reveals way too much in Alien Rapture. Check out these other fine books on Amazon. I would pass on this one.

It worked great for 50 weeks then it started reporting a \\"lens error\\". Looking on the Internet verifies this is a typical problem with this camera. Casio wants $120 to repair it -- ha!

To add insult to injury something internal to the camera came loose recently and I had to send it in to Casio. No problem I thought, I have had it less than a year and that's the warranty period. Guess what, they want $150 to fix it! Ridiculous. You can get a better camera with higher MP for that price.

Well I guess I am picky too because the pictures are no where as clear and crisp as my old camera which is only a 5 MP camera. The pictures are blurry, plain and simple and maybe for most it's not enough to make a differance for me it is. I will say this though, I don't know how anyone couldn't tell the difference though, cause it's pretty obvious.

Their customer service representative was not helpful and wanted me to spend more money to get a new battery, because my battery lasted just past my year warranty. If they know that their product has this problem (as it is clearly written all over the web when you search \\"casio battery problems\\") they should fix it. However, they don't and won't! I would reccomend against buying this product especially if you want something that will be reliable when needed for taking photos. AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a Good Camera","review":"The only bad thing i could see in the camera is that if you take pictures in dark places Without the flash the pictures look low quality, so its better take most of the pictures with the flash except the ones you take outside in the day of course... also it has 3 types of flash so that shouldnt be a problem... for what is worth is a pretty good camera!Its a slim camera comfortable to carry, i also like the screen, cause is big. If you need a camera for a trip that recharges very quick this could be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good-not great","review":"OK so maybe I'm premature having just unpacked this camera today. I haven't printed any pictures yet but I did view them (and a video of my dog) on the TV. They look great. I shot at the highest resolution (7) because that is why I got the camera in the first place. My first real complaint with it is the very fuzzy LCD screen. I took out my Sony (H-1) and that LCD view is much clearer, colors more vivid, and crisper. Even my son said it was fuzzy. So I can't really trust what I see. In review however, the camera takes clear clean shots. It also packs a lot of nice features for an inexpensive point and shoot. Will report back after playing around for a few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The optics on this camera leave a lot to be desired. Images are not crisp, rather they tend to look soft and a bit out of focus. With 7 megapixels you would expect very good detail but I got better, clearer pictures from my old Canon 4 megapixel camera. This camera is ok if you don't care too much about the details, but if you're taking pictures that you really care about, go with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use camera with excellent photo quality","review":"I love this camera!!!! It is compact enough to fit in my pocket, yet easy to use and produces excellent photo quality. The battery lasts for about two days, which is an improvement from my last camera, which I had to change batteries during an event. The best shot function is really easy to use and the picture settings are easy to figure out and use.I use this camera often for special events and it is very useful.I would recommend that anyone considering this camera or the powershot camera to consider the exilim because the powershot focus and shoot functions in the powershot are in the same button and it can be confusing trying to take a picture and you have to press the shutter hard to take the picture, otherwise you will only focus the camera (I know this because I have taken a picture with my brother-in-law's powershot and it was confusing at first for me); with the exilim, you do not have that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for it's size","review":"I got this camera to take to Europe on vacation. It took great pictures for the most part (just a couple blurry one's when the light was low). The only thing I wish it had come with was a case - I got a scratch on the lovely blue exterior the first day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio Exilim EX-Z75 7.2MP - Great","review":"I was looking for a small, nice design, practical and economic camera and this product just give me what I need.

She had a lot of fun taking multiple pictures at one click and see how somebody's expression changes as the camera takes 3 or 5 pcitures automatically and consecutively.She had a silver one from Xmas but lost and bought a purple one again. nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Photo Quality","review":"I bought this camera several years ago, and have yet to take a fantastic photo. At one time, this was my primary camera, but now only use this as a back-up. I cannot get decent images in anything but full light. Even then, images are still grainy. In every other way, it is great. Easy to use, good battery life, lots of features, portable, etc. But isn't the point of a camera to take good pictures?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for a camera that's behin the times","review":"This camera was a present given to my husband a couple of years ago. I have had several digital cameras. This one doesn't rate high in my opinion. I prefer to select my own photographic equipment. Your lighting situation has to be near perfect to get a decent image. The camera is not easy to use even with the manual. When this camera was left behind in our vacation home, my research showed that a Panasonic Lumix TS1 was the best replacement. That camera is waterproof to 10 feet, shock proof, and takes great videos. I intend to upgrade to the TS2 soon while they're still in stock. Why anyone would buy this Casio over a Canon Powershot is surprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This camera is fantastic. Very fast shutter speed. Clear pictures. It is very small and easy to drop, but that is why there is a wristlet attached. People do need to consider that all electronics are only made to last 6-8 months. Everything in today's society is disposable, so if you get 8 months out of a camera, that is great. I would recommend this camera to anyone who needs something small that takes immediate pictures with no delay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks too easily!!!","review":"This camera takes good pictures but it has some bad drawbacks!!! The battery is horrible to begin with and the camera is very sensitive. I accidentally put the camera on the table on its front side and it opened and the lense broke. I had to send it to casio they are the only ones that will fix the camera. It cost just as much to fix the thing as it is to buy a new one! I got an upgrade and the same thing happened to camera number two! DO NOT buy this camera unless you want to spend lots of money on postage and repairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed.","review":"I bought this camera little over a year ago. It looked like a good camera, receiving excellent reviews.I just wanted a point and shoot camera to document my everyday activities and it was decent. Most pictures would come out blurry despite fiddling with the settings. I have a shaky hand, so I blamed myself. So much for the stabilizer helping me out.I also planned to use it for outdoor concert photos. So much for that. Any movement what-so-ever would result in poor quality pictures.And the video microphone picks up so much random static when used it became pointless for me to bother trying.The kicker that set me off about this camera was that the battery ended up dying after 6 months of sporadic use.I gave this camera a chance, but I'm definitely not going to be purchasing another casio any time in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Camera but horrible battery","review":"I bought this Camera in July of 2007 for my wife. She has used it to take maybe 20-30 pictures. After 3-4 months the battery died, so I contacted Casio. They sent a brand new battery which also died in 2-3 months. Casio has offered to send another battery. They say that that the battery will dies if you let it discharge all the way. The last battery lasted maybe 1 charge. Stay away from this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this trash","review":"This camera is a beautiful trash!I bought it 6 month ago for my wife because it looks cute.However, its battery died after 1 month. We called casio and they sent us a new one. But this new one died again yesterday.We are so disappointed with the BS battery. Without a reliable battery, this camera is just a beautiful trash.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable","review":"This camera has a 6 month warranty. That should have been a warning to me. After 8 months the lens motor quit working and I got an estimate from Casio saying it would be $134.95 to fix it. Needless to say, I will never buy another Casio product as long as I live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"This camera was in such bad shape. There where old photos on it and it was surpose to be in good condition and it was in very poor conditions.

Not a pretty sight.","review":"Wow, I'm not sure what's with all the glowing reviews. I bought this EX-Z75 because my Canon camera is a few years old and I wanted something with higher resolution. So I got this Casio one and wow, the colors are bad. Everything looks so flat and washed out and dead. My old Canon is so much more vibrant. The shirt I was wearing in the pictures on the Casio didn't look like the color it does with the naked eyed, it looked faded in the pictures. I tried messing around with the settings of brightness and saturation and the modes but... it didn't seem to fix the problem. Anyway, a good camera should take good pictures right out the box. Sure, this has a big LCD and the camera is slim but if it can't take decent pictures, I have no use for it. I am not happy with this Casio and it's being returned tomorrow. Buh-bye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only that - it's PINK","review":"What a great camera - bought for my eldest daughter's birthday, and can't say enough. Takes perfect pictures, with exact color, even under compact fluorescent lights. Battery seems to last forever on a single charge, anti-shake function is flawless, more modes and options to list. Even then, the \\"easy\\" mode is really that - easy, intuitive, and takes great shots. So impressed, I bought two more, one for myself, and one for Mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery","review":"I have had two batteries die on me.

He wears it daily and thus far it has been great. The carabiner has a strong gate and is a strong enough metal to hold up to anything he can do. I also like that it is a single piece with no small pieces that can wear out or break as other watches have done for him. The watch seems to hold time beautifully and the large numbers and face are helpful to ageing eyes. The LED light come in handy as well and gives off a nice bright light. I would definately recommend this watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot get this to work","review":"I bought this two Chrstmases ago and cannot for the life of me figure out how to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"belt loop watch","review":"I bought two of these watches over the past six months and I had problems with both. The first one the clock was intermittent. I bought a second one. This one the light came on and would not turn off. I opened the back and had to disconnect the wire to the light, when I started putting it back together the back would not seat. Upon trying to reseat the back I broke the crystal. I then took the mechanism out of the second watch and put it in the first watch casing. The light is still intermittent. I would NOT purchase another one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic new argument on Human Sacrifice","review":"I first read this book years ago in college and loved it. I would say I read this book at least once a year. His theories regarding human sacrifice, scapegoating, and our evolving interpretation of death are incredibly interesting and have helped me narrow down the topic I intend to study for my anthropological post-graduate program. This is well-written, well-researched, and is an excellent introduction to the subject for the general reader. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"This is such fun to listen to! My 6 year old daughter loves to sing along to the songs she knows.

He never could get the crappy thing to work. What a waste and embarrassing gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating book","review":"This is NOT about the second coming of Christ, as the previous reviewer posted, but about the first coming of the Jewish Messiah told from a Jewish perspective, in a Science Fictional setting. In the novel, Resnick (who is Jewish) essentially explains why Jews do not believe that Jesus was the Messiah, and tells a sordid tale about a messiah who is an utter scoundrel, yet fits biblical prophecy much better than the messiah of the New Testament. It is very entertaining, and well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable that this was published","review":"If this book had been sold as fiction it would have been rejected because of the corny dialogue the entire thing is written in. Apparently the author has never read a true crime book. Most are written as narratives. I don't see anywhere a note from the author that dialogue has been reconstructed or imagined, which it had to have been. Don't waste money on this one, or time; it's not even worth reading as a library book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Make it Through the Book....","review":"Wow. What can I say but that reading all of the dialog between the two main detectives wore me OUT. I tried really hard like it, but abandoned it less than half-way through, because there was more mundane dialog than there was action or story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Colossal Waste of Time","review":"I'm a true crime fan, so when I saw this book at the Dollar Tree, I figured I would give it a shot. Now I know why it was in there.The problem with the story is the case isn't that compelling or interesting. It reads like it could've been done in narrative form in about 50 pages. Unfortunately, it's lengthened out by terrible dialogue. Within the first couple of chapters, the author goes on to mention the detectives working the case had a long history together, but their conversations read like two amateur sleuths making conversation by repeatedly stating the obvious mixed with groaning witticisms from the 70's.I actually feel a little bad for the author, who probably spent too long researching the story to abandon it, and had to produce something. Too bad this was the something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinnacle Must Have Been Desperate for a Release When They Published This Book","review":"Has author Samuel Roen ever listened to anyone converse? Apparently not, because his dialogue as related in Evidence of Murder was horrible; who talks like the individuals in this book? No one that I know, and especially not detectives.But...if you can get through the cheesy dialogue, there is an interesting story here. Roen relates the story of Carla Larson who fell pray to a random act of violence leading to her death by John Huggins, a career thief and wife beater turned murderer. Most interesting is that her husband, Jim Larson, lost his sister to serial killer Danny Rollings just a short time before his wife's demise. Who thinks that random killing can strike one family twice?!Evidence of Murder by Samuel Roen is difficult to read. The story of Carla Larson would have been best suited written by someone with experience in the true crime genre. I DO NOT recommend this book, even for rainy day reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the actual movie's soundtrack...","review":"When I first saw the movie I was psyched to get the soundtrack; I mean, so many great songs... Magic Carpet Ride, Time for All Seasons, Let's Get It On... Unfortunately none of them turned out to be on this CD. There are a few good songs, but it's really not the same feel as you get from the music when actually watching the film. It seems that Vol 2 of this CD would be pretty good from the track listings, but I don't actually have a copy. My advice: if you are going to buy one CD this year: make it vol 2. But if you are going to buy two, vol 1 is decent too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kravitz rocks....","review":"Lenny Kravitz has definitely come up with a winner...his remake of American Woman is an outrageous interpretation of the original by the Guess Who...The funky drum track, the wah-wah guitar and the fuzz vocals are what hit me...The recent debut of the video really put the audio in perspective...it should be nominated for video of the year, the ladies are perfect...Of all the ripoffs and samples of the originals by rap, it is refreshing to finally see someone do justice to the original song...Man I am back in the 70's again...Thanks Lenny"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Dr Evil would say \\"Quite pleasent really\\"","review":"I thought that it was very shagadelic.

Folks who loved the International Man of Mystery CD will especially be dissapointed. Would it really have killed them to do the real songs instead of half-baked remakes by REM, Lenny Kravitz and others?

No other band, and no other song, could compliment this album and film better.This is simply because,The Who,and \\"My Generation\\", are a truly historic representation of Londons swinging 60's mod scene.

Although the book is nearly exclusively based on archaelogical findings, Robert McGhee succeeds in assembling this data into a very fascinating account of this people lost in time. Fortunately, as the author explains, despite the long period elapsed since the disappearance of the paleo-Eskimos, due to the special arctic environment and climate relatively much has been preserved. The author guides through the history more or less chronologically, explaining the cultural and technological development of these first settlers in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland. He speculates on reasons for major changes in hunting techniques and religious practices and the final disappearance of this people vis-a-vis the push toward East by the Innuit.A well written book on a fascinating subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sprung!","review":"What I love most about this book is the perfect marriage between the photography and the printing .

There's a song called \\"I'm Mad Again\\" on a few of the other Animals compilations, but the original \\"I'm Mad\\" is nowhere to be found. I hate the way some of the compilations of the Animals' music mix the original band's recordings with recordings by \\"Eric Burdon and the Animals,\\" the group Eric Burdon formed after the original group split up.

In the wake of the Cold War, arguably the most obsessively secrecy-oriented period of Western His-tory, when we faced daily the threat of nuclear annihilation by powers using those secrets to maintain their power, we have the opportunity to re-vision our society to allow ALL its members to truly participate in its visioning and re-formation. But if we continue to perpetrate the myth that some secrets must be kept - regardless of the degree of scholarship we use to make the argument - we will only be successful in maintaining a status quo where the select few continue to hold 95 percent of the power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shattuck should make up his mind","review":"This book has been summarized already by previous reviewers, so I won't rehash that. I agree with the reader from Austin that this book was very disappointing. To me, it seemed as if Shattuck couldn't decide whether the book should be literary criticism or historical overview or a chance for him to air out his morals. He tried to do all three at once, resulting in a bit of a mess. He kept switching back and forth between objective history lesson and subjective moralizing to the point where the points he professed to be trying to make became somewhat lost and pointless. The objective bits were dry and boring and the moralizing was condescending and annoying and insulting to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorable Scholarship","review":"This work by Roger Shattuck is the worst piece of scholarship that I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The lack of intellectual integrity is astounding, especially for someone so high up in the academic world. His arguments are poorly reasoned and replete with terrible, mis-represented anecdotes which serve more to disprove his hypothesis than to sustain it. This book will appeal to those who secretly wish to resort back to the good ol' days when life was simple and God was still an unassailable reality, but for those of a higher intellectual nature, this book is a travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mind provoking book","review":"This book is of the rarest kind of books; it is as enjoyable as a coffe-table book and in the same time it runs so deep and academic without being pedantic. The scope is dazzling and the language is up to its subject and beutiful. Trying to restrict art and science within some kind of ethical borders is the nearest thing to sacrilige in our times, but the power of this book's argument (and maybe, his weak point that prevented me from giving him a 10 ) that he tries very hard to prove his point from within his subject's system of references instead of imposing an outsider's. I liked this book and I keep returning to it for the sheer joy of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thinly veiled polemic...Shattuck weighs in on the 'culture war'","review":"This book is, frankly, pathetic. Shattuck puts his incredible erudition to work in the service of his conservative Christian convinctions, to write a book that fundamentally condemns intellectual curiosity and advocates institutional obedience. This, from the man who wrote THE BANQUET YEARS, one of the best intellectual histories of fin-de-siecle Paris. In his old age, Shattuck apparently feels compelled to take a stand on the subject of society's increasing liberality, which leaves him feeling threatened. I knew Shattuck personally. I was one of his students in Boston. Professor Shattuck, this book is contrary to the spirit of UNI."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dull book with clever marketing","review":"If you are thinking about buying this book, please understand that this is a long philosophical inquiry into whether we should seek limits to what we know or learn. It is not a catalog of information that was surpressed. It is very learned and mostly uses literary examples to explore this dilemma. It does not examine any of the information on what we currently believe to be limitations on what is knowable (i.e. quantum theory, uncertainty and incompleteness), nor does it go into a broad range of subjects on what information is dangerous to have.It reads like a very well written piece of literary criticism, and I suspect that most people who buy this book will not finish it, nor enjoy it. I was mislead by the title in a book club publication and wish I hadn't purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb collection, deservedly well-known!","review":"Note that this collection was compiled primarily with learners of Old or Middle Irish in mind.

And only about half is \\"meat\\"--the rest is nauseating, narcissistic self-praise with a smattering of \\"defense 101\\" level information. Dr. Barnett takes credit for inventing many ideas that other strategic thinkers developed first and with much more rigor. In general, the book is like a pop song--its \\"hooks\\" stick in the mind but it's no symphony built on development, depth, and nuance. As a result, the important arguments in it aren't made convincingly, but are simply asserted or suggested."},{"rating":"1","title":"needles for thought in a wind-bag haystack","review":"The good thing about this book is that the author has some exciting and insightful ideas about the future of the world (nothing trivial here!) and what America needs to do to cope, especially the Pentagon. There are some fascinating data on world economics and demographics as well as entertaining insights on the world of government operations and bureaucracy.Unfortunately, these nuggets are almost buried in a turgid writing style, relentless self-promotion and bragging, and almost limitless mountains of jargon. Fundamentally, I decided this book is really about the author and how right he is about things; this almost swamps the enjoyable parts of the book, which have to be looked for and dug out of the verbiage. Overall: save your money and read the lengthy reviews here on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"New model for World War IV","review":"Barnett, a military expert and deep thinker has presented to many top level government organizations. This book while a bit repetitious is worth the small extra effort. The military should not concetrate on great wars (like WW 1 or WW 2) with, or example China. A changed mind set is needed to prepare us for many small conflicts in which the USA is the only power who can project power globally to \\"police the World\\". The chronic problem will be areas of the World that have not become globalized. This war will be long and protracted and we need to change the mind set of the military for this role. For me it was an eye opener, almost as mind opening as Friedman\`s book \\"America\`s Secret War\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Non Expert's Review","review":"I am a lowley civilian. Many of the reviews here seem to come learned insiders. Experts in the field need read no furhter. I found the book excellent and thought provoking. The thought process that goes into the Pentagon's budgeting process, and how it is/was tied to the Pentagon's view of the world and potential enemies was of interest. One can argue that 2 or 3 or 11 different kinds of forces are needed to do the job of winning early 21st century battles, war and then the peace, but the author was the first to get me, an average guy, to focus on the very different needs of our military today vs. 10 years ago in a comprehensive, well reasoned manner. I recommend this book to those that wish to get a peak behind the curtain at the Pentagon and the Naval War College and plans for military action in the 21 st century"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great except for the dose of ego","review":"I concur with the above reviews on depth of content. The author attempts to mimic Thomas Friedman's metaphorical style but falls short here. The book could have been about 80 pages shorter if Barnett did not have to ramble on about how great a briefer he was, and that he was the master of all things powerpoint.

He spends the first 30 pages discussing how innovative and brilliant he is. I was disappointed to find out that this is what passes for intellectual argument these days. There is little here that wasn't in the international development literature from the late 1970's and early 1980's. It just seemed new because the previous works were forgotten. He lost his remaining brownie points when he mentioned natural gas (CH4) as a carbon free energy source. I didn't even take organic chemistry and knew that was wrong. Solar, wind, nuclear--carbon free. Still curious, read his Esquire article instead. At least that editor was able to keep his ego in check.

Barnett apparently likes big words and grand metaphors, but usually uses them for no particular purpose, other than to sound like a typical DC blowhard at a cocktail party. As for analysis, there's a lot more ink spilled about how many generals wait breathlessly for Mr. Barnett's prescient analyses, rather than any actual analysis. One xample of how miserably idiotic this book is: in his \\"map\\" of the the \\"pentagon's new map,\\" he includes Turkey, Indonesia, Thailand, and Slovakia are part of his \\"Non-Integrating Gap,\\" those countries which are failed and failing states because they are not integrated into the larger global political economy.

This CD is a complete collection of all their familiar songs and they do sound like they did back then. But there are a few on here that didn't get a lot of air play that should have in my opionion. One that really hit me when I first played it is, When I Saw You. That song is as romantic as they come and I wish there is one more verse because I think it ends to soon. She sounds like she's singing to Phil and he's right there in front of her. Others include; You Baby, and So Young should have gotten much more exposure.If you like the 60's girl goups, the Ronettes are among the head of the class of that era. You'll enjoy listening to them all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"I know for a fact that all of these tracks were originally released in \\"STEREO\\" but I guess ABKCO has NEVER heard of the word.

What re-mixing except from Stereo to Mono.If all you're seeking is the music, it's okay, I guess.I'll probably be selling it and it's a double whammy for me as a Canadian as I had to pay in US funds as this CD is not available in Canada."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible-sounding CD","review":"\\"The Best of the Ronettes\\" CD is the worst-sounding CD I've ever heard. On most of the songs, the voices of the girls are not as loud as the musical instruments. I didn't have any of the Ronettes' records when their songs were on the charts, but I did hear their songs on the radio and they sounded much better than they do on this CD. Since the songs are all mono on the CD, messing with the graphics equalizer doesn't help at all. You can't get the voices to come in at a natural-sounding mix with the instrumentation. On many songs, there's so much distortion that you can't really hear the tunes. However, the two big hits (\\"Be My Baby\\" and \\"Baby, I Love You\\") do sound better than the rest of the songs. If you just want those two songs, you'll be satisfied. Of course, Phil Spector was famous for his \\"wall of sound\\" when he was producing the Ronettes, the Crystals, etc., but on this CD the \\"wall\\" crushes the voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Pop Songs!","review":"This a very fine collection of pop-songs from the early-middle 1960's. The sound is not so polished as with their contemporaries the Supremes; and some may find it a little raw, and a bit more dated.Personally I find songs \\"Be My Baby\\" and \\"Breaking Up\\" near perfect, but some of the lesser known tracks do sound, like they need some polishing / remastering. Somehow I never thought, the great tune \\"Baby I Love You\\" was given the optimal treatment; not a bad version at all here; but I believe it might have been even better.Other stand-out tracks are \\"Walking in the Rain\\", \\"You Baby\\" and \\"I Wonder\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I'm a guy, so the idea of paying more than $100 for a pot was - to me - pretty ridiculous.

These emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and \\"at-will\\" citizens for a long time to come.In reading the book, by the way, the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern, American style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends.
