They performed their music, chatted with the audience, chatted with eachother... it was so full of passion that you couldn't help but get caught up in it all.

The final battle goes far beyond challenging to just simply annoying. I liked the game until this final battle. The save points are non-existant except after you kill a colossus, so be prepared to spend lots of hours playing the same final segment over and over again unless you are an expert. The hardest of the first 1-15 monsters took me a few hours to kill (each), but #16 has been defeating me for over a week and I've re-played it dozens of hours.

This game is comprised more or less of huge stretches of empty land, no characters to interact or battle with other than the collosi themselves, and for the most part, had a horrid control system and the camera angles were equally bad. To honestly sum up this game, it's nothing but 16 boss fights and 5-6 hours of pointless travel time just to get to the bosses. And the reward for actually beating all of them? Sure, the girl gets brought back to life...and your character dies. So it's a really horrid ending too. Visually? Soundwise? Sure, the game is fantastic, but if you're wanting actual 'depth' to a game, this game really isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES FOR THE PS2","review":"This game has stunning graphics and fast-paced gameplay. This game is simply killing different bosses over and over again, but dont think im trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is. For example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them. Some a lot more complicating than others.

The game play is magnificent, and the visuals are incredible, besting almost everything else the PS2 has to offer. The characters are great, with my favorite character in the entire game being a horse. It is amazing how the story and action can make you so attached to a horse. Every fight is, in essence, a boss fight, and each colossus has its own unique strategy to master. There are several great fights, but a couple that stick out as being timeless gaming moments.Honesly one of the greatest games that I have ever experienced, I cannot wait to begin the fun again! There need to be many more games like this one.

I was suprised by the quality of the game's graphics so eventually I ended up buying it. Every colossi has a different weakness that you must find. In the first few battles the voice that told you about them gives you hints on how to find and where the symbols are on the body. There is always one on the head or so that I've found after killing about 5 or 6 of them and then you have to find the other one by using your sword. As time goes on the hints become fewer until you have to figure out how to kill the thing by yourself. I find this game fun because the controls are easy to use and it's neither too easy nor too hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"final boss battle","review":"to the little girl below me, the final boss isn't that hard, you just are not very good. it's not fair to bring the games rating down because you can't figure it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a different type of game.","review":"It's short but well worth the price of admission. For $20 you are going to get about 12 hours of game time maybe more.

The story is well above average and the graphics are great for PS2. It's really one of a kind.

You do get to kill big monsters. There's a fair amount of puzzle solving to figure out how to bring them down. Each monster has it's own weakness and half of the fun is getting to the monster then figuring out how to kill him.

It was very much like watching a movie in most places and I agree with several of the other reviewers that there are no other games like it on the market. Sadly, that is the end of my positive statements on this game. Parts of it (particularly the traveling parts) are quite boring and tediously repetitious, not to mention that the horse is difficult to control. In fact, many times, it was just easier to run to where I was going rather than fight with the horse. However, once you find a Colossus the gameplay becomes extremely difficult. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a challenge but this game is repetitious and far too difficult to be truly entertaining. Sad to say I feel like I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype about?","review":"There's not much to say about this other than it was BORING. The game is extremely repetitive. All you do is jump on your pretty little horse, and gallop around to find the next colossi. Beat it, repeat.

The over world is giant and empty! The controls are pretty bad but you get use to them. The story is.. well I wouldn't know completely because I didn't want to finish the game. The boss battles (which are the only battles) where well staged and beautiful, they really made me feel epic and grand! However this feeling only lasted the first 5 minutes of the battle, then the feeling went completely away. The battles ranged about 5 to 20 minutes to complete, which means you could probably finish this game in about 5 to 6 hours.Overall:It's a short game with, an empty world, bad controls, looping 30 second music, simple story line, repetitive gameplay/experiences, good scenery, and barely good boss battles.

The feelings of fear and isolation and guilt that it manages to create... It's incredible. The creature designs are fantastic, stuff of legends. The gameplay manages to be simple and complex at the same time, what with how you may know what buttons to press but you may not be thinking clearly up against such a mighty monster to push them properly. There are puzzles involved, methods to actually bring down the mountainous beasts. The story is just beautifully touching, in its triumph and in its sorrow. The music is marvelous. I love everything about it. I have not yet finished the game - I'm on the 12th Colossus - but if the fights to come and the end are as amazing as the rest of the game thus far, then I cannot wait to face it. \\"Shadow of the Colossus\\" is a work of video game art, without a doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Unusual Game","review":"I've played lots of different genres of games, and this one is difficult to classify, other than it's a great game.

However, my roomate and I decided to buy this game and play it through together, and it ended up being even better than my favorite Final Fantasy video game series.SotC has a unique story line, decent music, but most of all the most beautiful and innovative gameplay I have encountered. The idea of just fighting giant creatures throughout a free roaming world is amazing, being able to climb up them and use the terrain to the best of your advantage. Having no \\"trash mobs\\" between each colossus was a relief too, because I feel as though it would have made the game more cliche and unenjoyable.I could talk all day about this, but for the sake of listening to me rant... go buy this game"},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable","review":"I can't say enough good things about this game. I know this sounds kind of weird, but I have never ever felt both extreme triumph and extreme sadness after beating this game. All the Collusi are amazing video game accomplishments, but the LAST one. holy crap. Un-freeking-belivable. Such a crazy expierence. The music, the tone of the game, everything. You'll never forget it. Stick with it, beat it. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect game!!!","review":"To tell you the truth I purchased this game because it was released on my birthday, but it turned out to be REALLY fun. I can not stop playing it. I rather play it then sleep. A LOT of fun and cheap to. A MUST buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Is Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Ok i have no idea were to start this game is so good. The graphics are great, the gameplay is awesome, and the game is really long. Although the controls take a little getting used to, it only took me 15 minutes to learn them. The game may look really slow when your watching it. But when your playing it, its pretty fast paced, because you have to watch your stamina bar. The stamina bar is the least of your worries in a battle though. You should really be watching out for huge bolts of lightning.I highly reccomend this game, its extreamly fun, and it doesent get old, although it can get frustrating at times. but you can always look up stuff in stratagey guids incase you cant find out how to do something. 5 OUTA 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time well spent!","review":"I have played this game up through the 6th Colossus. The game just keeps drawing me in. I want to see the next colossus, find out what happens next.As other reviewers have said, these colossi are ENOURMOUS. Finding out how to kill them can be a challange but the game will give you hints if you get stuck.I can't say it's a terribly difficult game, but for me, spending TONS of time to figure out how to advance in a game is a turn off.Definately worth buying!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game, interesting gameplay, lacking in length.","review":"I recently bought the game for around 20 bucks and instantly liked it. If youre a gamer you will probably appreciate this title. The storyline is pretty general, no real details or back story to learn. Youre basically this guy who is slaying all of these rock/earth made Colossi for these gods of light to bring a girl back to life. Each Colossus you fight is pretty unique in figuring out how to defeat them. They all have their own kinda of moves and environments. Defeating each one involves figuring out how to actually get on top of them and then finding their weak points. I enjoyed the large environments, subtle but flowing story, and the different types of colossi you encounter. The game is over after the slaying of about 16 colossus, so relatively short. As a gamer Id recommend it as a unique and fun experience, only downside is length of gameplay. For 20$ its worth it- buy it son!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow of the Colossus","review":"Great game overall. even though it is all about the 16 boss-fights as as cool/fun as they are, there's a bit of downtime where its just you and the environment. now while the environment is gorgeous - one of the best for ps2 games - all there is to do is nav. to each boss. so other than that its fun and doesn't take up too much of your time. still a game you can enjoy, and come back to whenever you'd like to or have the time.ciao!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed in this game!","review":"I was expecting this game to be like God of War. I usually play these type of games with my gf. We use the strategy book and try to pass each level. We found the game to be boring.

He's poorly developed and extremely lame. This game follows the same pattern after each colossus kill, you go back to the castle and a voice tells you a stupid riddle, then you ride for 30 minutes looking for the colossus. Then Repeat again... These people saying that this game has a storline must have created it out of their own imagination. All in all this game is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is awful!","review":"I completely agree with everyone who also gave this game one star.I was curious about Shadow of the Colossus because of the high ratings and many comparisons to God of War (which I loved!).It's terrible and NOTHING like God of War. The environment is OK, but way too bright and overexposed. The \\"hero\\" looks like a girl and there is absolutely no story. The controls are incredibly frustrating which essentially make a boring and tedious game unplayable.Luckily I got to try this game for free - if I would have paid for if, I'd be SUPER pissed.Don't waste your money, just pick up God of War I & II and call it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated.","review":"You have to be a kid to figure this one out. I guess I am too slow to figure it out. I wouldn't recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"I have no idea why I waited so long to play this game. This is a masterpiece of a game that everyone true player should experience. Nothing like God Of War like some reviews tried to compare it to. This is by itself a game you actually feel you live through. Simple story, no hack and slash, its just you, your horse and a vast beautiful landscape..............oh and of course the huge 16 Colossi you have to battle. This is a game I always thought developers should have made.......and they did. Go get your copy today, I'm surprized it goes for such a low price for such magnificent piece of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to do","review":"I think my initial reaction once I started the game was, \\"Where is everyone?\\" There is nothing in the game to do but kill these giants--which I admit is rather interesting. You don't level up, you don't get items, you don't use magic. All you do is find the next Colossus, figure out how to climb on its weak point, and stab it to death. For those of you that have never played the game, I'm sorry that I ruined the whole game for you. I, myself, was also shocked when I beat the game. I remember saying to myself, \\"That's it?\\" and yes... that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Overrated Game","review":"This game is so overrated.This is the most BORING video game I have ever played in my life.All you do is just walk around and fight these huge monsters.That's It.Nothing or Nobody else around,except for you and you're horse.Only good thing that I can say about this game,is the graphics.They are amazing.That's why I gave it a 2,instead of a 1.The graphics IMO are the ONLY good thing,this game has going for it.I say rent it,before you buy it.I bought it for twenty bucks.Now it just sits in my drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dismal abomination of a game...","review":"I too got suckered into purchasing one of the worst PS2 games I have ever seen.

The button configuration is unique and the story behind the game is (even without words) a totally new experience.I wouldn't change ANYTHING about this game, but it was quite difficult. I will admit, I had to cheat and look up a few internet tips for a few of the colossi!5/5 - best $20 game I have ever purchased, and definitely replayable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This game is truly a work of art.

I really feel like it's any serious gamers duty to experience it. It wasn't perfect, the map could have been higher resoloution as it was really hard to find some of the Colossi and the camera got really, REALLY annoying sometimes, and it was really short.

Every gardener and turf manager needs to understand the positive as well as negative role of weeds in horticulture. Cocannouer's book is a true gardening classic, too long out of print, and too little-known. This book will change the way you look at weeds forever.Weeds tend to balance soil deficiencies or surplusses, break up dense soils, provide soil organic matter, regulate soil moisture, contribute to biodiversity, and often provide habitat for beneficial organisms. Identifying the weeds in a given plot provides valuable clues to soil conditions once the preferences of a particular plant are understood. For example, lambs quarters grow in nitrogen-rich disturbed soils. If they appear after incorporating manure, it doesn't necessarily mean the seed was contained in the manure, but that your application has been a success.You can read this book online at the Holistic Agriculture Library."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheeeeeeaaap - you get what you pay for","review":"I would NOT recommend this camera to anyone.

The 5-person rafts are not self-bailing so they often filled up with water and weighed us down, making it harder to maneuver. When we were on a calmer stretch of the creek, we had two rafters use the guns to remove the water from the raft. These guns are great!

Well made and when you collapse the unit, it protects the glass. After you slide the glass chimney down for lighting, it can be a bit tricky to grasp and pull it back up, but if you don't push it down all the way when lighting the wick, its easier to grasp. Or, after lighting you can push down slightly on the top of the frame and then pull back up, and then grasp the glass and pull it all the way up. The glass is made with a smooth edge so, no worries about sharp edges.Otherwise, what can you say about a candle? It puts out enough light to see around a picnic table at night and visit with friends, but you wont be doing much reading with the light from this thing.It is handy to pack, when camping, and you can set up 2 or 3 for more light.

Julie has a great smokey, alto voice with an accent that's perfect for the lower-key music that makes up much of this CD. One reason I know she's so good is that I'm usually not much into slower songs, but I can listen to these easily. Julie does the slower, mellower tunes better than pretty much any other singer. She can also put feistiness into the faster stuff on this record too [No Way Out, most notably]. I'm not listing the good songs, because that's most all of them and that would be redundant! Get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Blued Country Soul","review":"The debut album from South Carolina's Julie Roberts sounds more Memphis than Nashville. Her voice is smokey and sultry, the tunes are fun and funky at times, and its hard to think of anyone to compare this to. Probably the closest is Bonnie Raitt, as the Amazon reviewer stated. I love the way she bends a note; no other country diva sings 'em like Julie, however \\"I Can't Get Over You\\" is reminicient of the best 70s country women. \\"No Way Out\\" is a hip, fun blues jam with an awesome guitar/piano break. It should have been a hit or club favorite. \\"Break Down Here\\" is the obvious hit, but the simple, souful beauty of \\"Unlove Me\\" and \\"If You Had Called Yesterday\\" shine just as bright.This CD will leave you longing and aching for more. Faith Hill wants to sound like this. These songs are real life, I mean how many country songs proclaim, \\"my mouth tastes like yesterday's news?\\" Highly Recommended; I can't stress enough how well this works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Understated","review":"You won't find any vocal histrionics on this record - just pure emotion. Although it may take a few listens to appreciate, this is a promising debut from a great new talent. Whether pleading with a lover to set her free from her own emotions in \\"Unlove Me\\", fleeing from a bad relationship in \\"Break Down Here\\", or expressing longing in \\"Rain on A Tin Roof\\", Roberts is the picture of conviction. She draws you inside a song, but never overwhelms you. Her subtle expression is a testament that less really is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"given this as a gift","review":"There is something just very special about Louise Hay's books, and CD's. This is a very inspiring CD, pleasant enough that you can listen to it daily, and one does get a lot out of listening to it, once, or more often. Well worth the price. Her voice has a very pleasant quality, and the wording is very useful. I listened to this every night, for a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good tape","review":"I feel happy each time I am listening to this tape.

But if music is important to you at all, you will be disappointed by what you hear on this. For me, personally, it's so bad that it's distracting; it's like smelling something bad....unfortunately. So I can't listen to it.The other reviewers are correct about Louise's voice and presence; she sounds great and seems like a lovely person.There's also something funky they do with the sound to get the subliminal stuff in there that bugs me.I really really wanted to like this, and it kills me that I don't, because there's nothing much like it out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love subliminal messaging","review":"I just got this yesterday and have listened to it twice so I can't speak on it's effectiveness but I can say, however, that it's hard to believe that there are messages on this tape. The music is really cheesy and so I can't give it fiver stars, but it's all you can hear. So, at least it lives up to it's advert. I found the side where she speaks the affirmations to be too much, but the side where it's the music is very palatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the music","review":"I listened to the first chapter (the audible affirmations) and her voice is ok.My favorite is the \\"new age\\" music w/subliminal affirmations (3rd chapter).

The book is poorly written, poorly executed and poorly conceived.What I normally do with a bad book is use it as bird cage liner for the next few months. Sadly this book has a hardcover and its difficult to tear the pages out of the book. So when I give the book a 2 instead of a 1 I do so because of its durability. It certainly isn't because the author wrote anything worth reading.The book seems to droll on and on in a constant monotone. This interjected from time to time with poor attempts at humor and sidetracks that have nothing to do with Web publishing. To top it off the book has the worst organization.

Regardless no current browser supports HTML 4 anyway.

Even his earliest memories are tightly wound with his inescapable feelings of absurdity. Like Nabokov, Ionesco found solace in his work as a refuge from the the basic meaninglessness of world events, politics, and in some ways even art itself. In one passage he renounces Rimbaud's \\"Illuminations\\", so far does he descend into the depths of skepticism. Misery has it's place here, but so does an odd, rare kind of joy. \\"I know what hell is now\\", he says in a tone of authoritativeness.

The specials are fine and worth watching again and again, but why not give fans more? How about a set of discs devoted to each of the performers similar to what one finds in the Monty Python and Saturday Night Live series--i.e., The Best of Tim Conway, The Best of Harvey Korman, etc.? Or why not a disc or two devoted to the best Eunice and Mama sketches or the best movie/Broadway parodies, or one featuring famous guest stars? The show ran for 11 years and won 25 Emmys.

DO NOT BUY THIS - says the manufacturer!Just received my new Germ Terminator today and noticed right away that the package shows toothbrushes inserted upside down. This caught my eye right away because when I was trying to decide which sanitizer to buy, I liked that this unit accepts the toothbrushes standing up rather than head down like all the other units. Consequently, when going thru the reviews I learned that the unit I received has been discontinued by the manufacturer and that they warn against purchasing/using one (the price did seem to be too good to be true). Fortunately, I never used the unit and it's going back tomorrow. I don't understand though, after other customers have told Amazon about this, why they're still being sold here!

I've tried to clean the brown stuff out, but can't get it out. It looks like the inside bottom of the unit burned.

I have used it three times a day since the day it arrived and have found it to do an AMAZING job. Because the toothbrush is kept clean and dry, it is like getting a new toothbrush out of the package each time I brush my teeth. I am using distilled water. I found a cute little glass pitcher with a stopper that I fill weekly with distilled water and leave sitting next to the Sanitizer. (Much cuter and takes less space than a Gallon of distilled water sitting on my counter.) I was so satisfied with the product that I bought 3 more.

The only thing I got out of this video is insight into why it is called the turn card, which is why it I gave this two stars.

To completely dismiss the book as simplistic and obvious is harsh and narrow minded, yet to follow his suggestions to the T is equally narrow minded and unrealistic.

John Gray is very desisive when telling about how to communicate better between the sexes.

But it isn't, it is a modern enough book that the author should have known that the surface of Venus is hot enough to melt lead, that at the surface that atmospheric pressure is much, much greater then here on earth, and that the atmosphere has way too much carbon dioxide and probably other gasses to make it safe to breathe. Likewise, Mars cannot sustain human life, the air is much too thin, due to that and it's distance from the sun it's much too cold, and correct me if I am wrong but the atmosphere, even if it was thicker I do believe is poisonous to some degree also.So obviously, women cannot be from Venus.

With this in mind we'll have a better response to situations that arise. It uses a bit of humor when explaining how men and women think and react to certain situations. This book explains how both are different but when they understand and realize that they compliment one another.

I think John Gray is a little bit too warm-and-fuzzy for a lot of men but he makes a number of valid observations that I found to be valuable not only with my spouse but also dealing with men in business. It is not the ONLY relationship tool you will need but it can offer explanations for behaviors that seem unpredictable and unfathomable to women, simply because they are so different for our own behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tips from \\"Dr\\" Gray","review":"I don't understand how Mr. Gray keeps on putting the initials PhD on his book covers.

If you really want to find out about sex differences (if any exist...) take a social psychology course!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my least favorite books.","review":"Though John Gray does offer a couple of interesting insights, I consider the majority of this book junk that is unfit for reading. I found his writing style simplistic and insulting. And his attempts NOT to stereotype the sexes is a failure. I found this book very sexist, overly-simplistic, and perpetuating arguable oppresive gender roles. Obviously, it is also very heterosex-centered. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men R From Mars, Women R from Venus, John Gray is a loser","review":"While a woman's need to discuss everything is babbling that men need to learn to deal with, senseless as it is...it makes much more sense according to John that a man needs to hide in his cave where he can be king of his forest. Now that's mature. Oh, please. Women love to communicate, men just want to rule and not be questioned. If I was Mrs. Gray, I'd be puking all the way to the bank. I didn't want to give him any stars, but you forced me to.Just for the record, my partner and I are crazy about each other, understand each others different points of view and if he wants to go to a cave he drags me along by the hair talking all the way..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!

Horrible read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Yourself a Favor--Don't Bother Buying This Book!","review":"My son-in-law thought this book was the \\"cat's meow\\"--the answer to all his marital problems so he strongly recommended that I read this book. I tried, but I couldn't get more than a 1/3 of the way through. Usually I can read anything but this was an unhappy exception. I looked at the cover and saw Ph.D. after the author's name and thought, you got to be kidding. This book wouldn't pass Freshman English with a C-grade, much less Introductory Psychology! Then I found out that the author is not licensed to practice what he preaches and he got his Ph. D. degree through a mail-order diploma mill. I'm surprised he got this thing published with such shaky credentials. It's really scary to see that he's been on the Best Seller list and is writing more of this trash. By the way, the book did not save my son-in-law's marriage. My step-daughter wisely gave him, and this book, the heave-ho. I recommend that you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popcorn self help","review":"The one good thing about this book is that it is well organized. It is poorly written and low in substance.

None of them had finished it. And I can see why. It's poorly written. It's repitive. It's not worth reading through to the end.I'm the only person I know who has read the entire book. And that was a painful experience. There's not much worthwhile in the book. To summarize: men and women are different, view and see things differently, be aware of this when dealing with your spouse.That's all he wrote using the 'catchphrases' of Mars and Venus.To sum up the book - don't buy it - if anything take it out of the library. Then read any 2 chapters. The rest are all the same.And don't recommend this book to anyone if you don't read it entirely. You'll find that you won't be recommending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks more than it fixes","review":"I didn't read the book but my wife did. It caused way more problems in our relationship.

We ARE on different wavelengths, he says, and he translates each gender's seemingly odd behavior in a way the opposite sex can understand.Your mantra for every chapter will be \\"Gee, I didn't know that!\\"My church used this book as a basis for a discussion group; each week's chapter resulted in a lively and fascinating exchange. And several \\"lightbulb moments\\" when we suddenly got a flash of insight.For anyone who has ever been baffled by the opposite sex (and haven't we all?), this book is must reading indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish psychobabble","review":"I pity the stupid woman who believes this and buys a copy for her spouse hoping for change.

And yet he still appears as \\"John Gray, PhD\\" on the cover of his book! He bought his PhD from a diploma mill. He's a fraud, a charlatan, a huckster.I'd like to think that after a man who rose to fame peddling himself as a relationship guru -- while using false credentials to bolster his claims -- would find himself humbled after his PhD was revealed to be a fraud. Apparently, John Gray lacks humility and basic human decency, as well as a PhD.What John Gray has is the ability to tell people what they want to hear. Maybe he should sell a diet & exercise book too, and tell us we can eat all the chocolate we want, and sit on our fat behinds while watching 7 hours of TV, followed by 5 hours in online chat rooms, and we'll get slim & trim by doing so!Sincerely,Madame Beige, PhD, B.S.A., XyZ, PdQ"},{"rating":"1","title":"stereotyping for dummies","review":"I read this book as an impressionable teenager and came to the conclusion that I must be a man. I then walked around for years thinking that I'm somehow unfeminine because I don't shop for therapeutic relief and I don't gaggle in groups. Conversely, men who enjoy open dialogue are unmasculine. I've even heard some friends admit to assuming a young man was gay because he communicated well with women. If all men were introverts and all women were extroverts then this book would have received a two star rating from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Misguided","review":"This book does not offer any supported or relevant information for intimate partners. The driving idea of men and women being essentially from different cultures and having completely different communication styles is unsupported by the vast majority of professionals in the fields of psychology and counseling and it is not supported by even ONE reseach study. In fact, I'd make a guess that \\"Dr.\\" Gray has never actually conducted any reasearch on the matter. His credentials are shaky and so is his information and suggested advice.

Men and women are different as they are from different planets: Mars where self-reliant is valued, and Venus where mutual help and consideration are given without being asked. From this basic concept, the author goes into various practical ways to improve the relationship between the opposite sex. This ranges from the mundane daily occurrence- a woman in the passenger seat making comments on the man's driving - to offering support and understanding in emotional turmoil.To some extent, some might find this book a bit too obvious or just a bit of common sense. However the crux of the matter is that we do not practise the obvious in our relationships and take our partners for granted. This book will be valued by those who genuinely want to improve their marriage or relationship with the opposite sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"After reading MMWV, I read Susan Hamson's counterpoint, \\"The Rebuttal from Uranus\\" in \\"Taking Sides: Human Sexuality, 6th ed.\\" by Francoeur and Taverner.I must say that Gray is incomplete without having a copy of Hamson nearby to refute (or at least temper) Gray's \\"wisdom\\".Plus, Francoeur and Taverner provide a lot of insight on other important sexuality issues. I recommend that everyone read Gray, but read him in Taking Sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to get along with your caveman!","review":"This book is a wonderful guide for women on how to get along with prehistoric cavemen.

As a woman, I found the men were given way too many buy outs for bad behaviour.

I found it full of ridiculously broad generalities and stereotypes. Although there are a few nuggets of truth in the book, the majority of it is pop psychology at its worst.I read this book over a year ago, and didn't care for it then. I like it even less since discovering that John Gray's \\"PhD\\" so proudly flaunted on the cover comes from Columbia Pacific University, a diploma-by-mail mill which was shut down by the California Department of Consumer Affairs. (Look it up for yourself on the web.)All in all, I'm very disappointed with this book, its author, and the media attention it has received.

Kappas has people divided into two groups based on the methods needed to induce a state of hypnosis. Kappas calls his two groups the Physicals and the Emotionals. It is correct that people can be divided into these two basic groupings, but the division is not by male & female. In his book, John Gray makes all men Physicals and all women Emotionals. This is not correct. There are an equal number fo women who are Physicals and and equal number of men who are Emotionals. John Gray's erroneous stereotyping of men & women by these categories is a great dis-service in helping the sexes understand each other better. This book is trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all young couples","review":"If I had known this before, my relationships would have been a lot easier!

Very bland!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus","review":"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus created quite a stir when it was first written in 1992 because of the veracity of its information. Dr. Gray explained in vivid detail why it is that men and women just don't speak the same language and often misunderstand each other in relationships. After reading this book, it is obvious that men and women have completely different, and sometimes opposed, needs from their relationships. Any person interested in making their relationship better would benefit from reading this book with its practical and simple explanation of the opposite sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a space cadet","review":"The book can be summarized in one phrase, men like to solve problems, women like to have problems.

I mean, the characters, the plot, the subplots -- what the heck happened? I'm sure that Gray was trying to mimic the slice of life aspect, but he rode that starcruiser too many darn light years for my liking. There was no ambiguous moral message like you find in Clarke's work, just a lot of obvious ones like you'd find in Bradbury's weaker work.

I believe most of the people who have rated this book 1 star have done their homework and feel that this book was just a bunch of bull.

Gray's doctorate degree is from an unacredited college. He has never been published in a scholarly journal. Gray has never participated in serious communication research of any sort. He appears on Oprah, but refuses to speak at universities where professors might ask him questions. John Gray can write what you want to read, and you might even relate to his depictions. If you feel you need to find out what all the fuss is about, then read this book, but read with caution.

It is nothing but a collection of tired old gender stereotypes. The only thing good that can be said about this book is that Gray is impartial; he insults both men and women equally. He focusses on the most superficial aspects of human behavior as if they were profound, innate, and of the greatest importance. According to \\"Doctor\\" Gray, the secret to having a successful relationship is to resign yourself to the fact that your partner is petty and shallow and always will be. This book gives people dangerously bad advice. There are plenty of good books available on relationship psychology by knowledgeable authors. Read them and avoid this book.

There are many cavemen, and many needs women and those cavemen try to get their girlfriends/wives to back off, and I am sure some of those needy women are trying to be happy by themselves, out of desperation that their men won't treat them right. IF this is Dr Gray's expert solution, why hasn't this worked already?

This book had too many characters, storylines and insufficient detail. I had the feeling the writing was rushed, written too quickly to get it to press and not enough time was taken to give both the characters and storyline the depth that Emma's descendants deserve and that was originally created in the first book. I thought the twin tower replay was in poor taste and was both overdramatized and underutilized in the story line. This book was, in short, boring and disappointing. A pity, because so much more could have been done with this series, as I have found that each successive book is rather lackluster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the fourth book","review":"\\"Unexpected Blessing\\" is the fouth book in the Emma Harte series by Barbara Taylor Bradford.

Author Benjamin Epstein, in 1967, used exactly the same techniques to smear the John Birch Society (JBS) as today's left-wingers use to smear the Religious Right. One favorite technique is to call conservative groups extremist and un-American, and Epstein does not disappoint us in this regard. Then there is the usual attempt to associate conservative groups with the Nazis. In this regard, he has a whole chapter on \\"The John Birchers and Anti-Semitism\\". Using carefully selected anecdotes, he tries to impugn the entire organization. But facts are facts. The John Birch Society had many Jewish members, and never unilaterally condemned any racial or religious group. Epstein, and other left-wingers who think like him, should be ashamed of themselves for their innuendo against those with whom they disagree."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"Who Loves You Like This is a powerful, moving account of a woman's experience during World War II and the years just after it, covering her life in Eastern Europe, in a concentration camp, and in Israel."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment!","review":"The book itself is a great book!!!

The checks are just plain stupid, because they are so overpowering. For example, when you get to the goal everyone crowds and tries knocking you over as hard as possible. The game really sucks.

My son is a strong walker but as with any pushing toy it should be able to withstand some counter pressure. This mower is so back heavy that it falls very easily and in one instance caught my sons fingers underneath as he fell with it. This has been the only toy whether pusher or other that has actually hurt him, leaving both his Grandmother and I very wary of why it was rated so well. It tips at the slightest pressure and if I put one finger on the handle it falls backwards. My son has great balance and isn't being rough but simply trying to use it. In my book playing with any toy that ends in tears is not only a bad toy but has serious design flaws.The only reason I rated it a 2 is because he loves the idea and the fun popping sound.

It is very sturdy and has great eye appeal like all Little Tikes toys. My personal complaint is that I think it is VERY noisy-perhaps this is what makes it so unappealing to my children. My kids have loved push toys of all kinds (even a doll stroller!), but this mower has been a total flop in our household.(I had first tried the FP Bubble Mower-way to messy and very poor bubble output/ quickly returned.) At least I'll get a decent price for it's like new condition at a yard sale or as a donation.

It sounded so neat in the reviews, but it's just a cheap piece of plastic junk. I can't understand why it is so darn expensive! Ditto to the reviewer who wrote that it cannot be used as a walker. Unless you have a VERY proficient walking child, your baby is going to fall on top of this mower because it is extremely lightweight. It did nothing to hold my baby's interest.

Having heard Welser-Most live, I was amazed at how much better he is than his reputation would lead one to believe. He is a spuerlative conductor who may grow into a great one. This performance shows off his skill at handling a large chorus in a thrustful, almost lush reading of Stravinsky's neoclassical masterpiece. Highly recommened, even though none of the singers, except for Rolfe-Johnson as Oedipus, is truly outstanding. But he is, the best of the singers in the Peter Pears tradition, who try to make Oedipus quietly poignant and tragic through self-realization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice stylish watch","review":"I bought this for my wife a couple of weeks ago and she really loves it. The watchband is somewhat long so I had to purchase a cheap pin remover from Amazon (see my other reviews) to remove two links on either side of the band.

Most people, myself included, first heard of him in his association with Brian Wilson, especially his key vocal roles in the stunning \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"Smile\\" tours and albums. However, he is a great musician in his own right and this album shows why. \\"Laughter in the Rain,\\" an a cappella remake of the old Neil Sedaka classic, is worth the price of the album alone, in my view. Brian Wilson would be (is?!) proud of the harmonies in this track. The old Sunrays tune \\"I Live for the Sun\\" is given great new life here and the pop-rocker \\"Fish!\\" just soars along beautifully with a great high-voice wail. If you like the Beach Boys of the 1960s, but with a modern style, this is a wonderful album that will get you dancing and surfing again--great job, Jeff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meditations","review":"I really like Louise Hay's Meditation early AM to late PM.

However, on the evening meditation when she told me to picture my father as a small child balling his eyes out I decided I'd had enough. Maybe this is useful for someone who had a horrible childhood to picture a parent small and tiny and in need of love, but her method is just bizarre to me.

I do not need to read a book to know it is a wrong thing to do. After that I stopped reading any farther. What a waist of my time. I am a financially secure Japanese software engineer. Maybe this book is catered toward a women with no job, no game, a type of women who sit around and watch these TV talk shows all day.

I had a good idea of the book's content even before I read it. This idea was due soley to the fact that my girlfriend of 2 years suddenly ended the relationship, claiming that she had read a book that gave her a knew perspective. I had no idea that the perspective she spoke of was one so cold, heartless, and radical. Some might say that maybe I'm just one of those abusive thugs in Dr. Laura's book, and I probably deserived whatever heartbreak I recieved. I can assure you with every ounce of moral fiber in my being that I would never be abusive to any woman, for any reason, especially one I felt so strongly for. My advice to all those who wish to read this book, is to stay far from it, if you have any feelings for your significant other at all, stay far far away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Just The Best!","review":"I totally agree with everything she says.

Also from my understaning she is not even a true psychologist/therapist. I would not reccomned people reading this, and I know for a fact that when I am practing therapy myself I will NOT be telling my clients about things from this book.

We enjoy its mellowness, and the soaring vocals and harmonies.

After I disconnected it, it took a couple of months for the icicles to sublimate (evaporate) so I could pull out the tray and clean it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the first year...","review":"At first, this unit worked absolutely great - just as you would expect with great tasting, clear water. But after only a year it has developed a problem where 1 out of 10 times, the internal valve won't shut off and keeps wasting water from the drain line after the faucet is shut off. This is with 65psi line pressure and brand new pre/post fliters. In typical GE tradition and value, they have sold off their residential water division - so now customers are left with ZERO support on these units."},{"rating":"1","title":"loud and wasteful","review":"I've had this for two years and it has been loud from day one. Ahh, day one, how I remember the grey hair. Installing was a real pain. The directions seem to be written for a professional, though it was indicated to me that installing would be easy. Far from it.The noise... it grugles really loudly through the air gap when ever I use it. Much more than is acceptable. Beware.Now, there is a syphoning problem. After usage I can often hear water running down the drain that does not stop until I turn off the water. Once I turn it back on I'm fine, but not prior. I replaced the filters, but not the membranes and that fixed it for a while. Now it is back to syphoning. I don't know if $200 worth of membranes will help but I really don't want to find out they don't!I will say that I'm very happy with the water quality though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Product: GE Merlin RO","review":"Don't buy this GE Merlin RO system.

I wonder if anyone has considered the merits of a class-action lawsuit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone. Didn't pass the wife test.","review":"Pros: I used to have the more typical sears RO system but was frustrated by low capacity. I bought one of these last summer. It was great to be able to fill a 5 gal water jug in minutes instead of hours. Cool design.Cons: LOUD! The air-break in the spigot sounds like a jet engine. Because it is filtering so much more water per unit time than the low capacity systems, it sounds like you are pouring a bucket of water down the drain the entire time it is running. It has startled people in the next room when the ice maker goes off. Replacing filters is a $250 exercise. Mine lasted 9 months before the flow rate dropped to the point where it was no longer acceptable. Now it keeps turning on spontaneously with a trickle of water. It may be because of a bad valve or because the filers need replacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine is loud garbage too","review":"I've had the system for 2+ years now. It's never worked well. It's very loud when filtering water, and has very low output pressure. I added a booster pump and a storage tank to make it moderately useful. Even though our water usage is low, the prefilter has to be replaced every month or 2, or the valve will make even more noise. It kinda whines like a dying animal as it leaks waste water throught the manifold valve. My wife will be extremely happy when it's in the trash. I'll be replacing it with a conventional RO system in the next couple weeks. I'd only recommend it if you need 200+ gallons of water per day, don't mind 60+dB of noise, only use the supplied faucet, install the unit within 2 feet of the faucet, and keep a big stockpile of prefilters on hand to swap out every few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"GE Merlin is a water waster!!!!!!","review":"I purchased this unit about 5 years ago & initially was quite pleased!

When the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, he finds himself sucked into the vast conflict. What he learns about himself and the world while fighting we change his destiny forever.Interweaving Danny/Abe's story with a detailed acounting of the fateful attack on the Rumanian oil fields at Ploesti, this story combines a gripping story of the terrors and triumphs of combat with one man's story of self-discovery. The descriptions of combat are detailed and utterly convincing, and provide the backdrop for Abe's growing realization that there is more to life than he's ever expected. As someone who has always been fascinated by the men and machines that made up the Army Air Forces in World War II, this story kept me engrossed from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT PRODUCT","review":"Sony DEJ011 CD Walkman Portable CD PlayerThis little jewel provides a fast and efficient method of listening to CD's.

But still it played good with good sound quality for about four months, Then it developed the habit of not spinning up the CD unless you shake and bang the player with your hand (Kind of like playing a tambourine, I kind of looked at it as extra exercise) That lasted about two months before it quit completely.If you want a cheap looking player thats going to maybe give you six months of play time there are cheaper priced ones that will give you the same lack of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what a Walkman used to be!","review":"As soon as we opened the packaging and saw and held this Walkman, we didn't expect much.

It plays well and sounds good at first. Then just when you think it's your trusted friend, it starts giving you trouble. The first one broke after six months. The second one put a knick in one of my CD's and scratched another to the point of being unplayable (i.e. you can see light through the scratch when you hold it up to the light), so now I will have to replace the CD. Fortunately the ruined CD is a disc I can replace relatively easily (the disc it ruined was \\"Vortex\\" by Amon Düül II in case you're wondering), but I'm still not happy about it; that's $14 I could have spent on something else. I should also mention that at least the second one has lasted about 9 months, so better, but come on now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapppointment","review":"I really love Sony products, and this one had such good customer reviews that I don't really know what went wrong...I bought this for my son, who has to listen to therapeutic music for 30 minutes per day. I figured the anti-skip technology would be important to keep the music playing for a bouncy little boy. I liked the shuffle feature too.But from the beginning, it worked poorly. Frequently at the end of 30 minutes we'd find the music had at some point turned off, and we didn't know when or why. And the ALVS apparently reduced the volume on some therapeutically distorted disks so low that they no longer had therapeutic benefit, and was too easy to accidentally turn on. The layout of the buttons was awkward, with the play button too far from the headphones port to easily control in a tune belt. I'm giving up on getting this working right and buying something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie buff","review":"The delivery of this product was received in a timely matter.

It is really noisy though - I have the CD player hooked up to a set of computer speakers, so the noise of the CD player is sometimes louder than the music itself.Also, some people might like this, but it is kind of annoying to me. If you stop a CD before it ends, somehow the CD player remembers where you left off... even after you pull the CD out, put different one in, then put the original CD back in. After all that time the CD player will start back up where it left off. It's not a problem to fast-forward or rewind back to the beginning, just a strange thing, that's all.I haven't used the earphones, 1) I can't stand the kind that flip around the ear like that, 2) I don't need them since I'm hooked up through a set of speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the way I read my books.","review":"I have a great job where I can \\"read\\" while I work, thanks to audio books on CD.

Quality control and poor design are legitimate problems here, I can confirm.I bought this as a gift and was testing it out beforehand, because of the bad reviews. Sure enough, my model had a problem where it would not detect that the lid was closed. If I squeezed the unit a certain way as I was closing the lid, I could get it to work sometimes. Pathetic. It's pretty bad when you know the thing isn't going to work before you even open the package. It was just a matter of finding out what the specific problem would be, and I found out immediately.There probably are some working units out there but who has the time or inclination to keep buying and returning them until you get a good one?

I had a really old CD player, and I wanted the best, so I shelled out a couple extra bucks and it was worth it.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had an old cherry red Sony Walkman that worked great for years until it died. I thought it would be wise to spend a little extra money on a replacement, thinking it, too would last for awhile.In less than a year of owning it, the performance has deteriorated rapidly and the noise the player makes as it's getting ready to play has gotten worse. It is also very sensitive, and so skips or stops playing easily on disks that play without any issues on other players. Coupled with the horrible button design mentioned by other reviewers and obviously flimsy plastic construction, I would not recommend that anyone spend $40 on this player.I should add that I do not walk with this walkman, or use it as a personal cd player. It has a cushy life hooked up through my record player to a pair of speakers and plays the occasional CD (that friends bring over, or before I get around to importing it to my iPod)."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted less than 2 months","review":"In less the two months, the motor increased dramatically, sort of like a helicopter, and the unit now randomly turns off in the middle of a song. The battery life is low, with the battery compartment being difficult to access. The slide to open button on the front of the unit is extremely annoying to use, and should have been placed on the cover. The display is not back-lit and is hard to read in low light conditions. This is an example of why it is sometimes better to see and hold an item before you buy it. None of these concerns would really be an issue if the player didn't cost almost $40.00. For that kind of money, and based on the \\"good\\" reviews, I unfortunately assumed it was a superior product to the inexpensive models. As far as actual sound, the player does very well when it is actually playing the music. If you buy this model, and start to hear a noticeably loud motor sound bring it back immediately if you still can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dud","review":"CD completely failed to play after approximately 5 hours.It was a Christmas gift and the recipeint had thrown out the original shipping material so he cannot send it back.

You need to remove your CD before opening the battery compartment. Changing the battery is not easy, especially for anyone with big fingers. The player's Lid will always get in your way.

It's just kind of quirky to have that buried in the small print. This player's been great with those adjustments. Most players are messed up soon after purchase.

Yes the battery compartment is in a ridiculous place, and the batteries are hard to get out because the cover doesn't open enough to give you easy access, but everything else is so perfect that it is worth the effort.

For most of the ideas ascribed to Chomsky, no references are given, and as far as they are to be had at all, I guess they will all be from the 1960s.

Before we can ever hope to have an intelligent conversation about the Party Pooper Fake Poop, we must first get the nomenclature right!What really makes this a piece of crap is the convex shape. The curve kills the prank. When you place it on something that is not a toilet seat, it looks like the turd is trying to crawl away like a worm. You can see daylight underneath it! I've never seen poop like that. I'm telling you, this is not poop! It's crap!The prank worked on the kids, but the wife knew it was fake right away.

His original hits were made for Columbia starting in the '50s, and you need to hear the originals to get the full impact of this great man's work. These \\"warmed-over\\" versions just don't have the edge and energy of the originals, which in addition to Ray's great vocals also feature groundbreaking instrumental work from some of the greatest country musicians of all time. Look for albums on Columbia/Sony to hear what a great artist Ray REALLY is.

A fairly complex plot with good type casting and character portrayal, the film shifts from fiction to reality as Dashiell Hammett's latest novel envelops the author himself.Unfortunately, at least one steamy sex scene makes the film inappropriate for young teenagers and adults with delicate sensibilities. For the rest of us who enjoy being transported to another time and world through the Private Eye experience this is a truly entertaining movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pansy Leading Man","review":"Casting the lead with a masculine personality would go a long way in improving this movie.

Wim does a particularly bad job of directing a movie set in a genre he doesn't really understand. It comes across as a German director's idea of what film noir is all about. He should have watched a movie like Chinatown at least once for some inspriation on how a modern treatment of film noir should be done.This movie comes across as something that was done on such a limited budget, it couldn't be made well.It stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Missed Op","review":"Not a true biopic and not a real adaptation, just a good-looking drag. The picture's like Frederick Forest's take on the lead character. It looks remarkably authentic, but doesn't hold the interest for long. (Do scenes of writers at work ever really succeed on screen?) While the picture opens with Chandler's lauding Hammett's groundbreaking work, all we see here are cliches in action. We never get a sense of what he was rendering at the time that was different than what others were doing or noticeably realistic. We end up with scenes we've seen a hundred times before and some that explicitly foreshadow better bits in the Falcon.

I was disappointed in the quality of the pegs. They are plastic and shallow and tend to slip out of their holes during play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the plastic pieces","review":"I agree with another review I saw about the quality of the pieces. They are cheap plastic pieces that often fall out of the holes when you barely graze you hand or sleeve over the board while trying to move a piece. This happened frequently when my kids played. I really like the wood board, and that is why I bought this game. But if I would have actually seen this in a store and touched it with my hands, then I would not have purchased it. The pieces just fall over because they are not heavy enough to stay in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"no colors on the board","review":"The board in wood with no colors in the home triangles. It makes it harder to remember where you are trying to go when all the pegs are out in the middle of the board and there are no colors.

The pegs are plastic and fall out of the holes but in general the game is still fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplayable","review":"Purchased for our daughter. The peg pieces are plastic and are too short to seat properly in the board's holes. As a result, when you move a peg from one hole to the next, you inevitablely knock over other pegs in the vicinty. This game is unplayable as delivered. We have experimented with inserting short segments that we cut from a wooden dowel rod into the pegs to keep them from falling over. That works but requires a bit of effort from you, the owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic pieces fall out of holes, not \\"solid wood\\"","review":"We intended to purchase a solid wood game with solid wood pieces and instead ended up with a wood board and plastic pieces.

As a result, they tip over if you breathe while playing, or if you touch a piece to move it, or if your opponents touch one of their pieces.

The minor arcana are not illustrated, which some people prefer, and some detest. However, I objected to the fact that it is titled \\"The 'Witches' Tarot.\\" As a Witch, I can say that a great deal of the symbolism is just plain wrong. The Tarot was originally derived from medieval Christian mysticism, which is why decks geared toward modern pagans substitute certain traditional elements with more appropriate themes. As an example, 'The Devil' would not appear in many 'real' Witches decks. Most of us do not believe in the devil, and a substitution of a pagan god such as Osiris or the Celtic Antlered God would be prefered.

My prime interest was the sublime piano sounds from George Winston. I have a few of George's discs and never fail to enjoy his style.Interestingly, George Winston says that the making of this disc was the most challenging recording he had done. I can imagine. There is so much repetitive playing, done methodically and with a freshness that seems unaffected by the sheer effort to maintain the rhythym, timing and feeling.This disc is for me. Private and exclusively mine.Bagwan"},{"rating":"1","title":"At Best a Fair Try","review":"George Winston is a magnificent pianist, but you should pass on this one. I'm not sure whether most of the particular songs selected for this CD don't fit his style or whether the arrangements of the pieces are flawed, but there is little of interest here. Try his other works and see how much better he is than here. It's precisely because his other work is so much better that I only gave this two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eine Kleine Elevator Music","review":"What would you get, I wonder, if you took the Doors- one of the greatest of all rock and roll bands- and toook away Morrison's rich baritone, the dark lyrics, Kreiger's sitar-like droning guitar lines, and arranged it all for a skating rink? This is what you'd get.Because as great as the Doors music was, the songs were just not terribly complex melodically. \\"Light My Fire\\" is basically a two-chord song with a couple of very short themes that repeat, and unless you're Mozart there's just not a lot to improvise on. And Winston, for all his charm, is not Mozart.What Winston has produced is 45 minutes of noodling of the sort done by thousands of amateur pianists. There's nothing discordant or annoying about it, but at the same time there's nothing terribly interesting, either. It's just background music of the sort that made the phrase \\"New Age Music\\" the butt of a thousand musicians' jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The revolution is over.","review":"I wanted to like this cd I really did. I like George Winston and own December, Autumn and others. I like the Doors and own their music as well. I did I really did want to like this. Instead I feel as though my music has been reduced to cocktail lounge stuff. You can tell by how its being played, ole George is thinking he's really working it but it just doesn't work. At least not for me. I cringed, I skipped songs, I went back and listened. Oh I know the intent was good but the end does not justify the means. In a word ... YUCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Doors' originals","review":"George Winston is talented, and his December CD is really beautiful. But I feel he is worlds away from Ray Manzarek, the Doors' keyboardist, in temperament and style. The leap is just too great.

I have enjoyed other George Winston works (December) and also enjoy The Doors but having heard this disc, I knew I needed to warn the fine shoppers at Amazon. To me The Doors music represents a time period- a frame of mind- it evokes a specific mood and memories and to hear it in this form does not do it any justice. I am an open-minded person but I became very agitated at this \\"interpretation\\". It reminds me of very bad elevator music. In fact, if I was traveling down 100 floors in an elevator and this music was playing, I'd get out and take the stairs!!!! My mom enjoyed it (age 62) but then she has never heard of The Doors. By the way I am jammin' to The Doors Greatest Hits as I type in hope of erasing the former from my memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment - No Bright Spots Here","review":"As a dedicated fan of George Winston and The Doors, I eagerly awaited my first listen to this CD. I was bitterly disappointed however. Seems like a good idea, but it just doesn't work. Some of the songs that should sound bright and uplifting get turned into dirges. The spirit of The Doors is missing. What makes so much of the Doors music gratifying is Jim Morrison's voice or the intricate solos by Robby or Ray, neither, of course, are here. The engineering bothered me a lot too and was distracting -- the piano just sounds odd. I hear distortion, key thunks, the higher notes get lost in noise and turn into clinks. One listen to this CD was more than enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"George, why did you move into the elavator?","review":"I'm very disappointed. There has been no greater fan of George Winston than I. I have all of his music, so of course I bought this one the moment I saw it. One cannot get past the freaky Musak feeling you get in JcPenny's singing along to a sixties Beatles tune but it's in a quasi classical format. It's like a sell out of the Winston personal style. There is a reason I don't tune into the \\"Smooth Jazz\\" stations, it's the same thing. Take a song and shove it into the style you want to hear. Admittedly George has used other's songs before, but they fit.

On the other hand, if you are alienated by the Wedding Industrial Complex that insists that your invitations must match your reception tablecloths, OR by the notion that weddings are the pinnacle of women's lives, skip it. While the protagonist is supposedly ever-so-modern (whoa, she has a job! she briefly considers not changing her name! she has sex with her boyfriend BEFORE marriage!), the tale is the usual trite oh-the-wedding-planning-was-so-stressful-but-it-was-all-WORTH-it goo.

I love that our main character from the beginning put out the front that she was trying to avoid any bridezilla moments, but they can sneak up on you when you least expect them.With a groom that is very busy at work and a rough times with both families, I loved reading this story in the middle of my planning. The characters felt real and I could picture them walking down the street and passing me by. The book had the perfect mix of humor and comedy mixed with character development and heart/soul.I would put this book in the hands of every bride and bridesmaid to see a fictionized version, but to know that there will be a moment in each planning process where crazy can hit a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frontier dresses, children's tiara's, $400 shoes...OH MY!!!","review":"Laura Wolf's 'DIARY OF A MAD BRIDE' catalogs the count down to Amy Thomas' big day and all of the craziness that ensues before hand.

The reader watches as Amy go from a level headed bride-to-be to an almost crazed \\"bridezilla\\" herself!Wolf has written a hilarious account of how stressful planing a wedding can actually be. I laughed out loud numerous times and definitely recommend this book for anyone currently planning a wedding (surely you could use a laugh to de-stress a bit).

Instead I got a book about a woman who keeps getting more and more ridiculous - to the point where I no longer felt sorry for her. While bridal insanity may happen to a lot of people (myself included), the author takes the story way too far over the top in an attempt to funny. Instead of reading the book and laughing at the characters (and thus myself), by the end I was sick of the main character and all of the book's contrived predicaments.This was not a terrible book, and it was a very quick read.

From the Korean lady who wouldn't \\"let\\" her buy the mini tiara to having to wear a hideous dress passed down from generations before ... everything was of the ridiculous. I could never in good conscience recommend this book to someone planning a wedding who is looking for a few good laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute -- but it could have been better","review":"Diary of a Mad Bride is the journal of Amy Thomas who, after complaining about how annoying her bride-to-be friend is, gets engaged herself. She decides to be organized; she makes a list of everything she has to do to make her wedding come off; and her journal recounts everything that actually happens.It's an amusing read, and one that should draw chuckles of recognition from just about everybody, but at almost 300 pages it starts to feel like too much of the same thing. There's a nod to family relations, a few details about work, but nothing to give the book a little more depth or texture or even a little variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book-","review":"This book was a fun read, about a woman who gets engaged and keeps a diary about it and during the process of the year before her wedding- she makes herself and everyone around her, insane.Fun book.Ellen"},{"rating":"2","title":"a bride","review":"I read this and then had my DF read it.

Every Bride to be should have her man read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Funny, You Can't Stop!","review":"As other reviewers, both professional and amateur, have already said, it doesn't matter what you think of weddings in order to enjoy this book. If you have already had one, dreamed of having one, been the maid of honour at one, arranged one with your daughter, friend, mother, whoever, or have always dreaded the very idea of having one ... you WILL find this book hysterically funny. Wolf leaves no detail behind - she introduced a few things I had never heard of for weddings. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that it really isn't a great piece of literature, but then again it doesn't pretend to be either. It's just a whole lot of fun that had me laughing out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wild and crazy bridal adventure!","review":"Being engaged has opened my eyes to a whole other world of ettiquette, descision-making, and refereeing. Never before had I ever thought that I would divide the family if I used paper napkins at the reception instead of linen, or that guests would refuse to come if I didn't provide a course of dinner suited to their needs.Diary of a Mad Bride is one of those books I caught myself relating to more than I think I should have. It outlines the troubles and anxiety of wedding planning, and what she had to go through to get down the aisle (and trust me, we ALL have our own wedding planning anxities). This books is funny, witty, and dead-on. And I still haven't gotten my shoes yet. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too funny!","review":"This bride faces it all! From a concession stand proposal to a monsoon like storm the night before her wedding she conquers it gracefully. Amy Thomas, the main character, struggles with whether or not she wants to get married then after she accepts the proposal she struggles with changing her name. The funniest part has to be when her good friend Anita points out that with her middle name being Sarah and her married name would be Stewart her initials would spell out something vulgar. This book is a very quick read with tons of humor around every turn. Once you start reading this book you won't put it down!Follow up this book with another dose of Amy in Diary of a Mad Mom to be. See if you can spot dating errors with her birthday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and quick read","review":"I enjoyed this book and read it in two days. It had a lot of funny parts to it and the journal entry format made it a fun read. The ending wasn't as great as I expected, it seemed the whole book built up to the big day and then it got rushed, but none the less it was still worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so book, horrible wedding.","review":"I am not a Bride, a bridesmaid, and I am not engaged, so maybe I could not enjoy this book properly. I didn't think this book was very realistic and I was dissapointed with some of the events that unfolded. I mean who gives their son $5000 to plan a wedding then a list of 200 guests they expect to be invited? Cough up some more dough or tear up the list!! And, I hated Amy's wedding. I wanted to cry for her. I hated her dress, I hated her reception, her buffet..and most of all her parents. I would have eloped. To be fair, I should read this again when I am engaged and I might change my mind. For now I give it a 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!!","review":"This book was absolutely hilarious!! I picked it up seeking a funny, light, enjoyable read after some of the heavier themed books I've finished, and I sure found it!This book zips right along, formatted as diary entries of Amy Thomas, whose friends it seems are all getting married, and going crazy. Amy vows never to become a crazy, delusional bride-to-be. But when Stephen her boyfriend proposes to her, things quickly start spinning out of control. Before she knows what's happening, she's second guessing her antique engagement ring, the way Stephen proposed, her wedding dress, and fighting in public about her bridal flowers!As soon I finished this book I IMMEDIATELY picked up the next one, Diary of a Mad Mother-To-Be, and am half-way through already. I highly recommend this book, it's fast-paced and VERY funny! A great book for future brides, married women, or anyone even remotely interested in weddings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"helps you through this huge transition","review":"I read this book while I was planning my wedding and it helped me laugh and see how silly I was being.

The heroine chronicles her days as a bride-to-be and her struggles to create the (almost) perfect wedding.Amy thought she was content with her single status. Constantly told that she wasn't the \\"marrying kind,\\" she came to terms with that fact and thought that she was perfectly happy with the relationship with her boyfriend Stephen. That is until he popped the question. In the course of a year, she made all of her wedding plans -- and watched how almost everything fell apart. She became the \\"mad bride-to-be\\" that she thought she'd never become. There were some very amusing moments in this novel.I had no idea that planning a wedding could take so much of your time and effort. In addition to supplying me with some laughs, it made me realize what I have to do on the day I become engaged: hire a wedding planner!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I absolutely love reading chick lit books. I read a lot of heavy stuff in school, so it's a nice escape. This book, however, was so incredibly boring that I didn't even want to finish. The main character was dull and the overall story, while a good idea, was not carried out very well. I didn't like the fiance, either. What a waste of a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Shower Gift!","review":"As long as this book is in print, I will be purchasing it, along with a placesetting of china, for all of the brides-to-be in my life.

I feel thats already been covered, so I wanted to point out, this DVD is not enhanced for 16X9. Anamorphic Widescreen is not part of this, so one will have to stretch the image, losing some resolution. On my TV, it looked like poo.

Some of the characters (that's what they are after all) are truly inspiring, but when you get down to it, commercial summit expeditions aren't really very interesting.

When the recipients tried to hook it up, it did not work (yes, they read the directions thoroughly and called the 800#). DynaDirect has such a restrictive return policy that there is no way a buyer could receive the product, hook it up, determine it doesn't work and return it within the 7 day return (from their shipping date) policy. Needless to say, the 7 days has passed to return it to DynaDirect and I can get no help to contact the manufacturer / warehouse / North Pole to get the unit replaced or repaired.

The range isn't nearly what was advertised. It says 150 feet, but I can barely get them to work across the room. It's even worse in a two-story house. God forbid if you want to have the transmitter downstairs and the speaker upstairs or outside. They are prone to hissing and popping and my set has an annoying, high-pitched whine. Even the slight motion can interfere with the signal. I should have returned them when I had the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the volume?","review":"I am disappointed with this wireless speaker because it just doesn't get loud enough. The average boom box can get much louder than this. It sounds fine at a low volume but when it is turned up the bass distorts and the housing hums and rattles. I returned the first one I received because it sounded awful, the second one is a little better, not much though.It would be OK to use this speaker indoors but outside it is useless unless you are within ten feet of it.Another disadvantage is that you have to manually tune it. Even a cheap cordless phone can automatically lock into the signal.There is foam rubber insulation inside the housing that may be pressed against the woofer cone. I had to open mine up and push it out of the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"No customer service...","review":"The product would work great if you have fresh batteries, otherwise the static takes over. I have lost my AC power adaptor for the speaker and was unable to find a replacement to fit the jacks on the speaker.

In other words, if I need an AC adaptor I should purchase another speaker.

This one is HIDEOUS. Designed for outdoor use?!? No way! As soon as you walk a SHORT distance outside,you lose the signal. Sounds substantial enough when it's only 10 feet from the transmitter, but who needs that? I'm embarrased that I bought it for a gift for someone. When I asked how it was performing, they said they must be doing something wrong. I read the instructions to the letter and it's still weak. Because I have some background with wireless, I tried it and realized that this speaker is garbage. I had cheap remote control cars as a child that reached greater distances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but only with batteries.","review":"I had the same problem as other reviewers with these speakers but tried to move them outside as another person suggested. Once I did that, they worked for a while. I found though that if you use batteries and not the AC adaptor, they seem to work just fine. It takes 8 C batteries though so prepare to spend some money on rechargables!Advent (aka RCA) need to shield these speakers from outside interferance for these to get a better review.Once they finally started working, they sound pretty good for a low-end speaker system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"This wireless speaker had a usable range of about 5 to 10 feet.

I even called tech support and they were no help."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work for me","review":"I like to think that I am at least fairly competant and can follow simple instructions. I purchased two advent speakers neither of these items would work. I spent about 45 minutes on the phone with tech support (Thompson provides the support for these units) the tech support was very patient and helpful but we still could not get the units to work. I returned both units and subsituded with a set of acoustic research wireless which work flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not travel through walls well","review":"If you're looking for a wireless speaker system that works well through walls then this is NOT the speaker you want. I bought it expecting it to work from my living room (where the transmitter was) to my deck (25 ft. away). If I moved the unit into the outside window line-of-sight to the transmitter then the speaker clarity was better. However, I was disappointed overall with the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"This item is exactly what we were looking for. Its range reaches over 100 feet into our back yard. Those who complain about range probably didn't read the manual throughly.

I never even heard the static. I tried various things to get it working but to no avail. I returned it(very easy to return with amazon by the way) and received another quickly.

I guess they require a better quality control to avoid exchanges.------------I followed the instructions step by step (as recommended by some reviewers), I installed the transmitter in a RCA out (fixed volume), turned on the home theater, waited until the red light was blinking on the transmitter, adjusted the frequency, turned on the speaker, adjusted the frequency, incresed the volume, all perfect. 2 minutes later, game over. I tried again numerous times, and I even called Advent Customer Support to see if I was missing something. After all the troubleshooting they confirmed that the speaker was dead, possibly due to an internal amplifier problem.I am giving it a second change. Returning the item tomorrow and expecting a replacement. I will update the review when I get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Throw Out the Packaging","review":"This wireless speaker system is practically useless. Multiple attempts at tuning, placement, retuning, both speaker and transmitter only resulted in increasing frustration. Static was constant. And this was while using the batteries. It didn't work at all while plugged into the AC. If I had not discarded the packaging it came in, it would have been the first return I made to Amazon. However, I didn't return the speaker system and doubt that I will ever use it. The Advent AW810 900 MHz Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Speaker System isn't worth five bucks. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"Being able to enjoy music with a wireless speaker is fantastic. The speaker is small enough to be innocuous but delivers pretty good quality sound.

We bought the second one because we were happy with the first one.They are great for parties when our guests are both indoors and outdoors. Farthest we've tried them is about 100 feet from the house, and they work fine. We use the provided power supply and have had no problem. They don't sound like a high-end speaker, but they are adequate. We recommend them to our guests that are surprised at how well they work outside.Also great when I'm in a different part of the house from the big stereo, but maybe someone wants to watch TV in the room where the stereo is. We just turn down the stereo volume in the main room and I take the speaker with me.Don't expect to easily find replacement parts thru the manufacturer, though.

Too bad, Amazon doesn't carry it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, do not buy this speaker.","review":"Although I own two indoor Advent wireless speakers which are excellent, this one is horrible. Constant static whether from a radio or CD. It has trouble tuning to the stereo although it used the same transmittor(755)as my indoor speakers. Actually it was closer to the stereo.

Never, ever got it to work, I'm very disappointed with this product and am returning it tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay far away! Zero stars","review":"Wish I read the reviews here more completely. This was a complete piece of trash. Like with others, the speaker would not play for more than 30 seconds at a time no matter what I did. After a while I could feel that the speaker was over heating so I left it unplugged. Sure enough it came back and played for another 30 seconds and then quit. It's going back to Amazon immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, too good to be true","review":"I had read the negative reviews that complained of this product ceasing to work shortly after receiving it, but figured I would roll the dice because the price was so good and I knew I could return it if it didn't work. Well folks, it didn't. It played for about 30 seconds and then quit. If I turned it off and then turned it back on, it would play for about five seconds before quitting. If I left it off for a long time, it would return to playing for 30 seconds before quitting. Really weird. I can't imagine what would make it do this. Regardless, I've returned it to Amazon, who also paid for the shipping.I gave it two stars because it sounded fine while it worked.

Here we go with the 'women are subjective and caring' and 'men are objective and task-orientated' tush yet again. If that is the case then my husband and I must be aliens because we behave in opposite ways to that which is described in this book. For all those who truly want to know how the men or women in their lives think, I've one piece of advice - ask them!

Night school, books etc. After listening to the first tape, I learn't more than I had ever done previously. I listen when I am ironing (the most boring job in the world!) I honestly believe this man is brilliant, however, I do have an issue with the students. The girl is clever, and obviously had a knowledge of Spanish at the start of the course (as did I) but the boy drives me mad. A previous reviewer said he was Asian - how did they know?. I would love to see photographs of the recording sessions so we could all put faces to them. That aside, I will continue listening to this brilliant teacher.

I can't beleive any company would put this type of product out and call it a true learning experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun and motivational","review":"I hadn't had Spanish for forty years, but it started coming back to me quickly when I heard Michel Thomas speaking it. I very much like his set-up with the two students he teaches. It allows me to work along with them and the pace is excellent. I listen to the tapes while I'm on my 30 minutes of treadmill per day and the times goes very fast. I find myself thinking about his phrases and tips throughout the day. What he teaches has been staying with me. I did, though, keep a pad and pen to jot down notes since there is no book that accompanies the tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe how bad this is!","review":"This is the most boring, slow-moving, patronizing product imaginable!

The content of the CDs may be good; however, there are a few things that may annoy you to the point where you can't focus on the lessons.I borrowed this from my library to listen to on my way to work. Because the main speaker (Michel Thomas) speaks at a low volume and with an accent, I was forced to turn my stereo up rather loud in order to understand what he was saying in English. This made it difficult to begin with. Then during every pause, Michel Thomas makes a noise with his mouth like he is swallowing. It is very noticable and really starts to get to you. I could only listen about 20 minutes before I had to turn it off for my personal sanity. It reminded me of someone who said \\"um\\" after every phrase.I am glad I previewed it from my library first, otherwise I would be upset that I spent so much money on something I could not listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frenchman Teaches Spanish","review":"I invested in this set based on the reviews and recommendations. I have been disappointed and have not gotten past the first CD simply because Michel Thomas sounds like a Frenchman trying to speak Spanish. I'm sure his teaching technique is fine, but his Spanish pronunciation is poor. I've had several years of Spanish in school in the past, and native Spanish speakers have told me that my pronunciation and accent are very good, so I hesitate to listen to 8 hours of Spanish with a French accent. I'd have to say opt for something else if you want to both learn the vocabulary and the proper speaking habits for Spanish."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all that it claims to be...","review":"I have wanted to learn Spanish for years, and finally on a whim ordered this CD set because it claimed to teach without drills and textbooks and to make learning Spanish fun. To my amazement, I found that I agree with all it claims to be! I've had so much fun playing these CDs in my car, that I look for excuses to drive around and do errands. I definitely plan to order the advanced set.As to comments by some other reviewers that Michelle Thomas is a bit of a character, and his two students as well... so true, but this is part of the charm of his approach! How intriguing to learn from a man with such a dramatic personal history... I feel like I'm sitting in class with an especially engaging language professor who has nothing on his mind except to teach his pupils Spanish and make it easy and fun.P.S. My teenage son created my the profile name \\"el skillz\\"... wonder if I should keep it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixed review","review":"If you can get by the male student who has absolutely no talent for learning another language, you will love these CD's. The method really works. After going through them the first time, I repeated them and realized how much I have learned about the structure of the language and how I had learned enough of the verbs and pronouns to start thinking in Spanish. As I said, the method really works. The male student, however, is so hopeless, he really gets annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible pronunciation","review":"From what I've listened to so far, this is the most horribly pronounced Spanish program I've ever heard. The Spanish is not spoken by native speakers, and one cannot even make allowances for the poor pronunciation by considering that it is a non-native who is speaking. This is Spanish spoken with a British accent. A British accent is lovely if you're speaking English in England. It doesn't fly well if one is making a real effort to learn to speak Spanish correctly and well. To add to this, listening to Michel Thomas, himself, is tedious and boring. Don't waste your money. Go for Pimsleur or Spanish Now! or Living Language. I am glad I only borrowed the CDs from a friend to preview them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review Thomas Course","review":"Michel Thomas was excellent. I have tried to learn Spanish for over 30 years in an on-again-off-again basis. This course allowed me to continue in my learning time frame and still improve dramatically. It greatly helped with pronunciation and why some little words like \\"a\\", \\"lo\\", and others appear in places in sentences that didn't make sense to me before I took this course. He explained present, future, and past tenses in such a way that I can now use them.The only problem I had with this product is that some of the discs were scratched which made it difficult to understand some of the things that were being said.

The reason this course is touted as being so easy is that so little is taught. The vast majority of the time is spent correcting the male speaker.

I've been relatively unshaken in my opinion. I enjoy their stuff, but it's just not really my thing. This album has changed my mind.With \\"Knuckles Up\\" I've realized just how unique and talented this band truly is. Not only are the lyrics excellent, worshipful and uplifting... but the music can be quite tenacious and fiery in it's own right. While I've always felt that the celtic elements took away from the aggression of the punk music, I believe this particular album has the perfect blend. I'm halfway talking myself in circles here... Suffice it to say that this is an impressive and quite noteworthy offering from a band I never fully appreciated or understood. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bagpipes! Mandolins! Guitars! Oh my!","review":"Knuckles Up is an awesome celtic influenced punk CD that most punk fans can enjoy. It's the band's third release and their strongest yet. If you're a Christian looking for a band to replace Flogging Molly or Dropkick Murphys... just listen to what you like! But if you're a fan of good punk music with a strong celtic influence and lyrics that emphasize on brotherhood and faith, than this CD is probably for you! Even if you aren't much of a fan of punk music, I would still recommend this CD, with songs about pirates, and even one about accidentally marrying someone of the same gender, it's just plain fun! You really can't go wrong with Knuckles Up, a fine release from a fine band! 5 Stars and best of luck for Flatfoot!Also, if you ever get a chance to see them live absolutely go do it!

I have read quite a bit of Christian fiction and sad to say a lot of it is mediocre, even though I always hold out hope for another Lori Wick, Francine Rivers or Beverly Lewis to come along. This book had a good plot premise but fell flat. It seemed a bit far-fetched to start off with having Mrs. O'Leary of Chicago Fire fame being one of the characters, and while I understand the concept of historical fiction, this took some big liberties. The dialog is too saccharine and trite, especially the endless 'mommy, mommy' by the little boy; and there is far too little depth in the descriptions of people and circumstances. I finished it, hoping it would get better but it was just too juvenile for me. Perhaps a teen audience would appreciate it better, although I can't say it seems like it was intended to be that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book stole my heart!","review":"I received this book as a gift, and don't usually read this type of book.

No one can express in words the profound, mystical beauty of this movement. Previously, my favorite performance was by Kempff, but the sound quality of this 60's recording leaves a lot to be desired now. I feel that I've been waiting impatiently for 40 years for someone to record this sublime masterpiece with contemporary recording technology in a way that does it justice as perhaps the most mind-boggling piece of piano music ever written. I'd like to add that every recording by Kovacevich of this nearly-complete collection of the 32 Sonatas has been extremely beautiful. (I think there are six left to go, including Les Adieux.)

It's about a writer who takes on the role of his detective character to investigate a mystery but this choice sends him down a path of obsessive madness. It blurs the line between reality and fantasy and even identity as the author of this tale finds himself changing roles, stories and overall identities. The voices coming out of objects and gradual changes and pullbacks were intriguing. That said, it's so cleverly done that I feel there wasn't enough of an interesting story here so I'd say it's worth a look for its overall cleverness but it isn't Sterling Silver quality for the tale.

The only con I can say about this is the top fabric is starting to peel away on the edges now. This is no problem because the fabric is getting dirty and should be replaced anyway.

The pads with patterns and things printed on them can cause a problem with some laser mice and I've run into that many times. The back surface is great and the thing I liked best was it wasn't to thick. Some pads have a really thick rubber base and that tends to raise the pad a bit to high for me. I have my mouse pad holder mounted to the left side of my KB on a center desk drawer and this pad nicely covers the whole surface and isn't to thick as my old one was. The darker color seems to have helped my tracking too. I've ordered two more of these, one for another computer's mouse and a spare. Really like this pad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets all expectations.","review":"This is a very ordinary mousepad, though the Belkin name at least assures you of decent quality for a mundane yet necessary item. It replaces a dirty, ink-stained, slightly smaller red mouse pad. My 5-star rating includes considerations of pricing and packaging along with Belkin quality. I've received similar pads that were all rolled up and misshapen so that they would fit into cheap packaging and require less postage. But as a Prime product, this two dollar mouse pad, rest assured, will arrive in a full and firm cardboard box. No unfolding, pressing, or ironing required before you're able to use it without agitation. The pad, moreover, is sealed in a Belkin cellophane wrap, making it a nice, inexpensive gift for a friend or associate on an otherwise overcast day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a Razer if you play video games.","review":"Within 2 days of receiving this mouse pad, the bottom edge of cloth that my palm rests on started to peel and come off the rubber pad. Once it gets bad, I plan to superglue it to the pad, which should keep it attached for much longer. The reason I am still giving this 4 stars is because it was literally just 2 bucks; no tax, no shipping. You can't beat that deal. For gamers, I'd suggest going with a Razer mousepad. Once this one starts to really wear out, I plan on purchasing a Razer.

After one month use these three mouse pads are honest to goodness worn out! The material has in that short period of time separated from the overly light foam backing/base. This mouse pad didn't last. That's about one mouse pad per week! At the same time I purchased the equally boring but much better quality productBelkin F8E089-BLK 8-by-9-Inch Mouse Pad (Black).

I was so excited to hear that this release was coming, and equally as disappointed to hear it.It is a soft hushed style of singing, with odd arrangements and often it feels like the orchestration drowns out her singing.Someone Else's Story is the one I was REALLY waiting for since Chess is my favorite musical, but sadly it is just as disappointing as the rest. To have a voice as powerful and as magnificent as Elaine's and then to not have it come across on the recording is puzzling.I never thought I could say this, but there is really no reason to get this CD. Her other music really stirs the soul but there is nothing on this CD that has this effect. The song selection was brilliant, but it was a wasted opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only TWO Songs Make This Mandatory...","review":"Ditto to ALL the negative comments you'll read from the other reviews here... but two songs make this a must-buy for any lover of Elaine Paige: \\"You Must Love Me\\" and \\"Someone Else's Story\\". And Thank God these are the only two songs where the orchestrations don't destroy the original melody. These songs \\"complete\\" the characters that Elaine originated on stage(especially for CHESS), and Elaine's vocals are just fine on both numbers. However, how she could destroy OTHER songs from shows she's appeared in(HAIR and SUNSET BOULEVARD in particular) is totally beyond comprehension. Outside an \\"Andrew Sisters\\" swing version of \\"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair\\", I don't think you'll be listening to this CD more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor arrangements & orchestrations","review":"Like a few other reviewers, I was really looking forward to hearing this CD based upon the excellent song lineup Elaine had chosen. Her Centre Stage double CD is a treasure, and I could just hear Ms. Paige deliver some definitive versions of these great showstoppers. However, this is a rotten album; the arrangements are off-beat, discordant, and distracting. As the CD played through, I kept hoping the next track would be better, but each successive song was just as unpleasant as the one prior. We waited two or three years for this mess? Sad. This was a real missed opportunity to deliver a superior collection of classics. What a bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lyrical Elaine Paige","review":"I listened to this CD more than 10 times after I bought it. I think Elaine's voice is still fine and sweet. She takes a different approach to these songs, more lyrical rather than dramatic. She chooses to use head voice to articulate high notes and the songs sound light and tender. But the lacking of big musically dramatic moments has certainly disappointed fans. I think the main problems here are the arrangement is too pop-like, and some songs sound like ballads in the 80's. When listening to them one can hardly relate those songs to the original musicals. Hope Elaine will never choose the same producer again in future, and hope it won't take long before another all-new material CD of hers is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare Synergy 15 Reel","review":"The reel seemed to work quite well last year when I used it about 5 times.

The movie is partially nararrated by Deanna herself as she recounts the story of how she found the orphans and brought them to America. It is very touching although it has a few comic twists. Barry Fitzgerald is his delightful self and causes her no end of trouble. In the end she is the proud mama of NINE war orphans and has found them a very charming daddy. We really enjoyed this film even though it wasn't Deanna's usual style. It showed us that she was certainly capable of playing a more serious role."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"I grew up watching Deanna Durbin with my mother and love all of her movies.This is one of my favorites.It is a multi-generational great movie and a must for anyone's Deanna Durbin Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Smashing, Wonderful, Five-Star . . .","review":"Pillar of Fire is very good.

I think I read the two in a day or two (I'm a voracious reader, and had a lot of time on my hands at the time, although I suppose it wouldn't have been much longer even if it was during the school year).

I have another recording of this piano played by Andreas Schiff but it was recorded before the piano was restored by David winston here in England .This recording is far superior and though the piano is now nearly 200yrs old you can understand why it was Beethoven prized possession , he even took it on holiday with him and even when he was given a new Graff piano he still kept his Broadwood .The copy I purchased though second hand was in excellent condition and has been played continuously since I received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Work the Purchase Price","review":"This video might be worth renting, but it is certainly not worth buying. This is not a criticism of Cher or her performance. As always, she is wonderful. It is a criticism of the video itself.First, the audio and video are mediocre. The video looks and sounds like an analog copy of a copy.Second, this really isn't a concert. It is made from excerpts of a few concerts, particularly the \\"Cher: Farewell Tour\\". In fact, I recommend just getting that video instead. It is a great concert film, available on Amazon for only a few bucks more, and free if you are a Prime member. It's also available on Netflix."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Casiopea / Japanese Jazz album ever","review":"I don't think anyone would dispute that this is Casiopea's best album ever (closely followed by two more of theirs like \\"Photographs\\" and \\"Makeup City\\").Casiopea is here at their best, at the apex of the career with a solid album; every single cut is a winner; and 5 of them hit the Jazz charts around the world in the early 80s like nothing we've seen out of Casiopea nor anybody else out of the vast Japanese Jazz world; cuts like:- Asayake- A Place in the Sun- Eyes of the Minda cut that you cannot find in any compilations of Casiopea, and that has become a true sought-after gem:- La Costa (with a superb Brazilian flavor) and ...- Space Road (Has the most infectious Batucada-Jazz by any non-Brazilian I've ever heard; absolutely fantastic)Minoru MukaiyaIssei NoroTetsuo SakuraiandAkira Jimbohad a superb talent and this is their best showcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scenic National Parks","review":"With the beautiful cover shot and Rand McNally name on the package, I thought I would be viewing fabulous, high-quality footage of our National Parks. Instead, I got \\"A Doug Jones Travelog Production\\" from the 1970's. The poor quality footage is dated and tired-looking, the colors are dull and the details are hard to see.

While, I thought I definitely overpaid at the time due to unnecessary issues, the event overall was fantastic. I loved the idea of Bruce and his family having to deal with a realistic problem and the dangers that arose from that.

It's a shame though, because they're supposedly out of stock now. Personally, I think they took their listing down because they found out that, factory sealed, this thing could sell on Amazon for over $100,,, because they didn't un-list it until I told them they were out of production. Me & my stupid big mouth... I could've bought the 5 they had left, without contacting the site owner first, and spent around $70 dollars only to sell them here & make over $500. Do me a favor and don't pay over $20.00 for this cd, because the sellers know darn well that they only paid 12 dollars & change. To make things even more crazy, these Amazon sellers are asking $50+ dollars for this thing... used. Again, the site I was talking of, AnimeKrazy, had it for $13 not too long ago... if you missed out, you missed out. But for darn sake don't pay $50 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality rewinder.","review":"I had one of these and I replaced it with a Gemini 2 way rewinder which is of a much higher build quality and runs more reliably than this one.

A series like this allows for some character development that is often not found in adult adventure fare.There are many of us who were hooked on the YA genre as our children went through this age group. When they stepped up to Dickens or Evanovich, we often returned to these books.So often they deal with social issues neglected by adult genre fiction and made deadly dull by the more \\"literate\\" novels. Meg Cabot's books are no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointing....","review":"When I picked up this book, I had high expectations because Jenny Carroll did a great job with her other book series, The Mediator.

This is the worst of all the soundtracks; I was expecting so much more. When they started this new season with this great new opening and the Cue to Begin song I thought wow. The music that is in the show is so much better than what they placed on the soundtrack. The mix that was chosen for Cue to Begin was a sad one and a major let down. The mix that is actually on the show is so much better and I guess that I was expecting to hear something similar.

It sounds like if someone made a greatest hits package of pretentious, mid 80's Euro-pop.

I don't mind this guy taking the credit if it means Marc's music gets listened to by a whole new generation. Looking at Amazon.co.uk, the track is to be released September 6th...wow can't wait.

This latest installment from season four is delving further into the strangeness mentioned. I was ready for upbeat, uplifting, power dance oriented motivational music. Instead, I got a bland, boring, Quaalude party downer of a CD. I'll never play it again. Okay, I KNOW that not all gay people like dance music, so if that's the case, then don't buy dance music CDs. QAF discs are supposed to be dance music as that's the whole scene of the show. I know there's other music out there, but it doesn't belong on a QAF disc.

Not only has this helped my marriage(which I have been looking to do for years), but it also helped my relationship with God...whom I had lost touch with long ago.I plan on giving these as gifts to as many people as possible. I also recommend \\"The Power of a Praying Woman\\" which is just as wonderful, if not more."},{"rating":"2","title":"True blessing","review":"I would recommend this book to everyone.

But reading this book and praying for my husband and my relationship following the guidelines in the book enabled me to find peace and a new and different love for my spouse.

It is for every wife who desires a marriage blessed by God and a closer relationship with her husband. It is backed by God's word. God truly uses this author to teach women about their relationships with their husbands. It is an especially effective tool which helps you to summarize your thoughts on different subjects and put them into your prayers. Whatever your concerns may be (health, fatherhood, etc.), Stormie has covered a variety of subjects.

I believe the sound advice and prayer suggestions would have saved me a lot anxiety and our marriage would have been stronger sooner!

Though praying the prayers she has written out word for word might not be your style - the content and Bible verses that accompany each are wonderful.Best of all, you don't have to take the time to read this book in full to start using it!

After years of counseling married couples the author discovered that men honestly believe sex is one of a man's basic needs. The bible in I Cor. 7:5 says not to \\"deprive each other\\" except by mutual consent for a time\\" so that Satan will not tempt you for your lack of self control. If your husband desires sex, as his only source for the rest of his life you should not scorn the idea that it is something he \\"needs\\" from you. As for the part about not praying together with your spouse, since the two of you are one flesh you have more prayer power together than apart. That said I don't think this book is for me, since I am a newlywed and haven't hit the point of any of the problems in this book. Also, if I had reached the point where a spouse was physically abusive or using drugs I can't ever say I would condone staying with that kind of man. I dated a man like that and I can only say \\"Run. Run like hell.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have read reviews that said God shouldn't be treated like a genie and I couldn't agree more. However, I do not get the sense that Omartian ever does this in her book. Her 30 day mini prayers are an invaluable guide for me when I am daily praying for my husband. Note: I said GUIDE, not incantation. I thought it was a great book from start to finish and a must for any woman's library that prays for her husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Wow I love this book I am reading it now and i think i will read it a million more times!

I read this book a few weeks into my marriage for preventative measures: I wanted to pray BEFORE the trials came! I also thought the prayers would change the little things that urked me about my husband. I was surprised to see that with each prayer (30 prayers= 1 per day), I saw myself changing! The Lord blessed me with more patience, more love, taught me to be a more loving wife, gentle, gracious, and not easily angered, ect. When I changed for the better so did my husband because he was reacting to my adjustments! Power of a Praying Wife teaches you how to pray Scripture over your husband and it's a powerful thing!

I recommend it to anyone the Lord brings into my path that complains about their marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"For divorcing women only","review":"As a new Christian bride, I was excited to begin a strong foundation in my marriage through God's word. I began reading this book and was discouraged that it was only applicable to women who are unhappy in their marriage and having serious problems. Once I got to the section entitled, \\"I don't even like him, how can I pray for him\\", I decided that this book was only applicable to women with serious marriage problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book for women to stay abused!!!!","review":"Thanks to this backward book that teaches women to not stand up for themselves and let a man verbally abuse them is the reason women will stay in bad marriages and teach their kids its ok to accept poor behavior. Its the life they were taught to live.I believe God wants children in safe positive healthy environments. A wife can pray and be a strong single parent without taking insults from an abusive or addictive husband bringing everyone down. Pray and care for yourself and your children and provide a safe happy home. Pray for the husband and pray he will seek therapy and learn to respect women.Stormie get a clue, women are not on this earth to cater to men and their every whim!I hope Stormie will one day donate her book profits to a women's shelter and pray for them, they have some very sad stories to tell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of A Praying Wife","review":"I bought this book as a gift.

I have already witnessed God working in our lives and our hearts. I look forward each day to spending time in prayer intervening for my husband. Though I prayed for my husband before, this book has helped me to pray more specifically and with more focus.

I read it though and I love it. I read one of the prayers every day. After going through the book in order, I now choose one based on what is going on in our lives. I think that this is good for those with marraiges in crisis and for old happily marrieds like us. The only draw back is that the prayers are interspersed with the discussion of the prayer, so you have to kind of hunt down the prayer you want for that topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power Of A Praying Wife","review":"This book has been more than effective for my almost three year marraige. The beggining, of the book, made me do a self examination, after that, I haven't been able to go a day without reading and having devotion, sometimes with my prayer partner and some times alone! Thanks so much, Stormie for allowing me and my friends to come into you and your friends lives! Wonderful! Excellent! If I would've purchased, this book prior to getting married, I would be a much better wife. I recommend this book to women who are considering getting married!

This is book for any woman, happily married or not. I received this book from a friend for Christmas. I haven't finished it yet, and have already suggested it to my church's Ladies Outreach program. This book has taught me, with the help of my Bible, to pray and clear my heart so that I may better pray for others. It says in the Bible that if you have unconfessed sin in your heart, your prayers won't be heard. Stormie has brought to light the fact that we, as the women and the heart of the family, need to pray for ourselves and clear our heart of unconfessed sin. She teaches us that is important to pray for ourselves. Only by doing so are we able walk closer with the Lord. When our walk with the Lord is right, then it only stands to reason that other relationships in our lives will go better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner of Stormie's Books in my Opinion.","review":"I love this book because it helps you remember to cover ALL of the things you can pray for when it comes to your man and his needs or wants and/or his weaknesses whether you know them or not.

The best part is being able to reread the chapters you need. I copy the prayers and post them everywhere.

It's easy to understand and apply. The chapters are short and to the point. You will move through the book quickly. While reading you will think of other topics that fit your situation so remember to jot those down. She uses personal examples to show how God answered her prayers which I found very encouraging.I printed a blank calendar from the internet and wrote in one topic to pray for each day of the month. I've used this method for the last few years and have added several additional topics. I feel a wonderful peace knowing I've covered my husband in more than 30 different areas every month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praying Wife","review":"This is an excellent book for all wives to read.

I have also gone through her book Power of a Praying Parent which is also a great read for women with children of any age.Power of a Praying Wife is a book that you can go through again and again and get something different and profound out of it every time. This book is filled with situations that women have gone through and have had remarkable results with the power of Prayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Struggling traditional conservative marriages","review":"I committed to praying through this book. The Holy Spirit has used it in some ways to speak to me. But, mostly I find it advocating a type of marriage that I do not see in scripture. This book is geared to marriages that place wives as the submissive server in the family not the equal helpmate. This book is based on an extremely conservative traditional view of marriage. Also, this book is geared towards people who are harboring anger and resentment toward their spouse. I was looking and hoping for a book that would be able to be used in a marriage full of love and vibrancy. This is not that book. BUT, I do think at times she brings up good points and did feel like parts of it spoke to me. This book is best for a conservative submissive wife struggling to love her husband."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Esther Season","review":"I am not yet married, but for the last eight years I have dedicated myself to allowing the Lord to mold me into the woman and wife I will be for my Boaz. I realized too many wait to prepare for their walk in marriage and the outcomes were tragedies. I believe if the Lord has called me to be a wife then I need to learn to walk in the charateristics now. This book has taught me how to build a habit of praying and learning how to discern specific areas to cover my husband. I have also become more intimate with the Lord as He changes me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the hype?","review":"I purchased this book BECAUSE of all the excitement and was quite disappointed.

A friend of mine suggested this book and as I began to pray for him, I realized that I was praying for myself as well and in turn became closer to the Lord. I have now been able to see into our marriage with spritual eyes and not worldy eyes and we are much closer and the Lord is healing us both.The book is great because you are given sample prayers and sometimes we do not know what to pray or don't want to pray anything at all. The devil's goal is to break up the home in any way he can, this book enables a woman to battle with the Lord's help.I pray at least four prayers a day, even when \\"all is well.\\" I can sense and feel the prayers working in his life.

I have recommended this book to many friends and will continue to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of a Praying Wife","review":"I ordered the Afrikaans version of this book in the latter half of last year. Before even having received the book my husband told me he was moving out. I received the book two weeks later and even though we had started divorce proceedings, I started reading the book as I loved my husband dearly. Every chapter was very moving, inspiring and so focused on the real issues. It translates into words so many feelings which I so often found difficult to put into words. My husband came to me six weeks later and said we must try again. I truly believe that the \\"Power of a Praying Wife\\" is what gave me the hope to focus on what I believed in (that God meant for us to be together). I believe the book showed me a new way of 'living' my belief to the extent that my husband's eyes and heart were opened!

I looked at the table of contents I got turned off immediately. I decided to skim through a couple of pages and that convinced me; this book can help me, I made a right choice after all. The prayer that comes after each chapter was very helpful to me, it showed me how to prayer, I'm not one to prayer openly but this book help me decipher what I should prayer about, when one is in the heat of battle one cannot think straight much less pray the right prayer, where its said he/his/him meaning husband I changed that to me and found that I can prayer with faith and claim God's promises.

The characters never developed so that I could care for them. The story was also peppered with annoying little historical inaccuracies. While starting off well, the story quickly collapsed.

The characters don't have much much depth, and the book may contain some historical inacuracy. Two Georgia teenagers are discussing the fame of \\"General\\" Sheridan during the summer of 1862. Colonel Sheridan's promotion to brigadier general did not happen until September 13, 1862 (although it was then effective back to July 1, 1862). Maybe the kids were psychic? There is also a reference to an inscription on a silver cross belonging to a dead child that is dated 1948. Back to the future once again. Seems to me this book was rushed to press to capitalize on the success of books like Cold Mountain. At $24.95 for a paperback, the price is too steep for the contents. Is it a good book? Maybe.

My film was not great, however it did pay homage to what I thought was one of the greatest horror...forget that...One of the greatest MOVIES ever made. It had everything. Well everything except a good script and excellent acting. The Crimson Executioner is probably one of my favorite film characters of all time. Sure it was stupid, but this film was fun. The fodder for the bad guy were horrible...You had to cheer for the Executioner. What would make this film better? A sequel!!!.. It screams for a sequel. It screams for a viewing. Watch it! Savor it!

How could the Academy overlook this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Hargitay fanatics only","review":"Bodybuilder-turned-actor Mickey Hargitay made a number of films - mostly low-budget Italian productions - from the late '50s through the early '70s. In Bloody Pit of Horror, he plays Travis Anderson, a reclusive actor who thinks he's the reincarnation of the Crimson Executioner, a crazed sadist from the Middle Ages whose castle Anderson now occupies. Hargitay's ham-fisted performance may be one of the most unintentionally funny in the history of cinema.

The best is in the final torture chamber scene, where we got (a) a hanging babe with hot tar poured on her back, (b) two spinning babes whose bras are threatened by adjustable blades and (c) a face-down reclining babe riding an oven. Zero nudity, all naughty bits carefully hidden.

It sounds to me like she's back to her Candy Coated Waterdrop days, but with more edge. I'm a traditional metal/hard rock listener, so honestly, I don't listen to too many \\"Christian\\" artist. Plumb is the exception for me though, because she truly does her thing and does it well!Tiffany seems to put more elements into her music using traditional instruments, but adding strings, piano, etc. This gives her music more than just the basic cookie cutter, one dimensional sound. I commend her for staying true to her sound and for what she does. It seems to me that there are alot of us that respect her for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexual Abuse","review":"Hey the first 3 CD's I had of Plumb I liked but couldn't stand to listen to. Then in a counseling session for sexual abuse, my counselor played \\"Damaged\\" the Revised edition. I started bawling because then I realized what the message was on the CD. I realized why I didn't like her songs to much: they made me realize my pain. I used to listen to Rob Zombie, and Marylin Manson, then I became a Christian. I realized I had a problem and didn't know why. This song helped me realized that you can find true love. (I have a WONDERFUL GOD GIVEN HUSBAND!)Also that just because of what happened to you in the past doesn't mean God has left you. He loves you and will help if you want Him too. I was abused at 5, almost raped at 14, and raped at 17. All these men claimed to be \\"Christians\\", obviously they weren't.

It would be unfair to compare Ms Price to Loreena Mckennitt or Enya, she has a style of her own that cannot be compared to any other. However, if you love Loreena and Enya, you will absolutely love Kate Price...she is in the same league of talent and spirituality.

I believe I was looking for Loreena McKennitt albums, and on a whim I listened to samples from Kate's CDs. I was immediately hooked.Deep Heart's Core has some very nice tracks, but it doesn't quite have the polish of Isle of Dreaming. Kate's vocals are lovely and her hammer dulcimer is haunting, but I feel like this CD relies a bit too much on the sitar, and it doesn't take advantage of the beauty this instrument can add to music.I do love her style, and this CD is a good buy, but only if you also buy Isle of Dreaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete surprise","review":"This album brought me such peace of mind.

He imagines his own demise and tells us about it, as he imagines that the village itself is haunted by the ghosts of those who have gone before him. He, like many others he tells us about, has slowly lost his mind, the solitude has gotten to him. Llamazares' novel is eerily entertaining, moody, evocative, with a touch of the gothic.

For beginners, I suggest Scott Cunningham's Solitary Practicioner (both books), the Farrar's Witches Bible Compleat, the Campanelli's Wheel of the Year, or Raymond Buckland's big blue witchcraft step-by step instructional (his wiccan history is fairly accurate too!). Also reading the Witches God/Goddess by the Farrar's is also a good suggestion for the cyclical nature of Wicca. Reading a book from the mythology or anthropology section of Amazon.com is preferable for an educational background. However, if you leave out the poor history, Ms.McCoy's ritual ideas and receipes are pretty good. I have her Maiden, Mother,Crone book and the meditations are excellent.

In my opinion, it is well-written, informative, and instructive on a level that most anyone should be able to understand. Edain McCoy is one of the best writers on pagan subjects around and anyone who is relatively new to paganism, or just studying about it, couldn't do much better for a knowledgeable, sympathetic, and patient teacher.

Just some of the recipes and activities seemed to not really fit with the holidays they were listed under. Other than that, it is a great book for ideas, recipes, and activities to do for each of the holidays. It does contain historical information about how each holiday came about, it's significance, if it's being celebrated today and more. It reads really nice like a regular book or manual. I'd recommend as a resource book for anyone from beginner to master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank the Goddess for Edain","review":"This book is among my favorite pagan books.

It has near to no weight behind it (making it liable to shifts in position with even a small gust of wind from a nearby fan), the texture is unpleasantly rough and cheap feeling, and the red color is not even close to vibrant as I had hoped but rather is dull and depressing.

Of course with added features there are added things that could break. So far the yo yo seems durable. And because the kit includes extra string and oil for the ball bearings, there is some allowance made for potential breaking.So here's the bottom line:Pros:Very pretty with the flashing LED lightsYo yo moves smoothly with the ball bearingsLong stringExtra string and oil includedTrick DVD incoludedCons:With more \\"technology\\", there is more chance for breakage.All the \\"extras\\" don't really make the yo yo work significantly better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, Illuminated Yo-Yo","review":"I'm not all that experienced with Yo-Yo's myself, but the Yomega Lightbeam comes as a nice, high-quality package with an instructional DVD, extra string and lube pen to keep it spinning. The ball-bearing system obviously keeps it spinning longer than your traditional yo-yo (even a novice like me picks up on that) and while the LED's seem like just a gimmick, they do make you more apt to pick it up and give it a whirl. It makes a great gift to those who know their way around a yo-yo and enough to capture the curiosity of those who aren't (I've caught my wife playing with it three times now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could sleep longer - but still works very well","review":"Good weight, light display is awesome and the stock cord that this YoYo ships with is sturdy.

Its main feature is that it lights up! It is sure to amaze the kids and even the simplest tricks, if done in low light or the dark, will look great. I'm no master but the few tricks I do know and pulled off in a dim room made for a great light show. Kids always want to use yo-yos no matter how small they are and be warned. A yo-yo can be dangerous for young kids. Also since the strings are quite long and kids are short not many of then can use them properly. I think a 7 year old, with motivation could perhaps get the hang of it. A box to stand on could help. Shortening the string works but lessens what the yo-yo can do. Still for anyone who loves yo-yos or is just getting started, this is a eye opener. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good yoyo but not for impatient beginers","review":"Ok, this yoyo is a bit pricier than the $3 one at Walmart but you're buying a solid, quality yoyo with the instructional dvd so it's really worth the price difference. If your child/spouse/friend is willing to give this toy a solid go of it, it's a great little yoyo. The light flashing makes it more attractive and it's really neat at night. It actually returns easily unlike those cheap junky dollar store ones, so it's less frustrating and you're willing to keep trying and practicing a bit longer. If you're looking for a nice, solid yoyo, this is definitely it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Update of an Old-Fashioned Toy","review":"I'd had a yo-yo when I was a kid, but could never do much with it. Eventually, I lost interest in trying to learn.

Instead, he loved the lights and how the yo-yo actually returned. (I couldn't master that at all when I was a kid, which might explain why my yo-yos always wound up in the trash after a few days.) Before long, he'd popped in the DVD and started teaching himself some of the more advanced tricks. And not many days after that, he was showing off to the neighbor kids who were also impressed with the cool light patterns and ease of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lot of fun, if you're into this.","review":"I have never gotten a Yo Yo that came with oil. But this thing is really technical so I think its needed. I mention this first in my review because I think you should decide if you want a yo yo that needs to be oiled now and then. It also comes with an extra string.So this thing is quite serious, before you even get to the ball bearings.The light show helps to bring users into the 21s century, we are all used to being dazzled a bit more than the kids of yesteryear.The DVD is good quality, but, DVDs can only show you some ideas on what to do.

The first 33 pages contain an introduction and very basic cooking facts along with how to store food in the fridge. In keeping with the nutritional component of the cookbook, honey is used in the majority of the published recipes. As someone who rarely uses any kind of sweetener in cooking, I found the use of honey to be a bit too much ex: honey in tomato sauce. From an artistic perspective, The cookbook itself is lovely.

Repita el error de que la RV1909 fue hecho para volver la Reina-Valera al Textus Receptus. Eso es falso, los mismos revisores decian que su Biblia era basada en el texto de Westcott y Hort. La 1865 fue basada enteramente en el TR, no como dice esta Biblia. Fue la Versión Moderna, hecho por H.B.

As I read the book, my excitement palled and has become dismay. I find it, though somewhat informative--at least the names of prominent medievalists are given--generally a venomous reflection on those with whom Cantor did not agree. His ascription of venal motives to a number of historians, particularly the Annales school, is not an objective assessment of their contributions to historiography. Were this book billed as a personal polemic, it would be correctly labeled. One may gain some insight into the construction of Medieval history, but if one lacks any prior introduction to the subject, this is NOT the book for them"},{"rating":"2","title":"The title was apt","review":"It's unfortunate that some people see part of a title and not the full title of a book. I thought this was a great book. It was interesting reading. I started it out with initial doubts, next thing I know I'm halfway through the book. Once I started reading, I realized he was trying to answer three questions: 1) want current events affected the historian's point of view towards his research, 2) how was the historian influenced by his peers 3) what goals did the historian hope to reach during his life. It was obvious that current events influence all of us, as much as our peers do. But what constitutes a good or a bad historian?

However this book explains why it isn't a great strategy.I liked the short and to-the-point nature of the book. It is well written and easy to read. My only beef with the book was that it's a little outdated and I found myself wanting more explaination of more current companies.

Characters occasionally make abrupt decisions that seem to have no basis in reason, but are necessary for the story's progression.

It is hard enough, having to fight to understand all of the profound and complicated non-english words. Williams felt it was better to leave his explanation of these words to the end of the book, so when you finish reading and are completely lost you can only begin to start understanding what the essay writers meant to say. The essays themselves are no more than information presented in a very non-appealing and very text-book like manner.

Come to think of it, she held her own against Ralph and Ward.Great story! Ralph even sings a bit. (I wonder if that was really his voice - anybody know?

I love the banter between the family and staff and it is easy to recognize that the staff is actually part of the family in many ways. Seeing social lines blurred by the war and permanently changed afterwards is fascinating. The characters are endearing and you are left hanging for season 3. Hugh Bonneville does his usual stellar performance and Maggie Smith gets more lovable by the episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch for free","review":"You can watch this for free on Pbs.com, save some money.

It's wonderfully written and superbly acted, you fall in love with each character. I look forward to watching this again and again. Looking forward to the next season."},{"rating":"2","title":"No matter your preference, HD, DVD, or other, see all episodes","review":"Series two of Downton Abbey is as good as the first. It picks up in Nov of 1916 where series one ended. The entire series concludes in Dec of 1919--and already there is production for series 3, a continuation but in the 1920s. There are plenty of cast members back so it is advisable to watch the first prior to the second, but not mandatory for entertainment. You will be as enthralled as the true series of comparison, the amazing dramatization of Brideshead Revisited. Both are period perfection, a look at British life in the war years, some intense suspense and mystery mixed with bits of serenity and romance. It's the WWI years with all the good and the bad, but the acting and writing make it all seem good somehow, at least from an entertainment point of view.I'd strongly recommend the full series, even the past series one, and of course I'll be purchasing Series Three as soon as it is available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Masterpiece!!!!!","review":"This is truly a classic that we will watch more than one time!~ I have purchased Season 1 and season 2 and can't wait for Season 3!

Season 1 came through crystal clear so why there is a difference with Season 2 I don't know...maybe because these are the original UK versions (the only thing available at present - my Season 1 is the US version)? Judging by the other reviews I am the only one who has experienced this, so maybe it is my computer although I doubt it since everything else I watch is fine.

I was so excited to learn that when I bought my Kindle Fire and my Prime membership that I got both seasons free. Once I started watching I was hooked. I wish there was more quality television like this. The actors are amazing, the writing is brilliant, the setting is magical, and the story is positively addictive.

I hope it lasts as there are very few programs left which I enjoy watching with my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is truly great television...","review":"My wife and I love this show. We're completely addicted. After watching the PBS version of the first few episodes on TV, we went to order the blu rays. When I saw that there were two different versions and the comments about them, I ordered the UK versions. They are SO much better than the PBS version. Some plot points are even missed in the edited PBS version. You also get to see a lot more of the house, which is so beautiful, in the UK version. The only comment I would make is that this particular version of the blu ray does not appear to have the Christmas special. However, the same seller I purchased from had the UK version of that for $26, not the $50 of another version. Anyway, enjoy, but know that if you want EVERY drop of Downton Abbey goodness, you'll have to order Christmas at Downton Abbey separately. That's also the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do NOT miss this series!","review":"We are long time enthusiasts for the Masterpiece series and this is one of their best efforts! This is the new \\"Upstairs/Downstairs\\" which was one of the most watched and loved series in England. The characters are well played and although not an \\"action\\" genre series, keeps one on the edge of one's seat, hoping for the best outcome, fearing for the worst!

I watched the first and second season in less than a week.First of all, the cinematography is brilliant. Downton, the home and village the show is set in, is actually filmed at Highclere Castle in Great Britain. In the midst of WWI, the war scenes are gripping, and most definitely in the same caliber as the rest of the show. The costumes, slowly evolving as the 1920s style take-over begins.The plot, as dramatic and gripping as ever, thickens as some of our favorite characters go off to war. The seasons are short by American standards, but at a solid 50 minutes each, I can't complain. No novel can compare to the sensory overload this beautiful show offers. It is classic you will want in your personal library. I recently went back and rewatched season 1, it kept me on the edge of my seat for the second time! I can't recommend this series enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIC. The best BBC mini-series ever.","review":"This is BBC at its very best. I used to watch Upstairs Downstairs decades ago. This is similar, the lives of the aristocrats upstairs vs the lives of the servants downstairs. Exceedingly well acted. I am a little hearing impaired and find it hard to make out all the words because of the British accents, but the DVD has English subtitles. Rush out and buy it. I have already pre-ordered the next season, season 3, which will ship in late Jan, 2013 (Amazon, of course.) This is the best of the best of the best.

Too many storylines exist just for drama, producing unbearably maudline scenes, whereas opportunities for real drama were constantly passed up.

As much as I like many of the actors/actresses in the cast, the writing is average at best and the characters too variable and inconsistent to sustain an engaging drama.

Downton Abbey is used to house convalescent soldiers and the women of the house find themselves doing useful work.This season has plenty of excitement and progresses nicely from the beginning of the war through to 1920 and we see history shaping the way the world works for the characters.

I have to reiterate because I say it in all my reviews, Amazon is the best when it comes to availability and price."},{"rating":"2","title":"downton abbey","review":"I think this is one of the best series I've watched in a long time. I bought the first season on a special with amazon not knowing it was a series. I probably would not have purchased it if I had know it was a new series. I would have waited until it was into the third or fourth season. But after the first season I was hooked. The only draw back is waiting for the next season.

What started as a crisp and intricately woven drama has deteriorated into a clownish soap opera. None of the characters bear anything other than a superficial resemblance to their \\"higher selves\\" in season 1. What initially had me completely captivated, now makes me wince."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downton Abbey Looks like it would be a great series if I could watch it on Amazon","review":"Tried to view Downton Abbey and several other shows, I could not even get the preview to load, left a preview loading for a half hour, or more fixed and ate dinner came back and it was at the same spot for a preview I have not idea how many days we would have to wait for an hour show.

If you like adult drama set in the early, 1900s, I'd recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upstairs/Downstairs Redux","review":"It is easy to form an addiction to this frothy soap opera of early 20th century English lives! The costumes and the set design are scrumptious. One could wish for a bit more of the history and politics (you'd better already know it, to have a real context) but \\"The History Channel\\" this is certainly not! However, the densely-plotted story lines - while admittedly overwritten - keep you hopping from one richly-drawn character to the next. Our favorite character is the dowager duchess played acerbically by Maggie Smith; she herself is worth the price of this set!It is wonderful to have the entire season in one package, with no commercials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a fabulous show!","review":"I was told by many that I would love this show since I love period books.

Great, yes, it's a great series.A great cast partially filmed in an historic great English \\"house\\". It's worth the watching just to see the marvelous Maggie Smith posing as a Victorian/Edwardian grand dame, \\"wise cracking\\" her way through scenes with looks that could kill all on their own.In the reality of the day did Isis Lord Grantham's dog actually have the \\"run of the house\\", tagging along beside him in scene after scene? Did they really have four legged house pets in a place like \\"Downton Abbey? Wouldn't the dog have been confined to the stable, and the grounds when a hunt was on? I mean after all for less than 20 Old English Pounds Sterling a year Grantham's seemingly beloved dog could have had a valet of his own to look after him! (about $80.00 in early 1920's US money!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new addiction!","review":"I have friends that have watched Downton since it began. I watch so much other TV, I couldn't see taking on more. However, after feeling left out of the loop and folks having to tiptoe around giving spoilers away (since they were trying to talk me into watching it), I finally decided to catch it on-line. I am SO glad I did. I find it interesting to see how the two classes intermingle and how the bridge between them is closed by life events. Tragedy, happiness, fun, so many elements wrapped into one show. I love the little quips that \\"Granny\\" comes in with from time to time! Very well written and the cast seems to work well together."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am watching the second season right now on Instant Video for free","review":"Great show.

I'm really pleased and would buy it again, can't wait for season 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social class, world history, and a soap opera all in one!","review":"What I like best about Downton Abbey is the acting and the social history it opens up to my child, who isn't familiar at all with any of it. And of course, it's done in a most entertaining way - entertaining enough to keep an 11 year old intrigued. What I like least is the script's tendency to devolve into soap opera, but I think many people, including my child, love this aspect. The actors themselves are not in the least deficient!The costumes and setting are glorious. The streaming experience here is not as good, however, as it is on a streaming platform with which most of you are more familiar. I think Amazon will iron out the kinks, but the viewing experience for Season 1 was seamless, while our new source, here, is rather clunky and not invisible at all. I'm sure this must be something Amazon is working on. We look forward to continuing to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey done well","review":"The program is an excellent story and is an adventure to look forward too. I hope that season three will come soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing!","review":"Everyone else seems to have said all of the good stuff. I just love this series.

This is the best series to come along in a long, long time!

But my sister and I sort of monopolized it (oops) while we were at home together for the holidays and had watched the first season via Netflix. When they didn't have season 2, we freaked out and immediately queued it up on Amazon. I don't have Prime so I just paid for it.

I truly enjoy the roller coaster of interactions the characters have with one another. Tension is created between them, then resolved then created again and the witty humor gives a lovely lift at the right time during the stories. I thoroughly recommend this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"need your help/cracked DVD","review":"I ordered the Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Seasons 1 and 2 for my 89 year old mother.

When I choose to return it I was not given the option to have it replaced. I want the season 2. I cannot find anywhere on Amazon to contact customer service so I decided my only option was to write a review. The product is great if part of it wasn't broken. Amazon is great except that now I cannot figure out how replace this defective disc only return it. Will someone please contact me about this?

It was frustrating to try and find out if this season 2 UK edition really did have \\"special features\\" included. I looked through most of the comments and could not determine if it really did have any included along with the special Christmas episode. Of course Amazon description said that there were no special features. I was also frustrated with the price bouncing around from $26-$29 within an hour or less. As a result, I finally went to Target, found out it did have special features and got it for about $26."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the movie but instant play not good.","review":"i love this series but when playing instantly it kept stopping and i had to reload to be able to finish the episode. i know it is amazons connection because my netflix works perfectly fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erroneous information","review":"Contrary to two reviewers' published comments, this version -- the UK version -- does NOT include the Christmas episode.

I was recently introduced to the goings on of the Crowley family and was so taken by the whole story that I ended up watching the entire first two seasons (every chance I could get) within a week. When I'm watching it, I forget that it's just a series for television. The quality feels like a blockbuster movie. Every last detail draws you in from the superb acting to the location's beauty and sullenness. Feels so realistic. If you are a fan of Historical Fiction such as Pride and Prejudice and the like, you will definitely want Downton Abbey to be your new TV addiction! Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We need more seasons.","review":"Naturally this is fantastic. Maggie Smith alone is reason to watch any program. The rest of the ensemble cast sparkles. True to it's English origins it rivals Upstairs, Downstairs. You can see the depths of English theater in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Love, Genuine LOVE!!","review":"Even though this is JUST a soap opera, I am in genuine love with Downton Abbey. I think Season #1 got even better, and more over the top, with even the old trope of someone (sort of) coming back from the dead! (Sorry, guess I should have given a spolier alert...haha.) Anyway, the cast is an absolute dream, which their multiple Emmy nominations and wins prove. You have to give it an episode or two to let it get under your skin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"super good","review":"you can't beat this product for the price from any where on line or off. i will tell all my friends about this deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"Downton Abbey is one of the best PBS series I have seen.

I love how the series covers large amounts of time, skipping weeks and months ahead after each episode. The drama is subtle and believable, allowing me to analyze characters much like I do real people. I didn't love season two as much as season one because the war theme was quite depressing. Also, I have come to the conclusion that the main story line is somewhat copied from Gone With the Wind which is a little disappointing.

Not much was cut!","review":"We fell in love with Downton Abbey last year, and were so happy that PBS picked up the 2nd season of this British series. Imagine our delight at finding an uncut version?We had heard swirling rumors that they \\"dumbed it down\\" for the American audience, so we were most anxious to see what had been cut.We are not ready to begin the 4th episode, and so far we see very very little additional footage. Maybe a sentence or two in some conversations, maybe an extended view of an outside scene, a few seconds here, a few seconds there.So while I personally Enjoy the little extra bits, it's probably not worth purchasing if you already own the version shown in America, you have missed nothing so far in the way of storyline or even deeper character development.I give the whole series five stars, but I am giving this marketing scheme 4 stars, deducting one for getting my hopes up and giving me nearly nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful series . . .","review":"You won't be disappointed . . . unlike most serial dramas, this one is fast paced and although there is certainly a continuing thread throughout the series, most specific stories are resolved in individual episodes. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey is the best!!","review":"What a great series!!

Maggie Smith is always wonderful of course and the rest of the cast is so believable although I don't know if any are well known artists in England. I watched the entire series on my PC with a 25\\" HD monitor and thought the reception was beyond complaint. A previous viewer mentioned the reception was badly pixellated on a 32\\" television. I do not know what level of equipment or internet reception this person has but my picture was clear to the point of appearing nearly 3D. I love the streaming video from Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"I loaned my copy of Season 2 to a friend who does not want to give it up...so being a good friend, I ordered another copy for myself.

I got all caught up and am now waiting till each Sunday evening to watch the show as it airs on PBS. You probably don't have to watch all the past episodes to enjoy the show, but I would recommend it. They build the characters nicely - you love some and hate others. Also, besides the idea that the Earl and his family are very benevolent people (most wealthy folks of this era were not), the show seems to recreate the model and image of the classes in early 20th century England with historic accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"Found this series this past winter and fell in love with the characters and the story.

The acting is superb, the scenery and costumes are beautiful, the story captivating. It is the first show since Upstairs, Downstairs that my husband and I both enjoy equally. To think that Mitt Romney would have done away with funding for PBS, is frightening. You can't compare quality television like this with the inane prime-time shows.It's very scary to think that a show like Life with the Kardashians or Jersey Shore could draw a greater audience than a gem like Downton Abbey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series.","review":"This is such a great way for Prime members to catch up on previous episodes.

The story lines became more and more facile and unbelievable, the characters less and less interesting -- it absolutely generated into bad soap opera. After the first year's stellar quality, it was (or should have been) an embarrassment.I know others have already begun watching season three, but I have no intention of spending another moment -- wasting any more time -- on this series. Once a series loses its way in such a disappointing and ruinous way, I doubt that it will regain its footing. I suspect that is why the magnificent Dame Maggie Smith is leaving after this season -- I wouldn't want to be associated with it anymore, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged upon delivery","review":"The show itself is great and we are enjoying the series, but unfortunately the DVD disks were damaged when they arrived, with significant skipping and tracking issues.

Season 2 devolves into a bad soap opera with repetitive, nonsensical, underdeveloped plots. I don't think I've ever had such a drastic change in opinion of a show. If you want a good historical drama with complex, compelling, and relevant themes rather than simple soap opera drama watch Deadwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffering at just the not right moments!","review":"Clear quality.

I just watched Season 1 episode 1 again, and I admit I am bewildered wondering what happened? What were the writers thinking? What audience did they produce Season 2 for? Downton Abbey Season 1 began as an intelligent, cerebral show and it has become an insipid, silly soap opera with ridiculous plots. For shame. Such amazing acting talent wasted on such stupid scripts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing after Season 1","review":"I was very excited to watch Season 2 of Downton Abbey after such a great Season 1. Unfortunately, the great writing of the first season was not carried on. By episode 3 of season 2, Downton Abbey completely falls apart as a series. The plot lines and character behavior become improbable, erratic, nonsensical and incredible. It's a shame because the show had such great potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"No CC","review":"No closed caption option. For a deaf consumer like me. I can't even return the order. It is not fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series, but no subtitles","review":"Downton Abbey is a great series, but the version supplied by Amazon was useless to me asit did not provide for subtitles. I am hard of hearing and require subtitles for assistance, especially with the English accents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Season - Difficult Connection","review":"I very much enjoyed this season of Downton Abbey. My low rating has to do with the difficulty in connection and control of this purchase. I interfaced with the Amazon site both directly with my PC and indirectly with my Roku box and both options proved incredibly difficlut. The Roku box lost total control of the movie play features and the PC lost partial control. This is not an issue when connecting with other movie providing sites. Either their instructions for how to make this work are insufficient or the response from the Amazon site is poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 2 character development was dissapointing","review":"I do not watch TV but caught season 1 on Amazon on a whim and was drawn in by the characters. I was surprised that I cared about how the character fared, in part because the development was believable and there were some characters that had a sense of honor that was refreshing and worth rooting for.2nd season was a disappointment. The character development was not believable as some of the characters acted quite inconsistently with who they were in the first season without adequate explanation. The first season was more subtle and gentle/kind but the second season had jarring events and behavior thrown in just to get a reaction. The subtle depth and rhythm of the first season was rend apart by the 'cheap shots' taken in the script. It did not feel authentic.Quite dissapointed and won't bother with season 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey is Fabulous!","review":"This show was recommended to me by my sister. I watched the first episode of Season 1 and I was hooked. I watched the first two seasons in about two weeks.

LOVIN' IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece: Downton Abbey (Season 2)","review":"Hafta congratulate Amazon for putting Season 1 on the Prime free list --- Masterpiece is just that: a masterpiece of production, writing, acting, directing, etc. as applies to offerings of theatre works. I became so engrossed with the characters and story line in Season 1 that there wasn't a thought to not purchasing \\"rights\\" to view Season 2. I was fish in a barrel, as it were, not very challenging to land as a customer of Season 2. Hope there's a Season 3 in the offing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"This is a thoroughly entertaining series.

I look forward to Season 3 with great anticipation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother???","review":"I watched season one for no charge with Prime. But buy season two when Amazon does not support my iPod or iPad and other guys HD offering that does works on iOS is 20% less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a laugh","review":"The music, house and clothes are beautiful. All very well done.But the acting and storylines are cartoonish! I found myselflaughing out loud at the miracle recovery, the bufoonish doctor, the servantstalking back!! It's like a cliff notes version of a harlequin romance.I recommend the old Upstairs Downstairs. Never lived like the filthy rich parasites but the relationship between the two classes makes more sense.Much better acting, fully developed characters and storylines.It looks dated but still excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine if you like to watch men kissing men","review":"The story was interesting and engaging, but I stopped watching when they portrayed a man kissing another man romantically. Not my cup of tea. If you like that sort of thing, this will likely be a good choice for you. If you don't like that sort of thing, be prepared for a surprise \\"yuck\\" factor.NOTE: This was accidentally posted on the Season 2 review. I have reposted this under Season 1 where it belongs.

Maybe not since the Band of Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT series!","review":"I enjoy a good soap opera, and this is a wonderfully set series! My husband and I have watched 2 seasons in a little over a week, and will be so sad to catch up to the regular season and have to wait to watch the next episodes rather than doing it at our pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Series","review":"My husband liked the second season better than the first season. I like them both and I an excited for the third season to be available soon! The production is historically accurate in a basic sense. It is not history lesson, it is a drama set in the early 20th century, so there are a few goofs but so what...this is a great story of a family evolving with the times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to this program","review":"All I can say is kudos to PBS for bringing this wonderfully written, skillfully acted and visually stunning program to America. This is the story of an aristocratic family and their staff during the transition from Victorian times to the roaring '20s. Life is changing fast and people upstairs and down are having trouble keeping pace. This is not stodgy or overly romantic. It is compelling and engaging. I love the way the story is driven by characters in both sets of people, the aristocrats and the working class. I love seeing the amazing house. I also love being able to get a glimpse of what it may have been like to live in a time when electricity was new, there was no television and women were occupied with changing their clothes 5 times a day. BRAVO and keep the episodes coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"we both loved the series","review":"bbc and pbs has a great series,better than any reality show or other type of show with shoot em up or stupid stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent period serial drama","review":"This series could have been a lot weaker and still been a pleasure to watch. It has solid acting, particularly Maggie Smith, who looks like she's never had more fun, and a solid ensemble cast. It has an engaging, soap-y story line, with multidimensional characters. It has solid writing, that both illuminates history and makes it compelling and current. Production values are very high. It shows like an HBO program, only without the swearing. I'm looking forward to whatever direction the program takes next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mini-series EVER!","review":"I can't get enough of this wonderful mini-series.

The photography, character development, costumes and acting are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"After watching the first season, I figured it would remain just a miniseries of pre-wwI aristocracy and the gears that keep it running beneath the surface. There was no way the family could keep going as they were. That's the mastery behind the show, they weren't able to. Suddenly, the show has become a deeper look at the politics and divide between turn of the century social classes. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adore the Series, but Season 2 gets silly at times","review":"We love, love, love Downton Abbey here at my house. I've been waiting for a show like this since Brideshead Revisited in the 80s. I must say, though, that Season 2 has its low moments. Many reviewers have mentioned this, but in one episode a man shows up, covered in bandages, claiming to be the heir to the title. THe absurd thing is that he speaks in a Canadian accent. Why, why why introduce such absurdities?We also find NOTHING appealing about that character Branson. Awful personality. And the actress who plays Sybill, despite being lovely, is NOT convincing as an aristocrat. She has bad posture and a slumpy-faced expression. It's very uncouth.None of this, however, will keep me from watching this show, and I give it five stars despite these flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey online","review":"Excellent!!!

The show is awesome! The Costumes are beautiful and I am now able to understand a little better about the class system, something we have a hard time understanding in America. There was no crossing the lines of class then, and everyone understood this, until Tom came along. I'm looking forward to finishing season three so I can be ready for the next season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth viewing","review":"My daughter mentioned I should be watching Downton Abbey, so using my Amazon Prime membership to view past seasons' episodes, I began with Season 1. I am hooked! Once I began watching, I could stop. I am sitting up every night viewing at least three episodes. This program is so intriguing. The history of that era, the quality of the acting and the in-depth characterization of these people is wonderful. What a story line to follow.

I had been waiting for this second chapter to come out for quite a while. I got to view and enjoy the whole 2nd series before it aired on Masterpiece Theater. It was also shipped well protected and arrived quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining","review":"This is a lovely lush series with production values more like Brideshead than Upstairs, and is thoroughly enjoyable. It seems more accurately to be a 20's and 30's era drama in its characters, other than the dowager countess, who have the buffer look and attitudes of the 20's rather than the historically accurate depiction of the Edwardian age. The servants of this Earl seem unrealistically to have very personal relationships with the family. I do believe that the relationship was much more formal and distant, like most employee-employer relationships today. However it is a lovely series with a performance by Maggie Smith as much a jewel as Gielgud's in Brideshead. It would be good if PBS made a short film exploring the actual servant-master relationship during the Edwardian period as a companion piece, but this might be a hard sell. But, regardless, Hoorah for PBS."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this series.","review":"This is one of the best series on television.

It's even better streaming HD. I've never liked soap operas and DA has occasional sniffs of the genre, but the story and characters are so appealing these minor notes are easily ignored.

He's a decorated war hero. He will be 90 in August, is still very active,raising cattle with his sons help. He and my sister were married 65 years last July.I love the fashions that the women wear. The whole program makes you feel as if it is real. What fun it must be to have such a beautiful place to act. Highclere is a beautiful castle, and the way the owners have brought it into the present by using its resources to help them maintain it gives it all a sense of reality. .Its a beautiful place with lots of history and drama itself.

However the audio encoding is quite flawed. I have an Oppo BDP-93SE Blu-ray player with the latest upgrades. To get the best sound and keep up with audio encoding format enhancements I use the player's processor with upgraded software, high grade DACs and clock to decode the audio and send it directly to the Denon Video Receiver. However, there is some flaw in the audio encoding that results in no center channel output and very little subwoofer output. I also have a Sony player that produces the same output problem. No other blu-ray I possess (over 80 of them) has this problem and they all play perfectly in the Oppo.

I must have gotten a bad batch and the worst part is that I wasn't able to view them until after the return period lapsed due to a heavy work schedule. Because it was a series and the discs were new and sealed, I never dreamed that they would all skip.

While the show had a few war scenes, it was more based on the impact that the war had at home, and how the members at home dealt with these issues. The stunning conclusion was well written out, and left room for a third season which should be launched early 2013. I can't wait to see season 3 of this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downton Abbey Excellent Masterpiece Classic","review":"I rank this up there with Pride and Prejudice and all the best MASTERPIECE CLASSICS.

This one is about how to think your way around the golf course to make a better score using the skills that you already have. Unlike some books on strategy, it doesn't assume that you can always hit a precise fade or draw to land the ball exactly where a pro would try to hit it. This is about golf thinking and strategy for the average golfer. As books on golf thinking go, this book by a top pro golfer is more valuable than any of the books by sports psychologists. I highly recommend it.

Typically, I hit 7-8 greens in regulation. After reading Floyd's book, I played a round and hit 14 greens in regulation. The next round I played in a vicious wind and shot 77. Better than scoring low, these were the two most comfortable rounds I've ever played.Mr. Floyd's advice is about scoring. There is little about swing mechanics. I will read the first five chapters over and over. After reading these chapters, my mind is calm and clear. If I take this mindset to the course, I am fully confident that I will play my best golf that day.I own over 40 books on golf. This book is at the top of my list.

This book lays it all out bare. The real reason for the tragedy of WWII - or americans think of as our great victorious war to free mankind from oppression.

I'm an open water swimmer and triathlete, though I mostly train in indoor pools. I love the total immersion technique, and Laughlin has serious open water credibility, but the DVD fell far short of the quality I found on the shorter, denser clips on YouTube of Laughlin's onsite coaching sessions.FUNCTIONALITYThe instruction offered on this DVD is almost nonexistent.

I have the book also, but didn't need it after watching this DVD. I couldn't learn freestyle swimming before. I was always out of breath. After watching this DVD I was able to swim for hour without break. It is amazing. I couldn't believe myself. I think it depends individually. I never had problems with buoyancy so it was easier for me to learn it fast. I can swim for hours now. Now I need waterproof MP3 so I can swim longer. I am getting bored after long time swimming and need some music to make it more interesting (:I really recommended this DVD for everyone who likes to learn freestyle swimming. It was a little expensive but is worth it. I would spend more money on classes somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"astonishingly helpful","review":"I'm simply astonished at the results I've achieved using this program. Learning from a DVD is far better than a book, though still short of in-person instruction. With that said, though, I can't imagine how the DVD could be made any better. I purchased it to help me train for a triathlon. Before I started I would tire after about 75 yards. Using these techniques I very quickly started swimming 600+ yards in 20 minutes without tiring significantly. As I said... astonishing. A fantastic bargain, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polar bear style for retirees","review":"When I ordered swimming instructions, I expected a pro to show the best muscle movement.

So disgusting, I couldn't bear to spend more than five minutes before stopping the DVD. I am throwing it awa. FYI, I am 60, try to eat right and exercise right and am within five pounds of my high school weight.

There are many ways to do this, and the video mentioned a few, such as trance dancing, self-infliction of pain, and the ingestion of alcohol and psychotropic drugs. Some other methods that should have been mentioned include glossolalia, traditional meditative prayer, chant, isolation, fasting, etc. However, the only method this documentary actually talked about was drug use. I admit it was pretty interesting to see Peruvian Indians ingesting mescaline through their nostrils, but the video should have been entitled \\"Religious experience and drugs\\" or something to that effect. The title led me to expect something a bit more comprehensive, but all it offers is 50 minutes of superficial discussion on drugs.

Given that I paid almost nothing for it, I wasn't about to mess with sending it to Coby, so I opened it up to see what was going on. Problem was basically a poor design. The little push buttons stand up at right angles to the PC board inside, and when you press on them it strains the tiny little solder joints that hold them down, eventually breaking them. The play/pause button is especially weak since it's on the end. I swapped units with him and told him to be real careful with the buttons.

It sounded decent, was compact, light, and portable. Then after a few months the screen started showing garbage. I could still get it to play MP3's but I could not directly choose the one I wanted. It would lock up, and I'd have to take out the battery to reset it. It was malfunctioning badly. After contacting Coby, they basically told me to change the batteries and don't try to play DRM music. I would never dare allow DRM onto any of my systems, and I've got plenty of fresh batteries for every occasion, so I felt that their response was more or less a brush off.Out of the box, Coby electronics are generally neat devices, but they all reliably fail, so don't get too attached to any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks great, but didn't work with my computer","review":"I really liked the idea of this item; as small as a flash drive, big enough capacity for working out or the commute, but when it came time to getting it to work with the new iTunes, no luck.

I read an article about the band and was intrigued by listening to what some of the band's influences are. I have always loved Elvis Costello and this has a certain feel and sound like early Elvis costello. If you are wanting to know if this album sounds like the first album Decadence no it really doesn't because this album is more band driven as the album Decadence was more beat and dance driven since Dan the Automator was involved with that album. Dan is nowhere to be found on this album though and it is a very different direction that they have went to this time. Definitely one of the best albums from start to finish I have heard in a while. There really is not a weak song on here. Standout tracks are Graduation Day, Nowhere Fast, Laughing At You, Egyptian Musk, and God. This is a really good record."},{"rating":"2","title":"HA Throws A Curveball","review":"Anyone expecting a repeat of Decadence will be disappointed.

Whether there is only one over-enunciating, over-modulating, whiney-sounding and mixed-too-loudly singer in all of emo or not (as is the speculation), this guy's voice intrudes here to ruin what could have been a great record. It's the sound, as in all of emo, of a singer trying way, way too hard to be heard and an emo producer enabling him, resulting in the listener tuning it all out. What a shame, as a singer and producer with a true feel for the Elvis Costello/Jags/Yachts sound could have made a real gem with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Automator No Sales","review":"Just goes to show you that the Automator is one of the most underrated producers in the industry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much junk.","review":"When talented artists with unusual and eclectic style decide they want to make a 'pop' album, it usually actually turns out pretty well. 'Decadence' was a very decent CD, although I would much rather hear Daryl Palumbo put his vocal ability to better use with GlassJAw.Other artists have taken similar directions lately- I love Mike Patton's 'Peeping Tom,' when is the Faith No More singer's attempt at creating what he thinks pop should sound like...and it sounds magnificent.What makes 'Popaganda' different? It doesn't target pop, it IS pop. I hate to be cliched and use the term 'sell out,' but I can't see anyone with serious musical tastes actually liking this CD. Seems to me that it's nothing more than an attempt to attain a mainstream audience and more money- the whole disk is nothing but pure radio fodder with some of the weakest vocals Daryl has ever put out.Go back to GlassJAw and make good music again, Mr. Palumbo."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Worst of the Best","review":"The introduction of Bryan Burne in the wake of Edwin's resignation from the band in Blue Green Orange leaves me with mixed reviews on the album. While Burne's voice can be found easily strung in with the tunes and melodies of Christian, Jagori, and Bruce, the often muffled and unexplicably incoherant lyrics are a far cry from the well-organized songs from their past. However, songs like 'Gargantua', with it's fierce yet rythmic bass strikes, and 'Good for Sule''s melodic drifts on pianos and drums, prove that I Mother Earth's skills in music and producing songs with impact are enough to keep them from succumbing to the dangers of change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"'Three lives to live' is a book I read a couple years ago and I loved it.

And yes, these concertos are lyrical, but also dramatic. And Vogt gets to display not merely his artistry but also his considerable technical brilliance.A major question is, of course, the tempos in the Schumann concerto. Most folks play it in a slow, dreamy manner. And maybe that all started with Clara Schumann (who presumably knew quite well how it was supposed to be played).

Like who exactly were the bad guys, how the hell could some piss-ant planet in a minor system be able to raise a fleet strong enough to combat the New Republic. Then of course why couldn't the New Republic send a large fleet in to kick ass, wasn't it but two years ago that they laid the smack down on the Yevetha (Black Fleet trilogy) with a couple of hundred ships.

I found that it added to the star wars story line and that it was a fun read. There were a few parts which brought it down a star, due to some of the writing being a little elementary, for example parts where it would say something to the affect of \\"the button labeled OPEN THE HATCH BUTTON\\" or something to that nature. There were also some parts in the book which didn't seem to be very \\"realistic\\" in the sense of realism in the star wars universe. There was a massive interdiction field which mean ships could only travel at sublight speed, but some of the space craft seemed to be able to make it to places too quickly considering.On the good note, it was an enjoyable read, all three books were and I would recommend it to friends of mine. (If I had friends who read the star wars novels that is.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get some quality control on these books!","review":"Once again the lust for more easy profit from Star wars fans rears its ugly head. With this trilogy we get a somewhat tired tale where yet again the New Republic faces \\"Probably it's greatest threat ever.\\" I am astounded that with all the threats the New Republic has overcome it is not yet strong enough to deal with a petty crook in less than three books. Why is it that the further away we get from Zahn and Andersson's books, the more backwards Luke and Leia's Jedi abilities seem to become. Surely this whole tale could have been shortened into one novel with a touch more ingenuity in the way the bad guys try to ruin/control the galaxy. Basically, this is not the worst Star Wars book you could read; but it almost is. Isn't it about time that Luke and Mara get it sorted and give us the patter of tiny Jedi?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much potential and many ideas wasted","review":"I just finished this book and it mostly disappoints.

Oh, and someone gets married (or at least it's implied) and another character dies. Won't tell you who but it wasn't done well. I wasn't emotionally involved. By the way, when is someone going to write a book that is less sci-fi and has more of the Force? THAT is Star Wars, not space battles and firefights. The Star Wars fans love the Force. It's the original thrust behind the whole storyline. Luke and Han are boring, unspecial characters in most of the books.

I've been applying it twice a day with a mixture of Johnson's Aloe Vera and Vitamin E baby oil, plus taking a Vitamin E capsule. I've noticed my stretch marks have been fading,not much, but I also believe if i continue to use, hopefully it will fade these annoying depressing marks over time. I have tried everything from Trilastin, to Palmer's cocoa butter, and all kinds of remedies that swear up and down that they work, then turn out to be a waste of money. So I am real hopefully with this product, but will keep you updated in about another month."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a ripoff--its his first 2 combined","review":"This is the first 2 Wiz books combined under one cover with a new title--ok for new fans of WizZ, but a rip-off to those who have read them all.

I was very sad when I found out it was out of print. Then I saw this book on Amazon. The first 2 books in the series, reprinted together! I bought it, read it, and almost burned it. The editing is so horible, it almost ruins the story. Paragraphs run together, or are split for no apparent reason. Quotation marks and other punctuation are missing, extra, or in the wrong place. In some places text is repeted. The editor who let this piece of unmitigated junk go to print aught to be exiled to Siberia. This story is a must read, but only buy this book if there is no way you can get your hands on a copy of the original printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story, lousy edition","review":"I enjoyed the original books. The story is lots of fun to read. But the copy-editing and typesetting in this edition are truly despicable. Words are mis-spelled, parahgraphs are run together, and numerous other mistakes.Why couldn't they just have published this edition from the same master layouts as the original two books? It looks like the typesetter for this edition copy-and-pasted the two books togehter in his word processor; and then allowed his cat to walk on the keyboard before generating the master files for printing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"\\"The Wiz Biz\\" and the sequal \\"Wiz Biz II: Cursed and Consulted\\", about a Silicon Valley programmer transported into a world where magic exists, are fun and compelling. It's a clever idea and it is well, if not artfully, executed. The characters are types, but not stereotypes. The author, Rick Cook, while creating a beautiful, buxom mate for his main character, rises well above the kind of stereotype that would confine the audience for these books to young men. The world is well imagined and there's lots of humor. The more you know about about programming and the computer world the more in jokes you'll catch but there's plenty there for the merely peripherally geeky. Business schools could assign these books as a intro text to illustrate the reality of consulting, the pitfalls of charging in with a \\"great solution\\" before reviewing the current environment, the importance of considering the long term consequences before acting and the importance of creative thinking.A good summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE year 2000 toy collector's guide book.","review":"Massive 944 page book containing toys and prices updated for the year 2000.

These worlds share the same male dominated religious and economic insecurities from the threat of female liberté, égalité and their offspring, reason and free-will to their established orders. This \\"fundamental-world\\" reaction ranges from female infanticide to honor killings to submission and slavery.With films such as this one and support from all of us this issue, like many similar others, is on it's way to the history books.

But if your situation is like mine---my husband of 30 years just walked out forever without ever a clue beforehand, and since refuses to discuss any issue, and is determined to get a divorce and marry \\"her\\"---then what does this book have to say to you or me?

I never understood before how a twenty year marriage that looked good to everone else could suddenly fall apart. \\"Crazy Time\\" has given me a clear understanding of the rift in our marriage, and new compassion for the struggle my husband has been going through.

It examines, better than any other book I've seen, the complex, intense emotions you encounter when a marriage fails or falters. Briefly, a divorce is not unlike a death. You often go though several predictable stages during and after a divorce and it can take years, not months, to fully grieve a marriage and start life anew. I recommend it highly for anyone getting divorced or contemplating one, it helped me tremendously when my first marriage ended.You will find out why some people go through periods of promiscuity after a marriage ends, why it's so easy to fall head over heels with someone else when your marriage is less than perfect, and what are the financial, emotional, social and health repercussions of separation and divorce. Read it when you a getting divorced, or read it to remind yourself why you aren't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really what I was looking for...","review":"This book could easily be a 20-page report or pamphlet. Instead, the author uses A TON of different case studies - NONE of which were mine and really, they were boring to read after awhile. Kind of like when you're getting divorced and your heart is breaking - the last thing you care about is other people's relationships. I was looking for insight into how to proceed with a divorce, how to get on with my life and how not to repeat the same situation. The only thing this book taught me was some things to avoid/think about with my next relationship. The other thing I learned from her case studies were that 85% of the couples were cheating on his/her spouse.

The little vignettes are used to support it might bring a sense of \\"I'm not alone\\" or \\"I'm not crazy\\" to readers who maybe aren't finding that kind of support in their immediate surroundings.But the book held nothing new, insightful, or helpful for me. It was recommended to me by a friend who has gone through an 18-month traumatic breakup with a man who was ALMOST the man of her dreams, and since I've also experienced drawn-out breakup process that I felt nearly killed me, she was overwhelmingly certain that I would like the book as much as she did.

Anyway, the other day, she goes to sing and the microphone suddenly doesn't work. The machine hasn't moved from her nightstand so I'm not sure how it suddenly broke. She is heartbroken.

On December 6th I sent them e-mail saying I still had not received my pieces. The e-mailed me back on Dec. 11 saying they had a leak in one of their glass tanks in October and as a result all Corelle tint patterns will be unavailable until June 2009. They asked me to allow a few extra weeks for the delivery of my item. It is now December 16th and I still haven't received my item.

The Electronic Image Stabilization seems to only work welll when you are zoomed in on high-contrast shapes. That enables it to lock in and stabilize the image. Stabilization does not seem to work at all on general scenes lacking these characteristics. Compared with my own Sony, the image sensitivity does not seem as good, even in a normally lit room.

I am reminded of Colossians 2:8: Be careful that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit based on human tradition and not based on Christ.\\" And Matthew 15:9: \\"They worship me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men\\".Dont buy this book and further more run from any ministry who pushes this doctrine. It will only put you in bondage. Take the 10 bucks instead and give it to someone in need."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dangerous Message","review":"The message of this book is a very dangerous message for Christians. It promotes a very unhealthy view of how a beliver is to submit to authority in the church. Very little actual Biblical support is used to support this message. Instead, John Bevere uses many personal experiences to build his support for the message of Under Cover. These examples have an emotional pull to them and can be very convincing to individuals. However, there is a great danger in this message. As believers, our covering is the Lord Jesus Christ. In his book, Mr. Bevere points people to look at their pastor as their covering. This is serious error and has the potential to shipwreck people's faith. My recommendation would be to not read this book, or, if you are compelled to read it, be sure to balance the message of the book with what the scripture says."},{"rating":"2","title":"ASOLUTLEY LIFE CHANGING!","review":"Two years a go I read this book. An amazing transformation occured in my life. As I sbumitted to spiritual and governmental authorities, and turned to prayer instead of many words to defend myself, every obstacle was removed from my path and I walked away and continue to live in a tremendous and miraculous blessing in my relationships, my work, my church and personal friendships. Thank you John Bevere for sharing your wisdom and God's word in these areas, to help empower me to walk in strength, peace and success.

I have an old fashion porcelain tub with a slightly rounded bottom. I feel that is what created the bench to slide which caused the leg to buckle.

I think they threw some guy in a room with the CDs and a computer and told him to pick random songs for this release.

It has some songs from Eminem's mixtapes and non famous one's from Eminem's albums. I would not say this album is missing tracks because it's a CD of the hits from his solo albums so they did not decide to put in songs like Purple Pills and My Band.Also got three new tracks Fack, Shake That feat.

The bonus disc, \\"Stan's Mixtape\\", featuring Em's favorite songs, is a plus because you get to hear his guest spots like Biggie's \\"Dead Wrong\\" and Jay-Z's \\"Renegade\\". In fact, he could have added more on this mixtape. I can think of a few songs that they missed for this collection but this is called \\"The Hits\\", not \\"Al's Favorite Eminem Songs\\".

Holden is an undercover (sleeper)agent that loses his only contact on the \\"good\\" side and is stuck on the \\"bad\\" side. His \\"power\\" is that he can store and transmit the pain his body receives. Ironically enough, he cannot feel anything, be it pain or pleasure.

He's in SO deep that the only person who can substantiate his true involvement with the good guys is in a coma. So now he's stuck.This is a world of good guys and bad guys; literally superheroes and villains. You don't see too much of the good guys because there's off rescuing sinking cities, etc. It's the bad guys who Holden is running with, which I find very interesting. I haven't read too many stories where the protagonist is a bad guy. They all have villainous names (e.g. Genocide, Miss Misery) and work for an even more sinister man named Tao.This series really does have it all: espionage, superheroes, humor, excitement, sex. It's written extremely well and is not your little brother's comic, that's for sure.

I have been able to learn and practice kata between lessons without waiting to ask my instructor this or that question.

You didn't hear anyone in metal or screamo in the 90s doing vocals like this, and I really don't think it can be argued that it's an intentional stylistic choice, it's just kids out of their depth attempting something they don't understand.

Which is cool because of luigis insane jumping skills.The only thing that kept this game from recieveing the five star rating is because it seemed to short to me and has little replay value.

There are several interesting twists to this version: dragon coins exist in castles and fortresses, and Luigi is selectable and he's in his SMB2 form. So Luigi can be a little hard to get used to at first. They've should have brought both Toad and Peach as playable characters like in SMB2.

I love the idea of multiple exits, and finding all the secrets made me explore the levels that much more.The downside to this game? Over way too soon! I bought it and three weeks later, I had beaten the whole thing, including collecting all the yoshi coins. The old Super Mario Brothers Deluxe for BGC had harder levels! It took me at least a year to clear the thing. Given, I was younger then, but still.On the upside, the graphics are cool and the gameplay is great...but a more extensive secret world would have made me happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game will keep you busy on long trips!","review":"Super Mario Advance 2 is a great game to play on the road, at home, or just through boring patches. With 9 worlds and over 90 thrilling stages, this game will surely have you going left, right, and back and forth! It has been awhile since Mario looked this entertaining, especially for on the road fun. In Super Mario World, you must rescue Princess Peach and the Yoshis from the wrath of Bowser! All through getting there, you will encounter traps such as falling chunks of land, water, enemies, and a few bosses along the way. This game definitely is a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games ever!","review":"Super Mario World was a great game on the NES and the SNES and porting it to the Game Boy Advace was a great idea.

Definitely worth purchasing and playing over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most faithful translation of a game from SNES to GBA","review":"Out of all the Marios for the Game Boy Advance, this is the one that converted most faithfully to the GBA from the SNES. The capabilities between the two systems are extremely similar. This game is incredible. You have over a 100+ plus levels to go through, and many hidden ones. It's difficult enough to keep you going at it, but easy enough that you don't get up and throw your GBA out the window. Deciding what world to go to is a huge benefit in this game. At any given point you can decide which world to go to next, and it doesn't have to be the most straight forward. Everyone has a different strategy to this. The addition of Yoshi in SMW was always one of the big draws to this game, and I believe that still rings true. If you are looking for a platformer for your GBA, this would be my #1 recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"I played this tons when I was about 12 yrs old.

I would recomend this game(though I still want the Dragon Ball Z game-BAAAD!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"still the best","review":"Super Mario World was always my favorite game on the SNES which is why I'm glad that this game is back. What I think is the best part is that Luigi isn't just the same as Mario like in the original. It's like a whole new challange trying to navigate through the levels with Luigi's awsome jumping ability. Vetrens of this game, don't pass this up just because you played it before, its new features will have you glued to it longer then the original. All in all, this game kicks [butt] so don't waste your money on Pokemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Super Mario World","review":"Great game this game has all kinds of great secret levels such as Top Secret Area where you can get an yoshi, feathers that alow Mario and Lugia to fly, and red power-up mushrooms.

There is a bunch of other cool stuff about this game, but overally it is a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new incarnation of a great game","review":"Yes, I remember when this game first came out and how great I thought it was. Yeah, the music is \\"classic Mario,\\" and Mario 64 has now opened a new dimension for our favorite plummer brother, but this game still rocks. The color is nice, and I still find several of the levels to be just as challenging as when I first started playing (oh so many years ago). I think \\"Tubular\\" is still up on my top 5 list of fun (and super challenging) levels in the land of Mario for all time. So, my recommendation -- get this game as it will provide hours of fun. And remember, those red levels are the ones with multiple exits so enjoy searching for more ways to finish the levels. And if you are considering buying GBA, get it now. It is super light, fits right in a pocket, the playing time is superb, and there are tons of great games out there!! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Mario World 2","review":"Ever since I inserted the Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2 into my GAMEBOY advance, it seemed almost impossible to put it down. There were 96 levels full of obstacle courses ahead. The journey to save the kidnapped Princess Peach was on!The game starts at Yoshi's House in Dinosaur Land. You simply walk to one of the two starting levels. After finishing a level, you'll uncover a path leading to new levels. There are all sorts of levels, land, water, caves, ghost-houses, castles,and fortresses.I enjoyed the secret exits to some levels. They lead to secret levels that usually are shortcuts. But the secret world called Star World was my favorite. I had even more fun finding the secret exits of a secret level.I also enjoyed the game's means of transport. You can walk, run, fly, swim, or ride Yoshi. There are also other ways depending on what level you're on.I'm having lots of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definatly the BEST","review":"This game is awesome. THe game has a total of 99 levels. All of the levels are tough so that makes it a difficult challenge. You get to choose between Mario or Liugi. I think that Luigi is better because he jumps higher.I am currently on the 87th level. I have just ordered a guide book to help me. There are 7 different sections of the game in each section there is a boss. In the 7th section you have to verse Bowser. The funnest part of the game is star world. In starworld a secret level gets you to special world. This game is @WE$OME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun, Just too easy.","review":"Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo was the first ever video game I played, and I simply loved that game. The Game Boy Advance version of this game is just as good as the original.In this game, you try to rescue the Princess from Bowser's Castle. You get to his castle by beating the levels, and the bosses at the castle in each world. There are 96 levels in this game, and that includes secret levels that you need to find a key or go through a secret exit in a level to get to.This is is quite easy. I beat all 96 levels by the time I was in second grade, but this game sure is fun! This is a must have game for the Game Boy Advance! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Video Games Reviewer","review":"Super Mario World is an excellent game for the GBA. A remake of the original, Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World brings 16 bit side scrolling action back to life. When the original hit the Super Nintendo it was the best side scrolling platformers on the market, and with Super Mario World gracing its colors on the GBA some 10 years later, it is still the best side scrolling game available. 96 total levels of Mario platform greatness. New to this version of Super Mario World is a course traction option that can be brought up by hitting the select button that will display what screens you have opened and if all the Yoshi coins were picked up on that level. Another added bonus is that Luigi is now a playable character. Overall this is a great remake of one of the best games ever made for any videogame system and is a must have to everyone's GBA library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Supper (Mario World) Game","review":"I have not yet gotten a chance to play this but I loved the supper nintendo game it was based on.

This fight showed the skill, the passion, and above all else, the courage of both men. Neither man was willing to go down to the other. This fight went back and forth, each man giving and receiving a tremendous amount of punishment. Yet each man kept moving foward, neither man ever backed down. This was one of the hardest hitting, action packed fights of all-time, but because it was for the world title, and because the two fighters were Ali and Frazier and with everything between them, that it why it is the best heavyweight fight of all-time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Eugene","review":"I love it!

I knew Pink Martini at first from their CD Simpathique, also a beautiful disc. In this new work they play very interesting and inspiring songs, in Japanese, French, and Brazilian Portuguese among others. She sings here the well know song Tea for Two (Do you remember Doris Day?), really beautiful in her voice. Another song they play that deserve a remark is Tempo Perdido, composed by Ataulpho Alves, a well know Brazilian composer and singer (05/02/1909 - 04/20/1969).

If you have a chance to attend a performance, do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really new here","review":"While the first two albums from Pink Martini were real stand outs each with their own flavor, the latest release shows signs of creative drought.

It benefits as well I think from skipping around a bit, listening to the songs individually and in other mixes.

The points are well made, plenty of examples are made in order to betray our very warped and myopic view of the world.

The important thing about Chomsky's analysis is that it is not just a limited analysis of Iraq or Afghanistan -- his argument is that things don't change much and that if you look at the broader history of the last 100 years, the present involvements are not some \\"new age\\" requiring a \\"new prism\\" but are more like old wine in new bottles.I really recommend picking up these books.

In fact, its government more resembles the mafia than a government in the genuine service of its people. Chomsky tends to be repetitive, but so what. But sometimes he gets carried away, as in asserting, for example, that the Israel lobby is Christian, not Jewish - which is hardly the whole truth - making this reader, for one, wonder what his underlying motive might be for this obfuscation. The Christian zionists lack the political savvy and strategic thinking of their Jewish counterparts, who run the show. His work in linguistics likewise is brilliant - and not entirely workable.

In this book he examines America's experience with and oftentimes support for terrorism around the world, noting that the current \\"War on Terror\\" is really a renewal of activities dating back to the 1980s.This is not a book of easy answers like so many on the topic of terrorism and foreign policy today. You will not find any \\"us vs them\\", \\"they hate our freedom\\", \\"we gotta get them before they get us\\" nonsense in Chomsky's works.If you are actually interested in the realities of America's foreign policy decisions and the potential consequences of our actions, past and present, then you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's choose survival!","review":"This book is very informative and well written.

Instead, I found Chomsky's latest effort to be little more than a political diatribe based not on solid facts, but on a reflection of his personal bias. I strongly suggest instead of the rehashed rantings of a petulant political wannabe that characterize \\"Hegemony or Survival,\\" that those who are seriously interested in an intellectual discussion of American foreign policy read, instead, \\"The Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic by Chalmers Johnson.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Chomsky","review":"Chomsky's problem has always been the white heat of his polemic words.

Overfeed with propaganda and paranoia, in the hopes it spills out somewhat into the mainstream. Powered by the folks behind A.N.S.W.E.R. and American and international communists, he twists the truth to fit his--and their--view. Remember, he is a linguist--that's what he does.I'm not sold out on what's happened in Iraq--I think the timing was poor, and the planning for post-invasion even worse. But I am far from a Chomsky supporter...he reminds me too much of Orwell's pigs that keep reminding us that we are all equal, but he and those like him, the only ones that \\"know\\" the truth, are more equal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocrite, traitor, fool","review":"To call the one state in the world that has done more for human freedom than most of the rest of mankind taken together a ' terrorist state' shows just how little Chomsky is worthy of the freedom of speech America provides him.

According to Chomsky, the United States has done nothing worthwhile in its entire history, except the founding fathers were alright. The book is repetitive. It is 237 pages long and should be a 25 page essay. It is purely wacky opinion, stating facts without basis or appropriate footnotes. In the Cuban missle crisis, the Soviets were right. The United States is a racist country seeking to take over the world, comparable to the Nazis. For a linguist he is careless with words. My only question after finishing the book: Is there anything Chomsky doesn't know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chomsky and Ahmadinejad","review":"The Iranian demagogue and the liberal of liberals, what else will they deny? Chomsky publicly promoted the communist Pol Pot Regime in Cambodia without knowing over two million human beings were massacred. When confronted with the evidence, he denied it happened. Chomsky promoted the virtues of the communist Soviet Union ignoring and deny Stalin's execution of over 27 million human beings. Chomsky's arguments and social theories are never supported by fact based conclusions or historical success.

Naiveness is so easily acquired these days, it fathoms me how people will beleive writers, celebrities and critics so easily, and ignore those with PhD's in political science or governmental administration.

Yes, we should continue to improve American civilization,protect our freedom and environment. Noam proliferates conspiracy theories and reaches for ideologies instead of fact.

The problem is that these comments are the best part of the book. The poker-playing buddies, as well as Rita's dad, are all stock ethnic stereotypes and unfunny, to say nothing of unbelievable. The Main Line \\"WASP\\" types are also a stereotype and never come alive as characters.I will admit that I didn't guess the murderer so must give Lisa some kudos.

Rita Morrone, Philadelphia lawyer, is a sassy lady with a penchant for play life like a poker game. Indeed, her best friends are her father's poker cronies and they are probably the most memorable thing about this book.Despite Barbara Rosenblat's splendid narration (as always), this book doesn't click. The pacing is inconsistent, particularly at the end which has about three extra chapters. Rita's legal life and ethics go beyond any reasonable suspension of disbelief. She's a partner at her age??? She has no clue as to legal ethics??? Get real.

Her character development is so real I was continually picturing all the beautiful people I grew to know and love.The plot has great twists and really moves quite well. If you haven't read many of Lisa's newer books, you would do well to digest these earlier offerings. It really helps to see how her style has developed and improved. I would recommend all of Lisa's works if you enjoy strong, intelligent, and resourceful female characters - supported entirely by wonderful ethnic family and friends.

I was so dissapointed that I took it back to the library. Faith is nothing but a selfish woman who uses time old excuses. She kept her daughter from Jason for the stupidest reasons that you will only find in a romance novel. Jason shouldn't have left in the first place, but he did, and all Faith had to do was tell him as soon as she could. That would be the RIGHT thing to do. Jason wasn't any better though. He shouldn't have been so angry that Faith had gotten married. He left all of a sudden and didn't call or write till six months later. I always like the characters and writing of Nora, however this was such a short story that it left a lot to be desired. Nora should have not made her characters so cliched.

If not, then I'm giving up Nora for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brothels, Bordellos and Bad Girls (Prostitution in Colorado)","review":"Good book about the history of prostitution in Colorado. Very interesting, I thought. Certain prostitutes are named, as well as their experiences in life. Guess I was surprised to find out that so many have committed suicide. Others seemed to thrive, but they were tough women. Some of the dishonest techniques that were used to get the money patrons had were described, such as using a wire to sneak their clothing from the closets while they were enjoying the prostitute; steal their wallets and/or money and return the clothing to the closet!

I thoroughly enjoyed her first novel, Pink Slip, however, this one seemed depressing. The two main characters appeared to have no respect or show any outward love toward each other until the very end of the story.

Lisa strikes me as very off-putting in this.i agree with another reviewer who was just as puzzeld as I about the disappearance of family and friends-I loved those characters (especially Lisa's Mom) in book 1.

Wow, was this man ever pathetic. While he'd put his \\"faith\\" in Jesus Christ before anything else, he'd put down the homosexuals, the non-Christians, liberals, pro-abortionists, and basically anybody that doesn't live the pathetic life he lived. Falwell was yet again one of the right wing political scum, and with the help of Pat Robertson (another hypocrite who thinks people that aren't Christian are worthless), he made America angry.This book is only good for laughs and toilet paper.

Call it \\"noveau\\" ... that it is ... while not entirely Flamenco, in the traditional sense, the Spanish origins are unmistakable. The passion, energy, spirit, and soul of Spain is the creative impetus for this beautiful music. The listener is taken on a joyful ride as whirling energetic vortices surround the listener and remain with them the rest of the day. New energy is created and disappated ... making anyone within hearing distance more in tune with life and themselves. Pure pleasure! Pure passion! Purely personal!

But I have to thank the reviewers who pounded Ottmar mercilessly yet recommended Paco de Lucia and Gerardo Nunez. Both play with amazing ability and the traditional flamenco is far richer than nouveau. \\"Entre Dos Aguas\\" and \\"Antologia Vol 2\\" by Paco de Lucia and \\"El Gallo Azul\\" and \\"Flamencos in New York\\" by Gerardo Nunez are highly recommended. Even though they are brief, the samples offered on Amazon will give you an idea of the flavor you are missing with Ottmar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aural anesthesia","review":"This guy could help control America's runaway health costs single-handedly.

Simply stated, calling this flamenco, even nuevo flamenco, is a sham. I've played flamenco over 20 years, and studied it's background and history, even published a book on the history of the Gypsy and I can tell you there is not one Gitano compas in the whole album.It is truly unfortunate that competent flamenco guitarists cant stay gainfully employed, Pedro Cortes, Jr. in NYC for instance, and this guy is making money \\"mano a mano\\" calling what he plays flamenco. It simply is NOT flamenco but it is good elevator or dentist office music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nouveau Flamenco is what now?","review":"The self-stylized Nouveau Flamenco artist had to call it something new since it's not Flamenco. It's like any kind of pop treatment of serious music, from Yanni to Kenny G. It's ethnic elevator music.My aunt put this in the CD player a few Christmases back and hit repeat. I've heard it dozens of times; more than enough to give it a fair shake. Please consider something more traditional and with more serious musicianship (I've seen Mr. Liebert play and the best thing about it was the rhythm team and second guitar player, Calvin Hazen; all handily outshined their marque). You might try Paco deLucia who is widely considered the master of Flamenco guitar. There are also young artists out there who are terrific; eg, Vicente Amigo.Another reviewer who gave this 5 stars said it puts him to sleep at night. That's overly modest, this album can put you to sleep at any hour of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch this one!","review":"Ottmar Liebert has contributed notably to a second air of the flamenco a heartfelt and moving Spanish rhthym so enjoyed for many people aropund the world.This album encloses what we might call the real spirit of the flamenco in its different moods. On the contrary, I think this is a gratyfying album, plenty of inspiration and vibrant emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitsch sells","review":"It is unfortunate that Mr. Leibert can deceive so many people by labeling this as 'flamenco', when it bears no resemblance in either structure or sound to a art form that has 300 years or history.

This recording lacks depth and is probably best appreciated in the lift or a waiting room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Rich Quick Scheme","review":"K-Mart Leibert should awaken from his sleep and go to the University of New Mexico and enroll in some flamenco courses. I would highly recomend that if you want music that is more passionate and musically much more intricate buy any release by artists such as Gerardo Nuñez, Vicente Amigo, Chicuelo, Paco de Lucía, Tomatito, any guitarist on the street.Don't waste your time listening to unadventurous music, get the real thing!

Fans who can't get enough of his fine work on SUPERMAN would be well-advised to check out S: FAS, his first work on the character. The magic found in his present Superman material is overflowing in this early story. Taking place during the first year of Clark Kent's adventures in superheroing, Loeb gives us a gentle, epic fantasy with a charming hero, slimy enemies (his Lex Luthor is flawless), and rich human drama. The book evokes the feel of another brilliant Superman story--the beloved Richard Donner/Christopher Reeve film from 1978. Not surprising, given that Loeb is a screenwriter/film producer himself. (Would that he was making the next Superman movie!) This book is a must for any Superman lover, young or old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Understand the Hype","review":"If I could give it a 2.5 stars I would so it's right in the middle. This isn't a bad story, but it's not as compelling as the number of 5 star reviews would suggest. It was an easy read, but the artwork was not my favorite- i don't know how else to describe it except it looked immature. it's a very basic story and hey if i had a kid i'd totally read it to him or her as a bed time story but for an older audience it fell a bit flat. sorry if i offend anyone who thinks the world of this book i really tried/wanted to like it i just couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I might gain lots of hate because of my very negative review for this book, but that was what it was for me.I give one star to the book because of the art, which is not particulary good regarding characters, but the backgrounds are just fantastic.Regarding the plot, it turned out to be to slow for me. It tells the story of a young Clark Kent becoming Superman. One story each station.Most of the book turns to be a vanilla experience in Smallville and what it takes to Clark to go to Metropolis and start wearing the red cape. Is nice and slow, but is a SUPERMAN COMIC. It should have more action.I just didn't enjoy the reading. Maybe you do..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average superman comic","review":"Superman For All Seasons is an average Superman Comic.

There work on Batman, Daredevil, Spider-Man, and the Hulk etc., have been great. Here, their take on a young Clark Kent dealing with being Superman was really good. Told through the eyes of four different people in Clark's life we, the readers, get to see how different people view Clark differently. While the book is light on the action the inner turmoil and emotional impact is pretty huge. The dialogue from Ma and Pa Kent was the highlight to me. The art by Sale was a little less sharp than I remember and his Superman looked slightly too beefy but it was still good. Overall a really good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent Superman read","review":"A very good and well written story, not spectacular or something hasn't been done before, but well worth the read.I'm not a great fan of the drawing style though, especially not the way Superman was drawn - he looks really fat, not muscly at all, and as a teenager, he looks way too old in comparison to Lana and Pete.

Ironically the case is flimsy, but the covers are a bear to open.

I only found out about her, because of James Blunt, who is another newcomer with wonderful voice and great music. I recently got Katie's CD, and I just love how easy and comfortable she sings. Not forced at all. She's in the same gendre as Norah Jones, but I think Katie has a better voice and sound. My favorites so far in this cd, after listening twice are \\"The Closest thing to Crazy\\" & \\"My Aphrodisiac is you.\\" I'm definitely buying her other CD, \\"Piece by Piece.\\" I'm very satisfied with this CD, and I'm hoping to see her live performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check out track 2...","review":"Norah Jones comparisons abound and rightly so because, like her, Katie Melua can really sing. But, wait a minute, in amongst the high quality, perfectly executed, but essentially MOR ballads that form the core of this album, what's happening on track 2, \\"Crawling up a Hill\\"? Something very different... a brilliant down-tempo interpretation of a little heard R&B number, originally released as their first single by the UK's John Mayall's Bluesbreakers some 40 years ago. Exciting at the time and much, much better this time around thanks to Katie Melua's beautifully controlled vocals, some exceptional playing, and a production that extracts the best from its excellent lyrics & underlying melodies. An inspired choice and a stunningly good track that, for \\"cool blues\\" fans out there, is worth the price of the album on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"On an Airplane?","review":"I first came across Ms. Melua on a 5 hour flight from Washington D.C. to Sacremento. The airline's 'radio station' was playing her CD from start to finish and I was able to hear enough to pique my interest. All I can say is 'Wow.' I keep seeing her compared to Norah Jones, which I think is completly unwarrented. Norah Jones doesn't hold a candle to Katie's beautifully sultry, subdued tone. Most of her songs are cover's of tried and true blues/jazz tunes. This shouldn't dissuade you from picking up the album however, as she brings new life to each and every song she sings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"Comparing Norah Jones and Katie Melua is like comparing Pavarotti and Julio Iglesias.

The producer should have stopped this whining right away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful voice and album","review":"I received a copy of Katie Melua's album and absolutely hate it. She's got a flat voice and her songs are so dragging. Even after repeat listening, I still find her bland. However, good on her for making alot of money for a voice and material as interesting as a glass of table water.I gave my copy to the local charity shop, good riddance to bad rubbish, very bad.I would prefer NO STAR but it dont exist, sigh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No no no no no........","review":"This utterly horrible!! While Katie has some songwriting skills, her vocals are terrible. When I saw the commercial for her cd I thoguht it was a joke. I cannot understand why anyone would buy this. Damn, it is absolutely horrible. If this is what music is coming to, we are in trouble. Norah Jones can sing, so quit comparing the two. My advice, if want to experience the \\"magic\\" of Katie Melua, try driving hot nails into your eardrums while recording it. Then listen to your own agonizing wails of torment. That will sound better. This is garbage!!! Stay away!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG NO, NO","review":"Hate the voice, it's very irritating and amateurish. The songs are great though- i just hope somebody recorded it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lulu of a singer","review":"I too bought this CD after hearing so many comparisons to Norah Jones. Upon listening, I saw no similarities. I did however feel like I was listening to the second coming of that 1960's British chanteuse, Lulu (famous for singing the title song from the film \\"To Sir With Love\\").I found Katies CD to be pleasant enough, but not particularly edgy or complex. Pretty basic, vanilla renditions.The good news is that she is very young and will probably get better with age and experience. For someone just getting into jazzier kinds of ballads, this CD is an OK start. For someone who really appreciates mature musical stylings, this will be a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the cuts first","review":"I bought this CD on the strength of hearing Ms. Melua sing \\"The Closest Thing to Crazy\\" on the Craig Ferguson Show. She was backed by a three piece and the stripped down, sultry effect sent chills up my spine. HOWEVER, upon getting the CD,it is a fully orchestrated, over produced piece of crap. Most of the songs are OK and you can see the potential, but the producer should be shot. It is not at all what I expected and is gathering dust in a cabinet. I have resolved to never buy another CD without sampling the tracks. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"As a lover of GREAT female singers she leaves me COLD.

If you are considering purchasing this, I recommend you listen to the full CD yourself before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay well away ...","review":"Everyday I hear people say that modern jazz vocalists are not up to par with legends like Edith Piaf, Nina Simone ... It's usually the same ... not intense enough, not enough soul, but I figure ... this is as good as it will get for now, and vocalists like Diana Krall are at least technically competent.But Katie Melua just cannot sing.

Her melancholy, far-off voice transforms these songs into a wonderful tapestry of emotional love, loss and longing. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her voice has heart and she's a charming performer","review":"I sometimes laugh at how some of the reviewers take themselves so seriously. I enjoy vocalists regardless of genre and I think Katie has the makings of a promising career. The soulfullness of her songs keep you intrigued and while her styling is somewhat poppy, it has some originality to it. I can understand why some may not prefer her voice or don't think she compares well to other great female vocalists, but some of the rantings of her being talentless or having a terrible voice invalidate the authors' opinions. These extreme views are certainly questionable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating!","review":"Love this album. Yes, she's young, but somehow that's forgivable and almost makes you like it more in that she's enjoying playing around (where most others wouldn't dare to). It's haunting and fun and the musicianship of the band is unsurpassed. It's always refreshing to hear a great drummer.If you looking for fun and something you can listen to for a very long time to come (over and over and still discovering something new in it), buy this album. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Mr Fourie, another South African reviewer unfortunately cannot tell the difference between Norah Jones and Katie Melua.........sad because Melua exudes such appeal, warmth and 'listen to me' spunk.

I couldn't stop listening to it. Still haven't. Afraid that I would literally wear out this CD, I ordered another one when I saw this special CD and bonus DVD offered by [...]. Ms. Melua has a unique blues/jazz voice that grabs your heart; her songs of loss and longing speak to your soul. I especially recommend two songs from this CD: \\"The Closest Thing to Crazy\\" and \\"Tiger in the Night.\\" Would like to see this artist perform in Baltimore at The France-Merrick Performing Arts Center!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Talent - Getting There","review":"The Amazon review hits it pretty much on-target. She has the voice and talent for a great career - her choice of materials could use much more work. This is decent CD - some great and excellent tracks where her voice rises to the material - her voice works best on sexy and melancholy cabaret choices like BLAME IT ON THE MOON and I thought her performance on MY APHRODISIAC IS YOU was a cute, sexy, breathy cabaret take (as opposed to the Amazon review who dislaiked it) but on other tracks when she has to really \\"plow\\" into it, she is clueless for instance, butchering the MOCKINGBIRD SONG. If you like to hear all new talent, you should give her a listen but right now, you should just buy a few tracks until she gets the material to match her strengths."},{"rating":"2","title":"best listening on a rainy, cold, dark day","review":"i accidently bumped into this british singer.

It is easy to hear Maria Muldaur in Katie Melua's vocals, and that influence makes her renditions sweeter and lighter than Norah's. \\"Crazy...\\" totally blew me away. \\"Learnin' The Blues\\" is remade into a more refreshing tune and \\"Lilac Wine\\", which no one should dare sing after Nina Simone recorded it, is superb.

On colored wrapping paper, it shows up as white. Over lettering (attaching a label to a package), it makes words harder to read.

I ordered four and they was delivered very fast. The problem is the bottle leaks. Each one has the same problem in that water leaks from the area where the cap screws onto the bottle.

But I decided to give this a shot and I am so glad I did. It's an ideal collection of some of Tori Amos' best songs, her hits, some great remixes, and B-sides that every Tori fan should own. This is pretty much the essentials from the first ten or fifteen years of her career.I love the newer stuff she's done, but this box set truly captures the golden age of Tori and is a lovely snapshot of the beginning of a fantastic career.Music aside, the packaging and booklet really add to it. It's a beautiful box and the booklet is informative and eye catching. Every part of this set is worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A piano: the collection review of purchase","review":"Great deal!!!Got this within a few days of order. There were a few unexpected dings in the box, the hinge doesn't work properly, and there was the ever-so-common saw-hole through the upc code...other than that every thing was fine inside. This is so worth getting! I own all of Tori's works already, but Rhino does such a fine job remastering things-the audio quality is outstanding!!! Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely collection...","review":"I've really been enjoying this boxed set. It's a very well put togeather collection and some of the notes from Tori are very interesting. The Demo Version of \\"A Sorta Fairytale\\" is probably my favorite track from the set.

The amount of photography and visual presentation of the set alone was enough to impress her. I was surprised to see that there were a few tracks that she hadn't heard. I was happy to see that. I would definitely suggest this as a gift to a huge Tori fan or anyone who's into Tori Amos.It's a great display piece also. My girlfriend put it on our bookcase for all to see. Everytime I pass it, I can't miss it and pretend to play a little piano myself.5 out of 5 for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the new songs","review":"This box set is probably more for either really big fans who want a complete Tori amos collection, or someone who wants a collection of songs without buying all the cd's. What's unfortunate is that most of this box set is made up of songs that the people who would buy it already have, but the new tracks and even the remixed ones, as well as the demos are well worth buying. \\"Take Me With You\\" and the demo version of \\"Playboy Mommy\\" being two highlights for me.I would suggest buying this set if you like Tori and don't necessarily want to buy all the albums, or if you are a die-hard fan and buy everything she puts out. Otherwise, buy the indivdual new and remixed songs and demos somewhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Tori and never released songs!","review":"Well put together. Songs carefully selected. Piano box with ivory keys stunning, but only if you're a collector....without it the set might have been cheaper. The new songs are great, although I thought it was too few.A lovely booklet with explanations of some songs,and about her different albums and career, but I thought it could have been more detailed. People that knows nothing about Tori Amos will get to know what makes her tick as a wide range of songs were chosen over her career.

Marco Pereira is obviously a master of the genre and a master nylon string guitarist.. At first I thought the record a little too perfect, as though he was sacrificing soul for technical perfection, but the more I listened the more I realized this was passionate music making by a guy who just happens to have unbelievable chops. His subtle timbral nuances are about as good as it gets- I would guess he is a serious classical player as well.The tunes are a mixed bag of originals and jazz standards, including a wonderful suite comprised of several Baden Powell compositions. This guy pulls it all off effortlessly and flawlessly. Multi reedman Paul McCandless guests on soprano sax and english horn on a few cuts, spicing up the proceedings but the music seems to be at its best with just the trio. Bravo Marco!

Bottom line is the Garmin Deluxe carrying bag is ok for the Nuvi, but not the StreetPilot and Dash Mount. Ironically, as poor as the Garmin carrying case is ... the opposite is true of the Garmin Dash Mount; which cost about the same as the little bag. So, forget the bag and spend your money on the Garmin Dash Mount and a $2.99 Sears \\"small\\" tool bag.

How they can sell a bag that can't even fit the stuff that comes with the unit is truly beyond me. I can't even squeeze my Garmin auto power cable/speaker into this dinky thing, and nevermind the FM receiver and antenna. In no way do I recommend purchasing this item.

The screen turns black in the sun. The camera quality is terrible. The ring tones are horrible and very limited. Plus, there are no games, not even plain old freecell. I almost wish I had my old school LG phone, it may have been basic but at least it was easy to use. So beware of some of these reviews about how great this phone is. Or do what I did and buy the phone just to exchange it for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I've had many cell phones but this one has to be the worst! It scratches so easily its not even funny. I transfered from cingular last december and that was the worst decision of my life. I could stand next to someone who was a different carrier and 99% of the time i'll have less service bars then he or she. You get what you pay for and this phone is a clear example of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone ever.","review":"Hideous and cheapily made.

Grotesque design.Could it get any worse?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Design but Horrible Camera Concept","review":"I bought this phone along with a different brand for my wife mainly because of the design and ignored some of the warnings from various reviewers.My pros are:- Nice Exterior.- Simple to use.- Decent Picture QualityThe Cons:- They thought at Audiovox to put a button on the outside of the camera to take sublight pictures. VERY BAD IDEA. This goes on all the time and drains the battery without my knowledge.- The phone heats up after about 5 mn conversation.- Unstable Signal strength (I know it is not the carrier because my wife has an LGE with the same carrier and does not have the same problem).- No Free Games (not even) Snake??? (I know they want us to pay for it but we should at least have some)."},{"rating":"2","title":"AudioVox CMD8910","review":"This phone was a pain at first. From the start it was hard to determine what functions the phone offered and how to enable them. Soon I had to open the manual to locate and enable the many useful functions that this phone had hidden. However, next I had trouble with the sound and the speaker. It seemed like the phone is not capable of reaching the volumes I need; yet I am often in a loud setting. The biggest turn on about this phone is that it is very tough, mine has been left outside in the snow twice (once for three days), forgotten in the rain, and been chewed by my dog. Yet it still works with full function of every capability it had from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I got this phone about six months ago, and it's been a disappointment since day one.The ringer is very quiet- I can almost never hear it ring! Not only is the ringer quiet... the whole phone is quiet. I often have difficulty hearing the person on the other end, even with the volume turned up as loud as it can go.The flash doesn't do anything for the phone, so don't buy it just because there's a flash.The thing that really bothers me about this phone, though, is the battery. I can charge it for well over 24 hours, and the battery dies after an hour of conversation.My sister also has this phone, and she shares my dislike for it. She had her phone replaced within a few months of buying it because the phone wouldn't hold a charge. Just recently, her replacement phone started doing the same thing. She recieved yet another replacement phone last week... we'll see how well that works out for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why 'classical'","review":"Rosewynde's other two releases are listed under 'popular', and both show the artist as 'Rosewynde'.

My two favorite RTSes, Age of Empires 2 and Rise of Nations, were built by them.Like many, I bought this game because I adored Rise of Nations. I knew it'd be different, but, wow, I did not expect this. The gameplay is completely different. The removal of gathering different types of resources is discouraging. The three teams are relatively uninspired.

If you turn the image quality in the game to maximum you'll see the intricate detail they've used to build this game. Lower end cards will work but you don't get the full 'picture'.

So with some hesitancy I decided to try RoL. Boy am I glad I did. The game is intuitive, well balanced, beautiful, imaginative, and best of all addictingly fun. I can not comment on the multiplayer, because I am finishing the single player first. But without reservation I would recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft, It's Time To Move On","review":"I really wanted to give this game a chance. I really did. It looked very nice visually in the screenshots released. But unfortunately there was an utter failure to deliver. The concept of one single linked city was nice. I'll give it that. However, the core mechanics of the game (units etc) were horrible. I would have to say they were even less creative than those of some of microsofts older games such as Age of Empires etc. So in addition to the game mechanics feeling clunky, they also felt outdated.Basically, overall, the story wasn't that good, the units were uninteresting to say the least, and given the multitude of other options, and I really wish I could have had those hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate It","review":"This game is so different from the original they shouldn't share the same name. I still enjoy playing Rise of Nations and Rise of Legends is a different game in every aspect. I found playing it was too easy and there were no choices to be made by the player, just a singular story line to follow that was quite lame. Don't buy this game expecting it to be a newer version of Rise of Nations, it's something completely different."},{"rating":"2","title":"review from 10 year old boy","review":"Although I like the overall design, I have been encountering performance problems such as graphic details, the screen flashes in different sections with horizontal and vertical bars,and running problems such as the game tries to connect on the internet, although I'm not playing on the internet, so it just shuts down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Strategy Game Yet","review":"My boys and I fight for turns.

I recommend trying the free download scenario first before spending your real money and time on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A significant disappointment","review":"Stopped playing after 1/3 the way through.

And I like the convenience. But the claim of $.18 per liter seltzer is just plain wrong. Customer service could not explain how that cost can be achived. And the \\"60 liter\\" canisters can only produce approximately 45 liters of seltzer. I would give this product an excellent rating if the manufacturer were more honest about their cost claims. With the cost of the machine it takes awhile to see any savings over store seltzer and their claimed costs can never actually be achived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frequent price increases and false claims of quantity.","review":"This is a good product that is over-priced, over-hyped and under-serviced.It comes nowhere near their claim of charging 110 liters of water from one charger. If you were to try to get 110 liters of soda water from their claimed 110 liter charger, it would be so flat you could barely call it soda water.And, once you have made the substantial investment, you are a captive audience for their service, which includes frequent price increases.The ability to exchange CO2 bottles locally is very iffy. It seems to be different every time. Last time, I had to have the bottle shipped to me. This time, their site claims local exchanges, but the places claimed as exchange locations on their site seem not to have the same information.If they were upfront and honest about the cost and convenience of their product, I would give it four or five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more work.","review":"I agree there are problems with this book, but the section that has the baskets is very beautiful. That part was my favorite. I agree that better research could have been done on the weavers themselves, but the baskets make this book a beautiful addition just on the baskets themselves.

Finally, someone has said what a lot of us Indians were thinking.Sure the book is packed with a lot of fabulous photos, but the context of the book is so flawed. I am surprised Yosemite Park Service approved this book.The book is so inaccurate I was wondering why both of the authors could do this, but then again the Southern Miwoks are going for recognition. They needed books like this printed. It could be possible that is why this book was done. It now makes a lot of sense why someone would do a book so filled with inaccurate information. Best to check this book out of the library and just look at the nice pretty pictures, because the \\"historical\\" info is inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many problems with historical facts with this book.","review":"I like the pictures, but there are many, many historical facts wrong with this book. I have seen the census rolls of most of the \\"Yosemite Miwoks\\" and they are basically Paiutes and some Yokuts from Madera. Madera is a town over 60 miles away from Yosemite.So how does that make them \\"Miwoks\\". Yokuts are from a totally different tribal and langauge group. They were San Joaquin Valley floor Indians and not Miwoks.The rest are mainly Paiutes from around Mono Lake. So how is that Miwok?The book is full of \\"could be's\\" and \\"might be's\\".I thought this book was supposed to be a book on the Indians of Yosemite and not a Federal Recognition of the Southern Sierra Miwoks paid by the National Park Service?Nice pictures though, some are misidentified as \\"Miwok\\" when they are from another tribe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Battery and Poor Service","review":"I just received the camera as a gift and the battery doesn't work.

When it takes a picture, it has about a 2 second delay between when you press the shutter and the picture is actually taken. This means that the camera is not at all useful to take pictures of our 2 year old son, because 2 seconds later he has already moved on to something else and the picture is a blur. We have lost more pictures because of this camera.Tonight when trying to take our Christmas picture, I would press the shutter but no picture was taken. It was as if the camera could not figure out what it had to do. Try again, same result. Repeat, nothing. Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, still nothing. When I set the camera down, disgusted that it wasn't taking any pictures, then flash! - took a nice picture of the pavement.

Now that it has been in use for a little more than 1 year, I have become completely flustered.At first, it wouldn't always power on...but after a couple of tries, I could always fire it up. Now, after owning for about a year, the camera is completely dead. It will not power up in any camera mode, does not respond to reset, and will not function when plugged in.It appears mine is a lemon, given the majority of great reviews. We'll see how the service center treats me. The warranty is short, so fixing it is gonna be on my tab.Good luck with yours"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big camera in a small package","review":"It's easy to see this tiny yet powerful camera getting overlooked on store shelves, but check out the specs! What's more, this camera lives up to them, and means my larger older model digital camera will be sitting on the shelf much of the time. A clear, sharp lens, ultra-convenient size, high resolution images, various \\"pro\\" features for tweaking settings, five \\"movie\\" modes in mpeg and gif, including audio. This is an ideal camera for any number of high level amateur or field-light professional situations.

The first year it worked fine and I was happy with its performance. In the past year, I 've become completely dissatisfied with it. I always took good care of it, following the instruction manual. I first started to have power problems, the battery would not charge or would quickly discharge. Purchased a new one and now the shutter button does not work. It only goes down to the auto-focus mode but no to the record mode. I contacted Sony tech support and they tell me this is an unknow problem. Right! and I was born yesterday. Their only help was take it to a repair center."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with Shutter after 2 months.","review":"I bought this camera Dec 4. I loved the size and the durable look and feel. It is a camera you can take anywhere. And the pictures are very good.That said, my shutter button now jams up in the up position, so shots cannot be taken. It seems like a mechanical problem with the shutter mechanism and the mode dial. After playing with the mode dial back and forth, the button freed up. Now it freezes up every few shots. It seems to be related to the feature that keeps the shutter from being depressed while the mode dail is in playback or setup modes.So far their service is dismal, with a maze of menus and long hold times (half hour). I am very disappointed after an initial great product experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Even though the price was a little much the features and capability of this camera are outstanding.

Battery life is not that great, but the small size accounts for that. Ask yourself how big of a battery do you want to carry? The size of this camera, plus the ease of use were my main draws.My biggest gripe is the location of the on/off switch. If you're not careful you will turn it off while taking pictures. I've noticed Sony has corrected this on other models.The case of this camera is built like a tank. Some of the newer stuff looks cheaper.Accessories are hard to find. You really have to be persistant to find different battery chargers. The charger that comes with the camera, requires the camera be utilized in the charging. I bought a charger that charges two batteries independant of the camera. A vehicle charger would be nice but this has eluded me.I constantly get good comments,from auction buyers, about my picture quality. It has to be the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera for beginners","review":"I purchased this camera about a year and a half ago on eBay, I paid about $220 for it ($160 for the camera, and the rest was on the battery, charger and memory stick). It's a very nice design, with a large screen and a solid feel, and not at all too large. The picture quality was fantastic, I had no complaints. However, I had to give the camera up to my mother because the low-light pictures were AWFUL. The night I bought it, I took the camera to a minor-league wrestling show, and we compared the photos to my friend's four-year-old Olympus camera. The difference was striking- his photos came out much better, mine were either too dark, or terrifically blurry (those were in night mode). Again, if you are going to be taking photos in the light, for a party or outdoors in the daytime, you will love this camera. In the dark?

Example: A couple of procedures in the book showing how to use the iTunes did not work. This left us searching through the iTunes help pages instead.

Since I had this album on record back in the 80's, I knew better. And guess what? I still bought the cd. Why? Because Martin Metcalf is a much better singer than Shirley Mansion will ever be. This is not the greatest album I've ever heard, but it's very enjoyable.

The acoustical effects of brass, organ and voices bouncing of the walls in natural stereophonic sound is really beyond description. A good mix of brass ensemble, vocals, organ and gregorian chant. I had not listened much to Andrea Gabrieli before I bought this CD and I have to admit that his contributions to this CD are very powerful.The \\"omnes\\" at the end of the cd has extraordinary musical power. It builds to an amazing climax that has caused many a chill to go up my spine. On a personal note, I listened to this song on my way to see my alzheimer's stricken mother who had died just moments earlier.

However, it is also true that this album, his debut album, is far and away the weakest disc he put out.

This was a guy with talent and soul to burn and unlike Clapton, Beck, Bloomfield, Winter, heck, even Stevie Ray Vaughn, Gallagher never, ever made a bad album. This one's my favorite for simply having served as my first exposure to the man. And what a mix! Everything from flat-out rockers (\\"Laundromat\\" and \\"Hands Up\\"), acoustic country blues (\\"Wave Myself Gooodbye\\")and late-night jazz (\\"Can't Believe It's True\\") and points inbetween. Gallagher was especially eloquent on guitar, whether acoustic or electric, but the dude could also wail on the sax and was a very accomplished mandolin player as well. He's backed to the hilt by bassist Gerry McAvoy and drummer Wilgar Campbell, with Atomic Rooster's Vincent Crane joining on the 88s for a couple of songs. The styles may be all over the place, but the passion is always consistantly there and it makes for one great album.

Get this and see what was only hinted at in \\"Walk the Line.\\" If you want to know what gave Johnny Cash the strength for his comeback, this is the movie to watch. Produced by him and released in 1973, it was, according to accounts of the time, a labor of love.Various musicians were weighing in with their interpretations of Jesus: Rice and Webber with \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" and Schwartz's \\"Godspell\\"--it was appropriate that the reigning royalty of country music should do the same. See what Johnny Cash, June Carter, and Kris Kristofferson came up with--you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cash project that is very much below standard....","review":"I can only second what Puddleglumm (great nick ;-) has already written here before. Even though I love most everything that Johnny Cash has ever done, especially in his later years, I think that this film is downright awful. The blond Ikea-commercial Jesus obviously is historically inaccurate and his amateurish and uninspired acting is so off that the fascination that the \\"historical Jesus\\" must have exerted does not come through at all. Why would anybody have wanted to follow this sluggish blond fellow? The film certainly does not give any clue. And I did and do wonder why Johnny Cash and June Carter apparently did not mind the poor quality of the acting?? I assume that I won't watch the movie again, but I still like the \\"comfortably creepy\\" soundtrack--I still have that one on vinyl. Sorry if this might sound slightly offensive, but as a longtime Cash aficionado (I don't really like the word fan), I think that it's my duty to be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateurish movie","review":"Very poorly done showing Jesus like and Anglo-saxon individual.

Every aspect of the production is conspicuously inept, from hatchet-job editing to lobotomized acting. The cinematography alone is shaky enough to induce motion sickness.If this sounds like an unintentional laugh riot, it is -- for about fifteen minutes. After that, unless you're a die-hard Cash fan, you'll have to stick pins in your legs just to stay awake. The film's gospel soundtrack (a big slab of overproduced early-'70s Velveeta) is poorly served by an inferior 2.0 sound mix. Image is faded and grainy, though it appears to be in its proper widescreen ratio.

From an audio perspective, this DVD gives you no sense of presence. Everything's just a bit too murky.Though I prefer the look of the production of this Un Ballo to the Swedish setting and costuming in another Un Ballo DVD I own, I tend to watch the Swedish one just because it's so much easier to see and hear.Shame on the technicians.

The group consensus was that while we appreciated what he was trying to do with this, it just wasn't for us. I always find a bit of humor in most Miike films, no matter how sick. This just felt more like a Kung Fu Hustle type of deal, which isn't a bad thing but isn't my bag. The drama was also just a little overwrought in places. I couldn't really deal with the bad dialogue either, I'm not sure if that is supposed to be an homage to Sergio Leone filsm or what, but it was really distracting.

From the trailers this movie looked like it would be fun at the very least. I was sadly wrong and couldn't wait for it to be over. I didn't care for any of the characters and it was so slow moving with pointless scenes.

I found this film to be a bad waste of time. No surprise that the story line is familiar ... that is expected. However, everything that happens in the movie is obvious and just plain dumb. The film is gratuitously violent which is far from the worst part of the movie.It is extremely hard to impossible to understand the dialogue. Either this film needs to be subtitled, dubbed or have the actors learn to articulate in English. As it stands, you can only understand maybe half of what is said ... and I consider myself particular adept at speaking with individual with diverse dialects. I am glad I bought this used for $1. It really was not even worth that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Sukiyaki Western Django at first look interesting with lots of action but in reality it was a waste of time and money. One of the main things that got to me was the extremely poor dialog between characters so much I was hoping I can at least put the Blu-ray in Japanese with English subtitles. All I could do was keep listening to the poor dialect while having the movie in subtitles if I couldn't understand what they said. For all you guys who care more about action then story telling you will still be disappointed with lackluster gun and sword play don't get me wrong there was some good action scenes but none can excuse the movie poor excuse of a story line and character development. I only paid eight bucks for this movie and I feel I got cheated out my money the only use I have for this Blu-ray is to use it as a coaster do ya self a favor and don't bother even watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must see movie...","review":"...If you like spagetti westerns, comedy, parody and satire.Before watching this movie you should watch Django so you will see the recognize the reference in the movie.I would have given this 5 stars except the dialog was difficult fo me to make out in dsome of the scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somehow, I just don't get it......","review":"More than 30 minutes into the movie and I still don't see where this movie is going.

I give it four stars. It is kind of a Quentin Tarantino film meets Troma. The Actors / actresses are perfect in their roles. The only flaws I see are the VERY heavy handed [Troma style] humor especially in the begining. If only they toned down some of the jokes like over the top stereotypes and the overacting it would have greatly improved an otherwise terrific film. The photography is excellent especially in the zombie and action scenes. The Bush political humor already dated will age the film badly like a comedian doing a Nixon routine in a few years [ it could have been left out too, I mean look how dated All in the Family looks now].

So many would-be exploitation films are dull and talky - not this one. The performances are also quite good in an over-the-top sorta way - just like everything else here.Director Jay Lee makes a REAL grindhouse flick with today's technology and sensibility.

The one glaring thing about the movie that I noticed the most, other than that it was horrible, was that Jenna Jameson is so skinny and has lost so much weight that she barely resembles the hot girl she once was. If you took a concentration camp victim, put her in a tanning bed, gave her breast implants and duck lips and makeup you have the modern day Jenna Jameson. For much of the movie she has her hair covering half of her face which is good because she has plastic surgeried and starved herself into being repulsive looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did it get such good ratings??","review":"This movie is horrible!!

The directions say for quick leveling aim it where the wall and floor meet (assuming that your floor is level)...once you have it level you must raise the pivot head to where you would like your line. In actuality, when you raise the pivot head your line becomes completely crooked. The levelers are no help. Sure, it has two of them, but as soon as your raise the pivot head one of them is rendered useless leaving the job of leveling a guessing game. I might be mistaken, but I thought that this tool was supposed to take the guessing out of leveling. Don't waste your valuable time with this contraption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use!!","review":"I got this item as a christmas gift and I love it!!

I wouldn't have bought this book if I had been able to look at first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited","review":"This book is not for the novice craftsman. I have some carpentry experience and I did not find it as useful as I had hoped. The lack of step by step methods for creating the door/gate designs was a negative for me.

However, I did find a couple of very interesting designs that I want to tackle as soon as I find a book that will give me sound guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book","review":"If you want to learn how to build doors, as the title suggests, do not buy this book.

This book does not have substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull book with little information","review":"If you have no idea what Internet is and have never seen ebay web site then you might learn something from this book. But for an average Internet-savvy person it offers little to nothing. There is a lengthy description of well-know information (like terms of sale of ebay) and constant selling of ebay business model: nothing you can't read elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"so and so","review":"The author \\"gets\\" eBay. Unfortunately, he was not granted interviews or access to eBay people. As a result, the book is little more than a collection of articles from the Industry Standard, Fast Company abd the like. Furthermore, the book covers eBay until December 1999 or Q1 2001 at most. Back then, it looked like Yahoo! had a business model, remember? And yes, the author contemplates the possibility of a Yahoo! takeover (which was possible) and even the ridiculous idea that eBay should perhaps create its own \\"portal\\" in order to grow... Not worth the money. Buy \\"The Perfect Store\\" by Adam Cohen instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor read","review":"This book is basically a series of quoted and sited magazine articles hastily cobbled together into a book.

It takes a very secure man to pose for some of those photos!This book isn't about how to code your pages but its about what makes good design. You'll find tons of excellent tips. What I particularly like is the fact that he doesn't \\"condem\\" certain designs because they break the rules. He points out that there are times and circumstances that make all the rules null and void.This book is jam packed with great examples and tons of illustrations and sidebars with what [is bad] and what doesn't [is bad].Anyone serious about designing a USEABLE website should get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"why not learn good design by looking at good design?","review":"Is Vincent Flanders actually Jakob Nielsen in comedy mood? Both seem to think that picking holes in other people's work makes them bigger men, as if stamping on the heads of pygmies were as worthwhile as standing on the shoulders of giants.Public humiliation of the underdog is the hallmark of the bully.At least Flanders doesn't only slate, but also offers constructive criticism.But I doubt that Paul Simon writes brilliant music by only ever listening to N-Sync and Britney Spears; I suspect that he listens and learns from other brilliant musicians.The the best way to learn good design is to look at good design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Don't buy this for Streetpilot C series","review":"Amazon shows this as an accessory for the Garmin C340.
