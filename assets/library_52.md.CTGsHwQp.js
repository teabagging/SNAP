I used it as a primary reference for my thesis 11 years ago and I believe it is still relevant now, even with the preponderance of computer role playing games.

To my mind, it fails on both accounts. It is very factual and has limited analytical insights as real research is meant to be. It is also uninspiring for RPG fans or wannabees as it fails to explore what brings and most importantly keeps players around the table. Overall disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fountain of Youth book!","review":"I was so entrigued after reading how exercising promotes good bone health that I bring the book to work everyday, like my Bible just as a reminder to keep up with the work out.

If you do this I think it would be much easier to get the workout time down to where the book claims it should be.I own The 12-Minute Total Body Workout book, and in one respect, this book is better in that it contains a photo chart of all the exercises involved, which \\"12-Minute\\" does NOT have. I recommend that you buy a copy of this book, make a copy of the chart, then cut it up and paste each exercise onto index cards, so that you can mix up the order of the exercises every few weeks or so, as well as putting the warmups at the beginning of the workout.Both books are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great routine","review":"This is a great routine and the book is an easy-read that I found quite motivating. I was a bit discouraged, however, when I discovered how long the exercises actually take. It takes me 30 minutes to complete the \\"8-minute\\" routines. I would have actually felt more motivated had I been more adequately prepared to allow for the necessary time. That said, I commend Joyce for this book, which also includes a chapter on diet and a chapter on aerobic exercise. I am very encouraged that I may be able to prevent osteoporosis, and am recommending this book to my mom, who was recently diagnosed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little discernible purpose behind the selection","review":"This volume contains a large selection of photographs of primarily Victorian artefacts. Readers are invited to discern the purpose of each oddity - hence the claim to 'right brain' strengthening. I could not discern themes, trends or any guiding cognitive theory holding the assembly together. What the reader gets is a mish-mash of images more suited to an antique store fetishist. If poring over images of Victorian apple corers. toasters and other assorted early industrial artefacts, is your hobby, then this book is right up your alley. On the other hand, if you expected this book (which I bought on the assumption that it might have something interesting to say about right brain visualisation and cognition)to be of some intellectual value, you will be sadly disappointed. Ironically it is a book largely about rubbish; the rubbish of a bygone age. Happily, this book, a testimonial to that age, I suspect will soon be numbered among its ranks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"A friend of mine introduced me to this game during a slow weekend and I love it! It's entertaining, challenging, and not at all repetitive.

I think it would be great for anyone 8 or older. It won't be boring or too easy for parents, either, and it's probably great for building some strategy skills.During gameplay, we lost several of the shields down the back of the couch and had to search for them.

He makes a point of not sticking to the well-known, slick rules of standard writing, but rather encourages the reader to be creative in his or her own uniqueness. While walking the line of good advice without strict rules, Cohen is able to provide apropriate advice to all.Which, when it all comes down, is what we all want"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teflon Wiper Blade","review":"I purchaed these wiper bladdes for a 1996 BMW 328is.

It took me FOREVER to figure out that I didn't need to use the adapter included in their package -- the adapter was needed to install my previous blades, and they fit on the end of the hooks just perfectly, so it was mind-boggling to me that the wiper wouldn't install.

Her best series is her Hamish MacBeth books. I have read every single one and have loved them. The Agatha series does not have any of the wonderfully real characters that you find yourself liking and looking forward to visiting again. Agatha's relationship with James is very irritating. Where Hamish and his love for Priscilla just keeps you hoping they will find their way back to each other. The three Agatha books that I have read were flat/boring and I found myself flipping through just to get to the end. For a Hamish Macbeth book I would definitely buy it in hardback.

It is rather easy to figure this mystery out but the writing was a little sharper than the previous book making it much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful stories, not much else","review":"This book tells you short and sometimes sentimental stories about amazing people doing the most amazing things. It makes it clear that there really are people out there doing great things, and it also gives you the feeling that you too can and ought to do it.This is of course not bad of a book, but it might not be all that you want. If you are interested in understanding why these people do what they do or why you do what you do (whatever that is), you are not likely to find much help here. What this book gives you is the stories, not the explanations or the understanding. (If you want the latter you are better off reading, e.g., \\"The Altruistic Personality\\" by Samuel P. Oliner and Pearl M. Oliner.)It should also be mentioned that the book is sprinkled with quotations from thinkers from different times and different parts of the world.

Are we really supposed to believe that all these gorgeous, sexy men are actually attracted to these type women in all her books? I don't think so. It's too hard to read the book(s) trying to envision any type of attraction between her main characters. It's almost as though DP has something against attractive women! Are attractive women less intelligent? Are attractive women uncapable of feelings/concerns for the less fortunate? Are attractive women uncapable of having meaningful jobs? It seems that she's only associating dowdy, unattractive women with having a heart and/or compassion. Notice, all the 'heroes' are, or have been, hooked up with gorgeous women while they're supposedly drawn to her plain/ordinary heroines. Does not work for me!

This is not the easy read as her other titles are. The story seems to drag, and the characters Marc and Josette have so much potential in the beginning, only to fade by the middle of the book. This just didn't capture my attention, and can I please ask Palmer to stop the virgin, who can't physically have sex without an operation, theme because it is getting a little redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Texas Ranger","review":"I've read most of Diana Palmer's books. I must admit I liked her earlier books better, although Lord Of The Desert was pretty entertaining. But The Texas Rangers isn't worth reading. The book starts slow and gets slower. By the time the heroine and hero meet, the author had lost me. She went into too much explanation at the beginning and then kept repeating herself, turning a book that held promise into something that was slow repetitive and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best from Diana Palmer","review":"The basic plot of the book surrounds a pseudo murder mystery and the events leading to the capture of the cliche mobster. The romance story between Josette and Marc is NOT endearing. He treats her terribly and if Josette had the sense God gave her she would have left him in the past.

I will not give a complete review, because I was unable to finish the book. After several chapters, I just skipped through pages throughout the book and saw more of the same.

I am wondering how dumb she thinks her readers are that she has to repeat the same facts over and over and over.

That she dresses like an old maid and he is soooo attractive he turns all the girls heads. He wears an off-white stetson he tips over his piercing gray eyes and he has a hair roughened chest.

Also, stop trying to make bizarre jokes using scrambled libertarian party member names. It isn't funny, merely sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A libertarian fantasy","review":"This work is a tragedy, especially as the concept of a fictional hyper-libertarian president would be a good one-if it was applied realistically.Smith creates a president who accomplishes most of his goals in an unrealistically breezy manner, as another reviewer put it, and whose opponents (i.e. politicians in the major parties and in the Libertarian Party) are portrayed as unrealistic strawmen.In real life, a hyper-libertarian president, especially one who came to power by a series of chance circumstances the way that the titular character did, wouldn't be taken very seriously by Congress or the people, could very well diminish the power of the veto by overusing it (like Andrew Johnson) and would be highly unlikely to last more than one term.As the novel is nothing more than a propaganda piece for Smith's views with little literary value, the implausibility of its premise utterly ruins it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and inspiring","review":"I finished this book in two days and was ready for more.I've read most of the current (and not so current) libertarian literature and this is among the best.I like this book better than \\"The Mitzvah\\", but \\"The Mitzvah\\" is certainly worth reading.

She seems to want to control him. I wonder what really drove them to such tragic unfortunate consequences. Are they both missing the message here? What drove her husband to become an adulterer, and what caused him to commit those crimes. I suspect that they were one of those couples that forgot that God was their Source and took matters into their own hands. I encourage everyone to pray for the author to learn the art of forgiveness and to purchase two books by Linda Savage on breaking down strong Holds from Amazon.com.

All you're doing is moving a plastic mouse around the board and building an oversized mousetrap. Also it's pretty lousy that as you're building the mousetrap, every bump sets it off or makes a piece of it fall over.And durability, well, it's not up to much wear and tear and will easily get ruined if there are kids playing it.So, Mousetrap isn't much of a game and doesn't really offer much in the way of anything and it isn't worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big boring disappointment","review":"I have 4 children, age range 7 1/2 years to 22 months, both boys and girls.

Ok, gotta go play now."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's so cheap!!","review":"The game is kinda fun and my son loves it, but it's so cheaply built and over priced! The plastic breaks too easily, nothing sits right and the slightest bump knocks everything out of place. If your kids aren't asking for it, get them something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun toy, good time filler","review":"My son just wanted to build it and watch the marbles roll. He is only 5 anyway. Maybe we can play the game correctly when he gets older."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected.","review":"Classic game, just as expected. The kids enjoy setting it up as much as watching the marbles move through the machine. No one actually plays the board game."},{"rating":"1","title":"mouse trap not good anymore","review":"Integral pieces of this game were missing (not even manufactured by the look of it) The mouse trap does not fit together at all (even the bits that do not rely on the missing parts) so the game cannot be used and was a huge disappointment and a complete waste of time and money (I think the freight over to Australia was more than the toy)"},{"rating":"2","title":"mousetrap","review":"This is a favorite game of my nephews.

The boot does not hit the stop sign which renders the game useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made, pieces don't fit, game doesn't work.","review":"My son really wanted to have this game and it looked really fun on the commercials... However, the pieces don't fit together correctly and the green boot doesn't come close to hitting the yellow bucket no matter how it's manipulated. So, then I manually tip the bucket and the ball doesn't hit the hand thingy hard enough to tip the second ball... Oh, I almost forgot to mention that a few pieces were missing when purchased and we had to order replacement parts (pay for them). If you've played this game, you'd understand. It's a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to put together, impossible to hold together","review":"I sat there with my child to put this together.

Mom & Dad have to deal with it, & we can't figure out how to put it together either! The pieces are small & complicated. It is pure frustration. Don't buy it! Games are supposed to be fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun concept but cheap construction","review":"I give this game two stars because my 5 year old son always pulls it out to want to play with it. The game itself is not worth playing, but the construction part can be fun.However, the game pieces are so poorly and cheaply made that I don't think it is worth anyone's time to play with it. Not only do the parts NOT fit, but the thin plastic pieces bend and break very easily. My husband got this game because he played with it as a kid, but this particular set does NOT offer the same kind of fun as the old set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mousetrap - Boring","review":"We have family game night every Friday. My 7 year old has been begging for this game. When he got it he was so excited. We played it as a family and was boing and most of the time it never worked properly. The one good thing about this game is that my son plays with it by putting it together and watching the marble roll and fall down. Do yourself a favor and by the traditional board games. This one is a no go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excersize in frustration","review":"The thing takes an hour to put together and does not functionat all when assembled. What a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money or time","review":"This should be a great game, and is hindered by only one thing: the mouse trap contraption rarely works as it should. My daughters and I have set it and re-set it up several times in hopes we will get to see each device work properly, but several do not, especially the board held up by the hand.I would not spend your money on this, but if you do, good luck getting it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality, a Downgrade From the Original","review":"Having played the original version of this game and the new one, I can safely say that they have succeeded in making an ok game horrible. The game was never that great, and always seemed to devolve into simply building the trap and running it over and over. However, now the trap doesn't even work.The game now features a small metal ball on top of the pipes instead of a large plastic one. I assume this is to cut costs since now they only have to manufacture one type of ball (two metal balls instead of a metal one and a plastic one). The problem is, the metal ball is too small and frequently missing the diving board, falls outside the poorly aligned bathtub, or is too heavy for the hand to lift.I like the new artwork, but that hardly makes up for its other failures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made like is used to be!","review":"Was difficult to get assembled and once assembled didn't work too well. Parts were cheap flimsy plastic. Not how I remembered it when I was a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH.","review":"Just awful, the rules leading to the construction process beat all the joy out of this game. Even after I put the mouse trap together & threw out everything else my 5 & 7 year olds were still unimpressed.I had high hopes for this game never having owned it as a kid & now 44 years later it took me less than a week to toss it in the rubbish (wasteful, I know but that's how much I hated it). The kids never spoke of it again, even to inquire: Mom, what ever happened to that Mouse Trap game?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for teaching kids how to follow instructions.","review":"I had this game when I was probably around 10 and recently bought this game for my 6 year old thinking that perhaps he might be too young for it yet. The first time, I assembled the mousetrap for him but then the next time, I read the instructions for him out loud and helped him put it together himself. He had a great time. The trap doesn't work every time but there's usually an easy fix to the problem. Any adult who knows how to read instructions should have no problem putting the mousetrap together and should be able to help their kids suceed with the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a hassel to enjoy","review":"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter. The commerical is very deceiving. It looks like so much fun until you try to put it together. My husband has quite a lot of experience putting things together and it took him about 35 minutes just to set the game up. By the time we did that my daughter did not want to play with it anymore! At that moment I suddenly remembered my dad having the exact same problems 25 years ago...and he was an engineer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"My son received this game for Christmas last year. We assembled and played it once. After that it remained on his bedroom floor - still assembled - for a few weeks. Then, since I was tired of vacuuming around it, and he was not interested in playing it, I disassembled it and put it away. It hasn't been mentioned or thought of since! He was frustrated because none of the parts worked exactly as they should. Mousetrap is a toy that in theory is pretty cool, and could teach kids about cause & effect, but in practice, just doesn't work! Though the makers may have intended for kids to actively take part in the assembly to learn building skills, I don't believe that most kids have the patience or the (extremely)fine motor skills required to set this game up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"parents' nightmare","review":"this game comes in many little pieces and has to be put together before the kids can play, then taken apart, put together, and so on. The pieces don't fit well, they get lost, and your kids will need you to put it together for them , but after the first time you'll suggest they play something else! I finally threw it all away. What a relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS NEW!","review":"I purchased this game for $4.00 at a thrift store, and all pieces are present in like new condition. It's certainly not worth any more money than that. The parts do not all fit together well, but the children enjoy working the contraption. I do NOT recommend this game. The plastic parts are flimsy. I see why someone 'donated' this to the thrift shop. It's not fully functional!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"I remember playing this when I was little. When we first got it I wasn't very interested in the game itself, it was more just fun to set up the traps and set them off. That's one of the reasons it's fun for a large age group- even if you don't care about the game it's still entertaining. Young children do need supervision as some of the parts require fine motor skills to set up that most young children don't possess yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marble and engineering fun!","review":"My 5-yr old received this as a gift and it's the only thing he said he received from Santa, when asked, and he got it from my sister - it's such a hit, he can't get his story straight or think of another gift he received for Christmas! He is a train nut, loves to build marble runs with blocks, train tracks, matchbox car tracks - anything he can get his hands on that enhance the marble run. The fun in this game for him (and the frustration because he has to be patient) is to build the trap during the course of the game. We haven't cut right to the chase; rather we've drawn out the anticipation. I agree that the cardboard cheese pieces could be better constructed but so far we haven't had any issues with the rest of the pieces. If the trap doesn't work right, it teaches children to go back, look at their work, and problem-solve where the glitch might be. I think this is a hidden educational game, fun for the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun but not durable","review":"My son loves this toy, BUT he broke a piece of it within the second day of getting it for a gift as he fell on the board and broke one of the plastic pieces.

This is NOTHING like the one from when we were kids. It's not real sturdy and it's way too complicated for younger kids. It's a pain in the patuti to put together and when you get it put together it may work a couple of times before it gets scooted apart and have to be re-adjusted. The kids dont even pay attention to the game part they just like to play with the pieces. My youngest likes to turn the crank and launch the man into the bathtub but it requires a lot of work just to get that to happen. The kids can't play with it unless one of us is right there with them. It stays in the closet on the shelf most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mousetrap - The Game","review":"The Game of Mousetrap!Of course you help the younger players set up the game but once constructed my three and six year old grandsons were enraptured for several hours, following the convoluted course laid out.

The pieces are so cheap and flimsy, one broke while we were removing it (carefully) from the packaging. We tried tape and glue and it won't stay together well.

Follows the exploits of Cleopatra, Mark Anthony and Caesar.Carry On Up The Khyber - What do Scotsmen wear under their kilts is the question or more aptly, the match that ignites the fire and also extinguishes the fire during the British rule of India (now Pakistan) during Queen Victoria's reign in the 19th century.Carry On Up The Jungle - A classic E.R.

In this album, Rihanna barely hits the Reggae genre but trys to show that she is also capiable of doing R&B. Some of tracks are somewhat boring and not too many i would really consider being \\"Club Bangers\\" unlike her debut album \\"Music Of The Sun\\" which had some nice cuts on it.

I was disappointed, as the only good track on this one IS the hit single, SOS. A Girl Like Me has a less-urban feel, and is musically immature compared to her following release. It's not \\"bad\\" music really, but not what I had hoped for. OK really it is bad music except for SOS. While Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad is a pop masterpiece, A Girl Like Me is lackluster and just plain dull, lacking the hooks the vocals and the lyrical content that made her later album successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 1 GOOD SONG!!!!","review":"SOS was the only good song on here.

These albums with 2 hiphop songs along with 2 R&B; tunes and 2 reggae dancehall tracks accompanied by 2-3 remixes only make the listener confused as to what the artiste is trying to say-I certainly was.This is not a standout album, in fact it's average and just like any of the stuff any of these girls push out year in and year out.It's ok to have a well made-up face on the disc cover but it's all about the quality of the material on the disc that gets the buyer going.I'm glad that this young woman has made it unto the big market but it's time she pratices her craft,cultivate her voice and make some memorable music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Is Average- Nothing New Here","review":"This girl hasn't even been out for a year and she already has a second album out.

I already wrote a review on \\"SOS\\" and, like I said, Rihanna brings nothing new. I thought \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" was a remake of Queen, but it's not. \\"Break It Off\\" with Sean Paul was kind of weak. Other than that, the best songs on the album were \\"We Ride\\" and the remix of\\"If It's Lovin' That You Want\\"- the rest is just forgettable filler material.

Durable enough for the Hi-winds off lake Michigan, yet it flies in very low wind as well!

I could not find the same Norelco trimmer locally for replacement. I was attracted to this Remington trimmer by the other trimming features that it offered and its smaller size. Boy, was that a mistake! The beard trimmer has very fine adjustments on the comb that do not stay locked during use. They slip all the time by getting caught in the beard hairs and then it slips. If you are not careful, you will end up shaving your beard at a much lower setting as happened this past week. Net, I would not recommend this trimmer to anyone. I just bought a Norelco single function beard trimmer on Amazon today and this Remington trimmer is going into the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Trimmer","review":"I was given this trimmer as a gift. I would never recommend buying it. First of all, the attachments do not provide consistent lengths on your beard. If you change, even slightly, the angle you are holding the trimmer, you also change the length of the beard you are trimming. Second, the small trimmer does not work for me at all. It won't cut my beard. I have a thickish beard, but I've met plenty of people with thicker, I guess its only for 14 year olds. The large trimmer works well, but its attachment doesn't cut short enough for the beard that I - and most people not named Santa - am going for."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like Mine","review":"I have only one complaint about this product and that is the screen attachment that doesn't seem to do so well, but that could be from lack of experience, as I get better at using the groomer all the time.All the other attachments work very well and the little box keeps all the attachments handy.If you don't attach the cord properly to the base, you'll go crazy trying to get it to charge. It's not hard to do, but it must be done right.One thing, however, mine is a PG-250, even though it appears to be identical to the picture, so I don't know if that's a typo or not.At any rate, my groomer was well worth the money and is really easy to use, with the exception of that one attachment and like I said, It could be that I'm just not using it correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"karey","review":"Great for the price. Everything works well. I really like the foil shaver, After fist trimming my beard low, I use the foil head to get it very close with no bumps (I have a thick curly beard) I've had it six months now and its still going strong. My only complaint is that you can't use it corded if the battery runs low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheap!!!","review":"I was actually surprised to see another review saying good things about this product.When I went to use it after letting it charge up, none of the heads would work except for the nose trimmer.

I really do not know why people are really unhappy with this product but I guess they had some really nice trimmers before. Anyway, my pg350 worked great for me, i might just get a new one. It is not high end so if you have a super thick beard or are used to some real nice trimmers then this is probably not the trimmer for you but if you have a light beard and will probably use it for light maintenance trims then this is a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY, PURE 100% JUNK!!!

Honestly the only thing that was decent was sideburn trimmer, and that was only when it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality Trimmer","review":"Remington's cost cutting went a little too far with this model. My main complaint is that the trimmer is very flimsy and cheaply made. It lasted a few months before the plastic trimmer attachment broke.

I used this toy to play fetch with my three legged American Foxhound in the pool. This toy smells like mint big time and I love it as does he. He cannot get enough of this football. I put his life vest on and he's in the pool and ready for me to throw it. The second I try to take a break he starts crying and wants me to throw it again. I let him have it and run around the pool with it in his mouth and he's doing a bit of chewing on it then but that's all I allow. I know he will be really sad if he destroys it. I definitely recommend this if you have a pool and your dog likes water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome toy","review":"I have two labs (female, 2 years old & male, 4 years old). Both go through toys like crazy because they chew them apart so easily.I read the reviews for this football and decided to give it a try. I was super excited when it arrived and tested it out with the pups. My oldest absolutely loved it! He even sat down for about an hour or two trying to rip it apart. About the only thing he could manage to rip off was the white stitching. He hasn't even put a dent in it! He carries it everywhere and doesn't let my youngest play with it at all.I'm EXTREMELY happy with this toy.It's very durable!Now I just have to order another one so my youngest can play with one too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lil' Miss Football","review":"The football is smaller than the soccer ball , but my dogs still loved it. It's a great toy for them to play fetch with, but I wouldn't suggest letting them chew on it, even though I'd say this football would last longer than the soccerball.

So are my dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"My yellow lab loves this football! When I first took it out of the box, I was struck by it's strong minty smell.

But if you do not have a destructive chewer, this ball would be a perfect toy to leave with them :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome dog toy","review":"I have a very strong chewing APBT who can destroy anything and these are the only toys he can't destroy within minutes. This is a dog who pulls the tops off of XL extreme Kong's wthin an hour of a getting a new and can chew through a Kong extreme ball in two days. This and the soccer ball lasts for months. I think the design and flexibility plays a big role in the lasting ability.

Not a single solitary knick, crack, or nibble has been removed from this ball. Orbee-Tuff balls are THEE balls to get for overly agressive chewers or just plain old destructo mutts (like mine!). I also love that these balls are made from non-toxic ingredients, so I feel a lot safer giving them to my two dogs.

While not a new idea, Michael does take it a bit further insisting that it is an absolute requirement that each person's role in the organization must fill his own personal vision. When this is the case, the manager can find true fulfillment in his work and achieve wonderful things in the process. If not, all the theory, training, etc are pure folly. There's lots of good stuff in this one. It's an easy read too.

After summarily lambasting practically every management practice, he offers his solution; which was written in a \\"One-minute Management\\" -story style. The book was little more than an expensive promotional piece for his consulting services.

My family (kids age 9, 7 and 6) plays a lot of board games so it's not like we don't play well together. But this game requires everyone to flip their card over the same way, yell the correct phrase (Stop Thief, Double Decker, or Sandwich) and slap at the right time. It definetly requires a referee, which is not what I want to be doing during family fun time. I've heard more \\"that's not fair\\" or \\"he looked\\" complaints while playing this and it's just not worth it.

There is no denying that Sadie is the reigning queen of bellydance, but I just found this vid too daunting to be very much fun.PROS: (1) Great Attention to Detail in Physical Technique (2) Great attention to flexibility and proper postureCONS: (1) Not exciting or engaging (2) DRILLS, DRILLS, and more DRILLS (3) Can become quickly discouraging, as each drill rapidly builds on the next"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadie is a great teacher!","review":"I recently purchased this DVD and - wow!

Don't waste your time on this dud. It was made by Tigon, the studio that occupied third place to Hammer and Amicus in the British horror genre of the '60s. They turned out some fairly good films, but this one's lamentable. The only things I enjoyed about it were Peter Cushing, who never turned out a bad performance, and the curious casting of Robert Flemyng -- it wasn't great acting, but his natural bug-eyed features provided an ironic point of interest. The main vampire is a giant moth played unconvincingly by a stuntman in a cape. After a series of murders, Cushing identifies a handful of what look like oversized moth scales, and being a great detective, instantly solves the case: \\"I think the Doctor has created a giant moth.\\" Well, obviously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really... a MOTH?!","review":"Least scary monster in film history - absolutely hilarious!

I'll take Vanzetti's prose and poetry over Vitiello's any day. His poetry simply is not poetic and carries no energy or engagement. What a pity!

It's like you are reading a lot but get nowhere. I'm a RN and I know I critically think. It's imperative for my profession. Maybe Nurses and the Nursing Concepts and theory puts me at a disadvantage. Maybe this book is far to fundamental for me and I find it as the book states \\"goes without saying\\". It more accurately creates an apparatus. This book is the closest english can get to Math.

We have seen contralto Marian Anderson sing Negro spirituals, mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade act and sing in Show Boat , cellist Yo Yo Ma play the theme in Crouching Tiger, and composer Philip Glass nominated for Academy Awards in three film scores. The great violinist and humanitarian Isaac Stern plays 20 short violin encores to perfection. He describes these selections as \\"music that is as open as the smiling face of a child-- music that speaks directly from the heart to the heart....\\" Examples are Debussy's Clair de Lune, Stephen Foster's Jeannie with the Light Brown Hair and Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee.

Johnson tells a good story, in the go-get-em boys! style of the 50s, when this was first written.The reason I am posting this review is to let other potential buyers know that this \\"ibook\\" is published entirely WITHOUT any maps or photographs. How a company manages to publish a military biography without these is unbelievable.For that reason, I cannot recommend buying this edition, and am giving it 1 star; the story is a four, however.

The cup is wonderful - yes it gets a little cold but for the most part, he doesn't even seem to notice as much as I do. It has never, never leaked. I love the fact that when he outgrows the sippy spout, I can just change the lid and he'll have a \\"big boy\\" cup in a year or two. We take this cup everywhere, and I can be sure that my baby is not getting leached plastic in his juice or milk. Thanks Klean Kanteen for manufacturing a product that we can use with confidence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"less plastic\\" sippy","review":"I've tried the thermos sippys and they leak from all ends. Although the straw ones for older toddlers seem to be much better. I have also tried the safe sippy 2 by kidbasix (I think that is how they spell it) and I do love it except that the top smells. I have tried everything except harsh chemicals and I can not get the \\"dirty sponge\\" smell out of it. I love the Klean Kanteen sippy. It is extremely user friendly, easy to wash, minimum leakage and minimal plastic. I would love if they made a little 6oz for milk with dinner, that was one aspect that I liked about thermos, they make a 6oz. I would highly recommend Klean Kanteen to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"KleanKanteen","review":"Love this bottle for my daughter. I wanted something BPA free and was excited to see they made this in a size for her. The reason I only gave 4 stars and not five was because the spout is for 12+ months and that wasn't noted anywhere. My daughter is 6 months and can't use it, so I have to order the correct age spout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Frustrating!","review":"I was SO excited about this product and ordered two. They both leak everywhere. Also, when I pour milk into it from the refrigerator, the kanteen is so cold that my toddler can't hold it. We had to cut up a sock and put it around the kanteen, which was actually fine if that were the only issue. When I first fill it and shake it around it doesn't leak. Then when my son drinks out of it and puts it down, milk spurts out from every possible place whether I tighten or loosen the top. I also bought a stainless steel straw cup by Thermos(which claims no BPAs in the straw parts). With the straw cup you know it will leak if it tips over, but at least it is totally leak proof if the top is closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks like crazy!","review":"The Klean Kanteen might be an sufficient water bottle, but should NOT be considered a \\"sippy cup\\"' by any means! I bought the bottle w/ the Advant adaptor spouts and had milk leak all over my house, furniture, carpet, and children's clothing! The adaptor leaks (where it meets the spout), and plus you cannot fill the cup past the half way full mark or it leaks out of the neck of the bottle. What a nightmare! I appreciate the attempt to make a non plastic sippy cup, but I thought the term \\"sippy cup\\" meant \\"no leaking\\". As far as this product goes I would wait until the kids need an actual \\"water bottle\\" and then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"messy...","review":"We bought 6 of these cups to get away from the leaching problems with the plastic cups.

Klean Kanteen tastes the worst, and leaks everywhere. I've resorted to using it only for water, and still, my daughter is soaked regularly with this sippy. I understand that the problem is with the Avent valve system and not the cup itself, but for a toddler, this cup is unfortunately not the answer. Please note: it's not that she's dumping it upside down or banging it around; it simply leaks when she drinks out of it, and runs down the side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product, but the price is on the high range","review":"Its a good product for use.

I have contacted the seller to inquire about a replacement but needless to say after all the great reviews I've heard coupled with the money I paid, I expected this sippy would be able to withstand the expected use of an up and coming toddler. I also have a sigg \\"sippy\\" and find it MUCH MORE DURABLE than the KK.

Item arrived with only 1 spout. I called customer service and requested a replacement which arrived the next day. However, the replacement still only had 1 spout. I asked them to investigate the discrepancy because the item title and shipping invoice clearly states 2 spouts. I ended up keeping the item because I needed it for a gift that weekend. The product itself is a good one. My 1 year old thoroughly enjoyed using this as a water bottle but the inaccurate description combined with the fact the replacement bottle still only had 1 spout caused a great deal of frustration and wasted time on my part. Thus the reason for only 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint peels and toddler eats it - HAZARDOUSE!!!!!","review":"I bought this product to keep toxins away from my child. to my great disappointment, the paint is peeling off both the pink and purple Klean Kanteen sippies I purchased. To my horror, my toddler searches for any loose paint chips and tries to eat them. I did not buy this product so my child could ingest potentially harmful products, I bought it for exactly the opposite reason-to keep her safe. I have not had this problem with the 28 oz size. So I don't know if the defect is size specific or due to the abuse of a toddler - either way, this product is dangerous.I was attracted to this product because could go through the dish washer and would be usable beyond toddler years. It also integrates well with the other Klean Kanteen products we own"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Kanteen!!","review":"Purchased this to avoid as much plastic as possible. The top portion is still plastic, which was disclosed and was no big deal, but this leaks everywhere. Bad design of the suction cup thingy that attaches to the Sippy nipple. When the baby or toddler draws liquid from the nipple, it creates a vacuum effect and draws liquid out of the air hole located opposite side of the suction nipple. As long as no one sucks the nipple, it does not leak!? An expensive piece of junk now! If you keep it in the fridge, the content becomes too cold for the baby since it's made of stainless steel metal - not ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good ss dippy!","review":"This sippy does not leak or hold odors.

It does leak a bit when my son is determined to shake the liquid out, but other than that I trust that if I toss it in my bag I will arrive at my destination with dry contents. The only problems we have experienced is with cleaning. My husband put it in the dishwasher once (the product info warns against this) and water got into the inner insulating area of the bottle and we cannot get it back out. The bigger problem though is that after putting juice (mixed 1 part juice : 4 parts water) in the bottle we started getting some black mildew growing along the inside of the sippy/lid component. We have scrubbed it with a small brush, soaked it in vinegar, etc and have not satisfactorily removed the mildew. Searching for a replacement lid now, but they are very hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaking problem solved!","review":"I also had problems with these leaking like CRAZY, but since I wanted something besides plastic sippy cups for my toddler, I was determined to make them work. Solution: Do not overtighten the black adapter nor the black ring. Screw both on just enough, so they are \\"on,\\" but resist the natural urge to get a tight fit. Something about the pressure makes them leak if you overtighten them. The included instructions also say not to overtighten, but no specifics are listed. I almost returned them, and was relieved to finally get them to not leak. Occasionally they still leak, so I unscrew the parts and put them back on, making sure not to overtighten. Also, if baby turns the bottle upside down long enough, yes, it will leak from the obvious air hole, but not enough for me to use plastic again. These are great; I'm so glad I didn't return them.

However, the edition seen here is a cheap rip-off that is a far cry from the classic game. Here you have to individually stick-on pictures of the soldiers on the game pieces!

If you want to play with some photos, this will work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best computer accessory I have ever purchased","review":"This printer is by far is the best computer accessory I've ever bought for myself. An avid picture taker, I am more than pleased with the quality of the photos this printer produces. On top of that, it's compact size makes it's easy to take along when I go out of town.In addition, now when we have family gatherings, I always supply my guests with photos of the event even before they leave our house. They love it and what a nice remembrance!Two tips:When you buy the print pack, also purchase an extra package of just the epson 4 x6 paper. The ink lasts longer than the 100 sheets included in the print pack.Also - purchase a basic photo editing program for editing and cropping your photos before having them be printed. They'll turn out better.It was totally worth every penny plus more!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartridges don't last","review":"I am happy with this printer as long as the cartridge is new...I'm only getting about 40 good pictures from each cartridge.

I'm considering a new printer purchase - and it won't be an Epson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"When the printer works, it prints very nice pictures, quite sharp with amazing accurate colors and saturation. However, it's an ink jet printer, with all the evils associated with ink jets. Clogged nozzles, missing lines in the print, and a very small ink supply. If you do frequent nozzle cleanings, you'll restore the print quality, but that is a waste of ink. It has a couple improvements in that the ink ostensibly doesn't fade like normal ink does, and there are six jets, so color mixing is more accurate. Furthermore, the prints are waterproof. When printing through Epson's Film Factory, the printer crops the borders of the photos, so you'll lose the edges of your pics. This may happen if you print directly from the card; I haven't checked. This cropping is really an inexcusable bug in the process. My advice is to save your money and let a store print your photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this counterfeit?","review":"The packaging is not the original packaging, the cellophane was loose, and I could hear the perfume bottle rolling around in the box.

This is the most boring game for adults to play with your kids. I have four children and Chutes and Ladder is a long game and often give up to do something else. It's infuriating when you hope to finish soon only to slide back down quite frequently. By far, I prefer to play Candyland."},{"rating":"1","title":"my preschooler does NOT like this game!","review":"Terrible!! I remember playing this game as a kid and really enjoyed it and so we bought it for our almost-4-year-old daughter. She loves Candyland, UNO, matching games, Old Maid, Go Fish, Sorry, etc...but really does not like this game. We gave it to Goodwill after playing one time. The board is very hard to decipher (nothing like I remember as a kid) and it's simply too boring for her. Do NOT bother with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"takes too long","review":"I don't know if the board has changed, but as a parent of a 4 year old, I hate playing this. The board is like a big grid and my son gets confused as to which way he's headed. The spaces have numbers on them, but even I have to look at which row I'm in and when he turns a corner he thinks he's supposed to go up. I do like that the slides and ladders have pictures of rewards or punishments. We have more fun talking about the pictures than moving our pieces. My last complaint is how long it takes to finish a game. I feel guilty not playing it more often, but we just don't enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"This is a classic game all kid's should own and play with.

It's flaws make me curse this game every time my children ask me to play---if I could only find a simple gameboard from when I was a kid, we'd be fine. The game pieces are actually larger than the squares they travel on, which is very frustrating. The board is cluttered with unnecessarily large graphics, which make it very difficult for young players to see where they need to move. The slides and ladders overlap each other in several places, and obscure the numbered spaces, so often children cannot tell which way on the board to move. Skip this game, and save your sanity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"The cardboard spinner broke after a few plays, so we had to improvise and use a paper clip.

There was no damage and was deliver on time. The game itself as you can see from the picture is not like the original. This to me was no big deal at first until we started playing the game with our 3 year old daughter. The board is riddled with confusion constantly guessing which direction you need to be going do to the lack of indication. The player pieces are extremely large thus causing trouble for players to share a space. If 3 land on the same spot, forget it just put the others in the middle of the board or suffer frustration. The spinner works well enough to get the job done and there really isn't much more to say about this product other than make every effort to find the older version or at least a different one from this. :D Hope this helped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the second game most kids play for good reasons","review":"I was interested in which games were popular in a particular decade, but of course \\"Chutes & Ladders\\" has remained popular for so long because it relates to young children, not the children of a particular decade. I would certainly go along with the consensus that \\"Candy Land\\" is the first board game you buy your kids and \\"Chutes & Ladders\\" is the second.This game has three strong qualities which recommend it to small children. The first is simplicity, so that the child can easily understand it and start playing immediately. The second is luck, so that the child has a fair chance against older siblings, babysitters, parents, grandparents and the family cat. The third is repetition, so that the child can grasp the basic structure of such games and be prepared for those board games that are rites of passage down the road as they mature. As an added bonus, \\"Chutes & Ladders\\" certainly helps young children learn their numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"a must for the youngster in your family","review":"with its easy too follow instrutons and tiny parts you can eaily teach your children how to play many exciting self-mutilating games! I feel that some of the senarios are not very good for children to follow, i.e. the child is climbing the tall tree to rescue the small kitten without the use of a safety restraint incase the child may slip. Plus, now it is a popular drinking game found at many of the local colleges so you might want to order now while they are still in stock. Furthermore, the useage of eating too much and getting a stomach ache does not sit well with most of the obese society.

The revamped board is hard to follow and most 3 year olds can't count past 30 ish, so some directional arrows would be nice. Also, there are way too many chutes, most preschool kids want to play a quick game, not one they almost win, only to be thwarted by chute after chute. If a classic version exists, maybe, but this one is awful. I loved this game as a kid and was disappointed by this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Set Up","review":"I don't understand why, but this game has changed since I was a kid. The concept and game play is the same, but the board is terribly laid out. My young children cannot figure out which direction to go, and frankly, I have to look very carefully in order to help her. The game takes a long time to play, and often we get confused about direction and such, because the board is so busy and cluttered. I think Chutes and Ladders could use another revamp. I wish it was easier to play, like the version I remember from my own childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little kids favorite!","review":"As a kid my younger brother and I loved to play this game!

You move from left to right and then when you get to the end of the row you move up one space and then move right to left then on the next row you do the opposite again. The spaces are numbered but it is hard to read and my son obviously cannot follow the higher numbers. So you end up going one way and then you slide down and you have to go the other way. It is frustrating for us because we end up getting confused and having to redo the turn because we went the wrong way.The \\"water color\\" pictures are nice but it is sometimes hard to tell where you are supposed to be.Candyland is much clearer in this sense and my son has a lot of fun with that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Games Should Be Fun","review":"Games should be fun, but this one just is not. Not for me (no biggie), and not for my 4-yr-old. The numbers are difficult to read, the path is hard to follow, the graphics are too big and the colors are not great. My son can play Candyland and Cooties game after game after game, but he often wants to stop before completing even one, long, tedious round. Too bad - the older versions were more fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic!","review":"This is the classic Chutes and Ladders you know and love from when you were a kid. Bought this for a 4 1/2 year old boy. It was a little frustrating for him at first when he realized that getting to a chute means going backwards, but now that he's used to it, he enjoys the game. Helps him practice counting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could use a refresh","review":"This is a fun game, but as others have mentioned, it is easy for your piece to shift off your space, and cause you to forget where you were, and the grid has numbers that are a bit too small, making room for the illustrations. My 3.5 year old loves Candy Land, but slightly less enamored with this so far.I think it will turn out to be a good introduction to math tool in coming months.I suggest Hasbro refresh this game, with larger spaces and bigger numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy is visually confusing and very annoying to play","review":"I bought this for my son as a first game, and I've played it with him, as well as his younger sister, who is now 4 years old. I cringe every time they want to play this game. The board is so busy looking, and the slides cover squares that you need to count as you land on or pass by. It's confusing to kids about which way they're to go on the board (first they go left, then they go up, then they go right, etc.) I constantly have to help them count squares that are covered over by the slides, et al, tell them which direction to go, etc. This is not one of the best counting games out there. Try Hi Ho Cherry-O. MUCH better game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cute illustrations but difficult for pre-schoolers to play","review":"The best thing about this game are the graphics. Unlike many other games out there the illustrations are really adorable and astheticlly pleasing. But, like many games out there, the age grading is incorrect. The box says clearly the game is for pre-schoolers, but my 4 year old son can't possibly follow the track by himself. My 1st grade daughter is really getting a lot out of it though. Following the track to 100 is much easier for her and slightly educational as well. It's fun to play together, but Mom has to be there with the kids to help. Since I purchased the game to have something fun to do as a family, I have no problem sitting there showing my son how to count and where to put his game piece. If you want something for your pre-school age child to do independantly, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible graphic design - Don't waste your money","review":"The board for this game is TERRIBLE. The numbers are unclear, the spaces are too small and there's too much clutter. My daughter is age 5 and loves board games but she cannot follow this board. The players are way too big for this space. I definitely recommend the classic board rather than this one. Otherwise be prepared for constant frustration as the kids move in the wrong direction, skip spaces and get mad because they don't know which way to go.Such a disappointment because the original is such a fun game, but this redesign is AWFUL. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chutes and Ladders","review":"I bought this toy for my granddaughter. She really enjoys it.

Buy it if you don't want to have fun.","review":"I've played chutes and ladders at various ages in my life, from preschool all the way to adulthood, and the one thing that always stood out to me was how not fun this game was. Even as a four-year-old I didn't understand why other kids liked this game; I only played it because they wanted to. As an adult, I refuse to play this game with my four-year-old. We stick with checkers; it is less boring and better for her brain.I don't know why this game has stuck around for so long and become a \\"classic\\".

Then I saw The Moffatts on T.V. and then listened to this song. Now, every morning, my spirits are kinda torn when I wake up, but I just turn on this song and it just completely wakes me up and gets me ready for the day, week, month ahead.

To give you an idea about the size of the parts ;they are about 1/4 to 3/8 of and inch.

But, the writer's cramp...man. Forget it. That's when the game ended the life of Operation. And then, back to the closet, still collecting more dust. Sometimes, you see doubles.

While the images are small, so are the original paintings themselves, so it only serves the nature of her work to have them printed as such. I do wish the black and white copies of her work were in full color, but understand the need to have less in color in order to keep the cost of the book itself lower.

He could convey more pathos, psychological tension and mystery in his short, spare novels than most other writers could ever dream of.This book focusses on a typical Simenon character - a man broken by the events of his life who is barely floating through whatever remains of his time on earth. A bizarre vision propels him to write a journal that is really a lengthy suicide note. What follows is the delicate and deliberate reconstruction of a man's life.Poignant, disturbing, but never depressing. And highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it","review":"I'm a big fan of Simenon, in fact, he is the only fiction author that I read. First off the title has little to do with the story.

I use the clip-on's at the gym, in the car, at the office, around the block, on the plane. I wear them so I can hear the music plus the outside noise. Plus, earbuds are too big for my ears and hurt after about 30 minutes of use. I break the ear-clips off routinely no matter what brand or the amount I paid. For the price the sound on these are great, the volume control is critical for using in the office and they are stylish (everyone thinks I paid more for these than any others I have owned).

But for those in search of truth and guidance, I would recommend a search elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grief...","review":"Being the very pro-Second Amendment person that I am, it was impossible for me to like this book. There is a lot of false or slanted information in here, and the stastics are obviously biased. But the one main thing that turned me off of this book is his stance on the Second Amendment. He states that it applies only to states having the right to a militia. All of the other amendments in the Bill of Rights (free speech, freedom of religion, etc.) use the same language and are always interpreted to mean individual freedom, not state freedom. What makes this man think that the founding fathers would mean something different when they say that we have the right to keep and bear arms? This book gives no consideration to the arguments against gun control or to its proven lack of effectiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts? Where?","review":"I hate to admit it, but I finally found a book I couldn't finish. I spent quite a few years in law enforcement, and I honestly couldn't find support for Mr. Sugarmann's facts and numbers from any of my usual sources. I've never appreciated anecdotal evidence, and it does not serve anyone's interest in regard to such a serious topic. It appears that numbers have been twisted to fit an agenda. I can only advise a serious student of crime control to ignore this book as the propoganda it is. Research your own facts. I suggest the National Safety Council and the FBI. Sugarmann's assertions regarding suicide can be contradicted by any serious work on the subject. I tend to trust psychologists over Mr. Sugarmann.

For example on p.24 and p.25, the author made a comparison between percentage of people who oppose handgun ownership and that who OWN handguns nd draw a conclusion that the former outnumbered. This is an absurd comparison for reasons that I believe would be explicit for most people. Obviously not every person who supports handgun ownership is necesssarily a handgun owner.

Candyland is a classic for a reason. There are a few things I have found that are a little difficult for her. She had trouble with the special cards that move you forward or backward to the special character squares, so I just pulled them out of the deck for now. She has trouble figuring out which way is forward because the path squiggles around the board so much. Overall my daughter really enjoys this game and it's a tolerable game for parents. It's great for learning to take turns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over and over again!","review":"We have had this game since our daughter was 2 and she is now 4 and we still play it over and over again!

The game now has none of the magic of the version I played with in the '70s. The only positive thing, I suppose, is that the new characters are so grotesque they might put kids off candy.

We have heard all the wonderful reviews of Candyland. However, our experience was quite the opposite. Not one of our children enjoyed playing this game. Getting toward the end of the game and sliding back down to the bottom was overwhelming for our little ones. They became so frustrated that when they played Candyland someone always ended up in tears or they ended up fighting. Perhaps it is better if the children are older, but ours just never enjoyed Candyland."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't really HAVE to HAVE Candy Land.","review":"Of course, everyone had Candy Land, but when our just turned 3 yr olddaughter wanted to play, we wanted to run the other way...Boring...., and it is for her now, when after 2 weeks we purchasedmuch more challanging and interesting games. Also, it isn't made well. The game board isnot the same size as it was when we were kids, so the playing pieces are too big and overlap the spaces. The cards are notlaminated. And, after all the years this game has been around, why are there no children of color on the box/board? I hope they're not counting the brown lump of molasses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic fun","review":"I bought this for my 4 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas, and it is a family staple in our home. The price is right, and I like to add fantasies in that I had as a kid (having actual candy involved in the game). This is a good Christmas present because it's easy to wrap and you don't have to get a different box for it. Almost every child is bound to recognize it right away when they open it! Just like when we were all kids though, this game needs to be cared for. There is ample opportunity to lose game pieces or trash the board or box. Don't leave it out too long, it'll be like feeding it to the wolves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to put SKILL in Candyland.","review":"Each player draw a hand of three cards. Play a card out of your hand on your turn, then draw a replacement.A card may be played on either yourself OR another player. Note that a color card can only move any player forward; this is mainly useful for sticking opponents in the swamp, and so on.Other players can now send you to the swamp/pitfalls, but on the other hand, it is easier to get out with the greater card choices(It will also be easier to get on the Rainbow Bridge, which seldom happens in the regular game). There will be no more sending yourself back by drawing a special card, but other players will now be dumping the things on you if said things send you back- which should liven the game up.This variant can teach basic strategy skills, and make the game a little less simple for adults who get roped into it. But beware of teary three-year olds who get sent way back by -mean Mr. Mint- when they are about to win. (That would be -candy hearts- in the old game)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candy Land- fun for all ages","review":"My friends and I recently purchased this game, to bring back child-hood memories.

My husband and I were so excited about having a child to share this game with that we bought it when our son was 5 months old and we have played it a few times to show him what it is even though he's not old enough to play it. I'm positive he'll enjoy it when he's older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Ugly Redesign!","review":"Candy Land is a classic. It's only fun for kids from the ages of about 2 1/2 to 3 1/2. Once they really learn how to play it, they'll quickly realize they are too old for it. That said, it's a great game for teaching toddlers how to follow rules, take turns, recognize colors, and the basics of winning and losing.The downside is that the new redesign is horribly gaudy. The board is so busy, no wonder kids have ADD these days. It's like a still frame from a video game. Because there is so much clutter on the board, it's hard for even adults to follow the path sometimes and pretty much impossible for a 2-year-old.Do yourself a favor and get a vintage 70's or 80's era Candy Land on ebay. It's that bad. Trust me. I would have given this game 4 stars if not for the board redesign. Instead it get's 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original is better","review":"I much prefer the original.

I didn't want to add more cars and blocks to our toy bins, but he is not one for sitting still or following rules. We have a matching card game and he insists on picking cards until he wins without pausing. However, I thought I might as well try. He loves it! We play Candy Land at least once a day now, and after a day of frustration as he learned that he has to follow the rules, this game is one of his favorite passtimes. His younger sister, not yet two, likes to play along by picking cards and saying the color as I move her playing piece. Overall, I would recommend this as a gift for even wiggly little boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Isn't the Same","review":"This game was something I was anxious for my little cousin to experience since I had such fond memories of playing it as a child. When it was purchased however I was extremely shocked and disappointed by the changes. The gingerbread men had wider bottoms that overlap the board pieces, and the graphics were horrible. My favorite characters like Jolly and Grandma Nut were completely unrecognizable, and Plumpy was nowhere to be found. Plus there was a beaver, where'd he come from? My cousin enjoyed the game but I felt bummed. The nostalgia is just not there with this version. Why are they ruining all the great games with their ugly changes? Maybe it's just me and I focus too much on the looks of things, but the new version just didn't cut it for me.I suggest buying the retro version from Wal-Mart or an old game board online. My cousin enjoys the older version so much that we rarely use the newer designed board."},{"rating":"2","title":"A two year old can benefit from this game","review":"I bought this for my 25 month old niece. She could count to 10 already and knows her colors, I thought she may be able to play Candyland.I did not bother with teaching her about losing turns at this point, I will teach her that when she can comprehend it. She picks her own cards and knows how to move. At first we did not take turns. I taught her how to play a one player game, then we moved into taking turns. She can now play by herself and loves to get the candy cards as much as any other child. Instead of being stick in the mollasses swamp, she gets tickled...makes the game much more fun at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific game for beginners","review":"When your child wants to learn to play games like a big kid, but hasn't yet developed many game-playing skills, this is the answer. Most children know colors first, and that's all they need to play this game. Draw a card, and move your person to the next square of that color. The first one to the end wins. It isn't loads of fun for older children (or adults), but does give you a way to introduce the younger ones to game-playing concepts like taking turns and being a good sport. Still one of the best simple games around."},{"rating":"1","title":"When was the last time you played this?","review":"I have fond memories of playing this game as a child, but I don't know why. Have you played it recently with your own kids? You are NEVER going to get to the end. Even the kids can't hang in there on their never ending journey to Candy Land. They grow tired of it after reaching the candycanes. By the time you get to the last stretch of road and your hopes are high, you will inevitably pull a licorice card and be sent back towards the beginning. It never fails.The pros of Candy Land are:A) If your kid is able to hang in there, he/she would be reviewing their colors and countingB) Reaching Candy Land is JOYOUS because the misery has finally endedC) It teaches patience. Be patient, be patient, be patient, and you may eventually find your little plastic person standing in Candy Land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same great game","review":"This is the game that I loved as a kid, and when I had kids and they played it, it was still just as magical and fun.Now my 3 year old is just starting to enjoy it and I can't wait to play it with him regularly.That is a true test of a game... one that is still played and enjoyed in the next generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"","review":"This is such a great game!

They have ruined the game.- There is no longer any white space on the playing board. The path used to be made of large squares that wandered through a white/pastel candyland. Now, every inch of the board is covered in super-saturated graphics that make it hard to see the path, for us adults. It's like Where's Waldo but instead you are trying to find the path.- They have also made the squares smaller and put more of them on the board. Why, oh why, would they make this game LONGER? It's supposed to be a kid's first game. None of us could hang in there for the ETERNITY it took to get to the end.I am hiding this and going to look at yard sales for an older version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game has changed for the worse","review":"I had fond memories of playing this game growing up, so I was excited when my kids received it for Christmas. After opening the game, however, I'm not so excited. They have changed the board from the classic version; it is much more visually cluttered and Princess Lollypop and Queen Frostine look like Bratz dolls, which I'm not happy about..

Hear in Kreisleriana how she can swing from introspective sadness to euphoria so decisively. She can sure portray through her passionate playing how Robert fell hopelessly off the deep end for his future wife Clara - the dedicatee for his Byronic Fantasia. With those two you have the best of his piano writing. But she surrounds these with smaller works such as Traumerai to show up her tender poetry, Arabeske for her whispering filagree playing and the fiendishly tough Toccata to bring out her powerful bravura technique. The tricky thing with Schmuann is his chord texture and how quickly these leap around. Nissamn is so clean and fast with her crisp chording. All these gifts make her the ideal Schumann interpreter.Ian Dando.

It is a great counting game and does start to introduce a bit of strategy to a youngster. Whereas a game like Candyland seals your fate in the cards, this is a bit more open. We get a lot of play out of the set and it is a great deal for the money. I agree with the other review, yes, this is a much cheaper set than it used to be. Sort of flimsy and, of course, you still have to \\"put it together\\". But it takes about two minutes. And the pieces have holes this time around, probably saving a few kids from choking over the course of a decade. If your kids like this, move them up to Parcheesi (a more advanced race game) and then on to backgammon. Trouble really is Parcheesi lite. I highly recommend the junior Yatzee (Toy Story version) game. This is by far the best six bucks we ever spent on our kids relative to usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"The game is a fun to play, but my kids (6 and 3 years old) didn't quite get it. The board quality is pretty low (just a sheet of molded plastic over a piece of cardboard), and there is no place to hold the pieces besides the flimsy box the game comes in. I don't expect the pieces to stay with the board very long, and will probably have to use a ziploc or something to keep it all together.The game itself is fun. My 3 year old could push down the popper herself with some effort, and that was her favorite part of the game. I agree with others that younger kids will get frustrated not rolling a 6 to get a piece out of home. I allowed them 2-3 pops to give them a chance to play. The game is more fun with more people, but that also increases the chance of sending someone back to start. We tried to make it fun, but the kids weren't real happy about getting sent back after so much time trying to get out.I'd recommend it to others, but would think it more fun for 7-12 years old or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the original","review":"They sure don't make this like they used to. I played this game as a kid and remember it being much more sturdy , with a hard plastic bottom, and the popper not as flimsy. My son recieved this game as a christmas present, and most of the time the popper won't even pop the dice, and the game board it self is very flimsy. It doesn't even come in a hard sided box, just a thinly constructed jacket. Needless to say I'm very dissappointed in the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for preschool/kindergarten aged children","review":"My 5 1/2 yr old loves this game.

I have a four year old and a six year old, and it is nice playing a game that has begins to include skill as opposed to just luck (Candy Land, Chutes & Ladders). They both understand the game, but do have some problems popping the die, but can do it on a hard floor. On a carpet, they have too much trouble and the board deflects so much the pieces fall out. Also, the box is very lightweight cardboard compared to their other games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy game for families with young children.","review":"My husband and I play this game often with our nearly 3 & 5 year old daughters. The 3 year old gets bored with it fast and moves on to something else, but my nearly 5 year old can easily play the game all the way through. It's a nice way to spend some family time together while helping my daughter with counting skills and taking turns. Yeah she gets mad if she gets sent home and has to start over, but being able to lose is also another skill she needs to learn. I don't let my kids play with this game without parental supervison. The pieces are small and could be easily lost. And also the quality of this game is not like I remember it being when I was a kid.

She has learned a lot about counting and strategy - I think the educational value is high. And on a sweeter note, she's learning manners and sportsmanship in a really gentle way.

But I still enjoyed it very much. I think Jennifer Aniston 7 Adam sandler had a great chemistry together that I wasn't expecting. I'll admit, it dragged a bit in the middle. It was awkward to watch Adam Sandler's character create lie upon lie. But overall it was quite funny and I truly enjoyed it. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical latter-day Sandler","review":"A generic, formulaic, latter day Sandler with all the bad connotations all that entail. This one might be ever so slightly better as I laughed a total of 2 times, something I haven't done while watching a mainstream Sandler film for a decade or so, but even of those one was unintentional. What you see is what you get, no surprises, I can admit its a damn sight better than complete trash such as Little Nicky, Zohan, Mr, Deeds, Eight Crazy Nights and Jack & Jill combined, but still not really recommended for more than background noise as you do something else and certainly nowhere near as good as the wedding singer, happy gillmore or billy Madison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Go With It","review":"I've got to study this film carefully because the cinematographer and the lighting technicians made Jennifer Anniston look crazy gorgeous.

The Waterboy is still a favorite of mine, just so you know where I'm coming from. No laughs here. There are a couple of scenes in the beginning of this film that are cute, but the thing nose-dives very quickly. The writing and directing are horrible. The plot makes no sense. It's not funny; it's actually very annoying, and so are almost all of the characters. And it just goes on FOREVER. I'm convinced that the 5 star reviews I've read on here are plants. They HAVE to be. No one can honestly feel that this is a good comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst movie ever made.","review":"If I this were a theater I would have walked out and gotten a refund. It was predictable, dumb and the lowest common denominator of funny. poop jokes, really? And I am a fan of Jennifer. And Adam. But come on!So blondie is the one he thinks he wants but oh wait no! plain jane (yeah, right) Catherine (Jennifer) is the one he comes to realize was what?! Right there under his nose and the one her really loves. BORING. I knew it would be essentially that story anyway but I thought there might be some funny lines or cute parts. NONE. I bet they both drop this title off of their resumes like it never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"Don't waste your money on this movie.

Really? This thing? I was fidgeting almost from the get-go as I struggled to get through this flat Adam Sandler-Jennifer Aniston vehicle. You do get to watch singer Dave Matthews make his acting debut and tennis player Andy Roddick has a brief cameo as the new boyfriend of the love interest, who is his wife in real life. But that's about as comedic as this gets. Too much of the cute kids acting like adults. This was almost Disney-esque in its forced sweetness.

Still not impressed. This was a waste of film. The little girl that play Jennifer Aniston daughter is so annoying-severly overacting. Had to mute it everytime she talked. . She must be related to Adam Sandler. Jennifer Aniston did some overacting also-sorry Jen but you were only good in \\"Friends\\" (give up the movies) . But then again there are more annoying actors as (vince Vaghn and will Ferrell).

This one didn't, and that is doubly sad, as it is written by Billy's wife, Pamela. His Dickensian childhood is depressing, and the convoluted cast of family members is confusing. The prose styling is competent, but the sluggish pace of the book causes it to collapse under its own weight. I wound up skimming the last half (thank you Evelyn Wood!) The cover proclaims this to be a best seller, but I assume that was in England. Unless you are a real fan of Billy Connolly, I would skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Subject, Lousy Book","review":"The problem is that the author is the subject's wife. It really ought to be titled, \\"My husband is wonderful and we have lots of very famous friends\\". The book has neither the insight or observation of a third party biography nor the intimacy of an autobiography. Recounting things that her husband has told her just makes the reader want to push the author out of the way and let Billy tell the story himself. The great shame is that Billy is undoubtedly a fascinating subject and has a great story to tell. Unfortunately, this isn't it. A opportunity squandered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Insight","review":"I purchased this book with the hope of learning more about someone that I considered a very funny man. It did that and more. I am now more impressed then ever with the man that is Billy Connolly. He started from nothing and achieved what he wanted. I think there are valuable lessons to be learned in his \\"take no for an answer\\" attitude.The start of the story is slow and it is occasionally tough to keep track of all the family members that played a role in Billy's life. Overall, the path to success that was travelled is a marvellous adventure, which Pamela Stephenson has captured.A spectacular read for any fan of Billy Connolly."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly about billy","review":"Never has so little been made of so much. As a psychological profile of a complex man who has reached great heights depsite awful childhood abuse, the book is worthless. As a biography, it is sketchy and hardly to be taken seriously. Moreover, it is not always accurate, which is amazing given his wife being the author; for example, in the film \\"The Impostors,\\" Billy Connolly played a wrestler on a cruise ship not a tennis player on a train, as stated in the book. That is not even the worst of the book; most grating is the constant, very often unnecessary name dropping -- we are obviously supposed to be impressed with the list of Billy and Pamsy's friends. It's too bad, I have followed and enjoyed Billy Connolly's work since the 1970's and he is a marvellous and unique talent and would make a wonderful subject for a true biographer and someone who could write. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information, very inspiring, but repetitive","review":"Joyce Meyer tells it like it is, from her abusive childhood to her problems as a wife, mother, and minister. She offers practical tips for overcoming any kind of abuse. She also shows how Jesus will work in your life, if you allow Him. I haven't placed sticky tabs in a book in years, but when reading this book, I had to grab a pack. There's so much information I want to review! She also provides helpful prayers for each step in the forgiveness process.However, the book did get some repetitive, and that made it tedious. She also throws in A LOT of parenthetical explanations in nearly each Bible verse she quotes. This is distracting.Nevertheless, if you want a hopeful look at forgiveness, if you want to know GOD is rooting for you and wants you to have the best, then definitely read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great message!","review":"this series was very healing for me and my family. definately a must audio book to own.

But her words are trite and cliche, and alas I was too bored by her 'Sunday school' answers and explanations to even complete this book.

There are some who never get it and those that don't even realized they missed it. This book gave me a lesson in life that I want to share with all of the children that I have the priveledge of sharing this journey with.

It does have lots of stories in it, which is helpful and maybe the most interesting part to myself.The overall premise feels a bit stretched to me....of emphasizing Big lessons from Small verses in the Bible. I struggled with that aspect, feeling like it was an okay opinion, but a bit shaky to persist in it's importance.The book deals with \\"blessing\\" or loving/accepting your children by words, action, touch, and tone. The vaild point of the book is, as children, we want our parents to love us unconditionally and accept us. That I agree with. Yet as far as needing to \\"Bless\\" our kids, I got a bit lost in the authors jargon.I suppose, overall, I am showing my \\"Minnesotaness\\" and would rate this book as a bit too \\"feely\\" or \\"froofroo\\" for my taste.

In it he explained his theory of dating which it turns out is his theory of not dating.After writing the book he didn't follow his own theory instead he did what he thought right in his own eyes, and then wrote this book about how what he actually did do was the best thing to do.In this second book he tries to fudge the difference between what he said in \\"I Kissed Dating Goodbye\\" and what he says in this book. When he did meet someone he wanted to date it was apparently somehow different to what he prescribes for everyone else in \\"I Kissed Dating Goodbye\\".So does Harris have something useful to say in this second book?

When you think you're ready for marriage and want to do things God's way, which, by the way, is radically counter cultural, then pick up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Perspective...A Breath of Fresh Air","review":"Josh Harris' books (Boy Meets Girl and IKDG) have truly been inspired by God. Evidence that they \\"work\\" is seen in Josh's love and devotion to Sharon (his wife). I pray to someday have a relationship as fulfilling as theirs. As a Christian girl who lost her virginity at 18, and became pregnant, married, divorced, and a single mother this year at age 19, i needed a new, FRESH perspective on sex. It was obvious that the world's ideas were wrong... very wrong. The chapters on purity and overcoming past sins have helped me to forgive myself, AND give me something to look forward to in the future. I wish I'd read these books in highschool. So far, I've bought 2 more copies of Boy Meets Girl, and 3 copies of I Kissed Dating Goodbye. I'm lending them out to everyone i can think of, INCLUDING my ex-husband. Buy the books, Read the books, and Share the books. Stop \\"dating\\" and experience the sheer JOY of trusting in the Lord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ties up loose ends","review":"This book is a much welcomed follow-up to \\"How I Kissed Dating Goodbye.\\" It clears up some of the \\"problems\\" many readers had with the first book. I found the suggestions in this book to be rather practical and sound, and it is an enjoyable read with some rather touching stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for Singles!","review":"While there are negative comments about how the author has little experience or his suggestions are outrageous on how to create a healthy relationship before marriage, I think the author does a good job using his own experiences that were Biblically based and delivering good suggestions for couples thinking about courtship or marriage. The author does caution the reader in certain areas, such as kissing or not kissing before marriage. This is an area that is based on the individual and we do not have to take everything in the book literally. He gave his own experiences and decisions and some things may not apply to another couple. Overall, I think this is a great book. I am not looking to get married over the next year and I am not even in a relationship. The book was excellent, however, in putting on the mindset of living more Godly and portraying characteristics of a Godly woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"If Joshua Harris is advocating courting based on his willingness to serve God, why does the first chapter of this book deal with how he fell in love with a woman based on factors in her physical appearance like her eyes and her height? He says he was ready for marriage and so he started courting; and yet he had not seriously spoken with this woman! Plus, nervously calling and asking her out sounds like....uhoh..a date.The appeal of this book among young readers especially bothers me. It is geared toward older persons who are ready for marriage. What are younger readers supposed to do during the important years in which they are discoving and developing their sexual feelings?I gave BMG two stars because of the way this couple has chose to live a Godly life and practice what they preach. Otherwise, all of Mr. Harris's fuss over the wisdom of courting seems strange and convoluted in comparison to the ways of most Christians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joshua does it again!","review":"I consider this book very well-writen and well-put. Josh knows what he's talking about! I hope God leads me in a similar way that He led Mr. Harris. His definition of courtship is preferable over dating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awwww, too cute!","review":"My husband and I read this together while we were dating. It helps get your mind going in the right direction to have a wonderfully healthy courtship. Ironically, I finished reading \\"I kissed dating goodbye\\" just a week before I met my husband. So of course I recommend reading that one, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare Yourself for Forever","review":"\\"Are you ready for forever?\\" is the question Joshua Harris asks in his newest book, boymeetsgirl. In his first book, I Kissed Dating Goodbye, Josh explained why he felt God had called him to put aside dating for pleasure, and why he began to reevaluate his relationships with a more serious, biblical attitude. In boymeetsgirl, Joshua relates the story of his own courtship and engagement with his wife Shannon. Topics he covers include: dating vs. courtship, letting God direct your decisions, why communication is vital to every relationship, and embracing biblical roles of manhood and womanhood. This book is based on Scriptural principles regarding love, relationships, and marriage. Coming from a fresh perspective, Josh relates well to singles of all ages. He is fun and entertaining while still bringing to light important, neglected issues. Prepare yourself for forever with boymeetsgirl!(also check out his great web site: www.joshharris.com)"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"Dating and Courting isn't it all one in the same? It's all the same, just different words are used. There is \\"trial\\" courting which is the same as casual dating. I feel that in many ways this book is written for those raised in the church, and not everyone is raised like that. What about those that don't have godly parents? Whom should they go to guidance? Its unrealistic in many ways. It's a good starting point for teens but I feel that the author misses the mark in other ways. I liked, \\"When God Writes Your Love Story by Eric and Leslie Ludy\\" much better. Its more realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world is missing out","review":"I believe that the world is missing out on the right way to finding their spouse. I know from personal experience and others around me that the popular view on finding a husband/wife is to date as many people as you can to see what is out there, and then when your old enough, make a decision on what you want. I personally don't have these views anymore but I know that many people still do. In a sense, it is a way of not trusting God. Relying on oneself in finding a mate is foolishness in my opinion because we are only humans who make many mistakes. We see divorce everywhere and everyday. Relying on God is a more wise decision. He knows us better than we know ourselves. Giving him the ability to bring our mate to us allows us to be wise and also be in God's will. Courtship blocks out all the sexual worldviews and actions in dating and brings God into the relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compare to other sellers claims before deciding","review":"Binoculars appear to be well constructed but at 3-1/4 pounds are heavier than the 2 pounds claimed by Sharper Image. The field of view is very small. When fully zoomed I am unable to hold the binoculars steady without holding them against something because of their weight. The adjustments are not quick or easy to make. If you do buy these you should consider buying the tripod to hold them steady while you look through them. Sharper Image would not respond to my e-mail inquiry about incorrect weight claims by them. Their telephone customer service people did not provide any assisitance either.Won't make this mistake again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Face","review":"Just a lousy product.

It was made of very very thin plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Helen Carey's done it again, what a great book a good follow up too the other two Lavender Road and Some Sunny Day, i am waiting for the next one to come out, she cant leave us hanging we have to know what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed all three books in this series so far.

Looking forward to the next one.:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Knowledge","review":"While playing this game for the first time, and using less than one quarter of the supplied cards, our family found four cards with incorrect answers. For example, one card claimed that Grand Prix races take place not on the road but on an oval track. Another claimed that radar, not sonar, uses sound waves to detect objects. Another spelled the Ebola virus as \\"E boli\\". The fourth card had an answer that was correct, but was not the only correct answer, as was claimed. The makers of this game would do well to hire a fact checker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very pleased with this product","review":"There were good and bad things about this product. I liked that it had easier questions for children, but the questions were a big problem. They asked like 3 questions on blue whales, and missed many other important areas of science and nature. I found the adult questions to be laughably easy (there were a lot of true/false questions), or so obscure or unclear that they were not \\"fair\\" questions. I think that a game like trivial pursuit while it does not offer easier questions in the standard set for children, has much better thought out questions that are consistent and cover a broad range of topics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"knowledge is good, but...","review":"My 9-year old daughter loves the game. Personally I find in infintely better than the awful trivial pursuit but I still think it could be better: the science questions are generally too easy (my kids get the adult questions with ease) and they are sometimes flawed or unclear. There is a fair bit of content that is strongly biased to US culture, especially the sports stuff, and I find it the least appealing part of the game. The board itself could be better but it's fairly irrelevant since it just provides an excuse to ask the questions. Overall the concept is good and it's one of the better games of its type, but the questions could be better. It clearly has educational value and little or no downside."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay..","review":"The game is good but the directions are not.

We read some together last night with my 4 year old son, and all of us were not happy with the language. The first chapter is titled \\"I hate school\\". My kids like school, and I don't want them hearing about kids that \\"hate\\" school, or anything else! My daughter asked me to say \\"don't like\\" as a substitute for all of the times the word \\"hate\\" was used. Also the word \\"dumb\\" was used often, which is not a word that we like either. My kids seemed to not really like the book because of the language, and I think I will be passing this book on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crazy Life","review":"I think that everyone should read Miss Daisy Is Crazy because it's a fun book.

You can't go wrong with 36 songs at this great price. They are re-recorded by original artists so some of them sound just a hair different than the original versions but not enough that most people would care. With a big range including greats like Badfinger, Grass Roots, Sweet, Rare Earth, the Miracles, and many more, this is a set that is more than worth the money. It contains a fantastic alternate version of 'Hello It's Me' by Todd Rundgren (featuring Edgar Winter) with horns, which surpasses the original. Buy this set if you love 70's rock and pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"You say toy, I say learning tool.","review":"I purchased this product to use as a training tool for adult education.

If you email me, I would give you this no good movie for free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ti Lung the Master!","review":"Everything about this movie makes it a Classic: the story line, the way it was filmed, the fight scenes, Ti Lung! What's so hot about this movie is that Ti Lung is defeating fighters with & without his sword! His kung fu style is sick and his sword play is even better. Him having to run through a gauntlet of fighters to finally fight the head swordsman is the highlite of the movie. Their are really good morals to this movie too; \\"better be carefull of what you ask for\\"!

Playing a bit with more complicated There is a progression in the mood of the songs, from a feeling of opening one's eyes in the morning on the first track, Muddied Up, to going to bed to the sweet-voiced sounds of Supernature on a Superhighway.This is an album that, once heard thoroughly, will grow on you.

It did have good info on restaraunts.Look at a few other books or citisearch for the latest and greatest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"There is no way that this book could be deemed jam-packed. In fact, most of the pages are only half-filled. Each two-page \\"chapter\\" is based around a quote that is very loosely tied to a topic that may or may not have anything to do with busniess. If you want to get something out of your time and money, look for books by Seth Godin, Barbara Corcoran, and Tom Peters. They really entertain as well as inform their readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many typos. Plot is lost by Chapter 4.","review":"The book starts well. The scene is set nicely in the first two chapters and the authors promise you the earth. Then they seem to loose the plot. Not only do they get bogged down with too much detail and not enough overview, but lots of little mistakes seem to creep into the text. It's a pity but it seems that the book was never passed by an editor. For instance, in Chapter 4 on page 136 the authors promise to 'have a lot more to say about threading models at the end of this chapter (see the section named COM Threading Models)'. The only problem being there simply isn't a section named COM Threading Models in this or any other chapter! Furthermore, one might pardon one broken promise in one page but to do it twice is unforgiveable! Later in the same page, the authors refer to the same imaginary section!!But such mistakes and omissions are not confined to this chapter. The authors simply leave the reader bewildered and disappointed. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's got to be a better one","review":"I was not impressed with this book. The 'unusual\\" introduction using a BLOB to explain COM was dreadful. Basically, I didn't like the author's writing style, and lost confidence in his explanations of the subject. There were errors in the text. Maybe it's just me, but I am annoyed with little things like not naming something correctly, such as saying the \\"A\\" in ATL means \\"ActiveX\\" instead of \\"Active\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Easy To Impossible In One Page!","review":"I am an entry level developer and I am trying to grasp this COM/DCOM stuff. This book was recommended but it just doesn't help. The book starts off with what looks like a nice easy intro to COM and DCOM then jumps to a hole lotta hoopla, what is going on? The code examples are difficult to follow and do not make sense unless you know what you are doing. They jump from topic to topic and mainly confuse the reader. I do not recommend this book unless you have a good understanding of ActiveX and COM already. And if you are not experienced with Visual C++, don't even bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for C++ COM engineers","review":"The book covers in-depth COM programming and does it in readable form.

I have played that song a million times and it never fails to induce a giant surge of 'happy' every time I hear it. I also love dc Talk's version of \\"I Wish We'd All Been Ready.\\" The poignant lyrics are enhanced dramatically by their beautifully sung and haunting vocals. There's also a hard-driving song by Audio Adrenaline for the teen, and a good variety of music from other very talented artists. \\"Horses\\" by Margaret Becker is an upbeat song with a neat rhythm about being ready when the horses come for us! \\"Eve of Destruction\\" by Barry McGuire is an unusual song with unique word construction, an infectious melody, and raspy, desperate vocals that combine perfectly to declare the sadly ironic state of the world today. I am extremely pleased with this cd and highly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired collection inspires me!","review":"What I found so great about this cd, besides the great music and even greater message, was the variety of artists that are featured here. There is literally something for (just about) every musical taste here. From sweeping ballads (\\"I Wish We'd All Been Ready\\" - dc Talk), to alternative pop-rock (\\"New Body\\" - Audio Adrenaline) to R & B gospel-soul (\\"People Get Ready\\" - The Impressions and \\"Jesus is Waiting\\" - Al Green). Barry McGuire adds a gritty Bob Dylan flare to his rendition of \\"Eve of Distruction\\" and Cyrstal Lewis lends her beautiful vocals to the opening and title track \\"People Get Ready\\" (a different song from the one The Impressions do later in the disk).The hugely popular book series has already inspired many with it's gripping and exciting end-times story line and spiritual message. This collection is a fitting tribute indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Do It Much Better Than This","review":"People Get Ready is all about songs about God's return.

The tragedies and sorrows just kept coming and coming! I mean, I don't need for the books I read to be all sweetness and light, but this was ridiculous. It seemed to be a test of how much misery one human being can endure before they give up and/or kill themselves. True, the romance was there, and it was powerful, but - jeesh!!So, to sum up, if you're an avid reader of depressing Oprah-recommended fare and tragedy in general, this book is all for you.As for me and my reading buddies, we're saying, AAHHHH!! and running the other way.

Why would you want to be with someone that you absolutely cannot tell the truth to, all under the guise of it \\"being for their own good?\\" This makes for such a frustrating and contrived plot.In addition, there was no real explanation for why the brother failed to come forward with what he had seen, other than he resented his sister because Daddy loved her best?

This book gives a detailed account of Selena's life. Unfortunately, it seems to be based on rumors, not necessarily all facts. It does give lots of details, but it jumps around a lot and is kind of difficult to follow. Also, since Selena's family did not authorize this book, it is hard to believe this book word for word. The worst part is the author goes into great detail about how upset Selena's father Abraham Quintanilla is about people just trying to make money off of his daughter's death by selling unauthorized t-shirts, posters (including ones of Selena in her casket), tapes, and books, yet the author fails to admit that he himself is doing the same thing.

I will go back to my original vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shelter Logic replacement cover","review":"So easy to purchase a replacement cover for our Shelter Logic Canopy. We use this as a carport/cover for our Trailmanor 3124 KS. Great product...great price!!! We are now on our third shelter logic cover. We still love it...but they will rip because of wind. The trick is to check that the bungee cords stay taught. If they become stretched then we get rips. Ours came with the tan color but this time we bought it in white to see if it lasts any longer. Time...will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"This replacement tarp does not fit","review":"This replacement tarp won't fit your frame, if it's not a Shelter Logic frame. It is cut too small. Plus, and this is what I hated most, it does not have any grommets on the ends. The ends of the tarp are held in place only by the drawstring over the frame.

Only downside is the lack of grommets at the ends, there is a shock cord threaded there, i just prefer grommets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firestorm","review":"The heroine, Reyne, seemed to be a bit childish and silly, and the author's excuse for that was that she had watched some of her fire crew die. The hero is a bit arrogant and seems to think he's just too charming for anyone. Also, the relationship advances way too quickly. I don't really think it was all that bad, but just not my type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Read","review":"I enjoyed this book by Ms. Bergren. Although I don't know very much in regards to firefighters and smokejumpers, etc, that deal with large forest fires, I'm rather intrigued by all the science that goes along with it. I enjoyed learning a bit about what goes on behind the scenes of something like this. While this book was toted as a romance, I didn't see much between the main characters to really make me believe in their affection for one another.**Spoiler**The short story that resolves the situation that happens to Matt and Hope did evoke an emotional response from me, and I'm very glad it was included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firestorm","review":"Firestorm follows the life of hotshot boss Reyne Oldre. After a tragic encounter with a major firestorm, Reyne builds her walls, hides behind her fears and becomes a no nonsense kind of girl. She leaves the front lines and becomes a fire specialist. Along the way, Relyne battles her way through all that she encounters. Including Logan McCabe, a smoker jumper, with undeniable charm.When a second fire threatens all that she holds dear, Reyne needs to choose to give her fears to God, or hide behind her well built walls.I often find myself cringing at what I call the \\"cheese factor\\" of Christian Romance, while this book had a few of those moments, growing up as a firefighters daughter, and now the wife a firefighter; this book grabbed me and held on for dear life.Follow Reyne as she battles through fires, life, loss and love.This book was provided free of charge by Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers in exchange for this honest review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the plot and characters in this book.","review":"Firestorm is the story of Reyne Oldre. She suffers guilt and fear because of an accident involving fire and doesn't want to be involved with it again. However, when she is forced to work with Logan on a research project working to make firefighting safer for smoke jumpers, she finds herself being pulled back into that world.I thought the author did a great job at creating compelling and realistic scenarios with the firefighting, and I especially enjoyed that aspect because my husband has done some work on fire crews, although he's never been a smoke jumper.Firestorm is the 6th book in the series, and while there were certainly times I wished I'd read the previous ones, this book is a stand alone novel and can be enjoyed even if you haven't read the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Speed","review":"I guess if you are religous this book is okay.

I have 3 kids and several pets and vacuum every day. This vacuum picks up NO animal hair or food particles unless I remove the hose and use it as an attachment.

Safety-wise it has proven 5 stars, walking through the clubhouse is safe. The stools to sit on have been 'added toys' to his play as he likes to roll them down the slide....!Putting it together took about 45-60 minutes by my husband and a little help from me. Hard to find some of the screw holes at times but we had no problem making our own when we gave up looking for the assigned spot! Overall I recommend this clubhouse, and the more little friends to play in it, the more fun it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Hazard","review":"We ordered this climber for our preschool. The first thing we noticed was that the parts that were supposed to lock together didn't. We wanted to add several more screws to make it more secure, but had a hard time finding long enough ones. The second problem was that we live in a windy area and the whole structure blew over several times. When it blew over, the connecting tunnel fell apart and we needed to reassemble most of the structure each time it tipped over. When it tipped over, the plastic broke where the bridge railing was screwed into the tower. This prevented us from being able to re-secure the railing. There is no way to weigh it down or anchor it to the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I would give this 5 stars if it weren't for the expensive price tag. Wouldn't be so bad if free or reduced cost shipping was available. 25% of item cost is shipping. Otherwise, great product especially for children under 3 that are not quite ready for the big slides or swings but are out of the \\"baby\\" stage and are walking. This in combination with a swing set should keep the little ones occupied for for several years. My 18 month old loves it and the crawl space underneath is a great place for peak-a-boo! The only other complaint I have is that the \\"chairs\\" are a hazard and should be made to be bolted to the floor. These slide out from under her when she attempts to sit on them and they are made to go with the table which is a foot from the slide opening, so as you can imagine your child trying to climb or sit on the \\"chair\\" and it slides out from under them or tips over and they tumble down the slide. (didn't happen to my child because I took them out before it could)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept, needs to be bigger!","review":"My 2 year old is 37 inches tall (He just turned 2 in early June)... He will probably outgrow this in a year. I love it, it is made well, but the should scale it up a few sizes for more years of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Climber...with a few issues","review":"My husband and I bought this climber for out 23 month old son. Step 2 claims this climber is for ages 2-8 but I think 2-5 is probably the maximum. My son is small to average for his age and it fits him perfectly at his current size. He likes playing in it except when it gets wet and water pools in the steps up to the clubhouse. Since this is the only way onto the climber, without climbing up the slide, he doesn't like to use it when this happens.It was very easy to put together so I really like that. If we can get a few years out of it and sell it for half what we paid I think it will be a very good investment. We have a long narrow yard, so this was a great option for us instead of a large swingset. Fits well and there is still pleanty of room for other fun outdoor toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"real good","review":"Two big boxes, Took a little over two hours,Went together fine.Did it myself,but make sure you built it in the area you want it becouse once together it is heavy and arkward to move.Most important ,the kids love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding band, great cd","review":"This was one of the few bands from the late eighties/early nineties that I was sure would make it big. I had a cd with a couple of tracks from the Only Breathing/cloudfactory album. Up, With You, etc. and loved it. When I heard Toyboat (in 1990)I was blown away. Because every song on here is enjoyable and different from the other ones, I rate this as one of my favorite cd's.

The material is a heavy, soft cotton, it's stitched well, comes generously stuffed and there is a zipper on the side so you can adjust the heighth by removing some of the filling.I feel very stable and grounded on this cushion. I'd been sitting on flat ground for two years, before finally breaking down and buying a zafu, that I almost feel spoiled with this. It's made meditation much more enjoyable for me.

There is very little information of use to the hobbiest included in this work. So basic a fact as the size the fish reach is missing. Many of the fish shown are never or very rarely available to the hobbiest. Years ago TFH published a book, I beileve the title was \\"The Fishes of Lake Karibi\\". This book had nothing to do with the aquarium hobby, but rather was a study of the commercial fishery on this lake.

It covers the three main types of Retirement Plans: Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS) and Employer Sponsored Plans (of many types).

It's filled with crunching power chords and Mott the Hoople and Kinks inspired pop songs (in fact, they pay homage to Mott the Hoople by recording a killer cover of All the Way to Memphis). This is a fun album of crunchy, punky rock songs, and it is a great indie album (from before indie was the 'in' thing). I recommend this album, but I'd make a suggestion to check out Supercluster: The Big Dipper Anthology first because it has a much wider assortment of songs to choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This book is powerful, and when I found out that the woman who wrote it was only 22 when she published it, I was awe inspired.

I recommend this book to EVERYONE who loves to read poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offensive","review":"The Hard Ride is a fitting title for this book. It is apparent that the author has been to \\"hell\\" and back. Her book is filled with opinions of life, good, bad, and EXTREMELY offensive. She will certainly get your blood flowing. I read this book as a dare, from a friend who thought it was great, but has very different taste than I do. I can honestly say, I was offended by much of it, but my friends who have read it really enjoyed it. I guess it is art, and art is subjective...

This book is way more than about romantic love, it's about life.Ms. Schaeffer's insights are simple and wise. And new. I often shook my head in amazement while reading. Her knowledge is extensive and could be a bit too meaty and in depth, but her writing is lyrical and easy.

The opening chapter describing the plane crash was breathtaking. I wouldn't take too much notice of the supernatural aspect of Amanda's powers - they are not the main story line.Mind you I just saw a telemovie called Sole Survivor based on a Dean Koontz novel and the similarities between the 2 stories is amazing. The similarities are enough to make you believe in the supernatural :) Both feature plane crashes with sole survivor, a child that can heal the sick, a sad lonely guy that helps save teh girl, bad guys chasing them.

Although the protagonists are wounded souls who are well drawn, the plot reads too much like a screenplay for an action movie. The bad guys are all bad, and there is no redemption for them. As in Klavan's most recent book, \\"Man and Wife\\", a character becomes almost a Christlife figure, giving up his own life for another.As the plot unfolded, I began to hope that Amanda would use her special gifts to heal the bad guys, to change them into loving and life-affirming characters. That would be the greater miracle, and a more ingenious plot twist than those Klavan has concocted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems hurried.","review":"Picked this up because the title caught my eye. Although it was somewhat entertaining and certainly a quick read, I find it hard to recommend this book. The character development is poor and left me wondering why in the world someone like Lonnie Blake would ever be interested in a Carol Dodson. Or why a man who has just taken over the American branch of a \\"killer for hire\\" corporation would become so obsessed with Dodson. Or why it's necessary to kill everyone in the path of finding Carol, as if this wouldn't attract some sort of attention.Combine that with the \\"made for TV movie\\" style writing and you get a book that wasn't as satisfying at all. At one point he describes a background character as a \\"doofus\\" and I began to wonder how old the person who wrote this was. All in all, the book seemed rushed to publication, as if the author had no time to think and write the story out the way he wanted.Sorry Mr Klavan, but this one needed a lot of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spine-Tingling Excitement","review":"This book made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.

I read the intro/prolougue out loud to my husband I was so impressed. But that excitement quickly waned. The same scenes were described over and over again in succession as the bad guys offed yet another completely innocent person. I found myself longing for this book to get it over with so I could move on to better things. Then, all of the sudden it was over. I think maybe I'm missing some chapters. They get in the helicopter and fly away and that's it?!? Excuse me, but that's like getting half-way through the ninth inning and then having the teams walk off the field before it's over.In short, it seems like the author only had enough original material for 2 or 3 chapters. Maybe he should stick to short story writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"impressively awful","review":"The premise at the heart of this book is unbelievable, the characters are lifeless, and the plot is ridiculous.

The beginning is excellent and really gets you involved but I found myself less and less interested in the plot as it unfolded. I didn't like the main character (Lonnie), and I just couldn't root for him. The villian is so evil you know the whole time he's going to die an awful, dramatic death. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing exciting","review":"I was expecting this book to be a definate page turner with the main character falling for a prostitute who is on the run. The opening of the book is brilliant - a little girl (Amanda) is caught in a strange storm and goes off into the woods. The rest of the book is about Lonnie Blake, a musician, who helps out a prositute (Carol Dodson) one night and eventually falls for her. But Carol is hiding her daughter, Amanda, from many people, for reasons that are apparent throughout the story and Lonnie helps out both of them.I was disappointed with this book, it was hardly exciting plus by the end of it I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters, I pushed myself to finish it, but the ending was no surprise.Not recommended if you are after an excellent thriller, bypass this one and head on over to anything by Dennis Lehane or Michael Connelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SMALL!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This must be for an infant, not a toddler.

However, the concepts and imagery within are fascinating, especially some of the more disturbing sexual acts. The novel--more of a novella in terms of size--is a bit ridiculous at times, but overall a curious and interesting read. Good for those bored with current erotica or in need of something to shock friends with."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant story reflecting erotisism and philosophy","review":"This story opens up your mind to a lot of theories in philosophy and erotisism. At some points I didn't know exactly what I was getting into..the bluntness of unusually lude acts can be really abrasive at times..but it is also irresistable, you simply cannot stop reading..and it is such a short story..I ended up reading it twice in one day..the way it all comes together in the epilogue is really interesting. This book created a huge interest in philosophy for me..I've read several of his other books on philosophy, death, and erotisism..very insightful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing piece of literature","review":"Although my own personality can best be described as one of near-Victorian prudery, I was awed by the literary skill displayed in this volume. It has been a full decade since my first encounter with this work; many re-readings later, I often recall with chaste laughter many of its finest lines...\\" 'No,' replied Sir Edmond, with a categorical intonation.\\"\\"Each day I raped a likewise transformed Simone, ESPECIALLY TOWARDS NOON.\\" [*laughing*]\\"Please protect me when the Cardinal returns.\\"And many other such lines... Even if you detest as I do the seedy vermin-like undercurrents of life which many confuse with true eros, you will be dazzled by the beauty and humor of this miniature masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A splendid tale of initiation","review":"Quite apart from the gruesome details, this is a wonderful story of a prolonged initiation to oversexuality. And also of the writer's initiation to writing, as this is his first book. Bataille plays with the goriness as if trying to find out how far his pen can go, just as we all did on couches when our parents were away. Literaturewise, however, there's nothing much in it. Anyone over 25 will find it tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your curiosity is piqued one iota, get this book.","review":"Here is a masterfully rendered piece of erotica. Manifold psycological implications, however at first read there is a draw in his style that I've not discovered in any other erotic writer. Picture yourself reading along, builing in anticipation and excitement, and, whammo, it hits you: you've just been turned on by an eyeball removed from its socket. And then, here's the trick, you keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like blood and pee","review":"When I bought this book I thought it was going to be wildly erotic. I think a lot of amazon book reviews are misleading. But, I guess it's different strokes for different folks. If you think blood,gore, people urinating on each other and people mutilating a priest and an animal and driving an innocent insane is sexy then this book is for you. I would give it minus 10 stars if it was possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"consider","review":"\\"Bataille denudes himself, exposes himself, his exhibitionism aims at destroying all literature.. . In him, reality is conflict.\\"--Jean-Paul SartreYes. That is on the back of the book. Well, the back of the one most of us these days probably read. So, why is it that nearly every comment on this site has given THE EYE literary treatment? Is it that they do not agree with Jean-Paul Sartre? Well, if that's the case, they'd better go read his books first. And what about those who've already read Sartre's books? Well, then they already know. Know what? Well, that this is not literature. Or rather, this is literature aimed to bring to mind the falsehoods of other literature. Bataille is mocking the 'upright man' of Hugo's works, of all literature, because that's not REAL. Bataille belongs to the class of Sartre. THE EYE is a view of human nature likened to when one opens a book (as one looks into a soul), he reads. . . and finds NOTHING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating In The Extreme--I'm Still Traumatized After 7 Yrs","review":"If you're looking for something appalling for sheer shock value, this is the book for you. It's been 7 yrs since I've read this story and I still get the creeps just thinking about it. This story is a non-stop depiction of murder as an erotic agent."},{"rating":"2","title":"georges, georges, georges... man o man","review":"Eyes, eggs, bull's balls. The whiteness and yellowness of the depraved universe in which we swim.Where to start? Bullfights appall me. But women sitting in plates of milk I find rather appealing. And priests being brought face to face with their own inherent lust... well, it probably doesn't bother me as much as it should.If you're having a bad day, just be glad you aren't Georges Bataille. The man lived in constant agony, and he suffered for his art. I am annoyed by snarky people on this website who whine that this book didn't fulfill their preconceptions. If it did, you should see a psychiatrist.Georges Bataille was an extremely strange man. And the most strange thing about him was that he was ALIVE, and did not prune down his obsessions in order to match his neighbors' lawns.Good on you, Georges. Thank you for your sacrifice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story wasn't worth price of book","review":"If you're into Marquis de Sade type shock value, this book is up your alley. It's a little confusing, and not at all erotic, well, I wasn't turned on by it...it was worth reading, but not for that price. It was only 100 pages and there's more books continuing the storyline, so it kinda leaves you hanging..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone like this book?","review":"This book has no artistic value whatsoever. You may as well buy a porn magazine. Even if you can get past all the disgusting sexual details, there is no substance to the story. It's extremely disturbing and twisted. I felt guilty just reading it. Don't buy this book if you have a weak stomach or if you like the books you read to have a plot or some kind of meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless to say the least","review":"My first major problem with this book is the plot; yea, there isn't one. Yes it contains a lot of lewd porn, but that might not have been so bad had there actually been a storyline to this novel. There was no character development (except for the minor character development concerning the character of Marcelle) and a lack of character analysis. My second problem with this book is the revolting scences. Pissing on others is not something most people find erotic and neither are many of the other scences. The author seems childish, immmature and very underdeveloped. Of course there is also the possiblity that I just dont understand what he is trying to prove or say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Georges Bataille is one of the best. He defended Henry Miller with the censorship charges he was facing and actually gave up his anonymity of this book to help the case. Bravo! The book is not for the casual reader or the 50 Shades crowd. This is true literary pornography; honest and descriptive. A simple story with deep psychological metaphors that on some level only Georges Bataille can understand. Regardless it is a piece of classic literature that should not go unread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic pornographic French literature","review":"After knocking out most of Bataille's philosophy, I decided to give his fiction a chance. To my surprise I really liked this book, but however buyer beware, if you are offended by graphic sexual imagery this isn't the book for you. It features sex acts envloving eggs, orgies, and various debauched sex acts in a Catholic church included the murder of a priest. Published in the mid 20's it's still graphic even today. In the vain of de Sade or Jean Genet. I recommend this book for fans of either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grotesque and Astonishing","review":"George Bataille's brief Sade-esque novella is a mordantly brilliant dip into the post-Nietzschen world modernity. The Story of the Eye is a pornographic disintegration of the Western ethical code. It is both magnificent and foul; a more daring and original work than his later philosophy/anthropology. A seminal piece of 20th century literature; although it was published well before the cultural abominations of our current nihilism, we are still not ready for this bleak and punkish work of literary debauchery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! A very beautifully written book","review":"This was the first Jim Crace novel I've read, and I must say that not only am I not disappointed, but I am extremely impressed! It is truly very beautifully written with a captivating storyline and mystery that shrouds over it. The nature of \\"being dead\\" is profoundly explored in a non-obtrusive and genuine way. I highly recommend this novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful insight to decay","review":"This is a story of a middleaged couple who decide to return to the beach of where they first made love. Unfortunately for them, it is also the day a desperate man is among the dunes, needing cash and other valuables.The couples are left undiscovered by humans for almost a week, not so by the animal and insect world. While they are decomposing amongst the dunes we learn of what their lives were like, earlier that day and earlier in their life when they just met.I found this book to be totally engrossing and touching in many ways. However, I didn't find that I 'bonded' with any character to really draw me into the book. An earlier reviewer stated that you should read this alone, and I add that you shouldn't read it over lunch either, if you are squeamish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary Macabre Tale.","review":"A dreary tale about dull people. The author is a gifted writer, he just wasted his talents is this lengthy dissertation on the minute details of the decompostion of the human body. I thought this was a mystery novel. It was not. This book did not end, it just stopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started with a bang; ended with a dud.","review":"This was interesting as to the perspective of death and decay by insects, grass, etc. It started to get uninteresting and reminded me of those high school classics that are so dry and full of symbolism that you forget about the sheer joy of reading for reading sake. I would not reccomend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have put it down sooner","review":"I found the characters dull. The writing effusive and the story boring. I should have put it down when it started examining the death scene from the dung beetle's perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique read","review":"\\"Being Dead\\" is unlike any other work of fiction I have read. It begins with the murder of Joseph and Celice in the dunes of Baritone Bay, the spot where they consummated their love thirty years ago. As their bodies begin to decay, Crace describes that fateful day in reverse chronological order, intercutting the story of their meeting thirty years before. Flashes to the present update the reader, with graphic detail, on the increasing decomposition of Joseph and Celice, and the search their daughter Syl begins for her missing parents. \\"Being Dead\\" is a truly unique book; it rather defies classification. Perhaps in the \\"Brilliant\\" or \\"Haunting\\" sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of All-Time Worst Books I've Read","review":"I read a lot (approx. a book or two a week), find a lot of things interesting (ie., historical fiction, suspense, mystery, non-fiction) and read this one for a book club. I have to say it was one of the worst books I've ever read. Just a horrible, uninteresting read. It's the complete opposite of a 'page-turner'. I wouldn't recommend to ANYONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK.. just","review":"I found this book to be a difficult read. It is well-written but the message is rather bleak. OK, here are some people whose bodies are decaying and becoming a part of the earth. But, every character in the book - without exception - is very selfish, judgemental. Their lives are unfulfilled and wanting. The message seems to be that life is horrible and then you die, and your body decays. Even death itself, as described by Crace, appears to have no mystical aspect, it's like: \\"now i'm alive... now i'm not\\". Don't read it if you're looking for something uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"Nothing about this really worked for me. I can't recommend that anyone spend the time reading this book, even though it is short. I was trapped on a airplane and still almost put it down for good. I didn't get this book by accident; this is the type of think I read. This book is more of a gesture or exercise by Crace. Extremely disappointing given the critical hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death on Earth(?)","review":"There's an odd stillness to this book -- the stillness of bodies decaying on beach? It's a fascinating experiment where what happens to the main characters' bodies after death is often more intriguing than what happens to them while alive. Crace is deft at painting the psyches of the long-married couple, but less sure and original when he moves their rebellious daughter to the center of his canvas. Her tale seems rote, tacked on, irritating. John Crowley has pointed out in his NY Times review that many of the curious but convincing historical and zoological details -- for example, the 'quivering' tradition, and the 'sprayhoppers' to whom the husband has devoted his scientific career -- seem to have been made up out of whole cloth by Crace. (Go ahead, try to find 'sprayhoppers' in any online or print resource.) This might have subtly helped add to the rather otherwordly charm of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Dead?","review":"I was not excited about the way the book starts with the double murder. I was courious about how some one could write a book begining with main characters being killed. Jim Crace writes with such description that once I started I could not put it down. It gave me a new perspective on death and yet brought forth emotion and feeling. Yes a romance worth your time with a realist setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly English Narrative 2.5 stars","review":"Interesting idea but boring execution, and I do not dislike difficult fiction. The writing here is soporific and a bit sanctimonious. Two dull people with an estranged daughter are murdered on the beach where they first met and proceed to decay. The author immediately distances himself from any human considerations but attempts to pull at our emotions by describing the elements, the scavenger creatures, the grass losing color, etc. Never does it become engrossing. A minor author of a quirky, somewhat interesting book. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fine Line Between Being Dead and Being Boring...","review":"The author slips over this line once too often to rate the book above 2 stars - and that's in a fairly slim book (just under 200 pages).The forward by backward by forward tale of this couple's ultimate day alive - the details of a past that had them returning to this spot - the nature of animals being their passion and study - and their passion as animals being the authors study - how time moves on and through all of us without paying much notice to us.However, the author spends a great deal of time examining their lives which really are practically unfulfilled and fairly dull lives to begin with - in deep scientific detail. What they had for breakfast, what clothes they wore, how much and how little they actually feel for one another at various moments throughout the day -But no one ever really wakes up or comes to life - so it comes to matter very little - even to their daughter - whether the couple is alive or dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"life ends in death","review":"Every multi-celled creature ends in death. Unless you know someone who has been murdered, and layed undiscovered, and rotting, you don't know what happens after death. If you read this book, you will.You will discover life and death, at its most basic, primitive source. This book crosses the lines of what most of us want to know. The private, intimate world of a couple murdered on the sand dunes, the decomposition of their bodies. The daughter what hates her parents, and comes to love them in death.I am torn between loving and hating this book. If you don't have a strong stomach, or can not dissassociate, don't read it. If you can, it is compelling, and worth the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply moved","review":"I have been a Jim Crace reader and fan for a long time and have always rated his novels amongst the most adventurous and beautiful. I thought his career must have peaked with Quarantine. How could any writer produce a more intellectually invasive and astounding work than that? But Being Dead has turned out to be his masterwork (so far) not because it is any better written than the others or more strartling in its imagery but because its emotional powers and its compassion are unequalled by any other story I have read. I could hardly bear to read it at times, but I certainly couldn't put it down"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish more people were dead","review":"Sorry I hated this book. The technical imagery of the rotting corpses was good, but not enough to save the fact that there is really no story here and the people are one dimensional and boring. I had trouble not dieing myself while trying to complete this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad tale","review":"Being Dead is a well-written, at times even engrossing, novel, but is essentially bleak. Author Jim Crace provides a literary \\"quivering\\" for Joseph and Celise, the murdered protagonists, going back in stages to fill in details of both their last day and their 30 year marraige.The problem for me is that the author's \\"secular\\" view of life and death is depressing. Maybe some find the idea that we live, we die, and that is all there is to it, comforting. I find it grim. Add to my fundamental disagreement in outlook the fact that neither Joseph nor Celise was very happy with their marraige, their daughter, or life in general, and the whole thing is a real downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"The book was very gory - I read the book for a book club and that's the only reason I didn't stop after the first couple of chapters. There was no story - no point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Since you know the ending at the beginning there are no major surprises, just the story of how this couple lives led to their murder.

(20,000 slaughtered in ten years leading up to 1990 when he was there).Elephants are frequently referenced but not directly encountered. The emphasis is on how the socialist government is trying to convert the native people's from hunting, and or poaching, to other forms of food production.He interview numerous officials and violators but presents his material in the form of a narrative which is quite intriguing and well written as you might expect from an accomplished journalist and magazine editor.Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written and Still Relevant","review":"Nicholas Gordon deftly takes the reader through a real-life web of intrigue that runs from the lowest level poacher's assistant all the way up to the highest levels of the Tanzanian government. The problems of funding, manpower, and loyalty that plague the wardens who protect the wildlife are all carefully explored and often vividly illustrated by the situations that Gordon finds himself in. This book is full of unforgettable stories, such as the one about the warden who built a landing strip in the middle of the jungle without the benefit of any machinery, and the story of the nerve-wracking flight that Gordon and his guide take across the jungle in an aged, rickety Cessna that had been already been crashed once, by the same pilot who is flying them at that moment. The poaching described by Gordon is still a problem in Tanzania, and I expect that Gordon's documentation and analysis of the problem is still relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with my purchase.","review":"I bought this system from BB for $189.

So sad.Simply Mad About the Mouse [VHS]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired and boring","review":"There's so much to be mined from Disney music, it's surprising there are not more remakes out there. This CD, however, is a fine example of how not to do it. Without exception, the tracks lack any inspiration, sense of reverence, or creativity. When L.L. Cool J's old-school rap version of Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf rates as the best song on the disc (and that's not saying much), things aren't looking good. Overwhelmingly, if you're looking for some genuinely creative and sincere reworkings of Disney tunes, pick up Stay Awake, and file this one under Stay Away."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mystery of The Stone Markers","review":"As a teacher in training I'am always searching for suitable adolescent literature. I was intrigued when I came across \\"Stone Markers.\\" Like the best children's books, this one can be enjoyed on more than one level. Twin brothers stumble on to what looks like an old grave in the woods near their house. The discovery leads to their involvement with a sinister and dangerous \\"shadow man.\\" With a few friends they uncover and eventually solve decades-old crimes that adults in their community have tried to forget. The story is well told and fast-paced. The characters ring true, as anyone who's ever been around young teenage boys will see immediately. A powerful and welcome affirmation of friendship and loyalty, \\"Stone Marker\\" takes up and answers the age old question of; \\"what do we do when we are confronted by evil?\\" The Willard Aspen Detective Agency is off to a good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A La Media Noche Instead","review":"I bought this CD for one reason: the first track: Lambada and the third track: Dancando Lambada. Once I listened to the CD, I realized they are really the only listenable songs on the disc.They were trying to start a new dance craze, so they created the song Lambada in ten versions with same words and different rhythm, but none of the remixes match the original. The songs get boring quickly, because they're all fast dancing songs. The two best tracks (1 and 3) can be found in other collections (like Lambada Brazil and Romantic Collection), respectively.Kaoma's other CD \\"A La Media Noche\\" is a keeper, however. Buy it, and a couple good collections instead of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast service","review":"I am always impressed with the quick service and prompt response.....cd came in \\"new\\" condition many thanks it is much appreciated"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read.","review":"The idea for this book is a good one, but the execution is not.

Options are confusing enough anyway without confusing writing about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked ok for about 2.5 years","review":"The alarm stopped functioning after about 2.5 years!As an alarm clock in the bedroom this was great while functioning. It is easy to use and programme. The display brightness can be turned from bright to off by pressing the snooze button on the top - great when you're half asleep and want to know the time without having to think too much and you can then turn the display off so as not to be disturbed by it. Compact size is good.Usual functions of sleep, snooze and dual alarms.The sound quality is what I would expect from an alarm clock radio, audiobooks aren't too bad but I wouldn't choose to sit and listen to music on it.Radio reception in our area is not good and this unit struggles to get a good signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes and No","review":"I like the design and it works well with my Ipod. I just cannot believe that you can't adjust the volume when using the alarm. How bizarre! How many other alarm clocks have that problem? And the display (at dim) is still too bright. I have always thought of Phillips being a quality brand and I am really surprised to find these problems with the unit. I am unfortunately tempted to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Really Loud alarm!","review":"Overall this product is ok but the biggest issue I have is that when using the iPod for your alarm it comes on at a low volume and gets really really loud really quickly. It's ok for just listening to your iPod, but the alarm is not good at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product, terrible customer service from Philips","review":"This item was purchased for my husband as a Christmas gift. The alarm worked fine for about 10 days, then suddenly, even though set, the alarm would not go off. Then it would work for a few days again, and then fail, etc.I contacted Philips customer support. After several calls, disconnections and transfers and 2 hours of my time, it was deemed that the product is defective. In order to get a new one, I have to mail back the old one and pay for the shipping charges. Even though the item is under warranty, I have to pay shipping. Philips will not send me a new one until I mail back the old one.Based on my very poor experience with the customer support at Philips, it is doubtful that I will purchase anything from them again.Product review - lack of volume control is very annoying - the iPod or radio goes off and before you can reach your arm up to shut it off, the volume is blaring. Sound quality on the speakers is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Alarm and Poor Customer Service from Philips","review":"I purchased this item to play music (radio or iPod) to have my little boy wake up gently with music playing. Unfortunately, the system has an override that shoots the volume up from 0 to 20 whether you use the radio or iPod. There is no way to have alarm music play gently. This is not indicated on the package. The only alarm volume control comes with the buzzer option.I contact Philips with the hope of exchanging the product for a simpler model that had a traditional volume-set alarm, and was told that exchange, even for a lesser product, was not an option. It didn't occur to me that I would run into this trouble, so did not save the box, so cannot return to vendor. Shame on me. I will not buy Philips products in the future knowing their customer service ('sorry we can't reach our managers except by writing a letter') is wholly hands-tied and unable to individually address customer complaints ('...the policy says...) Find another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution! Unit could damage your hearing.","review":"I bought the unit to replace an old alarm clock. Sure enough, I should have read the reviews a little bit more careful. While the AJ300D has two alarm settings and a pretty decent sound quality for such a small device, the alarm volume cannot be adjusted and is always maximum, which is REALLY LOUD even when listening to a quiet classical piece. One of the advertised features of the unit is supposedly \\"Gentle Wake\\". More like \\"gentle wake\\" of the dead. This is clearly a design mistake on Philips' part. This unit goes back to Amazon first thing in the morning. If you are not planning on using the alarm function, this is a decent iPod speaker system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, No battery B/up","review":"This Phillips IPod clock radio has great sound. It compensates for the fact that MP-3 format clips low frequency sound. I just can't understand that they designed a clock radio without a back-up battery. Also the lighted display is too bright, even at 'dim' for a bedroom. I had to turn it away from the bed, but then can't see the display. The alarm (or Radio) comes on quiet, but quickly gets too loud. An anoyance if you just want to listen for 15 more minutes. The 'manual' is just a sheet of paper and lacks detail. I did return it for the above reasons, primarily the lack of back up battery. Poor design should not be rewarded.I replaced it with the Timex Mod. T617S that does have back up battery and C D player. It don't have a iPod jack, but does have a MP-3 input and pillow speaker output. I can still connect my iPod shuffle. It works great and does have a display dim enough to be next to my bed.Harold"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shuts off after two minutes","review":"I purchased this unit a week ago. The sound was great for the price. However, it won't stay on. My husband and I have tried many ways to get the unit to power on and stay on. We called Philips Customer service and they said to exchange it at the store. Did that yesterday. The new unit does the same thing. I have the iPod Classic. Don't know if it's a compatibiliy issue or if I'm just unlucky. Wish it worked! The sound is rich for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Alarm Flaw","review":"This radio looks good and sounds good, but for use as an alarm clock sucks. The \\"gentle wake\\" feature must be for people with no patience as it goes from quiet to jet engine loud in about 2 seconds. And first thing in the morning you think it will stop getting louder, but just as you think it's at maximum level, it goes up 2 more levels. It would be perfect if the wake up level could be adjusted. But it can't. Bummer dude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fixed alarm volume level too annoying","review":"The product delivers everything I wanted when I looked at the specs and I like it a lot, however the rapidly ascending alarm to level 20 and not being able to change this level negates all the positives. I read and re-read the instructions to look for this setting, then googled it, and was really, really annoyed to find out that it's a fixed level.It's SOOOO annoying - the product could be great, but ends up being a failure because of this flaw. Who wants to be woken up from deep sleep to being screamed at by the radio within 10-15 seconds?If you want to use it as an alarm, I can't recommend it until this flaw is fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a CD player!!","review":"Amazon's descriptions are mistaken, this device has no CD player. Other than that, I'm sure it's fine, but I specifically purchased it because of the nonexistent CD playing function so I'm pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really really wanted to keep this, but...","review":"I received this as a surprise Christmas gift and I was thrilled. It appeared to be a perfect bedside alarm clock. As others here have mentioned though, probably the biggest strike against this product is the inability to preset the alarm volume. Others have mentioned they thought the external FM antenna was ugly. I'm just glad there was one as my favorite station has a weak signal.This unit appears to do all, charge ipod, dock, wake up modes, three brightness levels, two alarm clocks, snooze button, compact appealing design. It is with great regret that I will probably have to return this unit due to the Alarm clock volume problem.There appears to be no equal products. This little Philips unit definately struck an emotional chord with me, initially. Its going to be hard to box it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving it away","review":"I bought this without seeing it. I thought 'we love penguins so it can't be bad'. It is. It follows the rhyme pattern of Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed only THIS DOESN'T RHYME. It was painful to read aloud. While the artwork is adorable, the lack of rhyme and flow just grated. The kids (7, 7 and 3) thought it was fun, but haven't asked for it again and haven't missed it since I put it in the 'give away' box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Love this book total play on 5 Little Monkey's jumping on the bed for a lovely New England Winter setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I got on line this CD's for my girlfriend and she love it, she listen every day for half an hour, and she is very happy and I thank you guys for the good work, Rudy."},{"rating":"1","title":"English for Brazilians","review":"The book is very basic and its pace is very slow.

The teaching format is very well laid out in each lesson. I would recommend this CD set for anyone who is looking to travel to Brazil and desires to get acquainted with the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the Heavy Breathing for the Bedroom, Not the Recording Studio!","review":"I must agree with the other reviewers bothered by Galbraith's heavy breathing. With earphones on, I felt like the guy's nose was about an inch from my ear. An injection of the ridiculous into the sublime!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over Substance","review":"While this recording does indeed showcase the harmonic possibilities of the 8-string guitar's extended range, Galbraith does little to prove he understands Baroque music. The rhetorics of Bach seems to be lost in Galbraith's emotionally detached performance. Especially noticeable in the Grave of the 2nd Violin Sonata, which should be played with a larger range of dynamics and much more improvisatory vigor. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do much for me","review":"While admire Paul's mastery and this enormous undertaking, and congratulate him and wish him well, this album didn't touch me deeply. Part of it is some of the pieces. While Bach wrote incredible pieces, some of his pieces are just a lot of notes, dry, and not that beautiful. But even in the pieces that I love, like Chaconne, these interpretations didn't do much for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, rich, deeply moving and unique rendition of Bach","review":"This artist with his unique instumentation renders beloved, but very familiar works by J.S. Bach in a fashion never before experienced by this reviewer. The recording is so crisp, richly textured and intimate that if one closes one's eyes, one could easily conjure up a softly lit greatroom filled with close friends being serenaded by an unparrelled artist, who is playing as a personal favor to you. Seldom is this music lover moved to near tears by the successful transmission of pure beauty through an instrument, capturing in such magnificent fidelity the emotional impact of Bach's passion and faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"One of the best CDs ever. Who cares if you can hear extra noise in the backround. This is the best Bach recording ever done on the guitar. Also try some of his other stuff, lute suites, haydn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all!","review":"I had purchased this CD because I am currently working on a Bach Partita (no. 2) on Violin and I wanted the Guitar version. Galbraith is a wonderful performer. Although the Ciaccona in the Partita is a little slow, it's still great! I highly recommend it! Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally fresh, superb playing","review":"I probably have 100 or so classical guitar recordings, and this one stands out from the others as boldly as the Segovia recordings, but for a totally different reason. The unique sound of the instrument, perfect playing, and lack of normal string noise took me quite by surprise. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond excellence!","review":"As a professional classical guitarist, I can tell you that to play Bach on the guitar is a tremendous but worthwhile challenge. After hearing this recording, I am convinced that Galbraith presents THE definitive interpretation of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas, not only for guitarists, but for all performers and/or admires of these great works of art. As for the person who rated this recording with only 3 stars, I would suggest repeated in-depth listenings of these two CD's and a thorough study of these pieces. Not only is Galbraith's playing beyond technique and interpretation, but he creates a seemingly effortless musicality which is unfortunately not characteristic of most performances of the Sonatas and Partitas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid pre-romantic concerto","review":"Hummel is one of the transitionary figures between the classical and romantic eras. Having studied with mozart, he was very adept at concerto style. Although not as striking as his a-minor and b-minor concertos (see my review of those), his E-major concerto is beautiful and full of emotion. It also is full of humor, with an amusing virtuoso passage at the close of the solo exposition. The minor key slow movement is quite moving and reminiscent of Beethoven. The double concerto is a less serious work, but nonetheless has excellent moments. It draws most of its influence from Mozart's style (it is an early work), probably from his sinfonia concertante for violin and viola. Hummel was a talented composer, and his work warrants a listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I have to say something about this particular band/album: it was released down here in Brazil in 1990 or so, and as far as I know I was the only one in my friends metal network who got it. Actually, I might be one of the few who bought it in the whole country. I doubt it sold over 50 copies overall.Which is just unfair, since it is a fine power/thrash metal album, with skilled musicians and a fine singer. The drummer is amazing and the twin guitar work is above average. Although the music is awesome, the package didn't help at all because any 8 year old kid would've come up with a better sleeve.The timing wasn't right either, since thrash metal was starting to descent and alternative heavy rock (or any other name they call it) was getting popular all over the world. Then Seattle came and smashed it completely.Nevertheless, if you're a metal fan who enjoys fast riffs and drumming, screaming vocals and the ocasional fair melody... go for it. It's at least worth checking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias and misunderstanding of economics","review":"While there is some interesting information in the book, it seems to be riddled with errors and sloppy research. It also has quite an amount of bias - for example Strathern says that the three greatest economists are Marx, Smith and Keynes. Marx isn't even an economist. Further - 'Franklin D. Roosevelt, the greatest president of all'. He might have been a reasonable president - but the greatest of all?? The Great Depression didn't prove Keynes right. Actually, the New Deal slowed the growth of the US out of the depression (see for example the recent International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook 2002 (recoveries and recessions). There are many other errors in economics understanding.

However, it is not knowledge he seeks to broaden but his own racial prejudice. I found the underlying theme to be how the poor black soldiers were subjected to prejudice. This isn't a history but another \\"poor little me, I,m black and the evil white man has abused me\\". There are many views of the war - his is dismissive of the efforts of all who were caught up in the conflict.

Another thing is when you move the part of the ear plug, that plugs into the cd player its self, distubes the sound and sometimes makes it so you can only hear it in one ear.

It is not perfect thought because it does have a tendency to skip once in great while but you gotta be really jumping up and down or running rather rapidly for it to do that. Overall any activity you do while using this walkman is not really interfered with. The sound quality is great and the hand strap is a great size for anyone to adjust to.

I bought this walkman to use on my commuter bus to block out \\"loud talkers.\\" Okay, it does accomplish that just fine. However, it is not very loud and the extra bass is either not enough or too much, thereby causing distortion. Like other reviewers have written, the headphone jack is just bizarre. If you move the headphone jack, it makes a fuzzy, static noise, and on my particular walkman, if I touch the headphone jack, the walkman beeps at me and skips to the next song!! SO ANNOYING!! Save your blood pressure, don't buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KY crosstrainer","review":"This is the second Aiwa personal cd player that I have baought. The first one lasted over two years. It was used most everyday in the gym and anywhere else I went. I like this one better than the first one. I like the size of the buttons. It is easier for me to operate them. I do not like the headphones. When I run, the sweat from my head makes them slide down my head. The rubberized case is hard to get in and out of some carrying case, that is something I can adjust.

Not all the songs are terrific, but most of the score lends itself to repeat listenings. Best tracks include:Double TalkWhat You Don't Know About WomenWith Every Breath I Take [beautiful song!]Lost And FoundYou're Nothing Without Me [the show's hit]You Can Always Count On MeFunnyGreat cast ... great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Cast, Bad Score","review":"This show has an amzing concept, flipping from black to white; and having the film parellel life. But, the score does not live up to the rest of the production. While I know that a jazz score is nedded for a 40s dectective show, as I listened to teh CD, I found the score sounded like it should be played and sung at a mediocre jazz caberet. I do think, however that the cast is magnificent! They all fit their parts and vocal expectations perfectly (escpecially the \\"scat-singing\\" ensamble)! Altogether, I gave the OCR 2 stars, because the score is listenable, although the singers are fanstastic. But the bad score does out way the stench of the score.

Plus, there are songs included in the London soundtrack that are omitted from the Broadway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, but...","review":"Wonderful music. I never had the opportunity to see the show and bought this CD because of it's thematic similarity to \\"Curtains\\". However the music is terrific and I'm glad to have it. I am disappointed however in the complete lack of liner notes of any kind. Not only that, but the song lineup printed on the package is completely out of sequence with what I'm hearing come out of the speakers. The Tennis Song is track 7 on the CD but the package lists it as track 21 and so on. Columbia is supposed to be a top rate organization but they really dropped the ball here. Print out the correct track listing from Amazon and enjoy the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"There isn't much available on this artist, so I was anxious to get this book. My enthusiasm was misplaced, because the book is a major disappointment. Granted, it was written a long time ago, but the style of writing is distractingly awkward. Most surprisingly, this book contains the worst printed plates I have ever seen. They are black and white. Not greyscale, but literally black and white. Some pictures have been improperly scaled in one dimension. This is inexcusable. There is some value in the text, but not even close to the book's cost.

Good thing \\"Rock and Roll Tonight\\" is the closing track, because it will splinter your stereo speakers, especially since play-louds \\"You Drive, I'll Steer,\\" \\"Back and Blue\\" and the title track precede it.

But two things went wrong, maybe only one. Once I got it I couldn't hear audio through the headset itself, I thought it might be my controller because it does that but I tried it on multiple. And the other, which is minor depending on how you feel about this sort of thing, is that it picks up other peoples voices in the room pretty well. So if you and your friends are raging while playing Halo, everyone could probably hear them as well, not just you.So...ehh...

You can hear everbody clearly and they can hear you, that is, as long as the mic is not resting against your face which can happen if it is not worn properly. It has plenty of cord and is very light although after a few hours it can make your ear a little sore but much less than other headsets. $30 is a little much but Amazon usually has it on sale for less.

The sound was just so so and the ear piece was pretty comfortable, but the mike picked up every sound imaginable. You cannot use this product if you are not wearing headphones. It will provide wayyyyy too much feedback for your friends playing the game with you. It was so sensitive, it even picked up the chips I was eating during the play.

It's funny because, while I was reading it, I could hear the sax playing in my head-so I thought. When I snaped out of it. I realized that coltraine was playing on my internet radio. The same song that was in the book. I was like (what da f%@#) Scared the Bageezus outta me. I enjoyed the heck out of it.

However, it's biggest downfall is it's length. I was very interested in the story, but I found it painful to finish. I just wanted it to end. The author got my attention with good character development and a great story set up. Then there was just too much drivel. For example, the author kept rehashing previous plot points through the view point of another character. This was interesting, but happened too many times. Don't get this book if you are not into the whole voodoo thing. And don't expect it to be scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh.................","review":"No. No one should charge $21 for an e-book.

I do like the theme of the book (evil spirits, voodoo, secrets in the family ... ), but she took way too long to get to the points she was trying to make. Maybe you call that suspense, but in this case it was dull. She was entirely too repetitive in discussing points throughout the book, once or twice is fine but this was overkill. Not to mention, for a horror book, it wasn't very scary. Over-all I don't think I will be buying her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Let It End","review":"Oh my heaven's! Is this bad.

The pouches that do not actually tear when opening, are just plain flimsy and difficult to manage and close. I actually loved this brand when they were using the higher mil rated material; it is really too bad they chose this apparent cost saving measure at the expense of the consumer.

This novel has many features worthy of praise. First, Joshua's character can go both ways in terms of admiration: some readers admire this crude character while othere despise the man who is a mere image of Richler. Second, continual flashbacks to different periods and settings make Joshua Then and Now a page-turner. The novel also had its lows. It was evident that Richler took a shortcut in producing this novel as Joshua Shapiro's character was a reflection of his own. Also, the novel could have done without scenes dealing with the William Lyon Mackenzie King Memorial Society as this did little to advance the novel. All in all, Joshua Then and Now was a success, preaching audiences about the importance of moral and sound family values. Mr. Richler, your comic energy and satires will be missed forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"*joshua then and now* S U C K S!!!!!!!","review":"this book is a most difficult read. it is almost like a history lesson. the whole idea of going back and forth from persent to past, made it a most trying excersise to read. if you are a casual reader from age 17 and lower; do not attempt to read this. this was the hardest, most boring and most challenging book i have yet to come across. read with caution and lots of time ahead of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked for me!","review":"After the birth of my 3rd child, I was concerned about losing the extra 25 pounds I had gained. This book really changed my life in that it gave great tips and information that I didn't find anywhere else - about food journals, duration of exercise, and when to start trying to lose the weight. All her information was right on, and when I followed her suggestions, the pounds melted off so quickly that everyone around me was amazed. Don't get me wrong, it took a lot of hard work, but after reading this book, I realized that if I worked hard for 2 or 3 months, starting at 3 months postpartum, that I would see the results I wanted. After 2 months of hard work, the 25 pounds were long gone, and I felt really great about my accomplishments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"This book is perfect for the mother that wants to lose weight the HEALTHY way. No gimicky diets. Debra Waterhouse really helps you accept your post-pregnancy body and love it for the healthy baby it produced.

After reading it and starting on Debra's PEACE plan, I have a new love of my body and am beginning to have a healthy relationship with food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and discouraging!","review":"I hated this book! I found the author's cutesy vocabulary and lighthearted \\"oh well\\" attitude in response to quite possibly never getting my body back to be nothing less than infuriating. Her description of waving a little white flag to 30 billion fat cells, and how they \\"protect their precious goldmine of fat\\" oblivious to months of exercise, and increasingly more stubborn with dieting, is obnoxious as it is frustrating.I felt that she was telling me certain goals are hopeless and that the only way to cope was to throw away my old clothes.I know that isn't true because (it was a tight fit), but I wore them home from the hospital! And I know I can improve from there.Don't listen to her!

Although I grew up in the chaotic sixties as opposed to the fabulous fifties, I was able to reminisce fully in the cultural offerings of that bygone era--from television programming to catholic nuns to youthful indescretions. This book has it all: humor; wit; and even sadness. If you grew up around the '50s or '60s, I highly recommend \\"Destined For Nostalgia\\".

An African rhythmic beat interwoven with a simple melodic synthesiser groove plus Joe's vocoder voice - grooving & soothing all at once! The opener \\"Patriots\\" in itself is really only a \\"warm-up\\" segue into \\"South Africa\\" - part protest song but mainly in celebratory mode for the liberation of Nelson Mandela & the black Soth African nation. Victims of the Groove & Afternoon showcase Joe's more embellished synthesiser effects (but always with that great, cooking underlying groove & never \\"over the top\\"). Then take it down a notch with the gorgeous tone poem Night Clock & Rua Paula Freitas before heading into the flamenco-tinged \\"San Sebastien\\" & the gorgeous \\"In a while, in a while\\".

There are complete season statistics, point race summaries, etc. There is literally no where else one can find this sort of information.Second, the book is entertaining. It's not easy to do the kind of in-depth scholarship that underlies this book and make it interesting. That's what the author does. It's literally a page-turner with a gripping narrative.Third, the book is a very high-quality production. It's a large-format, coffee-table book, the pages are heavy, glossy paper, the binding is extremely sturdy, and the pictures are sharp. This is one of those books that just feels good in your hands, if that makes any sense.In summary, this is THE book for any NASCAR fan.

I own completely satisfying readings of the MFSPC by Reiner, Bernstein, and Levine. But Harnoncourt has carved out a special place beside these greats.He takes very slow tempi in every movement compared to Reiner, but especially in the first--9:10 for Harnoncourt, 7:00 for Reiner. The effect of this slowing down is mesmerizing; you are forced to listen to the inner working of Bartok's complex rhythms as never before. Baartok was wriing is own version of counterpoint, and here his peculiar genius emerges with great freshness and freedom. The orchestra plays beautifully for him, and the sound from RCA/BMG is splendid.I think this is a great addition to the Bartok catalog. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Bartok","review":"An absolutely fabulous piece of music with which I was not previously familiar. Having never heard it before, it is difficult for me to compare this version with others, but my temptation is to label it as just a bit stiff in execution.

I highly recommend this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Film is a Gem!","review":"I loved this movie. It is a true gem.The story is about an Egyptian Police Band that is supposed to do a performance at the opening of a new Egyptian Cultural Center in Israel. One of the band's members asks for directions to the city and mispronounces the Hebrew word for the town. Thus, the misadventures start.The band ends up in a small town in the middle of nowhere. It is certainly not a place of any culture says the woman who runs the restaurant where their bus lets them off.This comedic and poignant film unfolds duing a period of little more than 24 hours, until the band can catch the next bus to the right place. We see lust, love, pain, grief and hope. We laugh a lot. I guffawed a few times. We are witness to how people learn to accept one another and go past their prior negative feelings.I recommend this movie without reservation. It is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BAND'S VISIT-review","review":"It was an interesting off-beat sort of show. It wasn't riveting, but it held my attention.

They get to know a number of the locals, and the interactions run the gamut: painfully (hilariously) awkward, funny, sad.The interactions between locals are as likely to be awkward (and funny) as those between locals and the visitors, just in more familiar ways. Maybe the film is about how emotions can cross cultures (even cultures known to have animosity), but I just found it funny and sweet and (sometimes) sad. But it is very well done, and I recommend it. (My wife and I both gave it an 8/10, which is strong praise.)The film is in English, Hebrew, and (presumably) Egyptian Arabic. We picked it up at our local Blockbuster.The film is PG-13. I remember one swear word and one split-second glimpse of a couple of arms and legs (which could be interpreted as sensuality)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from what I expected","review":"This movie was different from what I expected. I thought it would be faster-paced; a little bit on the edge, perhaps a little controversial. It was none of these. Instead, \\"The Band's Visit\\" is a quiet movie, made great by terrific acting, both by the Israelis and by the Arabs. Each part was played to understated perfection. I also liked the way the director cast very ordinary looking people, some with less than great teeth or bodies, to be the stars of the movie. In addition, the people in this film seem weighted down by boredom, loneliness or both- just like in real life! But moments of real insight do occur, which make the movie touching and worthwhile. Watch this movie when you are in a reflective mood, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As disappointing as the nothing town it features","review":"I usually love quiet, quirky films about people living out their ordinary lives. Generally because the characters evolve through some kind of minor crisis and discover hidden strengths or have a moment of revelation and change. This film promised to be just such a movie, and with my interest in the region, I looked forward to watching it.The slow pace of the film was appealing, but the lack of any kind of redemption in the characters wasn't. Everyone acted just as you expected they would... there wasn't even any political or social commentary (unless the producer wants to point out that Israeli women are either harpies or sluts) there were no surprises and therefore no redemption in this film and I was very disappointed.Sure, it's realistic, too much so.

In contrast the Israeli town they stay in looks ugly and worn. The Israelis are all sad and worn also. Obviously one cannot help but feel a certain tension between the Egyptians and Israelis, although there is no mention of this in the film at all.I am sure that a message is in there somewhere, but it is difficult to decipher it.

I needed the unit to control an outlet located in my garage, with remote activation from my kitchen, which is about 40 feet away. The remote will not work if my door to the garage is closed - only works if door is open and I move closer to the receiver unit. All in all, very poor remote range capability - certainly not the performance as advertised. Second problem is the countdown function. This function, as it turns out, cannot be activated remotely. To use the countdown timer (such as to automatically turn an appliance off an hour after turning it on) one must walk to the reciever where the appliance is plugged in, and manually hit the countdown button - totally negating the reason for even calling this a remote controlled unit.

It works dependably and I can unplug it and take it up to my face to program it then place it in the outlet which is behind a heavy piece of furniture. One thing that is a useful thing to know is that in putting some timers in an outlet you can't use the plug above or below.

It shows the conflict and love between two brothers. Personally, I don't like reading this book because it gets some what boring.

Hinton's writing is; while there are certain elements that may \\"date\\" the story to the time it was written, the basic emotions are something even today's kids can relate to.

Tex has problems with his friends, with his foes, and sometimes with the law. One of the reasons that I didn't really like this book was that that it doesn't live up to The Outsiders a book also by S.E Hinton. This book did not have enough adventure in it. I was expecting something very good and adventurous from S.E Hinton but this book just isn't. I didn't connect with Tex because he's not really adventurous like me.

So chock full, that at times it loses direction. The author is so in love with the ideas, he has a little trouble following one coherently at times. This tendency is exacerbated by the authors injudicious use of parenthetical phrases (where he suddenly goes in a new direction). The book is larded, weighted down, and crippled by these parenthetical phrases - after a while I just wanted to scream for him to get an editor. GET AN EDITOR! But of course, this book was written quite a while ago. Of course some of the parenthetical phrases are fine. Many others reflect the authors inability to commit to a direction, his incapability to abandon any direction related to his main point.

I think Dokey has an amazing understanding of the human heart and has a gift for expressing it in ways that can touch anyone - this book is no exception. \\"Golden\\" really dives into what it means to love and sacrifice, just as all of Dokey's other stories.

It is much more convenient than a 50 amp cord with an adapter.This cord is reasonably well made with a heavy plastic jacket on the cord and a molded plug to connect to the pedestal. The Marinco end is a genuine Marinco connector.

The book seems very complete and very detailed, much more than the other books around. A very useful addition, especially with the available errata for the typos concentrated at the beginning.

The only miracle is that this truly unpleasant film ever got made and released.

I had no interest in anyone. We watched it to the end in the hopes that somewhere there would be a glimmer of what could have been.Right at the end there's a good example of the poor plot.The neighbours arrive to complain about the meteor and the main kid (who I cared so much about I have no idea what his name was) talks about how that started the \\"war of the metoer\\", but they won - no explanation of how, no footage of the war, just that they won. Why even mention this? Again, a plot line that goes nowhere.Mike Myers didn't do a bad job - none of the actors did - they just had nothing to work with. This movie just seemed to be trying to ride the coattails of other recent Irish movies that do have good storylines. It was a waste of almost two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless, unhappy, a downright waste of time.","review":"I watched this movie because I was curious to know if Mike Myers would be able to do a serious role. He did turn his humour off but his character was too boring and had no in-depth consideration at at all.The movie is about an Irish boy and his younger siblings going through a tough time in their lives, recently recovering from the loss of their parents. After a meteor ends up in their backyard, they conclude that it's a gift from their parents and go to an extrordinary effort to retrieve it after a dopey scientist takes it away for study.The film lacks character and has no message at all. It was a sad movie with odd parts, and had no potential at all; I was completely ashamed with it. And why the young boy named the meteor 'Pete's Meteor' is utterly trivial; what did Pete have to do with it anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad movie","review":"Being able to understand what the characters were saying might have made a major difference in my rating, but this movie is totally not understandable. The heavy accents made it impossible for us to watch more than 10 minutes of the movie.

What I got was a fantastic treatise on the history of football presented in such a gripping way that even I understood!! I am not sporty. Now I am really interested in seeing football as well as satisfied with learning about a family whose beliefs were so integrated into their lives that it did not need mentioning throughout the book.

It was just fascinating and left me wanting to learn more.My interest in these kind of stories actually started with \\"what else but home\\" by Michael Rosen. 'What else but home\\" is about Michael's journey of informally adopting 5 Black and Latino kids from the projects, taking them out of the cycle of violence and poverty and trying to guide them to be productive citizens. The stories share some similarities; both are about \\"accidental\\" families, formed from conscious decisions to positively change lives, both highlight the importance of education, and both describe the hard work, struggles, and frustrations involved.Now onto \\"Push\\" by Sapphire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read despite being not exactly what you might think from the movie","review":"My family saw the movie so we decided to get the book; I remembered vaguely reading a New York Times magazine piece that Lewis wrote on the subject some time ago that I assume was excerpted from the book and thought it would be interesting to get the full story. It's an interesting and enjoyable book overall, with one main caveat: the movie for obvious reasons takes the Michael Oher story as the primary focus, while the book is fairly balanced between Oher's inspiring life story and the larger story about the \\"evolution of a game,\\" namely football, that Lewis addresses using Oher as a jumping-off point.

As a football fan, I thought there was enough of the evolution of the position to learn something, which provided an adequate level of context toward Michael Oher's evolution. The author did an excellent job in getting you involved with the depth of Michael's struggles, and in making you want to keep your eyes on Michael Oher moving forward.

I was really disappointed in the book. It was more focused on how things are done in the NFL and oh by the way a little about Michael Oher. It should have been all about Michael and a little background on the \\"blind side\\" not the other way around. Skip the book unless you are an armchair quarterback and just go see the movie. I heard it is great and can't wait to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The intersection of life and football","review":"The Blind Side is an interesting examination both of the evolution of a football position and of the amazing story of a young man who escaped poverty through the love of a Christian wealthy family. The real-life story is fascinating, as is his examination of the changes in professional football. The two parts are not well-integrated, however, and Michael Oher's story itself is told somewhat choppily and without the best narrative flow. I certainly recommend the book but I must admit there were times I wish it had been written by someone with more storytelling skill. This isn't a serious problem, though - read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did they go too far?","review":"A very well written book as are all Michael Lewis books. However, I felt like taking a shower after reading the end. The book did not have a \\"happily ever after\\" feel to it. The Tuohys(especially Leigh Ann) were not going to see Michael fail and would not let anything get in their way including an injured 3 year old boy. The correspondance school with BYU and the \\"tutor\\" made me question how much Michael actually learned. There was so much ego involved and I was left wondering if Michael was so keen on starting a Center for children like him (with his money) to keep Leigh Ann busy and supported her threats of him tranferring. I wish Michael well but I note he was second string All SEC and I hope he is prepared for life and not just running a Taco Bell."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than the movie.","review":"Saw the movie, and found it heartwarming, but the book is another thing altogether. Just wonderful. Learned a great deal about football (The author wrote Moneyball, after all) and the human side of the story was much more richly developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was going to be.","review":"I thought it was going to be more like the movie. All the history of the game was not anything of interest to me. If I were a football fan read it, they would probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blind Side","review":"Was a little disappointed due to the fact that this is mostly about the sport of football and not the story about Michael Oher as I assumed it would be. Did not see the movie yet either, so what I based my assumptions on were the previews of the movie back when it came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"the blind Side","review":"A little disappointed in this book -- It was so much football and not just about Michael and the family. There was alot of the book that I just skipped because it did not deal with his life.(I am not a football history person) I was looking for more like the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying book","review":"I loved the movie. The book? Not so much.As an avid HS and college football fan, I appreciate the emphasis on the evolving game.As a long-time teacher, I appreciate the efforts to bring a struggling child up to his potential.As a football mom, well... Let me just say that we don't have bazillions of dollars and a myriad of contacts at our respective alma maters (and beautiful window treatments and $2000 kitchen tables). Nor were we willing to flaunt the rules or have our son declared LD and then sign him up for \\"personal development\\" classes from an online school so that he could circumvent the NCAA rules. He's playing DII ball on his own merits, and we're happy about that.I'm 3/4 of the way through this book, and while I am not one to give up on a book, I am just tired of reading this.The Tuohys have lots of money. Money talks. Ho-hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled promise","review":"The premise of the store is interesting. How did left tackle become one of the most important positions in football? The first half of the book does a fair job of walking through the reasons. (West Coast offense, LT, etc.)Unfortunately, at that point Lewis runs out of things to write about, so he starts talking about Michael Oher, an O Lineman at Ole Miss. Oher's story is intersting, but it is too early to tell. He is a \\"superstar\\" but only a sophomore. I also think that Lewis overdoes how great Oher already is.I also don't really understand what Oher's story really had to do with the original premise of the book. Is Lewis saying that because left tackles now make millions, Oher wants to be one? I would think that if Oher had come around in the 70s people would still have thought of him as a football player. Last time I checked lineman were big and strong (and quick) in that era too."},{"rating":"1","title":"what were their real motives???","review":"This book needed a non-biased author.The first part talks so much about football, that I almost lost interest (although, it WAS kinda interesting). However, half-way through, I kept thinking those doubting thoughts, and sure enough, the book just reinforced how I felt.There were so many things that sickened me about the Touhys. First, the fact they \\"pushed\\" him to go to Ole Miss; 2nd, the use of someone else's baby picture!; 3rd the whole \\"christian\\" aspect of it (the \\"holier-than-thou\\" attitude); and finally I'd had enough when it was explained how they got around the system when it came to his education.It DOES make me wonder what their motives were. I just hope they're not making a dime off Oher's success (even though they probably are). And after seeing LeAnn interviewed on tv, it made me dislike her so much. The NCAA had every right to investigate.I hate not finishing books, but I got to about page 200 and couldn't take anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Story","review":"It's quite an odd subject for a writer of Michael Lewis's stature to cover, and the story line of the book is quite odd too. It made more sense at the end of the book when Lewis explained that the Touhy family of Memphis, TN are old friends of his. The story of the impoverished high school student Michael Oher from Memphis, TN was fascinating on many levels. The importance of sports today guarantees that a superior talent will be found and nurtured one way or another. Oher's case is about as extreme as you can imagine - being \\"adopted\\" by a wealthy Memphis family and hand-held all the way to an improbable college football scholarship and apparantely very good shot at the NFL. It's an extremely well researched and captivating story that will interest many, put particularly sports fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful family story for football fans","review":"I got this book just before the movie came out because I had a feeling I was going to love the story and I wanted to get a sense of the book first. What I found was a wonderful balance of football history/theory and story of a family brought together by football. Sometimes we aren't born into our families, and this was the case for Michael Oher. I'm a football fan who loves stories that explore humanity. In The Blind Side, I got it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story","review":"There's a lot to like about this book. The story of African-American Michael Oher and how his acceptance into a conservative Southern family helped him develop from a homeless, socially awkward teenager into a self-confident left tackle pursued by coaches from college-football powers, is heart-warming. Michael Lewis's writing is deft, and his effort at tying Oher's story into an account of how the left tackle position became so important in the NFL is masterful. It's a good read for football fans, and even non-fans can enjoy this rags-to-riches story as well. The movie version is good, too, but I recommend the book for its depth and detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game","review":"It was a great book explaining how the \\"Blind Side\\" works. I very much liked that Michael Oher was part of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The blind side: evolution of a game","review":"I liked the movie and wanted to read the book. I enjoyed the book very much. I would like to read more books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The blind side","review":"Good book I liked it I liked the movie to what a great story very very good book hope others enjoy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael's Story","review":"Very different from movie. Didn't like the cuz words. Felt that only a certain percentage was about Michael. Somewhat disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly inspirational story","review":"I picked up this book because I read other books by this author including Liar's Poker and Moneyball. I found this book truly inspirational. This is one of those stories that someone will make a movie about. Lewis tells a story about Michael Oher who was born to a drug addicted mother. He struggled through life and with the help of many families ended up playing college football and become one of the best players in the league.Whether you are a football fan or not, you will be emotionally touched by this story because every single one of us can relate to it. We all, in one way or another, have to struggle through life to achieve whatever it is that we want. If you have read other books by Lewis, this one will not disappoint you.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

I enjoyed MoneyBall but could not put down this book. Fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story of Wish Fulfillment!","review":"I love 'The Blind Side' and I never watch football. I did skip some pages that were only about football. Michael Lewis explained the football parts very well, but I just wanted to get back to the story. I stayed up until 5:00 am reading 'The Blind Side' and I was surprised to see the sun coming up. I highly recommend 'The Blind Side'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much More Than Football","review":"I read this book because I really enjoyed MONEY BALL and felt certain Lewis would handle any subject well. He did not disappoint me with this book. If you're looking to read a football book, you won't be disappointed, but you'll most likely be surprised by the intimate human story of love, loyalty and leadership that is included. This is a book for anyone looking to expand their awareness of our society and the human race."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I bought this book after I saw the film and was surprised that its emphasis was on the game of football and not so much on the story in the movie. Still I liked it very much and have recommended it to other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful story with many great messages","review":"Read the incredible true story of Baltimore Ravens lineman Michael Oher (pronounced OAR). One of thirteen children born to a crack addict mother, Oher spent his formative years on the streets of Memphis - times where neither the state nor the schools had any record of his existence.But through a chance meeting with the Tuohy family at Briarcrest Christian High School, Oher becomes part of a family, attends school regularly, plays sports - and gets a chance in life. It's a powerful story with many great messages (although I did skim over the lengthy descriptions of the development of the left tackle in the NFL)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great condition!","review":"The seller was responsive and efficient and the product was in the exact condition described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting character analysis, what's with the misspellings?","review":"I am currently reading this book for the second time. I enjoy the uniqueness of Michael Oher's personality, especially in the context of his personal environment. However, while reading this again I've come across at least four misspelled names without searching them out. Included are misspellings of Matt Leinart (Leinert), Adrian Peterson (Petersen), Patrick Ramsay (Ramsey), and Bob Stoops (Stoopes). I guess I will never understand this amount of errors in a major release."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Tom Cutler- Best Book I Have Ever Read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"History meets drama. This book provides the reader with an insight into the back alleys of West Memphis and Southern Detroit. It showcases both the game of American football and how it came to be, and the life of an under-privelaged boy gifted with size and athleticism. I won't say any more at the risk of ruining the book for you. This is a great book, and it can't hurt to buy it. Tom Cutler, 12 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a read...","review":"Michael Lewis has done it again. Recommend it highly to anyone that has appreciated his previous manuscripts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Subject Agreement, Please","review":"As many others have noted, this book is not about the evolution of the game of football as much as it is the story of Michael Oher. As interesting as Oher's story might be, it is disappointing to expect one type of book and find yourself reading something very different. I read and enjoyed \\"Moneyball\\" and expected this book to provide the same kind of analysis that would cause me to view football in a different light, as \\"Moneyball\\" did with baseball. It did not.It is a quick read, but I learned very little about the game of football. Most of the points made are fairly basic and pretty evident for fans of the game. If I had known beforehand what this book focused on, I would not have read it. That is why it merits two stars.In the future, I will be more careful before selecting a Michael Lewis book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the Movie, skip the book","review":"I wanted to read the book because there usually is more information contained in a book than in the movie based on the book & it ends up being better for it. Unfortunately the book wasn't better than the movie. There was way too much rambling explanations of the importance of former NFL players & coaches and, for extra added fun, these stories seemed to just be randomly stuck into the book in between chapters depicting Michael's life. I guess if you wanted to know the history of football, this would be a good book for you. If you want to know more about Michael than was depicted in the the movie, I guess you're out of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I don't like football. I would not see the movie. I was surprised when Sandra Bullock got an award for the movie based on this book. Then I read the book. I LOVE THIS BOOK.

HOWEVER, if you are reading the book to learn the story of Michael Oher, then you will be frustrated, turning the pages rapidly to get to those depicting his story. Don't get me wrong, the author knows his football and is adept at telling its history, as well as those unique players that have contributed to the game. As for Michael's story - - - see the movie. It's more rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of football knowledge.","review":"I am halfway through this. I bought it last night on Kindle for PC for my netbook. Easy to read, but a LOT of football background. You find out what every coach was doing before, during and after the timeline. That's ok, since my husband loves football and I have learned to, I enjoyed most of it. This is the kind of book you get for you, and then give to your boyfriend or husband, they might like it even more than you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I found the book to be an excellent read. Some very interesting football insights, including emerging offensive strategies, the increasing importance of the left tackle position, and the horrendous college football recruitment methods that currently exist. These are all interspersed within the story of Michael Oher, a gifted athlete , who manages, with much help, to emerge from the Memphis ghetto to become a potential superstar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and unclear","review":"This book is not a great value. It does not explain German grammar with the clarity found in April Wilson's \\"German Quickly\\" or even Sandburg and Wendell's \\"German for Reading.\\" It is particularly weak when explaining prepositions and the extended adjective construction, and it does not give pragmatic advice about figuring out the various crucial elements in a German sentence. Moreover, the exercise sentences are dull, and not worth the effort needed to translate them. This book is a classic mainly because German teachers are too lazy to seek out substitutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginers look elsewhere!","review":"I used this textbook in my first German class. I am a visual learner and this book doesn't have charts etc. that are needed if you are a visual learner. I knew nothing about German & I didn't really learn anything from this book. I consider buying this book a waste of money. If you have to have it for a class, try to borrow it from someone unlucky enough to have purchased it.I am retaking German 1 and the book we are using is Essential German Grammar (2002) by Durrell, Kohl, and Loftus. (Unfortunately it just went out of print so you will have to search for it.) It has lots of charts where the endings are in red so they are easily distinguished from the black type of the rest of the word. It focuses on learning patterns to recognize subject, main clause, subordinate clauses, etc. As a visual learner, this book is quite helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for a Novice!!!!","review":"Under no circumstances will I recommend this book for first time learners of the German language. Its poorly structured and fails to thoroughly introduce nerw learners to german grammar. If one has a background in German, then the book will be good for them but if one desires to learn for translation purposes, then this book is not for you. Furthermore, i was alarmed at the inclusion of very many imperialistic german passages....!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what I need","review":"I don't know how well it would hold up to heavy duty use on a regular basis (its not the same level of quality more expensive bits are), but it's perfect for boring out plastic lawnmower wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first step for Vegans!","review":"I recently decided to take the wonderful leap from being a vegetarian to a vegan and I went to a friend of mine for a cookbook to borrow so that I had somewhere to start from. The book that she lent me was \\"The Vegetarian No-Cholesterol Family-Style Cookbook\\" and I have nothing but great things to say about it. The recipe for eggless Mayo is a must along with great ideas for holiday dinners. Wonderful ideas for deserts and the Mushroom Barley soup is what they should've had upon Mt.

I found the plot very contrived and the love scenes were quite static compared to Lori Foster's other novels. I probably would have enjoyed the reading a lot more if 'Casey' had followed the format of the other four from the series. In short, the book was way too long for such a poorly fleshed out story. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"How she stretched it.","review":"I have to give it to her. There were moments when I wasn't suffering though the book, but they were few and far between. Maybe it was because I read the whole series at once and I was just sick of the characters, but I couldn't get into the story. There were problems in the book that needed to be resolved, but now that I'm done I don't know how she made the book as long as it was. I had a hard time thinking of Casey as an adult and not as the teenager he was throughout the whole book. Emma got on my nerves. It was a lot of romance but the issues in the book really didn't have anything to do with the romance itself. Basically, the book was a really long story with no plot. I read it in a day and wouldn't let myself put the book down.

Streaks in the varnish are evident from about 2-3 feet away and the surface is rough to the touch. Assembly was more tedious than anticipated since the milling quality is also poor. Assembly of one of the drawers was not possible without first using a chisel to expand the grove that holds the drawer bottom. Also, one of the two long rods for use of the file drawer with letter sized hanging files was missing from the package.

Picture books are meant to be a continuation of the text and this book succeeds in that purpose immensely. In the story of A Shop Full of Kittens, Tabitha the cat has lost her nine kitchens in a department store and she must find them. Within the illustrations, the reader has to seek and find through the picture where the kitten is. This book is a great tool for teaching vocabulary, for each area of the book is a different section of the department store. This book would most appropriately be used in a fist or second grade classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy time music","review":"Loved this CD. When is he going to make another?

This is a great album to listen to while you're sitting on the porch in the afternoon, just drinking a few brews(preferably Lone Star, 'cause, obviously, this is an album about Texas). I'm not from Texas, but I grew up watching Austin City Limits and Mr. Nunn's famed \\"London Homesick Blues\\" always played during the credits, making me wish I were in Abilene with the \\"friendliest people and the prettiest women you've ever seen.\\" After you hear this album, you too, will want to hop over the Sabine, head for Amarillo, and drink away the blues."},{"rating":"1","title":"London Homesick Blues Live","review":"This isn't the London Homesick Blues I bought the cd for.

The author breaks down topics in to small well focused chapters that help beginning programmers concentrate on one structure at a time.The algorithms are treated in a comprehensive manner. Besides the usual sorting and graph techniques many advanced and specialized topics such as file compression and cryptology are discussed.In sum, it ia a good second book to buy when studying C++."},{"rating":"1","title":"the writing of the book is not good","review":"The book always interprets each algorithm in English that cannot be easily understood.

I'm a few weeks into \\"Humanities in Western Tradition I, and I'm currently reading just fragments of what can be found in this book.

The book encompasses many of the great philosophical minds of in western history - the usual Greek medley plus other greats such as Locke, Descartes, Spinoza.Each set of highlighted works is prefaced by a small biography.If current western philosophical college curricula is anything to go by this book brings the relevant philosophers together in one place and thus forms a vital part of any student's bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase","review":"I was very pleased with the service and quality of my purchase.

Well, this book will be the first. The writing is drawn out, in this adoring (annoying) tone, references made to people and things without an explanation, constant jumping back and forth. And the sentences and paragraphs are so long. Could you not afford an editor? And who cares who Margot slept with or how she did it? Really...two stars only for the effort and the paper it was printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the gory details","review":"I was very disappointed in this book about the great Margot. Was it really necessary to put in all the salacious details of her sex life in order to give us a picture of her career and life? I think a little more restraint on the part of the author was definitely in order. I wanted to learn more about the ballerina's career on stage, not especially about what she did in bed and what her sexual prowess was. I agree with the lady who said she would not recommend this book to her daughter, the budding ballerina as I thought the 'so-called' sex information on La Fontaine was tasteless and over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for gym","review":"I particularly like the fact it's light weighted.

I think it is unethical, although not illegal, to manufacture locks that appear to be something other than what they are. I know the description does not say TSA-approved. Nonetheless, what is the point of producing locks that look like the real thing if not to deceive potential customers?? This is one of the few times I did not check on the individual reviews before I bought these locks because they looked just like the other TSA-approved locks I have bought in the past. Since it will cost me just as much to return these locks as the price I paid for them, I'll just stick them in a drawer. But I am angry and irritated at Master Lock for doing this. They have been a reputable lock maker but this really makes me wonder about their business practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily compromised","review":"We have many of these at the university that we use to seal computers instead of luggage. These are super easy to break into. If you lift the metal hook until it stops, you can literally \\"feel\\" the lock unlock when you switch to the right number (Starting from the bottom to the top). Bottom line is, these are fine when you have sight of your luggage or don't have anything too valuable in them. I wouldn't trust them for anything else.

This kind of thievery has been going on for years and the luggage and lock manufacturers don't tell you. Maybe you're better of using small plastic stay-ties which you or the TSA cuts off. Take several of these next time you travel AND do loop a second stay-tie into the first one and attach it to the top handle so no one can close the zippers if they open it illegally.

Everyone has their own taste, as others have noted here, but if you know and like solo jazz piano, I don't get why you wouldn't love this CD. I'd definitely put it up there with my favorite stuff from Bill Evans, Keith Jarrett, Chucho Valdes. I heard \\"The Sheik\\" from this album on the radio and bought the CD, and am very happy with it. It's true that Jessica delights in certain techniques, but she does them so well that I delight in them too. She explores coherently, tastefully, imaginatively and soulfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent all-around showcase for this creative pianist!","review":"This is a Tribute album - Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane & Mary Lou Williams are paid homage, I so much enjoy Jessica Williams' chops and enthusiasm, which spills over on the session; A playful, stride-style and a more contemplative side is also showcased throughout.

That's because the older devices used 12 volts, this adapter puts out 12V, and Apple switched to 5V(USB) power in newer devices. So, the iPhone tells you the charger is not designed to work with it...However, you can make it work, if you spend another $25 bucks or so. Scosche makes a small plug adapter that goes between this J3 and the iPhone or iPod, and reduces the voltage to 5V, which allows it to work with newer Apple devices.

The editing was so distracting and disconnected that I stopped watching the piece. There are silly cut aways just for \\"art's sake\\", the cameras go in and out of focus and shift angles for no reason, and the order of the lecture bits didn't make any sense to me. Chomsky's ideas are hard enough to follow if you don't have background info. on his subject, but it is fun and challenging to try to follow him as he explains the agendas behind our news, our reporting, our politicians, etc.... This film makes that kind of challenge almost impossible. (at least for me) Chomsky is, in my opinion, a genius and this film did not convey his coherent thoughts and eloquent speeches. I recommend Manufacturing Consent if you are new to Noam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Skims the Surface","review":"This movie on Chomsky isn't very unique or interesting. He is a brilliant man, and his books will obviously teach you more. A good dvd to check out is manufacturing consent - man. consent is almost three hours long, with a good structure that the movie follows, with more complete explanations of Chomsky's ideas.

I was expecting some sort of more hands-on version of Soros' \\"Alchemy\\". What I got was nothing of the kind. The trade examples are very simplistic and the book poorly constructed, laid out, and written. The entire work could be 2-3 chapters in normal prose and outline. The strategies discussed were somewhat advanced strategies that were described in an extremely simplistic manner. Somewhat akin to Sesame Street giving instructions on how to manage an options book. I was sorely disappointed as I know the author is capable of delivering a much more intriguing work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Titles might be misleading by Tevfik Aksoy","review":"The book is based on ex post iteration of events and investment strategies, which lacks the necessary foundation of macroeconomic introduction. It requires extensive knowledge of macroeconomics and finance in order to grasp (or digest) what the ideas behind strategies are. Clearly not for a beginner but I would not recommend it for an experienced fund manager at all. I found most of the examples and strategies highly simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that good.......","review":"When I first saw this book and ordered it i was very excited to learn more about the intricies of macro trading. After reading about 1/2 of the book I could tell I just wasted $40. I found that the authors comparison of two different variables on 1 graph with 2 Y axis was statistically wrong. You cannot compare two different variables on absolute movement at all, espically when you are using two different scales on the same graph. Using this method of comparison sun-spots and the S&P500; have correlated. The correct way to do this is by comparing percentage movement of the two different variables. By doing this with my previos example there is no real correlation, jsut as one would think. I would assume that the same would occur for 1/2 of this books graphs.All in all, buy, Market-Neutral Investing : Long/Short Hedge Fund Strategies by Joseph G.

By now, Davis was the most progressive force in the world of jazz and it was inevitable that something new was about to happen. Rock music was in the center of the world attention, and it was also the new source of inspiration for Miles Davis himself.His fascination with electrified instruments was enough to give birth to \\"Filles De Kilimanjaro\\". It just had to happen, marking the beginning of what would later be know as 'electric - jazz', or 'jazz - rock' if you prefer (perfectly balanced on 'In a Silent Way' and 'Bitches Brew' sessions, both from 1969, plus Weather Report's albums).

I am not really into games like Mario, Zelda etc. I am more of a person that likes play Playstation 2 games, watch movies, and listen and also watch my favorite music, so that is mainly the reason why I bought the PSP.

As a game system though it is quite nice, but nothing spectacular, once you get over the initial wow factor you will notice many of the games are lackluster mini versions of their big brother's counter parts.I had to return this item five times until ultimately receiving a refund, mine always seemed to have dead pixels, or button problem.

I already have an IPOD so I don't care about playing MP3's, and I own a DVD player, so I don't need to run out and buy UMD movies just so I can watch it on the PSP. I think the idea of UMD movies are a total waste, considering that they don't play on anything but the PSP. The PSP should have been able to play DVD's, then it would have been a great system.

I give up!!!","review":"I will admit that the PSP is a revolutionary system; from design to graphics, it kicks every other portable system out of the ballpark. The problem is, though, there are too many problems. CNET polls suggest that nearly 60 percent of the PSPs on the market have issues. Here is my story:The first PSP I bought had four dead pixels in the center of the screen (very distracting), so I returned it at gamestop.The second PSP I bought had only one dead pixel, but the screen had a bunch of dust UNDER the screen (major factory error). Returned to gamestop yet again.The third and last PSP I will ever own arrived with an entire row of dead pixels along right center of the screen. Returned to gamestop (got my money back after making a scene).Buyer beware. I must say that Sony really blew it on rushing this system out in the market, for it has too many basic errors.

This is one of the most beautiful little pieces of kid I have ever gotten my hands on, and I'm not just talking about outward looks. The graphical abilities are astounding and the screen is unbelievably good quality.BUT, I would advice against getting a PSP if you are only going to use it for games. The different price points mean that the Nintendo DS is far better on your pocket, and the games are also cheaper. I would also advice against it if you don't use your GB a lot. The the things about the GB is that offered something different from the home consoles, but the PSP is pretty much a slightly tuned down PS2 in what you will find yourself playing. Still, I love mine to bits.

Anyway, my main reason to post this is in agreement with a previous poster on the price- AMAZON IS OVERPRICING THIS SYSTEM!!! The original price is around (...), not (...)!

And even if dead pixels are still a problem, there is also a good possibility of a price drop, so you'd at least be saving about $50 if I'm right. However, if your just impatient, go out and buy one, and hope for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"dead pixles, not anymore","review":"Sony has realized that there are to many problems with dead pixles, it was the JAPENESE version, sony took all of them back and are now selling US versions with good screens. Dont be held back by the dead pixles. Just return it if you happen to somehow get a dead pixel, I curently have NO dead pixles and ive had mine for 3 months. DEAD pixles are caused by an image being shown oon the screen to long so the image gets parcially printed on the screen. Its not Sonys fault, its your fault for leaving an image still for an extended period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"PSP Rocks!","review":"I bought the PSP system in April of 2005, and it was no dissapontment! The screen is a beautiful widescreen, it has wifi. I liked it. The Only thing that's bad about IT is that it tracks fingerprints, so you have to clean it often. (With the included cleaning brush)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like a ps2 in your pocket","review":"First of all, the boy who said PSP is black poop shutup! Maybe you are just mad because you can't afford it or something. The PSP is the best. You can listen to music, watch movies, save pictures and play games. You can't do that with DS, why do you think the price has dropped already. Nintendo sucks. Gamecube and DS together is about the same price or less than PSP. That is how you know it sucks. Nintendo hardley never comes out with anything new. Since gameboy advance all they have came out with is different versions of a gameboy. For example, the gameboy micro, its just another way to play gameboy games, the SP, another way to play gameboy games. The DS is like the only new thing. Enough about Nintendummy. PSP' graphics are great. At first they only had a little bit of games, but now they have hundreds of games. It come with a charger, a remote, headphone, and even a smaple disk you just can't beat that for $250."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a game machine","review":"PSP is one of the coolest product that come out this year. It is a lot more than just a portable game machine. It also function as MP3 player, Video player, and Photo viewer.The game quality is not bad. It very comparable to PS2. Currently, there are not that many games out for PSP. But the number is increasingThe movie quality is great. Movies could be store in UMD Disc (you have to buy it. It is about $19 per movie) or your could convert DVD or any computer video and then store it on a MS Duo (I recommand all owner to get a really big size MS (at least 512MB) to store movie)Overall, this is one of the best gadget out there right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good!","review":"I am turning 10 and am getting the Sony PSP for my birthday.

Dead Pixles. When I play my games and watch movies they drive me crazy because they create greenish spots all over my screen. I have noticed that it seems like each time I turn the system on more of them show up, they are realy noticable now. If this problem didn't exist I would say that the Sony PSP is one of the best systems ever and by far the best handheld, but because of this wide spread problem I am finding them more and more unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Multi Gaming Device!!!!!","review":"The PSP is a nice game system released by Sony. It has many features that are awesome when on the go or even at home. Features includes: games(Universal Media Disks/UMD), MP3, movies(UMD), internent(wireless connection is needed, of course), and you can also download videos and photos onto your PSP. This value pack has pretty much what you need, except for games that is. It includes headphones w/remote, cleaning cloth, charger, battery pack, 32mb memory stick pro duo, and the PSP soft case. If you need game suggestions I would reccomend: Pursuit Force, Daxter, Ratchet and Clank:Size Matters, Full Auto 2, and also Burnout: Dominator. So as you can see, this IS the ultimate multi gaming device!!!!PSP:A+. Hope this review helps you if need games on the go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...not great","review":"I really wanted to give this system a fair shot. I truely did; however, after trying to get into game after game, I just can't get addicted to any one. The psp been collecting dust. I'm not saying don't buy it, but I'm rather saying that you may want to see if the game selection is to your liking before putting down money for this(if you're going to buy it just for the multimedia features, give it more thought-in my opinion, they are overrated, unless you have a huge memory stick). Also, who's going to put down 20 bucks for a movie that doesn't have half as many features as normal DVD's? There's an adapter to connect the PSP to the TV, but that's another 70 dollars.EDIT: After a while, I bought a larger(1 gb) memory stick and some DVD converting software. I am beginning to see the video capabilities on this, and I wish I could bump the rating higher. Also, I bought some good games(Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006 and Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I TOTALLY agree with that kid","review":"The kid with the sub \\"REVO SUCKS\\" is right.

At first, i was going to buy a Nintendo DS, but then i saw this. The DS cannot compare to the PSP. This system is AWESOME!!! Were do I start. The graphics are by far the best I've seen for a portable system. The lineup for games is basically the PS2 lineup, with future games like 007 from russia with love, Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories, Star Wars Battlefront 2, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Madden 2006 And NBA Live 2006. Now that new movie companies are publishing DVD's the movie line up is good too. The MP# feature will be nice too. But i did find a couple of downsides though. first, it did not come with a USB cable, but \\"supposedly\\" they already lose about $60 on each. Second, it scratches easy. Third, the battery only last about 5 hours. And lastley, Memory cards are Expensive!

They don't have time due to the upcoming console generation wars.There are way to few fun games for this system (through my friends & my brother who actually own the system, I've played just about all the 'popular' games for this system.

Now i'm trying to get ahold of the people at sony so I can get a refund and all I ever get as a response is that annoying recorded voice and never customer support.

Prepare for a 3-month affair with incredibly long waiting periods just to get another PSP that probobly has more defects then the first one. Unlike the Nintendo DS that is cheaper, more durable, and if you manage to break it, Nintendo's Warrenty has you covered. And don't pull that \\"The DS has GBA graphics\\" crud.

The characters are cookie cutter boring little people. For example, let's look at the dead daughter. She is described basically as perfect, only using more flowery corny junk to do so.And then there's the beautiful passage where he finds his daughter's shoe (which has somehow not been found at the crash) and picks it up, reminiscing. But Oh! it's too much and he throws it down. Nearly every chapter ends with a rediculous metaphorical summary of what has just happened. These closing paragraphs make up some of the worst writing I've ever read. Hilarious though.I could go on and on. I like almost any book I read, classic or not (except for really poor books).

I have sent it in twice to get serviced, and within a couple uses afterwards, it was bad again.Other issues I have with it: the button gets pressed very easily, even through the case, which causes it to beep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a few months, then get ready to pay $ to recalibrate","review":"At first I was happy with the device, as I felt the readings were accurate and consistent. After about 8 months, the readings became very inconsistent, probably an indicator that the breathalyzer already needed calibration. For example, a person blows into the device and gets a 0.2 reading. 5 minutes goes by, the same person blows into the device again, but this time gets a higher 0.8 reading. Since I purchased this device, the high price of calibration has jumped even higher from $20 to $25. Let me just say how unhappy I am with having to calibrate the Alcohawk Pro roughly every 6 months or so for the extremely high price (especially relative to the cost of the device itself) of $25. Rather than spending the money to calibrate the device, I'll probably just sell it and be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Money","review":"Bought to check people prior to driving after a party.

The commentators are good, although the color commentator goes to sleep after the 4th inning. This is a perfect game for kids - no obscenity, no violence, no gratuitous anything. A fun way to tour baseball stadiums around the US. The base running is a little hincky, especially if you've got multiple ducks on the pond. But the pitching and batting are great at the amateur level. I found the Professional level maddening from an offensive standpoint - where guessing the pitch and location are required just to make contact. Might be realistic, but its not much fun. Play on the amateur level and its endlessley enjoyable although you'll start to win about 90% of your games after the first week. Worth it for the pictures and simple play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baseball. Down to the Smallest Details","review":"This game rocks man. The graphics are unbeleivable. The gameplay is very realsistic. Certain players have their unusual batting stances and pitching windups, such as Johnny Damon and Orlando Hernandez. Also, the announcer is very good, he uses original phrases and does not have much repetition. The only minor gripe is that player ratings are weird. Dontrelle Willis is rated as the Marlins 4th best pitcher. Hes about the 4th best pitcher in the league. Also many players are overrated, when is Michael Young better than Alfonso Soriano and Mark Teixeira? Many good players are also underrated (i.e. Miguel Tejada, Bartolo Colon, Mark Buehrle, etc.) Also, every once in a while, a glitch occurs that has the pitcher just stand there, he will not throw the pitch and you cannot exit the game once this happens, but this happens very rarely, dont let it scare you from buying this game it really is a good game.

It lasted three days and killed an estimated five to ten thousand people. The mayor exploded dynamite to try to get rid of the fire, but the dynamite only created more. This novel also illustrates the annoying floor length dresses that the ladies of 1906 had to wear and the automobiles of Daisy's time. In some books earthquakes are made up just for entertainment. Not this one! This earthquake was real. The first shock was on April 18, 1906 and was recorded at 5:12:05 a.m. and it lasted for 45 seconds.

While it does make my hair pretty soft, whether I apply to damp or dry hair, it does absolutely nothing for my frizzies.It smoothes them down for about 1 hour on dry hair, but quickly they spring right back.For reference: I have wavy/slightly curly hair. This product doesn't seem to work on either the color treated portions or the natural portions of my hair.In the past I would distribute a dime-sized amount of pure vitamin e oil on my shower damp hair and then just sleep on it for nice defined waves in the morning. I'll go back to that for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, not too heavy","review":"This is a good product. It helps calm my hair and keep it from frizzing without weighting it down.

It manages at once to challenge one's notions of what system development ought to be about, placing it in the context of the history of our field, and confirm what one's experience has (often painfully) taught. But cutting through the style to reach the content is such hard work. The altogether agonising alliteration has me -- from time to time -- physically chucking the book across the room. I suspect that the ambivalent nature of the reviews that have been submitted reflects this dichtomy.Yes, the book is well worth the effort.

My only advice is that you read some of his earlier work first if you are a Clarence Bass fan. After reading \\"Challenge Yourself\\", I thought I could go back and read some of his earlier work that he referenced throughout this book. Big mistake, as his philosophy has evolved. \\"Ripped\\" was a waste of money for me, although I believe someone 40 years old, having not read CY and willing to take the \\"supplementation\\" he was at that time might gain something.

The ernies sound changed from original ska influenced music to a very Jimmy's Chicken Shack sounding power chord rock. There are three good songs on this album: Here and Now (the not very ernies sounding single), Mr. Benson and the Meson Ray (a pretty good ska jam that they played at a lot of their shows), and Its Digestible (an incredible song which proves that the ernies could have put out a stronger major label debut, and also sounds incredible live). The ernies dont like to be labeled or catagorized and contained, but they have done just this, with a record that sounds like a mix between Rage, Jimmys Chicken Shack, and 311. If you are an ernies fan, I dont reccomend this to you, but if you like the aforementioned groups--knock yourself out.

The things that they went through and their lack of self-love was sad.I was impressed with the way the writer was able to weave their past in at just the right moment. It is not often that you get to know about all of the characters in the book. Ms. Hill did not overwhelm you with their past, but just enough for you to understand where each person was coming from.All in all, Regina was such a hero. I liked her from start to finish.

Anyway, upon my first \\"unprepared\\" listening I was shocked! \\"Oh my God\\", I thought, \\"This is shlock!...How could I have? Possibly thrown my money away on this?\\"...Then I listened again. Somehow I had to force myself. I could not believe what I was hearing. Pure! Original! Like nothing I had ever heard before...Now I can't wait for anything he puts out. WANT ONE was a classic-but WANT TWO is truly a MASTERPIECE! I know it will probably never make \\"Top of the Pops\\" (as Ray Davies mights say) but this album is unbelievable!

I had never heard anything so irritating and awful in my life.I walked over to the music section, and found out it was Rufus Wainwright's new CD. I shook my head because I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I felt like I was being tortured and forced to listen to the sounds of screeching lab monkeys.Imagine a cross between Dave Matthews and an injured cat that just got hit by a car, and you've got Rufus Wainwright. The guy can't hit a key without sliding upwards toward it, kind of like what we all did in junior high when we were learning to sing.How anyone can like this is beyond me. I ran out of the store without buying anything because after 3 or 4 songs it was just too much to handle.So if you like the sounds of screechign monkeys and dying kittens, this CD's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the most pathetic cd i've ever listened to","review":"I have never heard such horrible sounding music, if you wish to call it that at all. I would have taken a hammer and smashed this album into little pieces if i thought it was worth exerting the physical energy to do so, Instead i slipped into the garbage disposal on the way to the frig, because i was hungry. I figured its so much easier for a fabulous invention to do something positive. not to mention the slanderous lyrics about jesus , that is not cool. it must be nice to be mr. wainright if he even deserves a mister to come from such a privledged musical household and choose to use his incredible talents in such a meaningless destructive fashion, its quite a shame. hopefully on his future works he can express something beautiful instead of hateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUFUS IS BACK ... BETTER THAN EVER!!","review":"This CD is great!! It is sad that he has not been given the attention he deserves; but, as a reviewer pointed out it's nice that he has not been 'swooped' up by the Top-40 crossovers. As soon as I heard 'Waiting For A Want' - the EP that was put on itunes exclusively, featuring Gay Messiah, The Art Teacher, This Love Affair, and Waiting For A Dream - I KNEW I had to buy this CD!! Please buy the CD, as it's a purchase you will be very pleased with."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album","review":"Rufus Wainwright is the most original and refreshing singer/songwriter on the scene today. He can sing anything and make it sound good. Want Two is the gay messiah's best effort yet. There is the regular chamber pop that made his previous albums great, plus the additions of obscure orchestral masterpieces and flaming cabaret swoons. The best songs on this album are the pop-rock \\"The One You Love\\" and the gypsy-folk/calypso of \\"Old Whore's Diet\\". The latter features Antony of Antony and the Johnsons. All in all, this is a fantastic and original album that deserves to be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"This album shows just how amazingly talented Rufus Wainwright is. His album begins with a classical piece sung entirely in Latin called \\"Agnus Dei,\\" translation is \\"Lamb of God\\". He then moves to \\"The One You Love,\\" which sounds like it belongs on a 60's rock album. All the songs are glorious in their own way. \\"Old Whore's Diet\\" is a commitment to listen to, since it is almost 9 minutes long, but the progression from beginning to end is amazing. My personal favorite track is \\"The Art Teacher,\\" which is a song sung from a woman's perspective.The DVD concert just makes you fall in love with Rufus as a person. He is such a passionate performer and a beautiful singer that all it will make you want to do is put the concert on loop and go out and buy every song he's ever published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watery","review":"All the songs did not play on my copy, so I returned it. However, the songs that I DID hear were not up to what I expected from Rufus. They all seemed to be the same song. I was disappointed. I still admire Rufus, But I will listen to clips before I order another album of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"I hope that one day Rufus will concentrate on simply making a classic cohesive album that he is so surely capable of. Not that any of his current 4 are ever less than compelling, it's just that they are too diverse and eclectic. Too full, perhaps.This, the second CD from the Want sessions of 2003, is as scattered with brilliant musical highs as Want One. Here, however, things go further into a more classical sensibility, arguably bordering on pastiche, and yet distinctly Rufus too.I don't think any modern musician has attracted this much attention from the classical fraternity since The Beatles. And the reason is the same - genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Rufus ditches all commerical considerations for this effort, and it makes for an exhilirating (if sometimes difficult listen).The DVD is a well-filmed live performance, though he comes across as rather catty in the off-stage footage. I'm not sure why a previous reviewer thinks Wainwright's \\"gay audience\\" would prefer to see him in a towel, telling the camera to get lost. Um, why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leftovers from Want One","review":"I love Rufus's music and although I feel \\"Want One\\" is his best album; in the same manner its evil twin, \\"Want Two\\" is his worst. I kind of expected it when I read he cut too many songs for them to fit in one album with the pick of the litter going into the first Want. The only reason to buy \\"Want Two\\" is the live DVD: a must for any fan.Payeyo GarciaSanto Domingo, R.D."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self got the better of him","review":"With each of his first three CD's, Rufus improved on the previous one. I absolutely love his Want One, but with Want Two he succumbed to every listener's fear - he did this CD for himself, not for his listeners. There is nothing on this CD for me. Perhaps I can use it to put under a wobbly table leg. I think Rufus is immensely talented, but he really wasted it here. I hope that his future work has something for the rest of us again."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"Don t buy Invicta, they are the worstI bought a watch in special it was 50$After 3 months got water inside, send it back to be repairedwithin the warranty..I got the watch after 3 monthsI was charged for shipping and handling 38$ plus 12.93brokerage fee......no other comments"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Watch Face","review":"The watch looks great.

Yes, there was evil-doing, but it was leavened with learning, poetry (William Blake's). One of her better efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial and unpleasant","review":"Walters' books are typically creepy and sordid. But the sentimentalism between an unlikely 14-years-old sqatter-genius, a twice-divorced decayed journalist, and a repressed gay voyeur is really too much. And all these details on homeless people. Actually, homeless men. Is this a book directed to cheer-up an audience of man-hating women?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad you do not have a no-star rating","review":"I am eminently grateful that I obtained this book at the library and did not buy it. The most positive statement I can make about The Echo is that the first 65 pages of this book were the best soporific I EVER took in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to get a headache, I suggest reading this book!","review":"I was a fan of this author, but she may have lost me. The most convoluted mystery I recall reading in a long, long time. So many characters. So many flashbacks. So many twists and turns. The author has a few scenes about a lady in South Africa...and I still can't figure out her connection with the plot. Like Patricia Cornwall, I suppose Minette Walters can screw up once every few books - but it is a shame after her previous books which were all terrific!I will say to her credit, the lady can sure write prose"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious reading","review":"I'm so glad this was not the first effort of Minette Walters for me to read or I would never have read a second and would have ultimately missed out on a wonderful writer. In The Echo Walters has, as usual, developed characters who truly are characters. However, to follow this book one would do well to create a flow chart to track the characters and their aliases and/or their sins. I was so thoroughly confused that by the time the book ended I felt that I had wasted my time reading it. Tracking this story was a form of torture that I could have done without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"This author is just about at the level of Ruth Rendell and her books, particularly the last few, are very highly recommended. I would not put this book among the author's very best - the plotting definitely is interesting but the climax and revelation of the killer do not live up to the promise of the plotting. Nevertheless, the author has created a likeable main character in Mike Deacon, although it is quite inexplicable why he would choose some of the friends he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minette Walters is a gifted writer!","review":"Congratulations Ms. Walters on creating one of the most enjoyable characters that fiction has seen in a long time. The character of Terry was the star of The Echo. I found myself looking forward to scenes with him in them.

This book is essential for all Walters fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An un-thriller","review":"I have to confess, I started the \\"Echo\\" with a bit of prejudice. Even though I quite enjoyed \\"The Sculptress\\", there was something suspicious in her previous books. Of course, I did not expect them to measure up to the best British mysteries, but then again, it is hard to compete with P. D. James and Ruth Rendell. But when I was reading the \\"Echo\\", I could not believe my eyes: a twisted, unlogical plot, stereotypical, cookie cutter characters, phony dialogues, political correctness in all it's ugliness. It got so bad, that in the middle of the book I stopped following the plot and was only able to pay attention to the stitches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walter's the Echo does not live up to her prior standards.","review":"Minnette Walter's previous books were true page turners. At the end of each the reader could not be sure beyond a reasonable doubt if the protagonist was guilty of a heinous murder or wrongly accused and maltreated. In the Echo there is no reason to care. Words on the page seem to go nowhere and there is no story or character about whom to care. This book went straight to the re-sale shelf of the local library in the hope of saving someone else the agony of buying such a disappointing hardback novel. Save your money.

If you really want to learn a language, I don't think these type of quick and easy CDs work. The marketing behind this CD is that if you listen to it on your 18 hour flight to China, you will be able to speak basic Chinese when you land. -- With general phrases you need to get around in Chinese. I would highly reccommend you not do that. While I have gone through the cd dozens of times, even taken a couple of cross country flights with it, and tried leaving one chapter on for hours, I have only picked up a few phrases, such as Hello, how are you?, and numbers. At this point, I am converting everything to notecards. As another reviewer pointed out, it is basically all blind memorization, and Chinese is hard to memorize.

The way to understand Barclay is to read an unaltered text of his original wording..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is simply wrong, and the original is not hard to read","review":"Freiday's book is condensed, garbled, and misrepresents Barclay in significant ways. It has very good footnotes, and more importantly, it has section and subsection headings, which Barclay's original lacked.If you can only have one, do not buy Freiday's book. Buy the Quaker Heritage Press edition of the original text. Then buy a pad of Post-Its and start flagging pages.If you can afford two, buy the QHP original to read, and Freiday's version to explain the esoteric references.There's no point in reading a shortened and twisted version if you want to know what it was that Barclay thought.

Gone Bad and Track 5.Calling for You. But don't let that stop you from buying it. The other 9 songs are $worth$ getting the album.*This fits in well with everything that Dee Snider has done.

This DVD also includes the original animated version of \\"Gotta Serve somebody\\" (which is sung by Bob but he does not appear in the animated film) and to say that this cartoon is ODD, is to understate how strange it really is.

The Mahavishnu is the greatest guitarist who ever lived. He constantly evolves and is always composing innovative music on guitar. This cd is a fine remastering of some of his electric guitar work with various musicians he had played with at this point in time (the late 70s).Some people may not be aware that guitarists from Jimi Hendrix to Al Dimeola considered Mclaughlin the best. This is one of Mclaughlins best recordings ever. Of course I can name few if any works by Mclaughlin that I do not enjoy.A must for Mclaughlin fans and for anyone who loves great guitar music.For some of his better acoustical guitar pieces I recommend some of his Shatki cds or his collaborations with Paco and Dimeola."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean and Crisp","review":"For the casual Mclaughlin enthusiast, this is a clean and crisp album that delivers excellent performances by an allstar lineup of jazz greats including a nice solo by Carlos Santana.

Even his pre-Mahavishnu work on recordings with the likes of Miles Davis and Tony Williams displayed a more free, atonal style. \\"Electric Guitarist\\" indeed granted McLaughlin credibility with even the harshest purists.

That means it's an enemy of yours. Its millionaire executives shut down all it U.S. plants and moved them all to China. Why should you pay $11 for a product when the slave who made it was only paid 1/100 of a penny?There are American-made padlocks, believe it or not.

Also not good.A third one I had just broke. It looks locked, but regardless of the dial settings - a gentle pull on the lock opens it.

The other 8 would not allow me to reset the combo from 0000. After the keys are inserted, it would not turn on any of the 8, even after jiggling, cajoling, and bending the key. I am familiar with how these locks are supposed to work, but I read the instructions just to be sure (I was doing it correctly). Also wasted about a 1/2 gallon of penetrating oil on the 8 which would not work, and a few hours trying to get them to work as it became a bit of a project.

Hard to keep up with key if you're going to change combo later. Dial turns only one way and numbers aren't as easy to see as some competitors.

Fortune was smiling on us the morning of the Kanapaha Spring Garden Festival as my husband and I experienced Lisa Lynne's music in person. We were eager to take home such enchantment and it was only as we were paying for the CD that Lisa Lynne came to us and shared that we had bought the very first copy of this new release.

Most of the content covered how the avionics worked. While there was some diagnostic/troubleshooting, it was at a very low level and did not go into much detail. There was a lot of text that could have been much more definitively explained with a flow chart. The normal repair info provided was to ship the possible defective unit back to the manufacturer for repair. In one word, what this book lacked is DETAIL!In all fairness to the author, avionics diagnostics and repair is not an easy subject of cover. The cover says that the audience is for Pilots and Technicians. Having two diverse audiences is probably the problem. There is probably slightly more info than what is needed by the Pilot. However, the info is highly deficient for the Technician. This book is more of a Pilot book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of the Tiger... not!","review":"Very disappointing especially following the excellent \\"Reload\\" album.

I didnt bother to read the macintosh description.This thing saves information way faster than floppy disks, cds, or the fatter floppy disk that no one uses anymore. it transfers music files and almost any other file to the data traveler at about the same rate that mp3 players transfer songs using their usb cord. the price for this online is cheaper than in most stores so if you can wait for it to ship get it online. oh and a gigabyte of information is probably a lot more than youd need for school reports and power points. if your going to be using it for school id reccomend getting a 512 mb usb drive to save money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Snuff","review":"I've had this flash drive for 9 months (since March 2007), and today it died completely.

I decided to try it to see how bad the damage was, and plugged it into my computer. I waited and then, all of a sudden, the little light lit up and I checked the drive. I did not lose any data!

Furthermore we get to listen to that same Oklahoma draw voice of his (or whatever you call it). Often his call victims pick up on the phony voice, and just hang on the phone to play along for fun. Roy's \\"character\\" isn't gritty or edgy. If you like Luke warm, \\"Senior citizen approved\\" calls then maybe you can sit through this for the 5th time.

Before we moved back to the US, we sold it and I was devastated to see it go because it's truly stunning. Imagine our excitement when we found it on Amazon for cheaper than we bought it the first time - and even cheaper than we sold it for!! It's really beautiful, great quality, looks much more expensive than it is, lasts for a long time and adds so much to the room. We can't imagine our dining room without it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome footage of lions and hyenas","review":"This film has really cool scenes following two lion prides- lots of action!

Maybe not since 1974, but for a while. And I don't get this album. I never got it, and I still don't get it. I just can't get into this album. Maybe I'm too stupid to get it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Short","review":"First experience with Mahavishnu. Bought based on past John McLaughlin recordings. Can't state that I enjoyed what was offered here. Too bad as I was looking forward to expanding my McLaughlin library."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Apocalypse is stunning.I've read a couple of reviews where people say that there are a couple of dull tracks and this and that... but I am of the opinion that each song has a very appropriate place on the album. I love the blend of classical and jazz/blues/rock influences on this record.To put it nicely, if you are reading this, you should buy inner mounting flame, birds of fire, apocalypse, visions of the emerald beyond, and between nothingness and eternity. Each album is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique artistry","review":"This work really pushes the envelope of musical expression and challenges asumptions of jazz and fusion. Real pioneering stuff, but also very compelling and often beautiful. It just works. It's not the best Mahavishnu record, and not the one to get if you are getting your first or second, but if you are a Mahavishnu fan this album should be an essential part of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Apocalypse\\" is highly underrated!","review":"This is an excellent disc. It's been panned in many jazz guides, but I feel it's a very solid Mahavishnu Orchestra release (I'd say second to their debut, \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\"). This disc combines interesting orchestral arrangements with John McLaughlin's virtuoso guitar work, not to mention Jean-Luc Ponty's violin playing!! I'd definately recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tales from Apocalyptic Oceans??","review":"I was rather surprised by the mostly glowing reviews this disk has received here. I've been a Mahavishnu fan for ages, but never bothered to buy this disk until a few weeks back when I was able to pick it up for $6 at the Tower Records bankruptcy sale. While quite audacious in its ambitions, it doesn't hold a candle to any of the other early 70's Mahavishnu releases, including Visions of the Emerald Beyond. In fact, for some reason it reminds me of another ambitious, but ultimately flawed album from around that time, \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" by Yes. Both albums have their moments, but both also have some very weak moments that render the overall listening experience a bit burdensome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absoloutely amazing","review":"Get Me Some is truly a great album. I must admit, it took a couple of listens to get into, but now I still can't stop listening to it. I first heard I Tried and I should have told you on the House of Blues Website and immediatelt started the hunt for this CD. All of the tracks have a great sense of feeling and soul which pours out of Jeff and band with songs such as Feel Better and I Tried. My only disappointment was that it was not released here in Australia and had to get it on import. Other than that, I hope to hear more of the same from Jeff Healey in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with John L. Gray","review":"Once it sticks, this product is great! However, the tape that comes with it is TERRIBLE! It does not stick to the sill nor to the wall! And sometimes not even to the plastic itself. It is sooooooo frustrating because only after I have carefully finished the entire job do I hear the tape coming off the wall, meaning all my work sealing and shrinking it went to waste! Then I have to get my own tape and go over the edges, and only then does it stay in place.The plastic is great though, just be careful not to blow-dry it too close or it will make holes in it. My house is a lot warmer when I seal all my windows with this. It saves on gas bills for sure!Do follow the instructions on the box carefully!!! But remember the tape doesn't stick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tape isnt Sticky","review":"Plastic sheet is OK BUT the tape isnt sticky on both sides, and is not very sticky on the one side.We're going to the hardware store to buy some double-sided tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"He deserves better","review":"This new Victor Herbert is a disaster. The soloist is bad and destroys Romany Life. Her other songs aren't much better. Most of the vocal music was written with a chorus in mind. No chorus. Over half the vocal selections are mutilated. 2/3rds of Kiss Me Again is gone, about 1/2 of Moonbeams cannot be found, the second verse of A Kiss in the Dark is among the missing, etc. Thine Alone was written as a duet. Molly was written for a tenor. They are sung by a soprano. Herbert wrote so much music beautiful music but onl;y his most famous can be found here. Three or four orchestral selections are all that can be recommended. Until John McGlinn or Richard Bonynge realize that Herbert once existed he is in trouble. Naxos and Brion are not the answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Price of Admission","review":"The artists on this CD, as well as Naxos, are to be commended for a fine performance of this wonderful music by one of America's great compsers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mayer needs an editor!","review":"The scope of this book is fantastic. I wanted to enjoy it, but Mayer plays too fast & loose with the facts. His descriptions of banking principles is muddy, leaving me to wonder if he's a sloppy writer, a bad economist, or so presumptuous to think his readers all have finance PhD's and don't need clear explanations. Among his factual errors: He mistakenly put Citicorp's card processing center in Fargo, North Dakota (instead of Sioux Falls, SD) and Reno. First Chicago was bought by National Australia Bank; it did not merge with Michigan National. Midlantic was bought by PNC, not City National of Cleveland. What happened to editors?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating insight into the \\"modern\\" ways of banking.","review":"Martin Mayer gives the reader a very thorough and insightful perspective of today's financial industry. A must read for everyone who wants to be up to date in the financial services industry, its risks, challenges and disasters, it equally well serves the outsider. Mayer's writing is full of anecdotal accounts of recent events in banking, making this a very pleasant read. His authority in the field is quite obvious and the picture that he paints of current developments in banking leaves plenty food for thought"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks too Much for a Box Set","review":"Too many key cuts are missing from this collection, and far too many non-essential tracks are in their stead. Absent are \\"Daybreaker,\\" \\"It's Over,\\" \\"Confusion,\\" \\"Last Train to London,\\" \\"The Diary of Horace Wimp,\\" \\"I'm Alive,\\" \\"All Over the World,\\" and \\"Calling America.\\" The two cuts from the flop film \\"Xanadu\\" are sorely missed, as the soundtrack to the movie is a difficult find. Three CDs is too many, since a single or at most, a double-CD collection would have covered all the AM & FM hits easily. This box set is not worth the price, and fans will be better off finding an import, or buying the \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD and filling in the gaps with the original LPs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Blue","review":"ELO released the three disc set Afterglow on June 15, 1990. The three disc set includes hits mixed in with album tracks and rarities. The box comes with a booklet and each disc has it's own letter on it: first disc E second disc L and third O. It really isn't a bad collection and has selections from the first couple of albums which is quite nice. However, it does feel like it falls a little short and could've been better. The album Eldorado gets somewhat stiffed and there's no Fire On High. I think part of the problem here is that they had to make room for the rarities and unreleased cuts which are mostly from the Secret Messages sessions. Secret Messages was originally planned as two lp set and quite a few of those end up here. While nice, this also gives the box a disproportionate amount of songs from this era. This box would've worked a bit better had they made it a four cd set. Perhaps with three for the released stuff and one for the unreleased stuff with more rarities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive ELO collection that true ELO fans will cherish","review":"This box set collection has the best of everything from the band that many of us grew up with. The set runs the gamut from the early 70's sounds of Strange Magic up through present day late 80's hits like Calling America. This is the only ELO album one needs to have in their personal collection to cover all of their greatest music. This CD far outclasses the prior \\"ELO Greatest Hits\\" release. Don't waste your time and budget on such a limited release, go ahead with this purchase -- AfterGlow is an album that you will thank yourself for buying for years after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise!

They change there style, to try to get new fans, but they just lost one. If you never heard of Shades Apart, you might like this album. Better yet you should go buy there older albums first. Then buy this one last, since it is the worst one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades Apart's 'Eyewitness' - A Power Pop Gem","review":"When compared to previous Shades Apart releases, 'Eyewitness' is restrained in tempo and crisply produced. It is also clearly the band's most mature and diverse recording to date. While \\"Valentine\\" is catchy and heartfelt, tunes like \\"Edge of the Century\\", \\"Sputnik (Watching Over You)\\" and \\"Second Chances\\" pack more of a power-pop punch. And you can't help but feeling good after hearing out the album's blazing closer, \\"Speed of Light\\". After many years of hard work and little acclaim to show for it, I am pleased to see that Shades Apart still aspires to make great original rock and roll music. If you enjoy edgy pop rock with a little jolt, 'Eyewitness' is well worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"It TOTALLY rocked!","review":"I was so happy to finally hear an awesome band on the radio--Shades Apart. \\"Eyewitness\\" is a great CD that illustrates the band's obvious musical talent. The three musicians in this band have long deserved the credit that \\"Eyewitness\\" has brought them. Their CD's are better than anything most radio stations play. Shades Apart cannot be compared to any other band because simply--no other band can compare. I guarantee that if you buy \\"Eyewitness\\" you will not be able to stop listening to it. I can't. It's catchy melodies and lyrics will have you hooked. It's definately one of the best CD's I've ever heard. If you feel the need to categorize \\"Eyewitness,\\" categorize it as great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyewitness....the BEST Shades Apart yet!!!!!","review":"I have been a Shades fan for years....and I think Eyewitness is their best yet!!!!! I recommend that you run to the nearest store and buy this....it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Genius","review":"Where to begin. . . This NJ band really knows how to rock, from upbeat fast songs like 100 Days to softer melodic songs like Starry Night this group aims to please and really delivers the goods. Their earlier works are a little heavier, each CD being unique from the one before it, but Eyewitness should appeal to every music fan. So for those of you who haven't purchased a Shades Apart CD yet this is a great one to begin with, just listen to the samples or go to the groups website (www.shadesaparthq.com) and listen to full versions and for those of you who love SA no collection is complete without this newest edition. Look for their next CD in 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album, every song worth listening to!","review":"A great rock album with excellent vocals, and aticulate playing.

Their new CD, Absurd Pop Song Romance, where the trio of Chris, Jon and Luis is joined by the terrific stage presence of Patrick, helps this great band, whose fame is largely due to word of mouth publicity to grow.Their sound has changed sharply from solid headbanger music into a softer, professional style, while maintaining their in-your-face gay sensibility. The lyrics are as clever as ever, and their title track, Absurd Pop Song Romance could put them in the mainstream if it gets enough pop radio airplay.Chalk another one up for this gayest of gay rock bands! Absurd Pop Song Romance is their best CD yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the most important album of the 1990's","review":"i bought this album back in 1991 when it first came out and it has been an integral part of my life for over 8 years. this is a monumental album that will, in hindsight, define the 1990's for me. 'dance with the tiger' remains the one song in my library that i turn to as a comfort song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A landmark achievement in pop music","review":"Nothing else in Rosanne's discography could prepare you for the intensity and the stark beauty of these 10 songs. Rosanne wrote and produced this acoustic 'concept' album, examining the dichotomy of a dying marriage that still seemed okay \\"on the surface\\". Writing about a 'relationship-gone-sour' is hardly rare in pop music, but Rosanne is a terrific songwriter who digs for the truth and doesn't flinch at the harsher realities of a relationship that just doesn't work anymore. Beautifully sung and produced, 'Interiors' is a masterpiece worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous Fun!","review":"A very entertaining cookbook, gay or straight you'll enjoy the spicy humor and the spicy food!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cd's of the 90's","review":"I had always been a huge fan of Prefab Sprout's singles but had been disappointed by the full length cds. There were always one or two songs that just never seemed to fit thematically (blueberry pies on two wheels good for example). So when I bought Jordan, I assumed it would be the same result. At first I thought the cd was an unholy mess...I couldn't get the point. After finally driving on a long trip I listened to it several times in a row and the themes stuck out like a sore thumb. Now, not a week goes by when I don't put this on. First class songwriting and an unerring sense of melody. A definite desert island disc. Favorite singles: \\"Michael\\" and \\"One of the Broken\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Jordan: The Comeback\\" - A Prefabulous Album","review":"\\"Jordan the Comeback\\" is an excellent achievement by arguably one of the best pop bands ever. The first cut on the album: 'Looking for Atlantis' is a wonderful, beguiling mix of classical imagery and good, solid pop syncopation. As always, the excellent literary-ness of the 'Sprouts', (as opposed to the 'Cranberries'), is only matched by their compelling musicality. After 'Atlantis', McAloon and Co. explore the power of desire in 'Wild Horses'. A Similar exploration is offered in 'Scarlet' on \\"Protest Songs\\", another fine 'Sprouts'' production. The third song on the album, 'Machine Gun Ibiza', is a very tongue-in-cheek look at the high life of the rock and roll (or RollMo) star, not unlike the wonderful 'King of Rock and Roll' on the fabulous album: \\"From Langley Park to Memphis\\". In summary, all the songs on \\"Jordan the Comeback \\" are gems; and, the album is really a compelling collection of sagatious critiques re: human emotion / experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sprout at it's most masterful","review":"This is perhaps the most perfect pop album ever made. Seriously. Paddy MacAloon, though critically acclaimed as one of musics most accomplished songwriters and pop stylists, still remains in a commercial twilight zone. Each release since the american debut of 'Two Wheels Good' has gotten better. More polished. Sometimes taking more chances (mainly with 'Swoon'), but always delivering pure pop gold. 'Jordan...' is a long, gorgeous symphony, somehow combining the triple theme of Elvis Presley/Jesse James/the archangel Michael into 19 glorious songs. Yes, you will get your money's worth...and you'll still want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this. It'll benefit you.","review":"Yani's good. Everyone else is fine. But Loreena McKennitt...that's a very different story. Define the best voice you can find...yep...her.

Just watch UPN's \\"Legacy\\" and you'll know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as good as the first","review":"Not bad, but not Pure Moods I, either. With the first Pure Moods, each song I listened to transported me somewhere, or brought back a pleasant memory.

If there is a Pure Moods III, and I hope there is, I trust more effort will go into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Editorial Review","review":"\\"Pure Moods was such an unexpected success that it launched a number of spinoffs and, eventually (and perhaps somewhat inevitably), Pure Moods II. Although it isn't quite as consistent as its predecessor -- George Benson's 'Breezin\`' feels out of place among among these atmospheric cuts, but not nearly as much as Massive Attack's menacing 'Teardrop' -- but fans of the first will still find it to quite enjoyable, especially since it features Vangelis' 'Chariots of Fire,' Loreena McKennitt's 'Mummer's Dance' and Dream Academy's 'Life in a Northern Town,' three major oversights from the first Pure Moods. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Very Good, with a few exceptions","review":"I got this CD because I heard from my English class students that it was very good, and indeed it is!!!

The only thing I'm disappointed is the song \\"Teardrop\\" by Massive Attack, which has no tone of being New Age or World, whatsoever, just dull techno.

There was also more great music by Adiemus, Enigma, and Sacred Spirit.However, there were also some not so great songs. \\"Euphoria\\" and \\"Teardrop\\" sounded too much like rock to be on this New Age compilation. \\"Breezin'\\" was okay, but \\"Emily\\" was too jazzy. \\"Life In A Northern Town\\" wasn't that great. Well, it had interesting lyrics, but the music was weak.In the end, I'd say this CD ismostly pretty good. There was beautiful music, but there was also pop, jazz, and rock that did not belong here.

Examples should be done in C#, VB, or both.I understand the desire to cover both VB and C# in a single book, but this awkward attempt to do so effectively produces an inadequate implementation of each rather than a decent implementation of both.Developers seeking to use this book to learn more about building Web Parts for Sharepoint should steer clear.

The plot develops in surprising ways; and the characters seem appropriately off-balance throughout. I understand portions of the movie were improvised, which may account for this. If so, it's a thoroughly appropriate tactic. The only word of warning is that you may need some French to understand the entertaining way it's fractured in this movie, and the iron control the French characters must be exercising to control their faces in response. Rule of thumb: if you don't know what a bijou is, you might not get it.A fascinating exercise is to compare this movie with I Capture the Castle (2003), which develops the identical premise in a completely different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A film that proves that digital video is not going to \\"save\\" the industry...","review":"I saw the directors of this \\"film\\" on Charlie Rose, of all places.

This film is slight, stupid, boring, and terrible, from both a technical standpoint and an aesthetic one. It seems the filmmakers said \\"let's go to a chateau with some actors and real cheap DV cameras\\" and make a movie. Well, that's exactly what they did.

There are scenes where we hoped the servants would either poison the two annoying guys from Kansas or just flat out shoot them in a hunting accident and make them disappear.The story idea is great, but the acting and script is so poor and unworthy of being described in a review.Jesse must either have personal ties to the building where he filmed-or really fallen in love with the building.

The acting is pretty good. I dont know if I liked the actor or actress more. I loved the twist, semi-twist, towards the end.

The first time I saw it was in Korea visiting some friends from there, I enjoyed the movie and the story really struck me hard so I decided to buy the DVD from Amazon when I got home (In Korea they don't sell US region movies)... the DVD is censored, actually they took away a lot of important and funny scenes from the film. I'm not judging the movie, is a must see for everyone; but the fact they re-edited the movie for the Chinese / US version is a big failure!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is still in my TOP 10 Movies of all time, granted it's more geared towards a korean audience, but if you have an open mind you will definitely see how this movie brings out Young Love from a not your average type girl. 5 [...]' Stars...

I intended to use this cushion in the vertical orientation, to act as a back support when sitting on the ground. In fact, the picture that comes in the wedge cushion package shows an adult sitting upright on the floor, leaning against the cushion, and the cushion is supporting her back.That picture is essentially false advertising. The reality is that the blue part of the foam is as soft as the white part, and cannot support an adult leaning on it. The cushion squishes down so badly, there is almost no back support. The only way it could work in the vertical position is if there was already a vertical support surface to lean against.Use in the horizontal position works OK, although I don't intend to use it that way.I'm tempted to return it, but too lazy to go through the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute beginners guide","review":"i was disappointed .I need something even easier on how to fix minor mistakes.

Only if you want too.....you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near the first!","review":"The first CD created by the Taliesin orchestra was a lovely rendition of Enya's work, with wonderful instrumentals. This CD falls far short of their mark. With the exception of Bodicea, not one of the tracks comes even close to matching the feel or sound of Enya's work. Orinoco Flow was worth buying, but I would advise everyone to steer clear of this CD, it is not worth considering"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Taliesin's previous tributes to Enya (ORINOCO FLOW)and George Winston (FORBIDDEN FOREST), so I snapped this one up immediately.What a disappointment!Charles, leave the vocals to Enya, and go back to working your magic on the instrumentals.Still, 2 out of 3 isn't a bad batting average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you really like elevator music","review":"I was very disappointed with this album. I am very familiar with Enya's work and enjoy the fact that it is soothing without putting one to sleep. Unfortunately \\"Maiden of Mysteries\\" crossed the line and managed to make Enya boring. I will give them an \\"E\\" for effort, but overall the album failed in it's mission to offer viable reworks of Enya's beautiful melodies. I'll just pull out \\"Memory of Trees\\" one more time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!","review":"Enya fans who would welcome an interesting, novel twist on her music to supplement the original albums should definitely avoid this offering. Rather than providing orchestral versions of the familiar songs, this album provides vocals as well (in contrast to an earlier album by the Taliesin Orchestra). The vocals are insipid. The arrangements border on the bizarre (the long Storms in Africa, for example). My copy is destined for the trash, rather than my collection shelf. Please save your money for future albums of the real thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taliesin Orchestra Has Strayed","review":"A major disappointment! Purchased this based on the outstanding first orchestral of Enya's music in Taliesin's ORINOCO FLOW. The banshee background vocals and the 'pop' beat literally mutilate most of the cuts in this album. Taliesin Orchestra knows how to make beautiful music - a la FORBIDDEN FOREST and ORINOCO FLOW. When they did ANTHEM they started to stray from their best...and now it has been carried over to Enya's music. The best way to honor Enya's music is to use the orchestra to express the mood and flow of her music...or have Enya herself sing her songs with a full orchestra. Get rid of the background banshee vocalists! While imitation maybe the sincerest form of flattery, this neither imitates or flatters. Hopefully Taliesin Orchestra will revert to their former selves and bring us more quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"a time to dance","review":"Despite what others have written in review of this cd, I thought it was great. I am a fond fan of Enya and think this cd is a refreshing deviation from her much loved traditional style. I especially liked the African beats and back up. This cd is upbeat, yet still dreamy - - it inspires the listener to dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is a BIG disappointment","review":"Unlike its predecessor \\"Orinoco Flow\\" which is an outstanding orchestral arrangement of Enya's music...this album is a real disappointment. The arranger is way off in left field on many of the arrangements. \\" How do I keep from Singing\\" is just plain awful espcially the singing. I thought this was supposed to be an orchestral album like \\"Orinoco Flow\\". Its as if Charles Sayer the arranger is trying to best his talents against Enya's. Only two songs are worth praise...\\"Pax Deorum\\" and \\"Evacuee\\" both of which follow the trend found on the previous album. I am a major fan of Enya's music and have been so for 10 years. This is the first time I have been disappointed and would definitely not recommend this album to anyone who appreciates Enya's music. A waste of money and time. It doesn't deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"falsely labelled","review":"After listening to orinoco Flow, I decided to get this CD. Unfortunately it is mislabelled. It is not about the \\"music of Enya\\" (like the previous one) but about her songs. Now, do we really call artists singers who try to imitate the original one? I don't think so. except for one or two tracks, this cd is not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, well written and easy to read.","review":"I enjoyed reading this edition of this book.

Despite that there are more decent tunes on this than on the earlier \\"Tonight\\": \\"Time Will Crawl\\" is one of his strongest cuts from the eighties; the Lennon-esque title track is simply a great pop song; and \\"Glass Spider\\" seems to be a return to form, harking back to the opening track of the fantastic \\"Diamond Dogs\\" album. Aside from these three tracks, however, the rest of the album is a pretty dispensable affair. The first half manages to keep itself above water, but the second half is blandness personifies - eighties pop at its worst. The bonus tracks on the re-issue make the album slightly more worthwhile. Although \\"Girls\\" and \\"Julie\\" aren't much cop, \\"When The Wind Blows\\" is a criminally underrated Bowie song. So, on the whole, the album isn't much good but the decent tracks would've made a great EP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bollocks","review":"Bowie himself admitted that he was in a creative slump when he cobbled together this atrocity, and I wholeheartedly agree. Gone is the brilliance of \\"Scary Monsters\\" or even the proficient if superficial pop of \\"Let's Dance\\": instead we have an uneasy combination of flatuent bombast and pure bland. The reissue is slightly more bearable than the original album; \\"Too Dizzy\\", the worst track, has been dropped. Bowie thankfully returned to making great music a few years later with Tin Machine. Too bad hardly anyone noticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw away album","review":"I bought this album after buying the genius Bowie albums Heroes and Ziggy Stardust. Boy was I in for a surprise!

Yes, the illustrations are gorgeous, but the content is dominated by unexplained acts of social rejection. If your child is at an age where discussions of stereotyping and ostracism are appropriate, this book presents a teachable moment. Why is the story dominated by repeated acts of ostracism until the very last couple pages? Must an individual who is heavily stereotyped prove themselves to be harmless in order for society to recognize them and/or associate with them? Does the ending suggested by the story work in real life? Needless to say, these are discussions for most children older than 2 or 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Very good book that teaches counting and basic concepts.

The band was about two links too long for my 6-1/2 in. woman's wrist (medium-large), but nothing I couldn't live with.Unfortunately, about 2-1/2 months after I received it, it stopped working--or rather, it stopped dead, then started again when I shook it a little, and then after another day, stopped completely, which suggests that the battery was old when it arrived in my mailbox.2-1/2 months out, it's too late to return it to Amazon, even though this is clearly a problem with the supplier Amazon got it from. I've purchased watches at this price level before and they've worked for approximately the year they should work before needing another battery.

Fisher employs small forces - three singers (each playing a character in the More tragedy and also doubling as a Dark Angel), together with a guitar, cor anglais, an indian harmonium drone and a small amount of tabla-like percussion - to create a slow-moving ritual that depicts and comments on the issue of Thomas More's integrity. Should he agree to sign a statement of support for Henry VIII and compromise his principles, or should he \\"hold his pen\\" and sacrifice himself?The music is slow-moving, tonal and austerely beautiful. The performances are flawless, and the recorded sound is spacious and atmospheric.

I drank one can before doing an hour of cardio and then drank the second can before getting back in the gym five hours later to lift weights.I got through about twenty minutes of cardio before the white-knuckled-near-panic attack ensued. It was about an hour of scary, disembodied attempted weightlifting interspersed with spontaneous laughter. I was incapable of even moderately intelligent conversation - but my lifts were amazing. I thought I was going to have a heart attack and I almost left the gym three times to go home and take an anxiolytic.About two hours in, I actually felt pretty darn good.

I don't think the book knows whether it is a serious treatment of life and suffering during its time/place or a Flashman-like tongue-in-cheek sexual-hijinks anit-hero adventure.

I felt like I was reading a plain romance/adventure novel instead of the great historical fiction book (i.e. Aztec) I expected.The only reason I finished the book was to find out why Cristo was being persecuted.

I'm open to religions though I don't follow any formal religion as I like a more spiritual path that can be followed by an denomination. That said, this one is not that type & did not seem relaxing or give a mind/body connection, rather a lecture while you exercise.

The inflection and phrasing that Terry adds to each song gives even old favorites new life.Closing the album is the finest rendition ever heard of Drunken Sailor.

Wonderful story and author."},{"rating":"2","title":"These is my WORDS","review":"I didn't think I would like a book on the old west but was I wrong! What a hard life they had back then and life was so short. There were so many dangers that could cut your life short, like Indian attacks, snakes, bad cowboys, limited medical care, and bad weather conditions. The book kept your interest and you grew to love the characters. Bottom line, it was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"I read this book a few years ago but I needed to read it again. I almost forgot how good it was.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give this book 50 stars","review":"I don't read \\"romances\\" as a rule. This book however, is an exception. My first experience with this book was in reading a shortened version of it in a women's magazine a few years ago. I couldn't wait to read the entire book. The author is very gifted in her characterization. The main character of Sarah is so real. The romance of Sarah and the dashing cavalry soldier, Jack, is beautifully written with the added bonus of having the characters not hopping in bed together before they married (this is why I usually don't read romance novels)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It reached out and invited me in.","review":"I loved this book and felt myself becoming Sarah and as I read the pages I could feel her every emotion.

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!","review":"Just finished These Is... last night. I miss Sarah and her family already. It is amazing how these brave these peole were that lived in the \\"territory\\", a hundred years ago. Jack's love for Sarah was so intense. I was so annoyed at him for leaving her to fend for herself so often. At the end of the book, it was easy to identify with Sarah as she said good bye to Jack. Living in Arizona helps put the desert pioneer life in perspective. I stayed up late many nights reading this book. I do not often write a reviews but I wanted to add my positive comments about this book. Buy it or borrow it from the library, but definitely READ IT, you will not be disappointed! Powerful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical and captivating book","review":"It is hard to explain why this book is so special.

Here are some favorite quotes:Pg. 121: \\"There is no outrunning fear, though, it comes on you and you have to face it. Childbirth is not an enemy you can fight or conquer or outrun, it takes you and tears you apart from the inside out and you have to just submit to it. I never understood why a girl would choose to be an old maid, but now I do.\\"Pg. 166: \\"It seems to me that any time there are men making a war, somewhere there are women and children at home waiting and worrying.\\"Pg. 309: \\"It seems there is always a road with bends and forks to choose, and taking one path means you can never take another one. There's no starting over nor undoing the steps I've taken.\\"Pg. 327: \\"Mama told me to make a special point to remember the best times of my life. There are so many hard things to live through, and latching on to the good things will give you strength to endure, she says.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read from any genre.","review":"I got this book for someone interested in frontier tales and reluctantly read it. It is excellent. I felt I knew Sarah Prine and was as concerned for her as I would be for any friend. It made me laugh out loud and cry enough to alarm my husband. Nancy E. Turner is amazing. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in YEARS!","review":"I, too, read the excerpt of this book in Good Housekeeping and could not wait to read it. Sarah was wonderful, as were all the characters, and I cried at the end. I cannot remember ever reading another book that I have so thoroughly enjoyed and hated to see end. Everyone should read \\"These Is My Words\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful story!","review":"It's refreshing to read a story of such purity and strength in characterization. One could visualize the intellectual growth of Sarah as the story progressed. As her life became more complicated she found less time for her diary. Sarah reflects the women of that time period who were very brave, courageous, strong in moral character and defenders of family. Anyone would be proud to be a member of her family. Nancy Turner's style of writing makes the story so much more realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Local Book Club review","review":"I enjoyed reading the book. The depiction of Arizona history was interesting. I plan to order more books by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of all time.","review":"I don't want to say a lot about the plot - this is a book every woman should read. I also found it sad to finish the book. I finished the book 10 minutes before midnight on New Year's Eve and it was the best way to spend the last few minutes of 2000. Through the course of reading the book I felt like I had been transplanted back in time. I felt like I could have been Sarah. This was the best book I have ever read. What an amazing gift Nancy E. Turner has given us."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gals that built this country!","review":"I so admire the faith and pure courage of the great pioneer women who put one foot in front of the other every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I love pioneer history, and I really enjoyed this book. It foretold of the hardship and realities of being a pioneer without being too one sided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tragic a tale to be realistic","review":"I debated between 2 and 4 stars, but after all is said and done I wouldn't recommend the book to my friends, so it came down to 2. As for reading enjoyment and ability to hold my interest, this book gets a 5. However, the first 30 pages contain enough trauma to send any woman to a pyschiatrist for years! Rape, murder, tragic child deaths, Indian attacks, attempted abduction, etc. It was a bit too much for me to handle.Although the description says \\"inspired by the author's grandmother\\", very little of the story is based on fact. When I first started reading it I was floored that so much happened to one woman. After some research I found out that it wasn't the case, the tragedies had nothing to do with her grandmother. And while I had read many true life histories and am aware that some pioneer women had very traumatic lives, this one goes a little over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathtaking","review":"I found this book in a local library and borrowed it after thinking the synopsis sounded interesting. Well. I finished reading it two days later and immediately went out to buy my own copy. =)As I was reading, I kept thinking how it reminded me of Gone with the Wind and the sweeping, epic relationship of Rhett and Scarlett. But then I realised that while it is similar, it's far more enjoyable. Sarah is a heroine you fall in love with immediately. You can relate to her and you find yourself waiting desperately to see what happens next, and you join her in her joys and sorrows, and in her longing for Jack to return from his seemingly endless Army assignments.\\"These is ...\\" is undoubtedly the most amazing book I've had the pleasure of reading in a very long time, and one that I'll go back to time and time again. However, I'm almost sad that I've already discovered this literary masterpiece, as it means the joy and wonder of reading it for the first time is already behind me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've reread it so many times, I just about know it by heart...","review":"Starting in the late 1800s when 17-year-old Sarah Prine and her family join a wagon train heading West, this story takes readers through the joys and tragedies of Sarah's young-adult years. Told in first person through a diary format, readers can see just how much Sarah grows as a person as she faces Indian attacks, dry spells, the death of her first husband, and her unwilling attraction to a young Army officer who just keeps materializing within her life again and again.This is one of those books which you're genuinely sorry to see conclude, for Sarah and her family almost become like your own.If you enjoy this book, I'd also recommend its sequel, \\"Sarah's Quilt,\\" which sets Sarah as a middle-aged widow struggling to run a ranch on her own. While it could certainly stand alone, it's much better if you have some background of what Sarah's life was like beforehand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I recommend if you like historical friction. Couldn't put it down and loved every page. Well worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"This book is really wonderful! My husband and I loved it. It was wonderfully written and we look forward to another book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flavor Full of the early West","review":"Turner's story of her great grandmother makes a modern-day woman grateful for many things, like a stove, pizza delivery when one is exhausted from physical labor all day, a telephone,etc., but you get the picture. This story certainly reminded me of what those early women suffered through in the settling of America. I enjoyed it and was exhausted when it was finished, so I'll be glad to read something more light-hearted and modern. Like French Women Don't get Fat, or something that doesn't remind me of how easy we have life these days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"Held me captive! Read it in one day! Easy to get caught up in this spunky woman's life. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next! Great read that includes historical facts on life in AZ territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic read","review":"This book is great--I have read many historical fiction works, but this was my first about the settlers of the American southwest. I'm so glad I picked it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read this year!","review":"This book was the One Book Arizona selection for this year. I thought the title was odd, but purchased it anyway. I could not put it down. I was immediately drawn into the world of Arizona's early history, and I was so sad when the book was over. I've since purchased it for all my family members, and my friends who love books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woman's issues","review":"These is My Words is filled with wild west high adventure. It is fast paced and reminds me of watching an action movie. Sarah grows from not understanding what is love. How it is demonstrated etc... to a profound understanding of a healthy marriage relationship. Filled with woman's issues: child bearing & rearing, pregnancy, marriage, courage, strength, meekness, life and death. A woman's classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've ever read.","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful book! I absolutely devoured every page. Unlike the book I'm reading now (All Together in One Place), it caught my attention early on and held it. Lately I've enjoyed about a dozen books on frontier/pioneer life and this is the best hands-down! Its one of the best books I've ever read and I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys reading. As with other readers, I found it hard to put down. Can't wait to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this one!","review":"Written in journal form, this is a must-read for anyone who enjoys historical fiction. Ms. Turner puts you in the heart and mind of Sarah, a character who could have been any young pioneer woman of her time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it more.","review":"And, I actually feel guilty that I don't like it more. It is a Diary of a woman facing hard times. It was just hard to get through as a book, and I actually felt relieved that is was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my mother's 75th birthday. I paid extra to have it wrapped with a nice note I wrote.The book came but it was not wrapped nor did it have a note. My mom just opened a box with a book. She didn't everever know who gave it to her. To top it off, I never got reimbursed for the $5 I spent to have the book wrapped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These is my words","review":"I purchase a lot of books from the used books department at Amazon. This book ws the worst quality I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Keeper","review":"Doesn't come close to its marketing hype: \\"...melds the sweeping adventures and dramatic landscapes of Lonesome Dove ...\\" Give me a break! The author doesn't know the first thing about good description to give you a feel of location. I had to keep searching backwards to find where she might have mentioned the name of territory or state or town to give me a clue. The characters are never fleshed out. Nothing and nobody, not even the dogs, come off the page. Through one third of the book, I started skimming and skipping just to get to the last page. I could have fed a lot of quarters into a one-armed bandit and at least had fun losing my money. I've read a lot better pioneer women stories, written by men! Just bad story telling. And exactly that. Dry telling. No showing. Nonfiction history and \\"real diaries\\" are more interesting. I don't think I'll buy anymore Regan Books if this is an example of what they publish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a wonderful read","review":"I have to admit, I'm not a reader of romantic fiction nor am I a fan of the western genre. I stumbled on \\"These is my Words\\" while browsing in my local bookstore the other day and was captured by the blurbs. Wow. I couldn't put it down. The adventures of Sarah Prine are just delightful, full of heart-in-the-mouth adventure, pioneer spirit and--yes, I'll admit it--a warm and charming love story. A wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasurable read","review":"Nancy Turner captured the essence of the early Arizona territory settlers. I was entranced by the exceptional research she did before she actually wrote this story. The story was a palpable woven adventure of a strong self taught woman -Sarah Prine who was challenged so many of life's tragedies yet appeared to become stronger. This book was one of the best I read in some time. I can't wait to read another by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book!!","review":"The immediacy of the first person narrative coupled with the author's use of understatement in Sarah Prine's journal thoughts and writings made this one of the best books of the year for this reader. From the first sentence, I was completely immersed in Sarah's world and felt priviledged to meet all the members of her family and to witness her relationship with Capt. Jack Elliot. There are unforgettable men that we as readers all carry in our hearts, and Capt. Jack Elliot certainly deserves to be included among them! These Is My Words is just one of those wonderful, sink-right-in-to-the-book stories...tailor made for a cozy winter weekend reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book - NOW!!!","review":"I am so envious of people who haven't yet read this book, since they have the most amazing experience in front of them. This is the book that has EVERYTHING you could ever wish for - adventure, excitement, happiness, sorrows, and the most amazing love-story. You know how most love-stories always seem to fade once the couple gets each other - this love-story only gets better. And you will be so happy for the heroine Sarah, because she will become your new best friend. You will laugh with her, and cry with her and your heart will beat just as fast as hers when Jack is around. I've come to love Sarah so much that I find myself thinking quite often these days: What would Sarah think of this and that. This book reminded me of another great book by Miles Franklin, \\"My brilliant career\\". Read both of these books, and I personally guarantee you will have the time of your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a draw-you-in-and-keep-you-spellbound saga!","review":"Okay, I've had to admit that, much as I might like to kid myself, I'm no Sarah Prine. What a brave, wonderful, hard-working woman. This is the kind of book that you read, then pass on to someone who will also appreciate the beautifully drawn characters along with the historical flavor and details of day to day frontier life. A real gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever","review":"This is my all time favorite novel - ever! I have read many, many books and this one tops the charts.My main reason for writing this review is to tell all of you that there is going to be a sequel! It is coming out in May and is called \\"Sarah's Quilt\\". I can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!","review":"I purchased this book in 1998 and am currently on my5th reading. When I first bought it, I could not put it down and I seem to keep picking it back up!! I read 4-6 books a year and I just keep coming back to Sarah Agnes Prine. Such a well written, enjoyable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read recently!","review":"I am 13 and at first I didn't think I'd like this book, because it's long, but it moves quickly, and is really captivating. I read most of this in an afternoon. The diary of Sarah, a woman living in the Arizona Territory in the late 1800s, really draws you in. I highly reccomend this book to teenagers who are good readers and pretty much anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A romantic journey","review":"I first read the short story version of this book in Good HouseKeeping and went right to the nearest bookstore to order my copy. I read the novel in two days and numerous times since then. The caracters make you feel as if you are a part of the family. I wish all families were as commited to each other in these troubled times. The book is a great escape to a easier time in life. Im looking forward to more novels from Ms Turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. If you enjoy Janet Oke or Jane Kirkpatrick you rhen here is another author you should try. I was really surprised at how this story got a hold of me and wouldn't turn lose. It is one of those books you try to put out of your mind while you are cooking dinner, but just can't stop thinking about it. This would be a good book for a book club. I found at the end the author has included a list of questions to discuss. I will loan this book out later. For now I will hold on to it. It is one I will look forward to rereading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable...but break out the Kleenex if you're a softy!","review":"The author does a wonderful job of creating authentic-sounding characters, and the narrative is gripping. However, I wound up feeling somewhat amused/exasperated by all the terrible disasters that strike--pioneer life was incredibly rugged and often exacted a tragic toll, but Turner just piles it on. That's a very small quibble, though...overall, I really enjoyed this book, and recommend it to people who enjoy history and first-person narratives (and aren't overly picky about good grammar)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your are there","review":"This book is well written and gives the feel of \\"your are there\\" which escapes many historical works. A fascinating story of early life on the Arizona frontier with real feelings and real hardships. Soon I suppose we will see then in a \\"reel setting,\\" i.e. movie. Hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"<3!!","review":"To everyone who is hesitating with bying this book: DON'T! You will not regret it one single time! It is truly the most real, wonderful, heartflying and heartbreaking novel you will ever find!I'm almost crying just writing this. This book makes all my emotions go wild every time I read it, even when it's the 19. time!- and at this moment I'm even writing a big school paper about the book.All I can say is: You will smile, you will laugh, you will fall in love, and you will cry!

Sarah and Jack are exceptional characters. I couldn't put the book down, but wanted more when it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fantastic.","review":"Man, so glad I got this book. I pondered buying it for a few weeks as it sat in my cart and then I couldn't ignore the reviews any longer. I bought and am so glad I did. It's a page turner. Thought I wouldn't like the format being diary entries and all but found it just as engaging if not more than any book I've ever enjoyed. This book made me laugh and cry and want to know more every step of the way. It never dragged and was highly fascinating because the writing felt true to what the early pioneers must have gone through. I found myself thinking of those scenarios a lot and having much more respect for anyone that made that trek. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to get lost in a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!!","review":"I didn't think I was going to like this book at first. But, after only a few pages, I became totally engulfed in Sarah's life and her trials. I absolutely couldn't put it down!!! I compare it to \\"Lonesome Dove\\" and if you liked that book, you'll like this one, too. I'd love to see it made into a TV mini-series if, and only if, they can find the right actress to play the lead (Mary Stewart Masterson would be perfect if she were only younger). Read it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"I have to say that I was dubious when this book was first suggested to me, but I quickly fell in love with the protagonist, Sarah! The main character has a believable voice which helped me get into the book. This book is filled with amazing characters who you will find yourself laughing with, rooting for, or against, and definitely crying with. I also appreciated that Nancy E. Turner is true not only to her characters, but also to the times and places her characters are living in. True however does not mean easy to read. Younger readers especially should be aware that some graphic events are described in this book including murder and rape. Don't however let this dissuade you from reading, it is only meant as a caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historical fiction","review":"I found myself rooting for Sarah at every turn, and wondering if I could have even survived through half of what she endured.

Over 350 pages covering literally hundreds of cases of \\"what went wrong\\" with launchers, satellites, missions, instruments, designs, and procedures from the 1940s to the present. It is well written, entertaining, highly educational, and can be read in many short sittings since the average incident description is about one page long. The book not only covers what went wrong, but in many cases also what was done to fix it. \\"Space Systems Failures\\" is a valiant and perhaps unequaled attempt to preserve institutional memory and the lessons learned, often at great price, by the world's space programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"so many types of failures","review":"Harland takes us considerably beyond the simple news reporting of a space system failure. We learn that these have occurred quite frequently in the last 50 years. The book gives an appreciation why. Starting with the fact that the launch rockets are essentially large bombs, that have hopefully controlled explosions. But not always.Then, when the probe or satellite gets into space, much else can go awry. The batteries might fail. The communication chips that talk to ground control might have been misprogrammed. The gyroscope needed to orient the satellite could be defective. And so on. If you are an engineer, the book is a nice education in what has to work in most space systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a wonder...","review":"I've been a fan of the space program since I can remember!

My favorite track has to be the Girl From Impanema, practically a standard in the early to mid 60's. This is nice as background music for a quiet dinner party, or if you're just sitting back and reading from your Kindle that you got from Amazon.

Redman and Method Man cream Mystikal on I Get It Started and Go Head is a boring track for the ladies. If that wasnt enough he puts his wack crew on a track called Paper Stack which sucks. Bottom Line: Its safe to say that its over for Mystikal especially after a mediocre effort like this. This album has its moments but Mystikal lost the fire that made him great.

The raspy-voiced N'awlins rapper adds a raucous jolt of soul to the Neptunes' high-tech backings, and the combination that produced Mystikal's breakthrough hit \\"Shake Ya Ass\\" last year is just as effective this time around. If you want subtlety, go elsewhere: the Dirty South has seldom been dirtier than on Mystikal musings like \\"Pussy Crook\\" and the James Brown-style \\"Go 'Head.\\" And while some in the hip-hop world whine about the folly of patriotism in wartime, it's not surprising that the Desert Storm vet takes a refreshingly different view of American ass-kicking on \\"Bouncin' Back (Bumpin' Me Against The Wall).\\" True, Mystikal's singlemindedness can sometimes be limiting--the best he can do for diversion is a silly rhyme about SUVs--but matched with grooves this strong, it's not much of a handicap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to No Limit","review":"This album pretty much stunk to me the only song that was good was bonucin back.

Even Juvenile showin up and providin a beat on this album cant save it. The beats by the Neptunes & Medicine Men fall short as well. Which is why this album is below average.

Yes, he has become more famous now thanks to the Neptune's produced \\"Shake It Fast\\", but Mystikals music now is all about sex and screaming obnoxiously. Gone is the wit of his old albums.

It's so disjointed I wasn't sure what time period we were in; what time periods and homicides were suppose to be a part of the factual basis to the movie; not sure of the outcomes for all the bad people and good people. Most of the characters seemed like black and white (only bad/only good) cutouts. Boring stereotype of prostitute life, johns and dumb cops. Usually when a movie is based on some factual event there is note in the credits to that effect with actual outcomes yet the lack of such information makes this movie a very dubious rendition. Since this was a so-made-up plot I would have scripted Chlo Moretz into an even more pivotal role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mis-leading","review":"I thought the whole premise of this movie to be mis-leading.

I was hoping that the writing would have been better. I man, this guy started killing in the 70s and well into the mid 90s. However, the movie does not tell you that. And, what's up with the blond girl and the her whacked out family. Weird brother and ever weider guy that wore the dark glasses. Not to mention the black guy and the blond guy.

He teaches how to do little tricks with Visual Basic without really explaining how it works.

I found that it is poorly organized and topics are not well explained. Peter makes the mistake of introducing concepts not yet covered and using complex examples. Get Michael Halverson's Step by Step instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good primer, but exercises unhelpful","review":"Peter Wright's book does a better than decent job of instructing the reader in VB programming. However, the beginning reader will be infuriated to discover that successful completion of the end-of-chapter exercises is often impossible without going on a wild goose chase though online help. Depending as they do on concepts not covered in the chapter from which they supposedly follow, the majority of the exercises do not help the reader feel as if he or she is progressing in the language. In this respect, Peter Wright's book is best used alongside a print copy of the programmer's reference.It will be greatly beneficial to newbies when a book is published that truly does instruct the reader in all aspects of the language. As it stands now, one has to purchase two or more books in order to feel somewhat competent at VB programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction to VB5","review":"Most Introduction books are either too simplistic, leaving the reader unable to create any meaningful programs, or too difficult to understand. This book has several good examples, and flows from topic to topic better than others I have looked at. After this book you will be ready to progress to intermediate level books on objects, or on database programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad end-of-chapter exercises","review":"This is a good book to learn VB from, until you get to the Chapter 7 end-of-chapter exercises.

Not hardcore Sci-fi (a good thing) but a solidly written facinating tale that opens your mind up to the possibilities of what one person with a wealth of experience and knowledge could do in today's technological society.I'd say more, but that would spoil the many terrific surprises and twists that await you in this wonderfully written tome.I cannot wait to read more great novels from this new and refreshing author !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good tech thriller","review":"Even if you are not into hacking and the computer landscape, this book is entertaining.

It's the true story of a person perhaps like yourself with 100+ pounds to lose and a dead end life. Julia goes into great detail about the circumstances of her life while she was overweight, and gives all the \\"insider tips\\" on how she achieved this amazing weight loss. I agree with the previous reviewers that the lack of editing at times makes for tough reading but it's refreshing to see this book published without all the \\"Suzanne Sommers\\" type slickness and empty message. Julia DOES have a great message and story, and it does come across. This book is for all the \\"real people\\" out there who want to know how to transform their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real book by a real person!","review":"I love this book. I can relate with the person who lived it and wrote it. Yes, there are problems with it, she commmented to me in an email when I wrote to bring her attention to the flaws, this is self-published and the wrong unedited disk is what made it to the printer. I think this makes it all the more human. I felt like I was sitting across the table from a friend and talking. She made me feel like she cares. I have emailed her for support and she responds personally. What this book lacks in polish, the author more than makes up for with her personal compassion and concern.

Well. Alright, there are some stellar tracks that manage to combine interesting rhythms with squelchy synthetic basslines, taken as a singular track. Actually, theres 3 of those that succeed, and then there's 1 buildup track that worked rather well for me, and 2 straight house tracks. The rest of the tracks don't really work as songs in themselves (too little change) and most of them wouldn't really work as dancefloor material, with about 3 exceptions. And the impression of dementia is really only skin deep. Perhaps attempting to create a sense of continuity, Garnier threw a bunch of well produced, yet similar effects into most of the songs, which unfortunately lead to a continuous listen that reveals less and less as the cd goes on.

I'm a huge Blink-182 fan, but this is unacceptable. I do like Tom's singing on this one, though.

Now, I also tried to use it to load a .22 Ruger magazine and yes it fits but it doesn't load it correctly. It does not push down the bullet (that's already loaded) completely, therefore you still have to use your finger. I do not recommend this product because it is misleading.

It's nice, but lacking in supporting information. This edition fills a chasmic void left by other editions. It has a tremendous amount of in-depth contextual information, footnotes, and other supporting material.As for Sun Tzu's text, it's very worth studying. It's short and couched in somewhat philosophical languague, which hinders its usefulness on the subject of warfare. However, when comparing the principles it lays out with other texts, such as Maurice's Strategikon (written 600 A.D.), it is very enlightening.By itself, I believe the Art of War's popularity outstrips its actual greatness, but this edition's supplimentary information makes it stand out above academically leaner versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another book you should read asap!","review":"While I do not have this perticular copy of the art of war I have read it and can say its one of the best books ever written on the proper use of military force!

Five contemporary Swedish artists (Ingrid Eriksson, Stig Sjolund, Jonas Kjellgren, Elin Wikstrom and Peter Geschwind) presented \\"happenings\\" or perhaps more accurately, \\"social interaction art\\" in LA. Unfortunately the catalog is pretentious gibberish printed in an annoying font. There is very little information on the artists (you can at most dig up 1-2 paragraphs on each of them from the introduction) and a total of 10 photographs of their work (or part of their work). Liebermann argues that in Sweden there is a culture of art \\"experience\\" which contrasts with the US emphasis on art as consumer objects(\\"the selling of tsotchke\\" in her words). In my opinion, the catalog does not help anyone understand or envisage such experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous music-wretched engineering","review":"Unfortunately, Sony engineers Tim Geelan and Larry Keyes take the old school approach to 78s, and amputate the treble along with the noise in these reissues. Once you've heard what really is stored on old 78s -- e.g. in Steven Lasker's superb digital restorations onThe Best Of The Duke Ellington Centennial Edition-- sound on \\"The Okeh Ellingon\\" is intolerable. One can only hope that these fabulous Ellington tracks get reissued again with different engineers.

Great version of Mood Indigo and Black and Tan fantasy without Bubber Miley.And first version of great Rockin'in Rhythm.This is a essential music for every fans of early jazz.But!!! sound on this double cd is one of the worst I ever heard.Absolutely muted, no clarity, no high tones, no drums.I recorded some songs (Rockin'in Rhythm, The Mooche, Harlem Twist) in Austrian radio station and sound on my cassette is 100% better than on this 2Cd.I hope then this recordings in future will be release in better form than on this Cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious Noise Reduction Job","review":"I'm appalled this CD is still in print using the same horrid transfers Sony made in 1991. The major label philosophy at that time was, \\"Eliminate any and all trace of hiss or crackle from the original 78, no matter if it totally kills the music in the process.\\" Great progress has been made since that time in the development of technology to transfer 78s without destroying the music, but has Sony bothered to create a new remaster? No. They are still pressing new CDs from the original 1991 transfers and they sound HORRID. Save your money, I beg of you, and wait for somebody to do this material correctly. This release is a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's petition SONY for this to be remastered","review":"For 19 years now we have put up with the awful sound of this CD.

Its criminal what they did to these recordings. Terrible noise reduction job that kill these recordings and make them sound like coming from a closed garage.That being said, there are some great moments of Ellingtonia in here, probably not my favorite period, but worthy specially to hear the best versions of the Mooche, and Black Beauty, Jubilee Stomp and Rockin in rythmn.Sorry for the low rate, but the sound is horrible.

Yet another tough book to comment on due to its translated form, Christa Wolf attempts to rewrite a myth from a female perspective and turn the Iliad on its head. The first person stream of consciousness is like a cloud that passes over that period in history, soaking up the facts we know and sprinkling them back down on us in digest form. Cassandra is not so much concerned with its own myth as picking and choosing focal points ripe for re-focusing from a modern feminist perspective (sexuality, the male heroes and their brutality, the reality of war, the mind-control of politics). Although Interesting, and possibly even poetic in its native tongue, Cassandra is more curious as an academic project than a piece of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK WAS VERY WELL WRITTEN.","review":"EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE MYTHOLOGY YOU'LL LIKE THIS BOOK.

So it is quite boring to read it. No matter - that's how women are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prophetic on many levels","review":"Anyone so fixated on this narrative that they don't spend the entire time picking apart the metaphor only proves how engrossing this story really is. How can anyone miss the allusion to communist East Germany in Wolf's use of Troy, which Homer called the walled-city? How can anyone fail to see Wolf herself as the real Cassandra who published this novel BEFORE the fall of the Berlin Wall? How can anyone who reads the opening passage not be unnerved by Cassandra's last prophecy that her captor, Agamemnon, will find his own end when he finally returns home (especially anyone who follows the news of increasing right-wing violence in the reunified Germany)? Yes, there is something of a dispassionate voice in the narrator, but this is the voice of disheartened resignation, knowing she can see all, yet influence nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor design","review":"The log pinchers don't stay hanging on the hooks - they slide open and fall off so I have to keep it leaning against the wall.

I expected the something similar to the temporary tattoos one would buy at a toy store or get in a box of crackerjacks. Instead this product is more like a very complicated sticker. You print to one sheet (making a blurry image), then transfer to a second sheet that you apply to your body with the aid of the typical wet sponge. Rather than the ink transfer you'd expect, you get a clear sheet of plastic glued to your arm. Not only was the result not what I expected, but within 2 hours my suffocating skin began turning blue and red. When I removed the tattoo, merely two hours after application, I was left with a bruise for days and a red mark lasting for weeks.

A good review of the rules of basketball - particularly the ridiculous back-court violations that occur in this game following blocked shots would have been a good start. Additionally, better play calling capabilities would make the game a bit more intelligent. Its fun and the graphics are good - but the being able to lob the ball the length of the court to Ray Allen who will hit a three everytime isn't the best mark of game design.

The gameplay is terrible, the options are terrible, just about everything is. I wasted 30 bucks on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse game i've played on the psp","review":"First off, my biggest complaint about the game is the precision shooting. Why not just press the button once and depending on a few variables (openess, players ability, or distance to the rim) the ball will go in or out. Instead you have to press the shot key twice. Also a turbo key would have been awesome. I don't think it is too much to ask as I recall the NBA Live games on PS1 had a turbo button. Obviously there are a few rules that the developers lost in translation as you can shoot the ball and have a long rebound travel back to the other side of the court and if you shot the ball you will be called for backcourt. The same goes for blocked shots and swipped balls that are touched by the opponent and travel across the half court line and then recovered by your team. I'm not exactly sure why anyone would by any sport game from this company and this game is no different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice graphics poor gameplay","review":"About the only thing this game will do is show you the potential of the PSP. The game itself has nice ideas in terms of setting up plays but falls down in the implementation. Why setup a post play that's 50% effective when you can jack threes all day and hit just about all of them?This game is a rental at best. A very short rental. Also, it does not come with commentary of any kind except when the announcer goes through the starting lineups. This is one of the last games I would pick up for the PSP. I'm waiting for NBA Street. That title has never let me down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real time capsule...","review":"Good guitars and an amphetamine-laced rhythm section back some of the most howlingly bad, unintentionally funny hippie-era rock lyrics ever recorded. A formidable band on the English Mod scene, the Attack lacked only one thing: good songs. The posturing and puffery of their lead singer is so deliciously laughable, as he attempts to project the same sort of profundity as numerous other bands, but without a whit of the subtlety required. It's pretty funny. Good to drop into a '60s mix, or just to chuckle over in the privacy of your own home.

Fill your salt shakers up over the mat to avoid spilling salt everywhere in your kitchen, decant your wine over the mat to catch the drips, etc.The Winco version is made of better rubber than some of the other cheaper mats that I have tried.

It's a sleek black mat that was the nicest thing I could find. It did smell a little out of the package like other reviewers have mentioned, but that's because of the rubber. It goes away fast so do not worry. I would recommend this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The smell is no big deal","review":"It's a rubber mat people! It smells like rubber!

I've run it through the dishwasher twice and soaked in in soap for 48 hours. Smells exactly the same. I threw it on my patio table to see if it will stop smelling by summer. Until then, it's pretty much useless. My buddy got the one from Williams Sonoma (no longer offered in this size) and it has no scent at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelled the whole house up! Do you like tire store smell??","review":"Sadly, while this is a great price, the package, the mat, and even the better part of my kitchen smelled like I had a Goodyear tire in the middle of it. I first assumed this was the result of it simply being new, so I washed it with hot water, and put it on my patio where it would have a chance to 'breathe' and debunk. Two weeks later, no change, and after putting it through three dishwasher cycles, the smell is still just as prevalent, however I now have the added bonus of it having stunk up the dishwasher, which is only now starting to fade away. Buy a better mat, the price is great, but clearly at a cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional Quality","review":"This is a thick, high quality product.

I plan to wash it a few more times with soap and will hope for the best. It is not clear which side to use this mat on... One side will absorb all the water, but fine tall crystal will not be balanced and will likely just get knocked over. The under side wont do anything helpful. Neither can't be used if the smell cannot go away. I will update the review once I have a good solution for the smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible toxic smell","review":"These mats have a terrible, toxic chemical smell out of the package. I tried washing them, rinsing them, etc; didn't help. Sending them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"no seriously, this thing really smells","review":"I normally ignore reviews mentioning that an item smells. The scent tends to go away in a short time after the product is allowed to air out. That is not the case here. I assume oil is continuing to leech out of the rubber and provide the tire store aroma. Some people said putting it the dishwasher helped so I tried that and now I can't get the smell of rubber out of the dishwasher even though I have run it multiple times since. I suspect the oil has bonded to anything plastic inside the dishwasher. I suppose the item does work as you would expect but I think it is made out of cheap uncured rubber. There are others on Amazon which cost twice as much; are these simply from the same factory or are they a higher quality rubber? No idea. Give them a go and let us know eh? :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smell out of it?","review":"Yes, I like the rubber mat. It holds a very heavy food processor in place, But how do I get the offensive rubber smell out of it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smell is hard to get rid of, but mat works wonderfully (and in the dishwasher!)","review":"As several other reviewers noted, this mat comes with a distinctly-rubber smell (after all, it is rubber). I kept it in the garage for two days to air out and then did a brief vinegar and water bath (1/2 cup vinegar in warm water, soaking in the sink for a half hour or so). It was a gift for my bartender boyfriend for his home bar, and he was not bothered by the smell at all at that point. We hosted a cocktail party the next night and it did wonders for catching all the drips and spills and allowed us to have several shakers going over the top of it at the same time. It works better for just one person at a time because of the size, but two can fit if needed. And we had great luck with using it in the dishwasher.In summary, if you are prepared to give your mat some air and a brief bath, the smell will not be a problem. It barely required effort to curb the smell, so I was quite happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"I bought this for mixing drinks on.

Unlike an earlier reviewer, mine has an excellent wristband (maybe in two years they've upgraded them), and it's just long enough for me to use. I have big wrists and either have to buy men's watches, which I don't like to do, or replace the women's regular length band for a women's long. I've given up trying any watches that aren't easy-reader and which don't have indiglo. I just wish Timex would make this watch with an attractive gold tone adjustable bracelet; the expansion bands they have look cheap and are so tight they pinch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps losing time!","review":"I've had this watch for about 15 months now and it keeps losing time. I've replaced the battery twice and it has not helped the problem. It started losing time 6-8 months ago at a rate of a few minutes a month, then a few minutes a week, and in the last few days it has lost several hours overnight. The band was also fairly cheap - I replaced it a few months ago and may have replaced it once before that - I'm not sure. I see the warranty is for 1 year, and I've spent enough time and money dealing with this thing that I'm just going to get a new watch - it sure won't be this model! Also, the battery cover was *very* difficult to replace (too tight) when I changed the battery. I had to take it to a jeweler to get the back cover on. All in all, I've invested way more in batteries, band, and labor than the original watch cost. Good lesson for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Band broke in 2 days","review":"First, the little leather loop to hold the excess strap came off when I put the watch on for the second time. Then, the buckle came off the third time I tried to put it on.

Took three day of waiting till midnight to change it myself finally it got the idea and hasn't given me trouble since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never know what time it is","review":"This watch has been losing time for months (so about 3 months into my owning it). I thought perhaps it was the battery (despite being fairly new and most watch batteries lasting for years), so I replaced it, but that has not helped. I never know if my watch is correct or 2-5 minutes slow. At one point it was losing hours (I assume it stopped). Then I know it stopped because I would notice that it was the same time for hours (but not until I was running very late for something, of course). Lately, it's just losing minutes a week. (I really need a new watch!)I'm very disappointed in this Timex and I've owned them for years and never had an issue like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good purchase","review":"Bought the watch as a gift. I know the price is low and was set for not expecting too much. The Timex watch strap failed after a week. Of course Timex does not warrant the band.

The strap's metal tongue must be too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional & a good value","review":"This watch is a good value for the money. Nothing exciting, but at least the numbers are big enough to see for us middle aged people. I always buy Timex watches, they don't last as long as the used to, I used to have ones that lasted well over 15 years and my watches have to take a lot of abuse. I find that the Indiglo feature is the first thing to go, but I have actually sent watches back for that to be fixed and they did fix it for the $7 fee. I would definitely recommend this as a good everyday watch. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only because of my previous experience with the failure of the Indiglo feature and the fact that they don't last forever, but hey, if they did, the company would go out of business!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch fine. Strap worthless.","review":"I wore this watch for a couple of weeks. I never take my watches off, which has never been a problem with trusty ol' Timex Expeditions. In truth, the band always wears out long before the watch does. In fact, I've never had a watch wear out. And I wear them swimming, hot tubbing, showering, bathing, everything. But this one, the cheesy band broke in two weeks. I just ordered a new band for it for 13 dollars rather than return it and I got a good deal on the watch but it still peeves me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex watch","review":"The watch came on time as promised. It works fine, keeps accurate time.The only thing I don't like is it is an easy read, but the date needs a magnifier glass. There is plenty of space on the face to make the numbers bigger. So, if you need the date at a glance, this watch isn't much help.UpdateThis watch just slowly quit working. First the date stopped working, then the second hand stopped working and finally the hour-minutes hands stopped. I didn't have it very long just over a year. For a Timex, it just didn't keep on ticken. I dropped it from 5 to 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected.","review":"This is my second easy reader. I liked the idea of a date.

Out of the box, the wallet looked nice. Three weeks later, the edges have worn away, exposing the fabric underneath, and the leather is peeling back from the cardboard inside. The leather looks and feels genuine, but it's truly the thinnest leather I have ever seen - as thin as a piece of paper. The inside of the wallet is re-used cardboard, and it looks like it was cut from an Indian cereal box - it still has the lettering and graphics from the box.From other reviews, I thought this was going to be a good product for the price.

I love books set in a faith-based community, and the reason Debbie Macomber is one of my favorite authors is that her style of writing immerses the reader into the setting, making the characters feel like friends and neighbors.

I guess the New York Times list doesn't require authors to know how to write anymore. The story is written at a fifth grade level, and the author is very repetitive. She belabors points up to four times, for no reason I can see. Perhaps she's being paid by the word. Her characters are good, and feel very believable as I read, but the story didn't hold my attention, the character's problems seemed picayune and silly.Before I was halfway through, I grew bored and tired of all the religious preachiness of this book, and threw it in the garbage.

Momma is a really good song he devotes to his mother, lyrically and beat wise, the song is very good.

In fact, the only thing worse than a geek is a geek who THINKS he is cool. Parker is the Charlie Brown of superhero alter egos, and will always be. That is what gives him his appeal, a lovable loser. To put him center stage over the Webslinger absolutely killed this film, special effects be darned. And Harry's character as a supervillian? Trifling at best. Stupid plot, and a waste of my money.

Too many characters, too little time, and it ends up that non of the characters has enough development into them. Viewers can't not relate to their pain or why they they fight.

The computer animation was horrible. Plot was stupid. The whole Emo-spidey was absolutely retarded. The best scene is when Mary Jane gets slapped. It drew applause from me and my friends. I hate this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaking the backbone of the comic","review":"As a child I was raised with Spiderman comics and when one of my favorite director took the reigns and gave us two incredible movies I was estatic. The second spiderman was the heart of the comic, the doing right no matter what you had to give up. I can't tell you how many times I watched Spiderman 2 and still love it.But I wish I could forget Spiderman 3. What made Spiderman NOT Batman was his motivation wasn't revenge it was about not doing the right thing and it had a consequence. In this movie Peter letter the robber go would not have saved his Uncle. That he had to GET the sandman was like a thousand other movies.The villians had nothing on Docter Octopus, none of the tragedy the irony, the coolness that was in the second movie. If I had never loved Spiderman, never remember why he was special I probably love this movie but I wish we could have a do over.Sorry Sam but what where you thinking?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a waste.","review":"Dedicate most of the movie to drama that would make Lifetime proud. Then give Venom (one of the greatest villains ever) very little screen time and have him played by a 90 lb weakling because thats what Sam wanted. Then have Sandman make his appearance as a third rate Mummy sequel. The effects will be looked back on in emberassment, I felt like I was watching somebody play a Spider-man game on Playstation 3. And lets not forget the \\"greasy hair nerd becomes a ladies man when he dances down the street\\" scenes. Who directed this abomination Joel Schumacker? Maybe Spidey should get nipples on his costume like ole Bats did. Heres hoping Spidey 4 gets a new cast (maybe get a pretty female lead to play MJ the Model this time) and a new director who won't make these types of mistakes. I'm so sick of the back and forth Petey and MJ \\"do you love me\\" crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 3rd Spiderman movie","review":"I really enjoyed watching the third installment of the Spiderman series. The plot is great, the animation is outstanding, and the acting is great. Peter Parker's life gets turned around when a black symbiote attaches itself to his suit. The suit enhances his powers, but makes his heart turn dark. Will Spiderman be able to defeat the powers of the black suit?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a very good movie","review":"This is family entertainment!I've loved comic books sinceI was very young.Here Spiderman comes alive for the third time.As with Superman before him, all his secretsare getting out.It isn't an easy world for a superhero...As usually good special effects, butyou can pretty well tellwhere real film ends and blue screen begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psycological Thrill","review":"Schizophrenia is uncommon among the general population, but this movie brings it to the forefront of discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danielle Steele write this???","review":"This movie was absolutely terrible. Every character was a whiny self absorbed crybaby.Venom practically non existent. Eddie Brock completely miscast. Venom looked like a scrawny wimp.Silly \\"bad Petey\\" scenes. Sandman the killer of Uncle Ben - LAME.Messing with Spiderman's origin for no reason.Sandman misunderstood instead of the cruel villian he is in the comics.Goblin II, cheap costume, both Goblin and Spidey kept taking off their masks. LameSymbiote suite, simply the normal suite \\"colored\\" black, yeah, real innovation there.This movie was simply a ploy to sell badly mad toys - WHICH AREN'T SELLING!!!Because this movie totally sucked.Transfomers had the balls and spine that this movie seriously lacked.They need to go back to the drawing board. New writers and actors. Tobey Macguire is obviously sick of doing it and it showed.Total suckfest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"What a great concept to have the dark side of spidey come out. Unfortunately it seemed more of a comedy than an action thriller. Storyline was lame and unfortunately poorly filmed. They threw this one together with not much thought to executing a potentially strong storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"CGI Overkill","review":"I turned this off 10 minutes into the movie because the CGI overkill was making me sick. If they have a movie with a budget this big, and the fan base to support it, then write a decent script rather then trying to out-do Star Wars by using CGI for 99% of the movie and trying to add 1% plot around it.The movie might well have gotten better after the first half hour, but I will never know because I can not stand the useless and terrible looking CGI with actors who don't cast any shadow or light from their surroundings.Sometimes I can see past the bad CGI, but this one is just overkill, and was it really needed to tell anything in the story? The whole alley way surfboard scene just turned me off completely.I'm glad i didnt waste my money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as EVERYONE makes it out to be ....","review":"Now I watched the first two Spider-Man flicks recently. (The day before seeing this one, in fact) And in all truth, I really enjoyed it and believed this was another step that Peter Parker/Spider-Man had to endure. Not as much character development, but we've had so much in the first two that who cares ..... I loved it for what it was, a MOVIE. I do fear for the next part of the Spider-Man Saga, seeing as Tobey and Kirsten are not too sure about coming back. But who knows?

A MUST HAVE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*Spolier Alert* One of the years Best Movies!","review":"My real rating is four in a half stars, but Amazon gives no access to give a number in a half. The movie was great in all, but it felt really long! I certainly did not like it because Harry Osborn dies. The ending was strange too. It was better than the first Spider-man, but the second one is better. In all, I really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"also underwhelmed","review":"Special effects not withstanding, I thought this version of spidey was a bit too long and the ending sucked. Don't waste your money wait for spidey 4. Overall would have to say it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"For the first time, I was tempted to leave the theater during a film...when emo Peter Parker broke into a musical number.The script feels like it was written by a bunch of high school drama club students. So...I'm just going to pretend the third part of this \\"trilogy\\" never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Movie Reivew is Not Tingling at All","review":"Well well well. The only reason I gave this movie a 2 is because I love Spiderman and the fight scenes were passable. I don't want to give away any of the movie here so I can not write why I really hate this movie. In the end I will say this, when Peter has Venom his hair becomes Emo. UMMMM , WHAT!?!?!? Venom = emo hair. I am lost with that math. Well I really love Spiderman so I hope they go back to the basics and make a good 4th movie that you know follows the comics better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderman 3 Super Sound","review":"It seems like the sound for each Spiderman has gotten better and better. This one is great, at least on my system. Not sure what it would sound like on a lesser system. I am greatly pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice nice condtion","review":"I will be watching this one tonite, this is spiderman week just watched the first two, movie came as described and quickly from seller, very pleased with purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first 110 minutes are horrible","review":"I am a huge fan of the first two movies. But the first 110 minutes of this movie were a mix of depressing and flat out boring. Right at 1 hour and 50 minutes, the movie starts to get really good--and the last 20 minutes are wonderful with the same characteristics of the first two movies: action, drama, tension are all present and well represented. Unfortunately, there's none of that in the sophomoric build-up of the characters in the first 84% of the movie.If it hadn't been Spider-man, I would have turned the movie off long before 110 minutes into it.So if you want to see this movie, rent it and stick it out (or fast-forward) to the last 20 minutes.My S.O. and I have 2 copies of the first 2 movies on DVD. But neither of us feel like buying even one copy of the third movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well done..","review":"I rented this the other day and was really looking forward to seeing it.Spiderman 1 was great, and 2 was excellent. 3, however, has too many villians, not enough action, and too much drama. I felt like my wife put on the Lifetime Network for a while. Sandman was hardly in the film, andthe whole scene with Tobey dancing down the streets was EMBARRASING to watch. Don't waste your time on this one. Let's hope 4 is a better one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SpiderMan3 - product not in case","review":"Received the item just fine. No probably with receiving shipment; however, the case was sealed when it arrived but there was no disc/movie in the holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spidey 3","review":"I bought this DVD for my 16 year old brother-in-law.

So I think it was a great movie for him :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"CURSING!","review":"Although the rating does not state that the DVD contains language, IT DOES! Therefore, if you are concerned about the language, then do not purchase this DVD! I am returning mine to the store because it should have stated language so I would have not bought the DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"How could anyone actually give this five stars? This is baffling to me. This could of been a good movie, and I still am unsure as to why they made this into a musical. But this is the reason why Spider-man was remade, and is now even more doodoo than ever. Please stop supporting doodoo movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined COLLECTOR EDITION Coverbox With A DUMB Sticker - Thoughtless!","review":"This was a gift for my brother, he loved the movie but the bad part of this purchase was that it came with a large circular sticker on the very cool 3D effect cardboard coverbox! Have companies become this thoughtless - I ask you, would you like your COLLECTOR'S coverbox to have a LARGE neon ACTION sticker on it that cannot be removed without ruining the COLLECTOR'S EDITION box. Absolutely moronic!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Cigar baby.","review":"When is enough, enough? These comic book movies and their sequels are like recycled garbage at this point. This film bordered on pretentiousness, like a blood sucking viper it drained the life out of me. I'm not down with the whole \\"spidey\\" thing, and all the bouncing off buildings and loud thuds and bangs? It's like does spider man drive a camaro? Wink, wink. It's like, get a life and start on a new action hero like Green Lantern or anybody at this point. When they make movies like Spider Man 3, they keep repeating the same actions and expecting different results at the end. Both me and my roomate literally fell asleep through this, but at different times, me first and then him. I don't need to see the rest of the film, you couln't PAY me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie. Great audio and video quality","review":"You cannot go wrong with Blu Ray technology. The picture and sound quality is great. My son loves SpiderMan and he watches it at least three times a week. The only thing that I don't like is the overall storyline. Compared to the other two, this third installment seems to be fast as far as the storyline goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spideys Gettin' Boring","review":"Spiderman is getting a little stale. Him and snaggle tooths relationship is boring.

It shall be filed away with 1 and 2 never to be watched again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"a lot of people say it wasn't a really good sequel, but i love all the spider-man movies so i would have to say: \\"great buy!\\" for this one too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The least favorite...","review":"the story of this spider mas 3 is really confusing...the movie really fail to bring VENOM to the story, and the sand man is like a crying baby figure....Not a good one...Wait for the next one with the LIZARD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the critics had said","review":"I just purchased this movie on 11/1 and I was completely blown away. I grew up on Spider-Man and have been a fan of the films, although I thought the second one was a little weak. I had read the reviews of the film when it was first released and had elected to wait until it came out on DVD to see it. Now I wish I had seen this epic on the big screen. This movie is a none stop action packed roller coaster ride. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet, but let me just say this is the best of the three films so far. It will be really interesting to see how they follow this one up. Topher Grace is excellent as Venom and the special effects for Sandman were simply amazing. My only critism is Kirsten Dunst, I wish they could have cast someone better looking to play Mary Jane."},{"rating":"1","title":"This could (and should) be the end of Spiderman !!!","review":"Maybe they should have spent a little more of the $300M budget in a decent script. Pathetic sequel with character situations not that different from a bad \\"Three's company\\" episode. The dance sequence should be more than enough to lock Maguire a Razzie next year and personally I've heard more than enough advice from Pete's aunt to last me a lifetime. Even the action sequences, so similar to those in 1 & 2 are just not that exciting anymore. I can't believe the same great director and writers of #1 & 2 made this one. I would strongly suggest they hold #4 for a big while, at least until we are able to get #3 out of our system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movies","review":"Spider-Man 3 was AWESOME!!! Loved the plot and all the thrilling stunts and special effects. This makes for a great movie because the whole family can watch it. Stayed true to the original comic book and I can't wait for another Spider-Man movie just as good as this one. The ending was great too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spidey Sense a Miss","review":"The first two Spidey films rank among comic book films' best efforts. Unfortunately, the third film suffers the same fate as every other \\"third\\" super hero movie (and for that matter almost every trilogy - third film therein - ever made) - poor story, writing, direction and sub-poar performances.The hd quality of this disk is magnificant and is great to watch on a big tv with surround sound.Let's hope they make a fourth (with a new creative team) and we see Spidey actually capture Sandman (like in separate story at the beginning - think James Bond type of films), fight Kraven on his honeymoon in the jungle (think Al Swarengen/Ian McShane as Kraven - how great would that be?) and maybe the Lizard as well.Now that would be a cool fourth film. Time to leave NY and set the adventure elsewhere with new writers, directors, and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"I HEART SPIDERMAN","review":"Okay, so my husband and I saw this movie and thought it was weird because Spiderman weirds-out on us. The second time I saw this movie I thought, \\"That was actually a pretty good movie.\\" I'm a Spiderman girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"This completes my collection of the Spider-Man series. What a great price and quick delivery. Now just need to find time to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you wanna know what pian is...","review":"I'm absolutely baffled by this movie. How could it be so painfully boring? I mean, it's got the same director, the same charqcters as the last two, which are completely enjoyable, unlike this one. I beg, that someone please just erase this from existence and do the proper \\"part 3.\\" Really, it's that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast 2:20","review":"Personally, I liked SpiderMan 3. The characters were more thoroughly developed in this script. I'm not emotionally attached to the series so I can overlook any flaws. Just relax and enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of Raimi's Spiderman movies","review":"Review originally posted in 2007Updates made in 2010Spiderman 3 is my least favorite of Raimi's Spiderman movies. It suffers, not only from the same lame humor that I found to be annoying in Spiderman 2, but also from being over-stuffed with too many new characters (3 villains plus a second love interest)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh","review":"I loved Spider Man 1 and 2. I had to have Spider Man 3, but it was not that great. First spiderman and Green Goblin act like BFF's. Ridiculous same at the end with Sandman there is no keeping to original personalities. The worst part was when Peter parker strutted his stuff on the street after Venom took him over. Otherwise it is pretty enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spider Man 3","review":"Love the first one. Seems like the 3rd is good but similar good guy versus bad guy theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked good but wasn't","review":"The trailers for this movies had me excited to see the 'darker' side of Spider-Man. I was sorely disappointed. What could have been a good film was made mediocre by the choppiness and the fact that they crammed two villains into the script. They should've spent more time fleshing out one or the other but instead did a wretched job at painting the story. It was too long and too boring to work. Too bad they hacked up the franchise with this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"Where's the relationship gone? Everything here was plastic and overwrought.

When Peter Parker/Spiderman gets the Venom outfit,he becomes bad! he tries to do terrible to get his revenge on Flint Marco aka the Sandman. The Black Spiderman suit looks good but It makes him bad. The love triangles are bad too! Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kristin Dunst) break-up because Harry Osbourn (James Franco) interferes with their love relationship! Gwen Stacy also gets in the way of Peter Park and Mary Jane Watson. It was very bad and in poor taste.I would not recommend you buy this movie! This is a movie to rent not to buy! Spiderman 2 (2004) is the best movie in the Spiderman Trilogy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad with a capital S","review":"more plot threads than egyptian cotton . i though the idea was \\"let you entertain me\\" ?

If you're smart, you won't waste your time.","review":"Wow, this movie is terrible. The plot, dialogue, and main characters are rife with horrible cliches. The special effects are over the top and the action is totally unrealistic - yes, I realize this is a comic book-based movie, but come on. Everyone is invincible until the contrived plot calls for the heroes to defeat the evil doers. None of the characters are likable - particularly Peter Parker, who was so unbearable that I constantly was hoping for his quick and painful demise. There's a dance scene or two which are so intolerable it defies words! This movie is rubbish plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't live up to the hype","review":"Spider Man 3 is HORRIBLE! The first two movies were decent, so I was actually wanting to see the third, but it turned out to be a HUGE disappointment. Topher Grace was just awful.

The Sandman(The other villian) is a pretty good villian and has reason for been bad so you can feel sorry for him. The down side: We only got to see Venom FOR ONLY 10 MINUTES. Emo Peter is even geekier then the other one. The crowning down side of this film is Peter's dance scene. It breaks the movie,it changes everything & it sucks out amount of seriousness they were going much like The Spinning the Earth backwards scene from Superman. Overall,Its not great but pretty good and over-the-top silly. Watch it at your own risk. I give this film a 4 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Chapter","review":"How can you not complete your collection with this one?

Really one should only have to glance at the title...Spider Man 3 to know what is in store. I honestly think Tom Hulce who played the part of Wolfgand (read Volfy) in the groundbreaking film Amadeus or even Richard Dreyfuss (thespiatus of Goodbye Girl repute) would have made a better spidey.

Tobey is too wimpy & emo and Kirsten is not pretty or sexy. Everything else about the movie was pretty good, but Tobey & Kirsten really messed it up. I really hope they hire new actors for the next Spiderman movie because I don't want to see Tobey & Kirsten anymore. I think I have a right to say this about this movie and it's not fair that the editors deleted two of my previous reviews of this movie. Not everyone is going to be a big fan of Tobey & Kirsten, so you really should allow all views to be put on Amazon.com. Because otherwise, people won't trust the reviews on Amazon.com.
