I wanted a good stroller, not too bulky that would be a great stroller to use for her as a toddler. This stroller did not meet my expectations. It was not too bad to use when used as a travel system, but when used as a stroller for a toddler it was awful. You have to push with two hands at all times. The cup holder always falls off. The safety harness is confusing (my husband could never remember how to hook it up). And for being such a light weight travel system, it is not even functional at the mall.We are going to get rid of ours before baby #2 comes, b/c I don't want to deal with the stroller again.

So many of my mom friends got huge strollers with their carseat and end up really disliking how big it is and buying another stroller later on. They all comment on how mine's the perfect size. :)Cons:* I never could get the cupholder to snap on. It ought to, it's there... I just can't get it to fit!* The basket, while a pretty good size, is really hard to access when the seat is fully reclined (as it has to be when you put your infant seat on it)* The canopy is pretty small.* Folding it down and unfolding it up really does take two hands.Pros:* Price!

I wish we'd done more research before picking it. The covers for the on lights broke off a long time ago, the heating plate is irreparably charred no matter how much I try to clean it, and it has never produced a very hot cup of coffee. The final straw is that its now exploding grounds out the side of the machine every other day despite all my attempts to clean, adjust, change the thickness of the grounds, etc. I have to keep dismantling the whole filter assembly to try and clean it out then attempt to wedge the cheap plastic parts back together. It seems obvious to me now that an all plastic machine simply isn't going to hold up to long term daily use. The replacement is on the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good idea","review":"My new combo arrived just a week after I ordered it. As I pulled it out of the box, I discovered the glass coffee pot was broken. I called customer service the next morning and they said they would send a replacement pot. (I never received a confirmation about that.) So no coffee right away but I still had the espresso machine. It was no problem to make a nice strong cup of espresso. My only complaint was that the filter basket had a small circumference so I couldn't use the new tamper I bought to go with the machine. The second day I used the machine, the plastic handle broke off in my hand when I connected the filter basket to the machine. So now the coffee side could not be used and the espresso side needed pliers in order to use it.I called the company again and they offered a replacement machine but I would rather get a partial refund.

DON'T BUY THIS","review":"My wife and I had this machine for only two months when the carafe handle broke off. I have read other reviews here with the same problem. By looking at the way the plastic handle is made it is easy to see that this is a design problem. I still have an earlier Krups expresso machine that is much better designed and has had no problems for about 8 years. I bought this one as an update and for the combination of the coffee maker. But this machine is just junk. The milk steamer does not heat up the milk as hot as the earlier model, and the design and construction bad and a step backward. Unfortunately, Krups no longer makes the earlier model that works so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee, disappointing machine","review":"We've been through two of these machines in five years. That may be good for some people but for $100 we thought it would work longer. Even with constant cleaning, after awhile it takes forever to brew a pot and most of the water/coffee is lost in steam.

The handle on my carafe broke off after only 3 weeks, and all I was doing at the time was washing it. The plastic is weak and very thin, unlike my old Krups. Further, the frother has very little adjustment: it's either ON full-bore, blowing huge bubbles in your milk, or it's off. The positives? Well, the coffee is okay, and it's quiet. That's it.

I just purchased my third one in 5 years with each one drastically inferior to the one previous. This last one takes 15 minutes to brew a double espresso. The frothing wand produces NO FROTH - just huge bubbles similar to blowing into a straw. And dealing with Krups Customer Service is poor at best. They only want to repair the machine while your out a coffee maker for 2-4 weeks. Do yourself a favor-spend a little to a lot and get a REAL espresso machine. One that I'm sure will last a lot longer than my total experience with these three (3) Krups machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long","review":"I used to have a separate krups coffee make and espresso maker. I love the espresso maker because I can make more coffee then most. The frother works well, you just have to learn how to do it right. After six years I decided it was time to replace both when I broke the carafes to each machine. So, I decided to get this double machine. The coffee pot just stopped working. I clean it out with vinegar on a regular basis so I know it wasn't calcified water. When I turn it on, the hot plate doesn't heat and the water doesn't get sucked through the hose into the pot. The espresso maker still works, but the coffee is never hot enough. I always have to microwave the coffee after it's made. So, now I'm looking for separate machines less then two years after I bought this. I don't know if I just got a bad machine or if there's something about the way this is designed, but it's never given me hot coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good concept cheaply executed","review":"Here's the skinny -This is the least expensive coffee/espresso maker I could find. I use it daily. It's a steam driven machine, so if you are a serious espresso fiend, you'll be disappointed. It just doesn't crank out enough pressure to give you an authentic espresso. It does an ok job at a fast shot of really strong coffee.The thing that really and truly is disappointing is the glassware. I'm pretty careful about how I take care of my things. But repeated heat + washing makes the plastic handle on the espresso carafe get a little brittle. Then the handle and lid break off of the carafe. Replacements for the carafe are $20 or so. And they don't have any kind of warrantee on the carafe. You can call Krups and ask for one, but their customer service is pretty rude about it. That effort will not be met with success."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Krupps!","review":"The delivery was fast and we use it daily. Works great! The price was very reasonable as well.

Most likely not, and I will have to buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"I previously had a Krups espresso/coffee maker and loved it. It was a much more expensive model, but it lasted over 10 years. This model fell way short. 1) It lasted less than a year. The coffee side just stopped working. 2) The milk steamer didn't work well from day one. I microwaved the milk before steaming, because the steamer didn't heat the milk. 3) The steam arm was flimsy and placed too low on the machine. You have to tilt the cup of milk to get it under the arm. And, when you tilt the cup of milk, it spills. Duh. 4) The steam arm made bubbly milk, but not a smooth frothy hot milk that you want. 5) Even though we cleaned the coffee side regularly, it seemed to always drip slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Purchase","review":"It is unfortunate that a fine old German manufacturer has its products made in China out of inferior materials.It is made with a foul smelling plastic which is permeated throughout the product.

I contacted Krups USA with my complaint and they suggested that I rinse it with vinegar, which I already had done several times, including brewing it through the system. They then offered to evaluate the system for me at their expense. I didn't them to tell me that it stinks. I cannot return it to Amazon because of their no return policy on used items.

It makes a big difference in the flavor. In addition, most espresso machines have an adapter that you can slide into the espresso basket that allows you to use the paper wrapped coffee pods (ESE size.) This one does not. In fact, there's no adapters for anything other than the full four cup measure.

The whole house smelled like burnt plastic and my tounge burned after drinking my coffee for hours. For all I know it may be a carcinogenic, also. I just sent it back.Would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect better performance for price","review":"I did not buy the Krups espresso coffee maker from Amazon, but received it as a gift. By my standards this is an expensive coffee maker. I was so excited to use this, as it was replacing my junky old Mr. Coffee that is probably older than me, and was basically running hot water over grounds.Pros: this Krups coffee maker looks good and brews strong, tasty coffee.Cons: the most disappointing aspect, and the reason for only 3 stars, is that the carafe does not fit well with the drip spout. Coffee gets backed up. Grinds find their way into the carafe. Sometimes it leaks.For the price I expect better design mechanics."},{"rating":"2","title":"krups is kewl","review":"i had an older one of these several years ago that i recently retired because of internal leaking. the new coffee maker is fine. the main difference is that the pot is better than the old one. the old one couldnt pour from the spout without dribbling everywhere. i havent tried the espresso yet, but that was fine in the old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad we bought the Krups XP1500","review":"I tried buying this item on line from a major dept store 3 days before Christmas.

I had the item the day after Christmas and we have used it daily ever since. We are very happy with the purchase and are very glad to have it in our home. We are also very glad that we bought it through Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out good, but did not last long","review":"I'm new to making espresso and lattes, so lots of trial and error was required. Out of the box, the machine performed well and true to other feedback, the frother worked extremely well. The steam control knob was required to throttle steam flow to achieve micro-froth. After using every day for 2 months, it now takes 20 minutes to make a latte and there is barely enough steam to froth. If you're serious about making espresso, pay a little more and get a more robust unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"REAL PIECE OF KRUP!","review":"We replaced a Krup coffee/espresso combo which we purchased about 12 years ago. What a wonderful machine! Unfortunately, this model was no longer available. The model #985 was the recommended replacement. However, it doesn't even come close.1) The basket for the coffee filter is too small in diameter for the filter, causeing grounds to fall into the brew. The basket also leaks, giving you a countertop lake to start your morning.2) The espresso is okay provided you don't want a cappuccino. The froth attachment is so low and it is difficult to get the milk pitcher under the spigot. The milk froths very quickly, and your container is overflowing with foam while the milk is still cold. It's okay only if you froth enough milk for 1, maybe 2 shots, but if you need milk for the full pot (4 shots), you'll need to froth milk one-half at a time.The pot is will soon be available for sale at our local Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy froth!","review":"My previous espresso machines were Krups and Starbucks Barista. Having good experience with my previous Krups, I thought this machine would be as good. NOT. No crema. Steam wand is weird, doesn't froth well. The machine feels cheap. I'm going to take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Krup?!?!?!","review":"After only using it for 2 months, something went wrong with the steam wand. It will not pass any steam.

I am extremely disappointed that this broke is such a short period of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like they use to be","review":"My mom has has Krups products for year and has been very happy. This latest purchase was very disapointing. Case is more plastic and cheaply made. Frothing tip is on the left side which makes it harder to froth. And the coffee basket would not open without using a knife. (defective) She returned it for credit and went back to her old combo coffee/expesee maker. I think Krups should be advised of this review also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter Coffe is Good Espresso is not so","review":"I have previously owned a separate Krups Espresso machine and it made great espresso. This one doesn't. The problem is the amount of coffee you have to put in to make an espresso they say 2-4 cups but if you make two you cant compact the coffee unless your making for four so no crema ever :(. Filter coffee is fine and has a nice cut off feature when you take away the pot whilst coffee is being made. The build is not great and don't get the feeling its going to last that long..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good coffee maker","review":"This is my second espresso machine. Unlike my first one, I didn't do any research before buying and have regretted it. The frother doesn't stick out all that well and makes it difficult to get a cup to froth the milk. It also stopped working after about third or fourth month. You have to use the glass contain for espresso because it is difficult to put a coffee mug under the spout. Finally, you have to buy coffee filters and is a pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine coffee and espresso maker","review":"We replaced a Krups espresso machine and seperate coffee maker with this machine. Both had served us well, and so far, this one has as well. It is a rather large unit, deep, and sticks out quite far on the counter. That is my only, minor, complaint. Coffee and espresso both are great with the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I purchased the Krupps combo Espresso/Coffee maker for Husband as a gift.It made the worst coffee I have had in a long time.

To bad it is a nice looking coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"The steamer / frother is useless and is way too low to work well at all. Very hard to follow the Krups directions - the manual is just poor and i was still trying to figure out if maybe I was doing something wrong, but after reading more reviews - it is not just me. After giving up on the cappuccino - the coffee part actually makes coffee that tastes like plastic. Before I had a $30 coffee maker that made much better coffee. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Coffee machine","review":"This product makes very good coffee and excellent Cappuccino in part to reading the manual and following instructions (-:Our only disappointment is that we must trim the paper #4 filter as it is about one quarter inch to tall and was catching along the top.This allowed the grounds to drain into the carafe. We now have it down and enjoy the unit very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I bought this product about 3 weeks ago. The coffee is delicious! Its really easy to operate too. However, the steam wand's function entirely stopped after 3 weeks. I called Krups to troubleshoot it, and she told me I would have to return the product, and that there was no hope that it would fix itself. Basically, this machine is a gimmick. The coffee maker is durable, but the espresso part is for the infrequent user. Do not buy this if you intend to make yourself a latte every once in a while.Overall, I am disappointed in this product. I really liked it; then it broke after light usage. I only had it for 3 weeks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice!","review":"I love both coffee and espresso but have limited counter space and this looked like the perfect machine. It's been a perfect nightmare. The machine arrived and worked fine, except water poured from it all over the counter. Krups agreed to repair or replace the defective machine. It took two months! The machine was repaired, rather than replaced. I set it up to make espresso and nothing happened: the water never got hot. I tried a second time and it worked fine. The coffeemaker side is great, but for espresso? The good price is not worth the hassle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad :(","review":"Got this for our wedding.

Unfortunately, I happened upon the movie when it was already half over. But I have to tell you that the half I saw really affected me.The subtle and graceful acting, the African landscape, the beautiful language, the truly wonderful soundtrack, and the dignified, but sad story - a woman's struggle to care for her daughter and home (and later, her dying husband) and survive her own battle with AIDS long enough to see that her daughter starts school and finds a loving home - made this little gem well worth my time. It's easy to see why YESTERDAY was nominated for an Academy Award. I definitely want to watch it again.What a lovely, haunting film YESTERDAY is.

The depiction of Yesterday's grief and acceptance, in addition to her husband's denial, rings true and brings tears to your eyes. One interesting point is the fact that HIV is not even mentioned until half way through the movie, even then it is called 'the virus.' This could mimic the attitude of silence by Africans on the issue. Other fine points about this film include the fact that is truly one story. Yesterday is not then compared to thousands of other dying women, although we know that this is the case. We see the world through her eyes and in her small village. This is a movie about the power of the human heart. Great movie.

Otherwise, very nice watch.Update: After 2 years, I'm forced to get a second one of these. My nephew has taken mine, claiming it is perfect for his needs.

Yes, folding a lot of hands at the beginning is boring. The reason all the top players and good books advise you do so is because it's correct, if your goal is winning money. This is especially important for relatively new players to understand.This book is not just useless to help you improve - it is misleading and likely even harmful for most players. Stick with the concensus best books on the topic: \\"Hold'em Poker\\" by David Sklansky, \\"Winning Low-Limit Hold'em\\" by Lee Jones, and the new \\"Small Stakes Hold'em Poker\\" by Miller, Sklansky, and Malmuth.Or just buy this book, play your garbage hands with confidence, and watch your bankroll shrink."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a manna from Heaven","review":"My very first hand of real money Texas Holdem I was dealt an unsuited 8 3.

But now that I know that the 20-4-50 system is out there, I can play more profitably than ever! Using provincial syntax and skipping all that extraneous math in other poker books, Bob Turgeon not only de-mystifies, but codifies the ultimate piscine playing style.

It is the most poorly organized travel book I have used. Even good information, if poorly organized, becomes useless. I found myself frequently having to piece together information from 3 or 4 different sections to decipher anything useful.Transportation information: useless.Accommodation listing: mixed. Of two hotels marked with their highest recommendation, one was very good, the other the worst we stayed in. After that we stopped using the book's suggestions, and just asked other travelers.Historical information: good, concise, interesting.Site and activity information: incomplete or incorrect.We were traveling independently by public transportation for 9 days throughout northern and western Turkey.

My Rough Guide ended up in the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not under any circumstances buy this book","review":"This is an awful book. It does not have any transportation information.

When there are two or more bus stations it does not have anything about which station to go to. It also is devoid of any hints or feelings one way or another. There is no \\"Take the train for the nice view\\" or \\"Take the bus because the train is awfully slow\\" It is simply not there.For a \\"rough guide\\" to Turkey I found this book completely lacking.

While it is true that \\"all music was new once\\" it is also true that not all new music is good. Once it has been given a fair hearing, a listener can justly conclude that it might not be worth playing or downloading. For a singer, the burden of selection is greater. Not only must the performer decide if the music is good but also if the music is suitable for his or her voice.Ned Rorem is an eminently forgettable composer with no apparent understanding of the human voice. Brian Asawa makes the best of this poor material but the results are mostly dismal, sometimes dipping to painful. The only reason to get this recording is that there is some traditional folk songs added as filler.

Many have argued that Tosh represented the grittier, rougher side of the music, in contrast to Marley's more accessible sound, and this is not far from he truth. But Tosh had plenty of catchy melodies to offer as well.As live documents go, you don't get any better than this: the sound makes you feel like you are really there in the club... you can almost smell ganja smoke coming out of your speakers! And the songs, a little slowed down from the studio versions, lose none of their vibrancy. In fact, some of them benefit from the slower, longer delivery.As an overall aural picture of the reggae sound, this is a fantastic example for neophytes and devotees alike. It is also a phenomenal live recording of a rebel in his prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recognize this classic... audience with a prophet","review":"First, the band.

The are technically magnificent and the simmering fury that they play with comes right through the speakers.Next, the vocals. Do not believe they are inferior. Tosh is singing with emotion, conviction of his beliefs, and power. He is singing for an audience, not the studio, so the vocals won't be \\"perfect\\". Forget it.

But when he casually starts writing some words down on a page, and secretly borrows one of his writer father's poetry guides the exile starts to become more bearable. He slowly recovers, all the time writing about the death of his mother, past and present loves and his discovery of a whole new way of expressing himself.If I had to describe this book in three words it would be 'short and sweet'. It's fun and cheerful (although I have to admit I didn't \\"get\\" the title until I was finished reading it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare Bats Cleanup","review":"Shakespeare Bats Cleanup is a funny, breezy, cute book. I don't think it relies as much on the themes of baseball, or even poetry, as it does on the theme of young love.

The author has some very good points about \\"junk news\\" (which I agree with) but the fact is we have a market-driven economy.

Its aim seems only to scare you in a conspiratorial tone: you are being watched! your every move is being analyzed!Too bad it accepts the claims of the companies trying to market these surveillance and date mining systems at face value.

The MAINstage helpfully arrives with every type of cable necessary for hooking up your TV and video accessories.

Still, for the money and the simplicity, it was a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud...But That's About It","review":"I owned a Soundmatters unit for about a year before giving up on it. Although it pumped out lots of volume, the dialogue it produced was so muffled that I often couldn't make it out. After a year, the unit began to malfunction, often refusing to turn on. I took that as a cue to switch back to my television's speakers, which actually produce clearer, if quieter and less bass-heavy sound. If you like lots of volume with decent bass, this might satisfy. But if clarity of dialogue matters, skip the Soundmatters."},{"rating":"2","title":"MainstageHD - Better than Bose.","review":"I have had the Mainstage HD since January now, and I love it. I purchased it as a package, with the Substage subwoofer for only 599. I loved it so much that I purchased a second HD that hides behind my couch for a discreet 5.1/6.1 real surround experience. When I purchased the FullstageHD (Mainstage + sub) I was really impressed. I put in Star Wars, action flicks, and even older films, to see how well it could hold up. It did. I must admit the high end isn't always the best, but it certainly isn't awful. I wouldn't have bought another one if it was! Now, with the second Mainstage the sound is INCREDIBLE. My friends and family could not believe the oomf this system had. The subwoofer is responsive as well and ads to the experience. This is the best space saver. And if you have the $$$ to blow, buy a second mainstagehd as a rear channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound in small package","review":"The Soundmatters Mainstage really packs a lot of sound punch in a small package. The Mainstage gave me more than I expected and really came to life with the addition of a sub woofer.

The misunderstood, seemingly quirky nature of the heroine who dies strangely. The hero's attempts to become involved in the storyline. The brother who does not fit. It has been a very long time since I have read such an amazing story with twists and turns that leave you shocked by their simplicity.

After Kristina dies, though, it drags big time. I saw the Big Shocking Twist coming about 100 pages ahead of time, and a lot of the characters and events just seemed really fake.

The band who covers \\"Subdivisions\\" is the main offender. The music is sloppy and without organization, and the vocals bring to mind a man wrestling with a severe bout of constipation.

But somehow it's funny to listen how Rush's fine songs are pulled through the mincer, isn't it? It comes closer to the idea of a tribute album than \\"Working Man\\" did. Rush's other tribute album was just trying to duplicate their songs, while \\"Red Star\\" brings some new interpretations. However, if you liked grindcore/death metal, this album could appeal to you.

Still, there are a few flashes of humour. If Falco would ditch the extended family, Davis would tighten up the writing and not be quite so coy, this series could be salvaged. Davis should take a few lessons from John Maddox Roberts and Decius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable","review":"Lovely job. This one was just plain fun once it got started. It reads well. I don't think Ms. Davis' strength has ever been the puzzle. No one would mistake her for Agatha Christie. On the other hand, she's a lot more enjoyable to read. Yes, one could wish the mystery were tidied up better, but then the whole thing might not be so nicely spiced. As it is, I enjoyed myself hugely. (Note the wonderful \\"Briton\\" playright who gets by without royalties by being popular with the general public and hence sharing in the ticket sales. Several rather delicious references to a Vespasian-era Shakespeare. We were amused.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flush the Bathhouse","review":"It is hard to imagine a mystery bad enough to not get five stars from #1. The only redeeming feature of A Body in the Bathhouse, for me, was its description of the construction of the Roman Palace at Fishbourne. Because my ignorance of the site is near total, the details that bored other readers were more interesting to me than the characters or the plot.Too many sub-plots, too many pat soluctions, too much cutesy family stuff, too much Benny Hill potty humor, too much wrong word-usage (ex-patriot for expatriate), and too much British slang from the lips of Romans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivery and Packaging","review":"I finally received my order after many weeks more than usual yesterday and am completely disappointed. The book arrived in a very sorry state and I am extremely shocked and angry. This book is a very expensive book and I had been waiting and looking forward to receiving it. However, it arrived simply inside a soft bubble-wrap postal pack with no protective covering around the book. This is a heavy hard cover book. It should have been boxed at the very least! The paper cover of the book is totally ruined and the book itself has been completely ripped from its hardcover and the corners of the book are all bent. I had intended to keep this book as a display coffee table book but it is no state for that use. The distributor has offered me a 20% refund - on a book of this cost and the condition it is in, this is ridiculous.

Just like George Lucas, Harbinson wrote Eposide 3 first, in 1980, and then the others. If you want to read just one book, read this one, GENESIS.

It was simmilar to many contemporary fantasy books, so if you liked Eragon or something simmilkar, I guess you would probaly like it at least a little bit. One thing I did not like was that the charecters and settings seemed flat and unrealistic, and I didn't realy care about them.

This book is slanted to modelers (cars, planes, and fiqures) and as such I would not recomend this book if you are not intending to use your airbrush for that purpose. But the book does take you thru a step by step procedures for which airbrush is right for which project, and list some other equipment to use. It even gives a quick description for how to build a cheap spraybooth. The author of the book is mostly known for his work in model cars so many of the techniques that the are slanted toward that purpose but he does delve into someother types of models.

I'm tired of false paper jam messages, having to remove the back cover just to make the message go away. no printing because the machine thinks the cover is open, figuring out that if I wedge a piece of paper inside, the open cover message won't come on. I'm tired of having to remove the paper tray because constant reinsertion finally causes the ink cover to open which eventually has to be taped closed because the machine won't print with it open. I'm tired of it printing in green only even though all the colors are inside. It had one great feature though. I could buy ink for it on ebay for a couple dollars. It delivered me one last fatal error message that said not in so many words that it needed to be opened up and fixed so I said goodbye, it boarded the next dumpster and we parted ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many little issues","review":"At first, i really enjoyed the printer. The print quality was great for the price, even the photo prints came out very nice. But after a few months, the small problems became apparent. It frequently says that an ink cartridge is low or empty, even after I replaced them all, and didn't use the printer for a awhile. That is bad enough by itself, but it makes it worse because if one cartridge is empty you can't do anything else. If Cyan is empty, you cant print , even if you are only printing something in black/white. I changed the settings on my computer and pressed the button for black/white on the printer, but it just keeps beeping and showing that Cyan is empty. This is very annoying because i don't print that often, so whenever I do need to, it says something is empty, and I am stuck. This has happened the last 4 times I tried to print something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works poorly with its own cartridges; configuration issues","review":"Frequently thinks cartridges are out of ink or missing when they're not.

It works well enough for color printing and scanning.Unfortunately, it consumes ink standing still -- even powered down. You have to unplug it to prevent it from going through automatic cleaning cycles. Ink prices for this unit have nearly tripled since the initial purchase. Finally, it won't print black when a color cartridge is empty, and it won't scan or fax when any of the cartridges are empty.This is an inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor answering machine, so-so Linux, but a decent printer.","review":"Overall the printer is good, but the answering machine crashes twice a week.. I have to restart the whole printer and sometimes I lose a few messages.

I can't get scanning/emailing documents to work in Ubuntu (I'm doing everything over the wireless network so maybe that's why). This is my first all-in-one printer so maybe I expected too much.Update: My printer ran out of magenta ink and now refuses to print at all (including grayscale). I'm disappointed because I only printed a couple of pages in color. I found out that every so often the printer uses up ink in a routine internal testing (to see if it still has ink)?

I regret this wholeheartedly. The ink only lasts 1-2 prints and if you don't use it after a while it seems like it just dries up on its own. Even if the other colors are full, if one of the colors ran out then it refuses print anything no matter which color you choose. The panel in the back of the printer is difficult to remove if you have a paper jam. Overall the perks of having a color printer is such a pain I would rather just buy some colored pencils and do it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Disposable","review":"Magenta print head is clogged and is uneconomical to repair(cost $85 from Brother). The service center wants $100 just to look at it. They don't even sell service manuals, and even if I were to replace the part myself I'm better off with new printer.Brother Ink is obnoxiously expensive and you have to replace it at least twice a year, or risk clogging the print heads(they suggest 6 month intervals). Generic ink is a risk, if the print heads clog because of it you have a doorstop with no warranty. A lot if ink is wasted during cleaning and b&w; printing uses the colors.Ink cost as much the cartridges that contain print heads. I will never buy a printer with an ink tank system again. The three color cartridges with a tiny quantity of ink cost almost $40, this is more than an HP or lexmark cartridge with a printhead.Two stars because I can use it as as a greyscale printer(until that clogs) and fax/scanner."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing but problems..","review":"this printer is JUNK! don't waste your money.. we had nothing but problems with it.. !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Print cartridges are only good for 6 months used or not","review":"I just installed one of these for a friend and in the instructions Brother tells you that you must use the cartridge before the expiration date on the cartridge package or six months after you place it into the machine.This means that if the machine has been on the store's shelf for a while your will have to replace the cartridge before it is empty.This also means that you should not purchase additional cartridges so that you can quickly replace the cartridge when it is empty because your backup cartridge also has at least the same expiration date.I would not buy this for anyone that might run into this cartridge expiration issue during a crisis such as getting out a term paper for college or a business offer or presentation at the last minute.

Everything else about this item is great including the price. Another feature I have come to despise is the door in the back that is removable, so whenever there is a paper jam it is very easy to remove the paper.

Heavy parts with screams mixed beautifully with lighter parts, including large amounts of piano. My personal favorite track is \\"Countryside Bohemians.\\" The only problems with this album are that it is only 39 minutes long and too hard to find for a reasonable price. If you can't get a hold of this, then pick up \\"In Harmonia Universali,\\" as their style has moved back in this direction.

Nigerian Tony Allen's drums set the pace, and the other guys are more than doing their share. And Doctor L's production brings it all together. The spoken words ain't nothin' startling, but they invariably have a calming lilt and an underlying \\"lets be cool\\" tone. In one song Allen speaks about \\"keeping it simple\\" . . . . .and while the whole cd has a deceptively simple feel, well, I reckon there is a lot of good stuff happenin' here.

With the emphasis within modern business on \\"diversity\\", there are few good definitions about what that means.

The work on the Myers-Briggs type indicator is by far the best approach to understanding how your team and workplace functions.A leader will be able to better understand the reasons for team's success and failures through the lens of their preferred personality type.

I am the regional for several stores, and the biggest complaints from employees are of people not getting along. In assessing the complaints with the help of this book, I realized it was due to miscommunication, and perceiving a person of a differnt \\"Type\\" wrong. This book explaines each type and some common tendencies of each. It also has strategies and solutions for developing the opposite style you have to be able to communicate with all types of people. For example, if you tend to be an \\"F\\" or Feeler (using emotions to make decisions), there are pages of strategies to help develope the opposite side (the \\"T\\", or Thinker) without compromising your own personality. I have used this book in mediation and arguments with fabulous results, just by having the employees read the other person's type and knowing where they are coming from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanging problems","review":"I've ordered several inexpensive necklaces of a similar type to this one, all of which I've been happy with. This necklace was the exception to the rule, and is the only one I've never worn. This pendant looks nice enough, but there's a problematic design flaw. The cord or chain you use to hang the pendant around your neck goes through a metal loop which is behind the hilt of the sword (you can see this loop in one of the available images of the item). Unfortunately, this loop is over-sized and sticks out. Because it sticks out so far on the backside that should be laying against your chest, the sword is made to rest awkwardly and has to tip to one side or the other. There are a lot of other great necklaces for around this price, so I suggest you purchase one of the others which don't have this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!!!!!","review":"Excellent film with insight.

Along wih the criminals in the coal buisness. Including the senetors that endorse this. This movie is harsh and needs to be to bring this issue to the public. this is a prime example of the Govt. turning its back on the people of this country.

I have followed Annie Lennox's career since the early eighties, and having read plenty of interviews all through these years, I expected to read a book that might shed new light on this wonderful performer. Instead I found a comprehensive body of work regarding the description of every single song and video performed by her. That is great for die-hard fans thirsty for details, but fails to grasp the reader's attention for long and should by no means be the final goal of any biography! Besides the authors failed to bear in mind that most A.L.'s fans are over their 30's and that the biography was Annie Lennox's and not Shakira's, for the use of storytelling-like idiomatic expressions (e.g. \\"...at the tender age of six...\\") and the lack of depth in the subject matter of the book is more suitable for a teenage pop idol biography!

Additionally, she's included three methods for making most of these breads: by mixer, by food processor and by bread machine. Take your pick. She's included some fried treats as well as more traditional breads from all over the world. I've especially enjoyed comparing her recipes with those I've been baking for years.

If you're looking for a book on seduction do not use this method, it's sleezy and there are other methods that respect women more (surprisingly) It involves violating her personal space, and confronting her fears.

That's a mistake.Young women with career goals might find it useful to learn some of the male territorial and hierarchic signals described here. For example there's a hilarious passage about men challenging each other's territory on a restaurant table using only the instruments at hand. Next time I lunch with a man I'll notice how he lines up his fork, and try not to laugh.Women (networks, team players, verbal) and men (hierarchies, power lunchers, spacial) operate differently and use different body language to communicate different signals. Most of the time only the male signals are visible to this author, so the book's value is limited.The publisher does a disservice by not making this clear on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is outdated and lacking in significant content.","review":"I feel this book is outdated.

Underneath the surface of the fiction about epilepsy you can just see the more complicated story of an eating disorder; writing about *that* would have been far more absorbing, would have enabled Slater to delve into the real psychological preoccupations & complex family relationships that underlie that particular illness--the symptoms would have been more in sych, anorexia in particular is a much better metaphor than epilepsy for the emotions displayed here--and her questions about how possible it is to tell an honest story about oneself would have had more power.

Think they rushed this into production. I couldn't get the rocking of the fence adjusted out..Dewalt says its normal. If you are cutting precise miters, ya sure don't want the fence rocking around while going thru the saw. Also the presets won't stay preset. They will vary as much as 1-2 degrees each time you move the slide. I have the Dewalt 746 table saw and wanted to stay with Dewalt equipment if I could, but after a couple days of messin with this miter gauge I took it back and ordered an Osborne EB-3(seperate review)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Doesn't Work","review":"It looks impressive, but it simply is not possible to cut 90 degrees accurately. Actually, I found a way: use a framing square to square the fence to the blade; clamp the fence to the sliding table (if you spent the $400 for that option), then cut. Clearly, DeWalt rushed this product to market even though it was faulty. DeWalt can no longer be trusted I guess. They should have a recall on this. If I could give it a minus rating I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"SubPar Design","review":"The problem I have found with this is that none of the fasteners are loctited so I had to pull it apart and lock them all.and the stops built into the slide are not even close to the callouts on the slides e.g. I thought I was cutting at 90deg and I was actually cutting at 85deg. My fault for not checking the setup ahead of time, but thats why I bought this so I can just set it and cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"The specs say this will fit 3/4-inch - 3/8-inch slots.

The author pisses and moans a lot, which is a given considering the title, but she seems to really be annoyed with \\"housewives\\" and \\"stay at home moms\\", as they are mentioned as a group even more than the \\"old folks\\" that she also cannot stand for various grody reasons.The funniest comment was in the acknowledgements, where she thanks her editor/friend for \\"helping me see the light at the end of the tunnel,\\" which to me makes it sound like she spent more than a full month on this spare little pamphlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential but disappointing \\"read\\"","review":"This book is more of a long brochure than it is a book that you sit down and read. The concept is brillant and I will admit that I had really high expectations for it, so maybe I was destined to be disappointed from the start...This book hardly takes any time to get through and I did laugh out loud a few different times when I was able to picture people from my gym acting like the ones mentioned in the text. My reactions and thoughts are very similar to the author's in a few instances when it comes to working out, but I did get annoyed with her constant whining and repeated observations throughout the text. This book is a slightly amusing, mindless read...IF you go to a gym. I can't imagine reading it if you don't and certainly wouldn't recommend that you pay full price for it no matter what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open, honest, real. What we all feel, but don't say aloud.","review":"It's difficult to read a book by someone you know personally and remain objective. I made it a point to remain so during my read. Sam Fulwood represents a growing segment of the American populace. His book speaks for many of us who belong to the segment, but who cannot express as eloquently what we feel as he did in his memoir. There were areas where I felt he could have been MORE vocal, more expressive, but overall, there are things that all Black Americans can learn from his experiences interacting with White America. The chapter on South Africa is by far the best to me. I wanted to catch the first plane to Johanesburg. For those who don't know Sam, it's a slow read, but it builds nicely to it's conclusion. For those of us who know Sam, it's worth a second read. Savor it the second time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for Lindsey Davis !","review":"\\"Three Hands in the Fountain\\" is another excellent book from Lindsey Davis. The spate of body parts appearing in Rome's water systems is of course a job for Falco, and we are taken on a fascinating journey through the sewers and aqueducts of Rome, as well as to the countrysdie in the quest for the killers. As usual, Davis is entertaining and informative, and this book is recommended to historians as well as mystery lovers. Steven Saylor is another excellent author who deals with Rome in an earlier period, although his books have less of a popular mystery appeal.The subtle shift in Anacrites' role through this series is worth noting - and those who haven't yet read \\"Two for the Lions\\" have a further treat in store !"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sucks","review":"Since I have had this unit it works only when it wants to.

The screen has a solid feel and classy look in the cream color. Mounting took about 10 minutes and includes wall and ceiling. We are using the ceiling hooks and due to the solidness of it, is very stable. I was impressed with the brightness of the screen with the projected image at 1080i and at 720p as well as the viewing angle was quite good. As with all screens I have used it can be a bit tricky to get it retract when only partially deployed.

If, on the other hand, it's based on the belief that they ARE the original versions, I have to burst his bubble by pointing out they are re-makes.Like Bill Haley & His Comets, there seems to be a glut on the market of re-done Little Richard stuff which, if that's OK with a buyer, no problem. After all, there are no original versions around of Mozart playing his best pieces [or even re-makes, come to think of it]. But when an outfit tries to pass off a compilation as his best, without informing you they are not the original versions - that's a no-no.There ARE better Little Richard CDs available and these are suitably reviewed as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that's just plain old fun!","review":"Little Richard has always been one of my favourites.

Keep Knockin is one of my all time favourites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragging, boring, annoying...","review":"I guess as a debut novel this isn't bad but it's by no means a good book. The main character has no hooks to endear herself to the reader. There's no real story to her, she's just barely above one dimensional. The rest of the cast is trotted out on a one by one \\"Wait, is THIS the killer?!\\" basis. The story starts nowhere and really goes nowhere. There's a killing, there's another, there's two in the past. Gasp! Are they all related?! With the exception of a couple short stories and her second novel (waiting on the nightstand as I type) I've read and enjoyed everything Ms Harris has written except this. If you're a completest, go for it, you might as well read everything. Otherwise, give this one a pass, it's not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"Up until now the only books by Charlaine Harris I have read were the \\"Dead in Dixie\\" series, and it was interesting to read this early mystery work by her.

Others have given you the basic plot, so I'll just add my recommendation that you get hold of this little gem now that it has been re-released!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"I read 7 chapters and then just couldn't take it any more.

I have to second that. The characters were flat and I just didn't care what happened to any of these people. This was apparently an early book of this author's, written some 20 years ago or so. I just have to say I really enjoyed the Sookie Stackhouse books but this one, was a big NOT. Also, like another reviewer commented, I didn't like the reference to black people as \\"darkies\\". Just a turn-off for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I always finish a book I start so this one was no different but I was happy when I was on the last page. And disappointed. Not much action. It feels like it was stretched. The description of African American characters makes me cringe. Not the best ever by C.Harris by far. I so miss Lilly Bard & Aurora Teagarden.

Even knowing that this was her first book and giving huge latitude for that, the book was so bad that about a third of the way in I decided that I was not going to finish it. I have NEVER not finished a book. I cared enough to skip to the end to see if the end was surprising and it was, but only in how stupid it was. Then I flipped through the rest of the book to see if there were any good parts that I missed, like maybe development with the relationship with Randall, but no. Not even that. I won't take this as a mark on Charlaine Harris as an author overall, but there is a reason this book is out of print. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promising debut","review":"Paradoxically, the first book published by Charlaine Harris many years ago was the last one I read. There is one important difference between \\"Sweet and Deadly\\" and all the later books by Mrs Harris: it is not narrated by the heroin. Obviously, later the author found it easier to express the emotions of her heroins when writing in the first person. Otherwise, the book is not very different from \\"The Secret Rage\\" and the series with Aurora Teagarden or Lily Bard. Catherine Linton is as interesting and engaging as her younger sisters, and the plot is maybe too elaborate, but very readable. I found really impressive the precision, with which the author closes the book on the same seemingly secondary items on which it began: a dead dog and a gun. This was a debut which promised a lot, and the author fulfilled certainly these promises."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"Wow I wish I had ordered the sample not the book.

Over all a decent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Deadly - don't miss this one!","review":"Okay, I never thought I'd get hooked on one author. Charlaine Harris must spend twenty hours a day writing, and not one of them is wasted judging by all of her work that I've read to date. Sweet and Deadly is a \\"stand alone\\" novel I picked up at the local bookstore just to see if it was as good as her series are. It is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags on and on...","review":"After reading all but one of the Sookie Stackhouse books, followed by Harper Connelly, I decided to try out more of the Charlaine Harris books at my library. I discovered this was her first and was excited to read it. I am so glad that her writing has improved. This one drags on and on. I did not like Charlotte Linton or any of the other characters. I did not need to know what happened every second she was at the newspaper. I finally stopped reading halfway through. It got to where I didn't care who the murderer was or if Charlotte was still a suspect.Everyone has to have a first book and while the reviews seemed to like it I did not. I guess I'm spoiled with her current books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Princess Catherine Radziwill's writing was a very early form of tabloid junk that you see today in the cheap papers.She was a very bitter person and took delight in speading gossip about the Imperial family and other royal families of Europe. She was known to have hated the Empress Alexandra with a passion and spead the story of the relationship between Alexandra and Rasputin. The relationship between the two was totally innocent and Alexandra trusted Rasputin with her life but more importantly that of her only son and heir to the throne Tzarevich Alexis. Alexis had haemophilia and rasputin was able to stop the bleeding when nobody else could. So to Alexandra, Rasputin was a man of God. She never saw his darker side and did not believe the police reports that was given to Tzar Nicholas II.Radziwill totally focused on the negative side of Rasputin's character. So avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just for baseball fans","review":"I bought this book for my husband who is a true baseball fan, but I ended up reading the whole thing through for myself before I gave it to him. The humorous stories of the boys' trip are not just for baseball fans to enjoy, and I could even appreciate what they had to say about the stadiums.

Null's razor sharp narration, the witty banter between good friends, and a crystal clear feeling of actual presence in the ballparks they describe almost brought me to tears. It is clear that baseball needed this book. America needed this book. I have rediscovered my passion for the greatest game ever, and I owe it all to the vision and dedication of the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This Book","review":"I was excited when I read about this book..., but thoroughly disappointed. Most of the time, the author (and really, it's only Brad Null talking) whines about his friend, the people he meets, and complains if he doesn't get free food. There is almost no insight into the parks, the fans, the game, or the cities... and the title has nothing to do with the content. Unless you are (or, more likely, were) a friend of the authors, I could not recommend this book. I have been to 28 of the 30 baseball stadia, and I did not find this book to be comparable to my own experiences, or provide a level of insight that I enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy Fulfillment out of the ballpark!","review":"Brad and Dave did what many of us dream about doing.

The times when he did get free stuff. I suspect that life is always half-empty for the author.

It skips less when I play it on my laptop but impossible to use in either of my two regular dvd players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Tai Chi and poor sound","review":"For one thing, it's not Tai Chi in any recognizable form. What it is, is a slow, repetitive series of moves derived from the traditional series of Tai Chi moves. I didn't find it to be of any muscular or cardio benefit at all. If you want to meditate, then buy something of that nature, because this doesn't fulfill that criteria, either. Plus, the DVD warns you that it isn't up to par for surround sound and so should rely on TV audio instead.

I have stood at the South Pole, flew in a helicopter through the Dry Valleys, cavorted with penguins on the sea ice, visited the restored huts of Scott and Shackleton. And yet this DVD bored me. Granted, the cinematography is awesome (well, semi-awesome on a 21 inch screen), and I learned a bit about glaciers. But the reviewers who point to the film's choppiness are spot on. Moreover, the narration is at an annoyingly low volume compared to the rest of the soundtrack. Finally, the romantic elevation of Robert Scott into a great explorer is ahistoric, as Roland Huntsford showed long ago in his book Scott and Amundsen, so the fawning treatment here is inappropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short !!!","review":"I love nature doc's.

R.I.P. Dave Williams 1972-2002, the singer of Drowning Pool.DISTURBED: Fear- I love Disturbed, they are a great group, this is a great song. Wish they wouldn't curse though.The rest of the songs are pretty bad, except for the 2nd Stage songs, those are pretty cool with the exclusion of Mudvayne which is a Slipknot ... I like Otep and Hatebreed they were pretty cool. I sold the album but burned myself a copy to have. Its okay. You'll either love it or hate it.

All this is is hard rock mixed with rap, with most bands. Sabbath is the only band on here with talent, but ozzy and his wife considering these bands such as slipknot, papa roach ect. metal, is the only reason why he gets to keep his ozzfest, and stay commercial. Real metal heads alike know what im talking about. Do you think slipknot and papa roach will ever be able to play an actualy guitar riff or a solo? No they wont, because there not good at guitar, if you disagree then it its a fact, youve never had guitar lessons.

It begins with Sarah as a young orphen and how she finds herself living with a grandmother she never knew she had. The first half of the book is focused on her as a child as she adjusts to her new life. The second half of the book takes place when Sarah is about 19 years old and the rest of her history is revealed. The Maiden of Mayfair is so rich with details of the time period that you feel like you are there in the room with the characters. Some authors overdo the details and I find myself just skimming over a lot of paragraphs to get to the meat of the story but Lawana Blackwell writes so that I enjoy the details and don't feel bogged down by them. The romance is light and more of an undercurrant than the focus of the story but you know and connect with the characters so much that you smile at the happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another enjoyable read !","review":"I have read many of Mrs. Blackwell books.

I think Lawanna Blackwell writes very well but the plot was, in my opinion, predictable and amateurish. The main characters were all very likable, but lacked depth. I kept waiting for something to catch my interest or surprise me but, as I said above, I found the entire plot to be totally predictable. I also found it to be somewhat unrealistic. I know that this story is fiction and that fiction doesn't have to be realistic.

It's to inconsistent to use as batting practice in any fashion. One pitch will be right down the middle, the next will go behind his back and the next will be 10 feet outside. It's good if you want to practice catching line drives or short fly balls. That's it. I am going to bite the bullet and purchase a real pitching machine.

I hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for skeet shooting than batting practice","review":"Thought this would be great for my 5 year old. He's got decent coordination and can hit balls pitched to him. However, because the product is so light and its mechanism so sensitive, it cannot pitch consistently. Instead, balls fly wildly too high, too short, too far in either direction. Once you think you've lined it up, half the balls are already pitched (it goes fast) and then the slightest jarring throws it out of whack again. My son gets frustrated and bored while we keep futzing with the thing to get it to pitch somewhere near where he is standing. Spend more money and get something more dependable. His 6th birthday is in two weeks and I'm already looking for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's for 5yr olds","review":"It pitches okay when it does that is.

We used them for a while on car rides until they stopped working. Then we took them to the slopes, but half-way up the chairlift we wouldn't be able to communicate. Then others around us would be on the same chanell and you would hear everything they said. Now, 1 year after buying them, when you turn them on, all you get it static, the VOX doesn't work, and sometimes, when you turn it on it just blinks at the same chanell and you can't talk to anyone.

As for the the battery life...It is a weird thing. Midland had the right idea to shut of the LED display while on a single channel, which definetly improves battery life, but when the unit is scanning the display stays on.

They're range is very limited - maybe a couple blocks outside.These radios are reminiscent of the old walkie talkie I got as a kid for Christmas, although they are better than that. This may be a good kid's toy, but the battery jumping out of place will be a problem with kids.If you're interested in a radio for your family to stay in touch at the mall, outings, etc. spend a more money and get something better...that's what I plan on doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Being a Disney fan I thought this game would be cute.

But into the middle of his scheme stumbles Andy Fiddler (Levy, A Mighty Wind, American Pie), a dental supplies salesman from Wisconsin. From there unspools some formulaic buddy-movie pap: Vann gives Fiddler a dose of excitement and Fiddler teaches Vann a little compassion and trust as they improbably track down the bad guys. To a degree, the producers were right--the interplay between Levy's Groucho eyebrows and Jackson's burning scowl provides the only juice this movie has. The Man doesn't deserve actors as talented as Levy and Jackson, but there's no denying they apply themselves diligently and squeeze out a couple laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"it sucked i don't think u should get it the acting is bad ive seen jackson so much better don't get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Comedy!!!","review":"This movie is extremely hilarious!

This film comes across as an adventure-comedy farce. It has some truly funny moments, but the humor doesn't leave you feeling good. It leaves you with more of the blush that one feels after having laughed at an off color joke. Not much about this film, the plot, the action, nor the punch lines is original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny movie","review":"This movie is a great pairing of Eugene Levy and Samuel L. Jackson. They make a great partnership and the acting is very well done. I especially like the banter and the way they try to get back at each other for previous things in the movie, great fun. The only reason it didn't receive 5 stars is because the plot is nearly paper thin, but if you look past that the movie will make you laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not That Bad......","review":"I fould it to be very funny I mean sure that is no story but who cares it's fun to Jackson doing a comdey for once I mean okay the other actors suck but it does not stop this movie from being funny.I know that the movie has alot of crude hummor in it and I like that kind of stuff but for those of you who want a funny and clever movie then go look somewhere else but for those of you who want to have a good time then go out and buy The Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Great movie, I love SLJ, he's an American treasure, and he was so funny, as was Eugene Levy.

Some sections area little quirky, but overall an interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"The book gives a generally correct picture of Huntington's disease and how it affects all members of a family. However, as another reviewer has pointed out, some of the information is dated. It also covers the secrecy that many families practice, which may partially explain why some people say they had no idea the disease was in their family. Otherwise, the book doesn't have much to offer. The writing is stilted and definitely needs an editor. The story line is trite and at times unbelievable. The protagonist is a whiner who does not generate much sympathy. He seems to be caught in adolescence, still trying to find his identity. Works of fiction with a particular disease as the focal point must be very hard to write. Perhaps writers should stop trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Picture's Worth a Thousand Words","review":"This absolutely stunning, full-color collection of heavy-weight postcards, 30 in all, comprises pictures of the varied life of the medieval woman. The collection spans illuminated manuscripts from 1200 to 1550, and includes a sweet introduction by Sally Fox. The backs of the postcards have the source material, but they also contain plenty of writing space-with nothing to detract from postal requirements-for those so inclined to actually use them. I highly recommend this collection.--The Medieval Chick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude, vulgar, blasphemous, cheerless","review":"I started reading this book with the impression that it might be a clever, amusing \\"proof\\" of the existence of Santa Claus. Instead, it was a crude mockery of existing philosophical theories and a cynical, scandalous dirtying of the happy image of Santa Claus. The author makes blasphemous jokes about Judaism, Christianity, the Bible, and Aristotle, and makes it quite clear that he is not actually attempting to prove anything; he is not even pretending to attempt to prove anything. He is merely trying to discredit the entire concept of epistemology. This book was a bitter disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to hard to be clever","review":"The first thing I noticed about this book was it had several racy or off color jokes, & the use of the \\"F\\" word once. That didn't particularly bother me, but was surprising in a Santa book, & I was glad I read it before purchasing for some other people I'd intended to.There is no magic in this book. It is an attempt to be clever, & some of it undoubtedly is. Some made me smile. But I didn't feel any Christmas spirit or excitement after reading it, just that I was supposed to be impressed with how smart the author was. It also had a section about how obviously Christmas isn't about God or celebrating Christ's birth. Overall I wouldn't recommend this book to Christmas fans. Someone who enjoys the intellectual arguements in here would enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dundee Township Moments Frozen in Time","review":"I liked the book format the spiral binding and all the pictures.

It was STRONG! It made my whole room stink of rubber/plastic. I washed it in soap and water many times - no improvement. When I used it, my hands would stink. I grew to hate the smell. I finally set it outside in the sun in hopes it would eventually outgas and stop stinking. No luck - it stunk even after the UV degraded the rubber material and it all fell apart. So I threw it away.At Physical Therapy, I used a different brand of web exerciser, and it did not stink. So maybe some other brand doesn't have the same problem.

If you need a lot of space, get this one. However, it is a little too much desk for my 15\\" laptop. Also, I never needed to use the light, so it gets in the way. Not to mention it makes my lap warm because the soft under cushion absorbs my natural body heat. A lap desk should keep a computer stable and cool, but it should also keep you from overheating too. Sadly, not recommended. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Tranquility Zone Lapdesk w/ light","review":"I am very pleased with the lapdesk I ordered!

There were so many choices, and the light did it for me because I also like to read late at night. The batteries don't last very long for me, but the laptop was my main purpose.Older people would probably like this desk for correspondence and reading, plus it certainly makes your lap warm. I recommend this as an alternative to a chill pad with your laptop, rather than an addition to the chill pad. The entire set up with the chill pad, laptop and lap desk make this a bulky thing for the lap. Something has got to go, and I think it has to be the chill pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality..","review":"..I suppose its the reason the desk was priced at $29.99 when I bought it.After taking the desk out of the box my wife immediately pointed out bubblingin the material used to cover the desk. It looks like that within a week thematerial would begin to chip away leaving unsightly scars. I wish the lightwas paced a little better as well. The base of the light stem was partiallyexposed too like it was bent too far during packaging. I ended up returningthe desk but received half of the cost of the desk after shipping. IfI had to do it again I might go with a lap-desk made of wood and just buy aclip on light.Another thing, the handle is neat but if you carry it around like that it seemedlike there was potential to walk the light into a door jam.

The light did not work. Since the item was a gift we did not have the receipt. After replacing the light bulb (which was broken) the light still did not work. After taking the desk apart, and playing with the electronics (wrench, exacto knife, ohm-meter) I determined that one lead was soldered to the wooden board (about 1/4th of an inch from the switch contact).I concluded that the desk could not have ever worked (since wood does not conduct electricity). So only buy this product if you want a desk from a company that doesn't check to see if the product works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Eater!","review":"Don't buy this item unless you own stock in a Battery Manufacturer because it eats batteries and expensive ones at that. The light output, even with fresh batteries is sub-standard. Particularly in light of the fact that you are using 4 C Batteries. In the two weeks subsequent to receipt of this item, I've put 16 new Akaline (Copper Top) batteries in the device after using it only 2 hrs every third day. This company (SPI) also sells another model that uses 4 AA bateries and has a LED light that is bright and soothing on the eyes. I also purchased this model and It's been over a month since purchase with only one set of batteries. Go figure.Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak light","review":"You'd expect a brighter light given that it needs 4 C cell batteries.

It is sturdy and thick without being uncomfortable, thanks to the bottom cushion.The light is easy to position (either towards text, or out of the way). The bulb gets very hot, however, and puts out fairly uneven light. Removal of the bulb requires a Philip's head screwdriver, but it has managed to last so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lap desk!","review":"I bought this desk for my mother who had some surgery on her leg and needed to keep it elevated in the evenings. This desk was perfect. It was small enough to not be obtrusive, the light was a great bonus and it was comfortable. She uses it to write letters on as well to read and do a few crafty projects.

The Boppy seems like a money-making gimmick to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful!","review":"I did not find the Bobby helpful.

Total waste of money","review":"Read all the rave reviews and decided to get this since I planned on breastfeeding my daughter and also because I was having a classical c-section and thought that this would help alleviate the pain on my abdomen when holding my newborn. Not sure who these boppy pillows were made for but if you're a larger person these do not fit comfortably around you. I was much more comfortable sitting in the glider with the baby propped on a pillow in my lap. Even now after 3 weeks I've given it another try and they still aren't comfortable for me and I've lost most of my baby weight.Amazon has a 365 return day policy so if you don't mind spending the money and giving it a try then go ahead but for me it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This product sounds like a great idea. Granted, there are other purposes I wound up using my Boppy for but breast feeding wasn't really one of them. I found the Boppy to be far too small for me to comfortably feed my little one. I kept putting pillows under it. The great use I DID get out of it was when my little one was very new, I would place the Boppy in the bassinet to prop him up.

Unfortunately, the fabric was not described. It was not the plush, soft fabric I have seen on other Boppy products. The cover was colorful, but harsh to the touch--not baby friendly at all.

I was overjoyed at my baby shower when I received the pillow as a gift. When I opened it up, I was super bummed out when the room instantly filled with a nasty chemical smell from the flame retardant. Unless you plan to chain smoke while simultaneously breast feeding your child, these chemicals seem somewhat overkill. It does not say anywhere in the description of the item that flame retardant is present, but it most definitely taints this otherwise handy product.

I went with the Brest Friend, which I used a grand total of 3 times. It may have encouraged correct breastfeeding posture, but it was also bulky, uncomfortable, and looked like a medical devise. I ended up stacking throw pillows for the entire 16 months I nursed, which was a pain to say the least. Now that I have my 2nd I decided to try the Boppy. It is great! No, it doesn't give you correct posture, but it is versatile, comfortable, and I don't feel weird in these early days when I have to take it everywhere with me. My son is 5 days old and already the Boppy has already made this nursing experience much easier than last time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"We have a 4 month old and I still carry my bobby from room to room to nurse her. I love it. It is firm enough to hold up her weight, and so far (knock on wood) isn't showing signs of wear. I would definately make sure you have 2 slipcovers. It is nice to throw one in the wash and have the second as a backup. Although, you can use the bobby just fine without the slipcover. I have the miss cherry and the fluterby covers. The fluterby is much softer than the miss cherry. Must be the type of material, but both are great.The only suggestion I would have is for bobby to put a handle on the pillow covers so it would be easier to carry from room to room with an infant in your arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice but not necessary","review":"i seem to sit on this more than nurse with it. my baby doesn't like sitting in it, but she does like laying tummy down on it. i can see its helped her develop her neck and back muscles very well. also, when i do nurse with it, it helps my posture, and its more comfortable for my baby when she falls asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for the NICU","review":"The boppy is great for all sorts of baby things, but what surprised me was how often I used it when my son was in the NICU. The chairs in the NICU are uncomfortable, sometimes too hard, too deep or with no neck rest. The boppy helps with all of these things. When doing kangaroo care (skin to skin contact with the baby), the boppy is essential. The baby is so tiny and I was always so afraid that I'd jostle him or push his breathing gear out of the way. The boppy provides a stable surface on which to prop my arms so I could hold him for hours. If I ever started to get sleepy- and what brand new parent doesn't- the boppy gave me confidence that I wouldn't just drop him before I could wake up enough to put him back in the crib. Breastfeeding is tough enough with a term baby, but the boppy was helpful to support him while I could use my hands to help him better suck at the breast. Oh- and keep the case it comes in- it provides great storage to prevent the boppy from getting dirty."},{"rating":"2","title":"love!","review":"Love my boppy and slipcover.

The opening is really small so it didn't fit around my waist. (Maybe if i was a size 0 right after giving birth it would have!) Also the curves along the length of the pillow put a baby at the wrong angle for nursing. I have nursed 2 babies through one year and have never used it once!

I like the design, too - it's muted but happy, fits with our eclectic decor. I also used it around my waist while sitting - it feels nice! The only bummer is - whenever I ask one of my parents to help me place it around my waist, they always ask: \\"What waist?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"very helpful","review":"i used this pillow from day 1 at the hospital to feed my son. i've had it for 11 weeks now and it's still in great condition. i'm sure it will be even more helpful once my son gets heavier. it helps me prop him up and makes feeding him easier. we also use it to help him sit up when playing with him, and for tummy time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never stays in place","review":"I wonder how it gets so many reviews..This just doesn't stay in place while nursing..You have to keep adjusting..I wish I had not wasted money on this..A normal pillow is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as promised","review":"I have been drinking coffee forever and have never gone the \\"grind your own beans route\\" until now. After looking at the specs and reviews (and not willing to spend a lot of money I settled on the Mr. Coffee. Overall I am pleased with its performance. The description of the timed cycle is a little vague but I figured it out. Every batch has been consistent, without unground chunks. I would recommend this entry level grinder without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The grinding part of this grinder does well, but everything else is mediocre at best. The \\"chamber maid\\" isn't tight enough against the bottom to really get all the grounds out, the bowl and lid are a bit difficult to put in and lock into place, and after 6 months of use, I have difficulty getting the buttons to line up just so to activate the grinder. My old crappy ToastMaster grinder was more faithful than this one. I will be buying a replacement soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a great product for its low price. Does exactly what it is supposed to do! Grinds finely and quickly. Easy to clean. Yes, the cord is a little short. Make sure you pull it out all the way because it comes tucked in the bottom. Nice and small, easy to store. No complaints here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best choice","review":"I make 4 12-cup pots a day with my Bunn drip machine, so this grinder gets a lot of use. I'm now on my second of these grinders. The first lasted 9 months, the plastic spinning uprights in the cup that scrape the sides broke. So although there is a warranty I just bought a new one because it was the easier option. Given the heavy daily use mine gets and the low price i'm happy though, and for me this still beats out the competition by miles with its well thought design. For me the best feature is the removable cup, it makes it easy to tap the grinds into the filter basket without moving the whole machine and pulling cords anywhere. If you take a minute on first use to look at how the pieces of the grinder all attach together, removing and replacing the cup each time becomes quick and easy. I think this is the best choice and have bought again, recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and fussy","review":"Got this as a birthday gift, meant to replace a great old cheap Krups which I had had for eons. This one is very fussy to put together, inconvenient to load, even more inconvenient to empty, and grinds a bit too fine for my coffeemaker (also a Mr. Coffee). Holding down the top during the whole grind defeats the purpose of it even having a timer. The little scraper arms, which are designed to clean the inside of the grinding chamber, never did work very well, and after several months, so maybe 90 or 100 grinds, the plastic scraper arms broke off anyway. The grinder still works without them, so I think I'll turn this one into an occasionally used spice grinder and buy a very simple new coffee grinder without all the bells and whistles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair grind but quickly kaput!","review":"Had this grinder about a year. It often left big chunks of beans in the grind. Now, it has died. My old Kitchen Aid A9 worked for over 15 years. I am going to see if I can find it on auction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Coffee has cheapened the construction!","review":"We had one of these for many years and it provided great service but eventually wore out, so we bought another one. It has a much cheaper fit and finish than the old one. The bowl has a looser much less positive fit. The lid used to snap fit closed, now it does not, so when emptying the bowl it makes a mess of grounds on our kitchen counter. Worse of all, they shortened the electric cord by so much that it no longer reaches a standard height kitchen outlet, this means the grinder must be held up in the air with two hands near the outlet when ginding. We are now shopping for a different grinder and this one will end up in the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"Our good friends bought this for us last month and it works great! We had talked about getting a coffee grinder but we didn't see any under $50.Our friends set it up for us and showed us how to use it, since they also have one. So, like the previous reviewer, I did not know about the cord storage and was operating it in tight places. Probably why they add the operating instuctions and tell you to read it first, huh? :)Anyway, if you are looking for an inexpensive coffee grinder that grinds perfectly run out now and get the Mr. Coffee Electric Grinder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stupid design!!!","review":"This is a stupidly designed coffee grinder. There are plastic parts on the inside that are supposed to help clean the grinds and scrape them off of the sides of the jar. Well, the design is bad because not only does it not do the job but it is also flimsy and snapped into pieces this morning. I am now worried that I am actually ingesting little bits of plastic every time I drink my coffee. There are simple grinders out there without these fancy accessories that last much longer. I prefer the Black & Decker one at Walmart that is nearly the same price but is much easier to work with. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $20 - get the Krups","review":"My Braun died after a few years of good service. I went with Mr Coffee, but will get a Krups after just a couple of weeks. Not worth the effort to return it so I will eat the $20. This is why I dislike it: the green leds do not shutoff, you have to unplug it; after you grind the coffee and try to empty it, a lot is left stuck on the bottom; the 'grind' button sometimes sticks, and you think it is broken; it is taller than my old Braun and is somewhat unwieldy. Don't need any issues with a grinder, just want it to be quick and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets the job done, there are better choices probably","review":"I really don't care for this grinder at all. It does get the job done, but transferring from the grinder to the coffee maker is a messy business. The 'chamber maid cleaning system' is pretty ineffective. Some manual cleaning is still required, and the cleaning system actually hinders getting the last bit of grind/debris out of the chamber. It's awkward to use because the electric cord is so short it's a bare couple of inches from the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I purchased this as a gift, and it turned out that the recipient already had one, so I kept it as a back-up to my Kitchenaid grinder. Fortunately Kitchenaid has a lifetime warranty, so I'd only be relying on this thing for a few weeks at a time, but MAN I hope my Kitchenaid doesn't break! This thing is terrible - uneven grind, tons of small parts to get beans stuck in, cord that's wrapped so tightly under the base that it's hard to tell if you're unwrapping it or pulling it off of the machine. Awful. I'm soooo glad I didn't end up giving it as a gift! Spring the extra $20 and get a Kitchenaid or another quality grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Flimsy! Be warned!","review":"This is the second Mr Coffee grinder I have owned. The first, bought several years ago performed well for a couple of years of daily use until a piece of the plastic basket broke off. I was otherwise happy and so I bought another one. This grinder broke in exactly the same place, this time after no more that 6 mos use. Even for a low cost grinder this is unacceptable. Mr Coffee would be well advised to spend a couple of more dollars to use metal or sturdier plastic in this part. The grinder is useless without it. Buy something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to use. Easy to clean.","review":"After daily use over the past several months, this grinder is still going strong and is a breeze to use and clean up. For those worried about counter space, it is small enough to slip into a cupboard easily or to simply leave out.If only everything in my life were this well designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It!!!","review":"I was looking for something which can be used for grinding purpose (being an asian - we need spices for cooking) and this one is perfect. Used it within 5 minutes of getting this and I loved it. Used it for grinding poppy seeds, chillies, sesame seeds, garlic, ginger etc. This is great and washable in dishwasher! Wonderful at this price!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect inexpensive grinder with a digital timer!","review":"I enjoy coffee, and fresh ground coffee is the best. I know burr grinders produce better grounds, but they are usually very expensive and large. For less than $20 you get a small blade grinder that includes a digital timer that automatically shuts off according to the amount & grind setting you want. Super easy to measure, adjust, and just hold down the grind button until it is done. No manually timing yourself! The top tips up for easy pouring, and you can also as easily remove parts and clean it with a paper towel. Stylish with a integrated cord wrap, this is a great grinder. A few beans miss the blade and don't get as ground as they should, but overall it consistently makes great ground coffee for a super price point!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Bought this after I got so tired of only being able to grind a little coffee at a time with my old grinder. I don't do anything fancy as far as coffee goes, just grind it fresh every day for use in a standard drip coffee maker. So I love this. Can grind enough for a whole pot or as little as 4 cups. Love the ease of use and the fact that the cup can go in the dishwasher. Great for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great...","review":"The \\"Chamber Maid Cleaning System\\" is useless. When I bought it I thought it was pretty cool but arms don't do a good job of scraping along the grinder walls.The cord is really short and what they call the cord storage area is ridiculous. It's a huge pain to wrap the cord up into the little slot they provide in the base of the grinder.The auto grinding feature doesn't go a very good job of grinding. Used it twice and went to doing it manually. Since you have to hold the button down anyway didn't feel like much of a convenience loss.Flip top lid and pour spout only serve to help you spill more grounds.Only good thing was that it comes apart which allows you to wash it with soap and water.Used this for two weeks. Got rid of it and bought a simple Krups Fast touch grinder. Much happier with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, less messy","review":"I have this grinder over 2.5 years. It works fine consistently. Before this one, I always hated to make a mess with a grinder-open plastic cup part, spill some, and lift the whole thing and tap it upside down over the coffee machine...NOT with this one. You can just twist upper part, lid attached, and bring it to the coffee machine. I am buying the second one for my work now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Equipment with Gimmicky Features","review":"This is a terrible coffe grinder. It looks very space-age with lots of lights and switches, but its functionality stinks! It is difficult to clean, based mainly on the fact that the \\"chamber maid\\" cleaning system shredded after about 6 uses. Many of the beans after grinding are still whole. Wish I'd read the reviews here before buying this \\"fancy\\" piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it.","review":"I bought a new electric percolator (I got tired of the lousy coffee from drip coffeemakers) and because I needed a coarser grind than that readily available in grocery stores, I decided I would grind my own coffee beans to make coffee in it. I purchased the Mr. Coffee IDS77 from a local store. I hated it; it only had 3 grind settings, it was not easy to use, I had to stand there and hold the button till it stopped, the cord wrap was a royal pain, and worst of all some beans were ground to a fine powder but it also left big unground chunks of coffee bean at the completion of the coarse-grind cycle - - yuck! And it was difficult for me to disassemble, clean, and reassemble with arthritic hands (lots of twisting involved).After reading all the reviews here (thank you, fellow Amazon fans!) I ordered the Hamilton Beach 80374 Hands-Free for just a few more dollars and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! See my review at that product.Needless to say, I am returning the Mr. Coffee grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as a daily grinder","review":"I really wanted to keep this grinder but at the end I must return it.Deal breaker annoyances: Must hold button during grinding; Must stay plugged in else settings not remembered; If left plugged in appliance sips 0.1 amps just idling (what for?); basket designs means messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Something Else","review":"I hate this grinder. The cord is about a foot long so if there is anything in front of your outlet you have to move it to grind your coffee. The lid is fiddly and loaded with nooks and crannies that hold coffee grounds and spill them all over your counter when filling or emptying the cup. The \\"Chamber Maid\\" cleaning system does nothing useful, and the Coarse-Medium-Fine setting needs to be reset every time the device is unplugged."},{"rating":"1","title":"self cleaning arms broke","review":"I do not recommend this grinder. The self cleaning \\"chamber\\" feature is great, but after a couple of months of use, the plastic arms broke, up at the top where they \\"tee\\" with the circular ring. What this translates to is a lot of fiddly work to get it back together after washing it. It's so bad I rarely wash it now, and I am -- yet again -- researching for a new coffee grinder. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, Messy, Short Lived","review":"I received this coffee grinder as a Christmas gift and lasted about 11 months before the grinder blade chewed up and broke the plastic scraping blades on the inside. In the time I used the grinder I was never a big fan: It was loud, had an inconsistent grind, messy (that could be my fault, I'm messy in the kitchen).I know I'm being very negative, but it is a serviceable, inexpensive grinder. It is not ideal for french presses. It might be good enough for coffee filters...that is, until it eats itself from the inside. It's probably great for herbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only use with a paper filter","review":"I bought this before I knew anything about coffee. For not a lot of money more you can get a refurbished burr grinder that will be more consistent and leave less dust. The chamber maid cleaning system didn't do a great job because this pulverizes some of the coffee beans in order to crush the other beans. It doesn't have any way to control how coarse you want the beans except for how long you grind, so only use this for a paper filter drip pot - no espresso or french press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Coffee grinder not for fine coffee","review":"I purchased this unit to grind coffee for expresso and found it does not grind to a \\"fine\\" ground. It has a \\"fine\\" setting but does not come close to actually pulling it off. The \\"fine\\" setting just grinds longer than the \\"course\\" and \\"medium\\" setting. Very disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor coffee mill isd77","review":"Christmas present looked good. Sub-par operation and construction killed the joy. Grind timer did not work. Ground as long as button held down. Obviously not 'timed' as promised, so grinds as likely to turn out 'fine' as 'coarse' or 'medium.' So called 'Chamber Maid Cleaning system' required several minutes of hot water and soap to clean after use. Not easy. Actual chamber maid would have been fired before lunch. Chamber Maid system thin plastic and likely to give up as in earlier review. Does not clean coffee off the side of the chamber. Cord storage very poor. An excellent example of promises not kept, poor design and construction. Got to be a better one out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who designed this thing???","review":"The cord on this thing is so ridiculously short it is basically useless if you have deep counter tops. Once you grind coffee, the flip top makes it nearly impossible to empty without scattering coffee everywhere. Save your money and buy another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some major flaws","review":"Well, first, this thing is REALLY loud. I know by virtue of what this is that it is noisy but I usually grind at night which defeats the purpose, so as not to wake up a sleeping hubby. Second, it is a giant pain to get the coffee out of the thing without getting the spoon caught on the blade at the bottom. The turn to clean thing works ok but there are so many steps to get it off the base and the top always flies open and flings coffee everywhere. I do think it works well, you can grind for the right number of cups to get the perfect grind and it has a buil in timer but I will definately replace it with something different when I buy the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Results, Gimmicky, Overly Complicated","review":"At around $20, this little blade grinder is cheap but suffers from a needlessly-complex design, poor performance, and useless gimmicky features.Here's why I returned mine:1. Too many piece-parts to lose, clean, assemble, and break.2. A very inconsistent grind (far too many \\"fines\\" along with medium and large particles) that can cause sour and/or bitter flavors.3. Difficult cleaning that can add stale/rancid flavors: many of those overly-fine grinds are impossible to remove because of the \\"cleaner arms\\" that don't actually work and are just in the way.4. A useless grind timer that requires you remain holding the power button while beans are over-processed on virtually every setting.CONCLUSION: 2 Stars instead of 1 because it is inexpensive and has lots of buttons and neato green LED lights!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It may have been a little too much to hope for a grinder that cleans itself. The only thing that the plastic blades intended for wiping the coffee off of the sides are good for is providing more surface area for coffee grounds to stick to. The removable cup and lid only become nuisances to fit back into place. Green lights that reflect the number of cups the maker is set to grind and the current grind setting only make me think that I'm unnecessarily using extra power (granted it's only pennies, but it's still waste). My last simple coffee grinder lasted 15 years. I don't think I'll last 1 year with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted","review":"I was excited to receive my Mr. Coffee electric grinder for Christmas. I've used it 10 or 15 times and this morning it broke. The blade will not spin and the motor smells hot. Nothing appears to be blocking or broken from the outside. Also, you are supposed to be able to pull the cord out, but try as hard as I can pull...I can barely reach the outlet with my cord without tipping the grinder over. It was such a fancy, pretty grinder that worked good the first 10 or 15 cups of coffee... =("},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic makes perfect?","review":"Took almost no time for the plastic wall scrapers to break.

Despite using the \\"coarse\\" setting on the Mr. Coffee grinder, it produced very inconsistent results.

It has been so nice to have freshly ground coffee. My wife and I follow the directions for grinding and for cleaning. If you do this you won't have any issues. The unit is small and it does what it was made to do. The description tells you all you need to know. I cannot say anything bad about it as I just follow the directions and it works as it should. I highly recommend it to anybody who loves freshly ground coffee and the smell associated with it.Happy drinking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend a few more bucks","review":"Spend a few more bucks.The cord is ridiculously short! 24 inches or so. As you have to hold the button down the entire time it grinds, you will probably need an extension cord or you must stand CLOSE to an outlet. My biggest complaint.The Chamber Maid Cleaning System is mediocre and just a bit functional. Not a real selling point and shouldn't have been used in the name of the product as such. I use a brush from an old system to get it all out,It does a good job at grinding.

Last week, while grinding for 8 cups of coffee, there was a CRACK! and then the motor was running with no load. When I looked inside the chamber, one of the three \\"arms\\" of the Chamber Maid system had broken off.

If you can put together a food processor, you can do this.I'm actually pretty amazed at how finely it got the spices - there were some pretty tough rosemary pieces in there I couldn't get with a mortar and pestle.

To my surprise, they must have revised the plastic molding design because the lid does not have a good seal when closed. I have the old broken unit and new unit side by side and it's very clear there is a visible gap near the sprout on the new unit when the lid is fully closed! Why do I complain? Because I usually give it a light shake during grinding to loose grinds that stuck to one side. With this open gap, a light shake would cause grinds to come out of the chamber. In fact, it have not had a single session that I didn't need to clean up my kitchen counter because of the escaped grinds.I took the new unit back and swapped it and same issue on the second unit, which leads me to believe the plastic molding design got changed for the worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product and could have chopped my finger off!","review":"I just purchased this today and was anxious to use it.1st - No instructions, but figured it was pretty easy since I've owned other grinders before.2nd - Set the cups and grind medium and hit the push \\"on\\" button which I needed to hold in order for it to keep working. I thought it was supposed to grind and shut off automatically to whichever setting I put it.3rd - The next time I plugged it in, without the top on and the thing shot coffee all over my kitchen!

When I set the unit for medium grinding setting, I can use less coffee in comparison to the use of my Cuisinart Grind and Brew coffee unit.

The parts are supposed to help clean out the cup. Instead, they actually help to hold coffee grounds in the cup. The lid even holds grounds. There are way too many contours in the cup. It cannot possibly be cleaned out. At all.Also, you actually have to stand there and hold a button down to operate the grinder. You can't walk away and get your lunch ready. You can't do anything, if it would require you to walk away from the grinder. How is this a good idea? Why in the world can't they have a switch that you turn on and walk away? It could turn itself off automatically, (We know this because that's what it does now; It turns itself off automatically).Summary - Pros: Cheap. <$20 Cons: Does not empty completely.

They were right about that after I finally got it put together. It took me over 30 minutes to find how it turned to close and lock. Plus the little plastic pieces looked so fragile that regardless of the 15% return charge and then shipping both ways, I was afraid that it would become more of a disaster than it already was, so back it went.

After nosing through the blade grinders on Amazon I run across this little Mr Coffee grinder. The key for me was the removable grinds chamber. Previous, simple grinders I've owned (like the basic Krupps) required the whole unit to be taken to water, wiped and stuck upside down to drain. With this grinder, twist the top, twist the chamber and off it pops leaving the body behind. Very smart.This coupled with a variation of timer to adapt to quantity and coarseness of grind, and really this little grinder has everything I could have wanted.Good design, solid, works, good bang for the buck.If you're looking for a grinder, you can't go far wrong with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basket gone in one year","review":"We purchased this grinder less than a year ago and it worked well. But eventually, the plastic of the cleaning basket wore out. I had read other reviews here and noted that others had called Mr. Coffee about this and recieved a replacement basket from them for free. So with this information, I called Mr. Coffee, but they were out of replacement baskets. To my surprise, they sent me a hole new grinder, absolutely FREE. It was a BMH23 Automatic Burr Mill Grinder, which was much better quality than the one I had. Kudos to Mr. Coffee's customer service. This kind of service creates satisfied customers.

It grinds the coffee quickly and the motor seems strong enough to last a reasonable amount of time (hopefully at least a 1.5 years or maybe 2). However the quality of the chamber itself seems a bit questionable. The chamber isn't that sturdy, but if you're careful I really don't see how this could break except when subject to extreme use. Great deal for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good grinder... decent price.","review":"This is a good grinder for the price, however, it doesn't grind all the beans in one session.

If I was allowed to rate this ZERO stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad It Didn't Work","review":"I ordered the IDS77 on the strength of a Consumer Reports review. They felt that, as a blade grinder, it did a pretty passable job of equaling the performance of a burr grinder. Perhaps their sample did, but my unit was Dead on Arrival DOA). The problem was the grinder wouldn't run because the actuator button was faulty. I sent it back to Amazon at no charge (what a great company) and selected a Hamilton Beach 80374.

It was nice to disconnect the chamber for pouring into the filter and the cleaning mechanism was helpful to loosen the coffee. But within a week of buying it the ability to set the number of cups and degree of fineness stopped functioning. I should have returned it then but it was still performing satisfactorily.Recently however it started being picky. I'd have to unplug and replug it back in to get it to work. Today that stopped working too. It isn't acting like a problem in the power cord more like some sensor or other internal component no longer working as designed.Oh well, next I'll try one with a simpler design, but I don't expect better reliability. It seems all manufacturers want us to replace such things every year or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in less than 3 months!

You don't need that stuff. And it takes two hands and more negotiation than I should have to give to get the grinding cup on and off. A simple grinder is all you need. You grind the coffee til you decide to stop. You tip it over to empty it and you can clean the well with your finger, a brush, or a towel. You don't need Mr. Coffee to think for you. Get outta my way, Mr. Coffee, I don't have time to play with you.

Certainly applies here. Chamber maid cleaner is held together by thin plastic strips that break easily. Never really scraped all the coffee of the bottom anyway. Grind size selector is just a gimmick, much easier just to grind until you get the grind size you desire by holding down a bottom and taking a peak. Take my advice and go with a simple model. You'll be happier in the long run. I give it 2 stars because it actually grinds coffee. It just does so in a more difficult way, and to me, that's just the wrong approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This grinder is not very good. It does not produce a fine grind which I prefer to use as I use paper filters. The grinder is also very difficult to clear. All the Chamber Maid Cleaning system does is get in the way and make it very difficult to clean the ground coffee out with a small brush. I do not recommend this machine for those reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad grinder","review":"I will keep this short. I have found the same issues as many here have pointed out. The sweep arms don't work well and only serve to get in the way of cleaning with a brush. The cord windup feature is a stunt in itself and isn't worth the effort. The grind is inconsistent - even for a blade-type grinder. The alignment to close the lid can be a pain. And my newest problem with this grinder is that the plastic chamber deforms after a while and the lid tracks don't hold tight anymore. I have to twist-latch the lid and then hold it tight to ensure it doesn't slip off. In fairness, the grinder has worked to grind coffee every morning for about 6 months with no issues outside of the over-thought under-executed engineering. This was an emergency replacement for my previous grinder, but I can already see myself buying another grinder very soon; a pity, considering the motor, selectors, and timer all seem to be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disatisfied","review":"The second time I used the grinder the programming feature failed to work. It did grind the beans by holding down the button. I am disappointed that it failed as I liked the features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice grinder for the money.","review":"It's inexpensive, efficient, and seems to be well made. The \\"Chamber Maid\\" system seems to me a bit gimmicky -- it doesn't seem to do anything that could be done with a couple of taps on the side of the bowl. In fact - I usually do that instead. I don't miss the feature, so I don't consider it a bad point that it doesn't really seem to be effective.It grinds quickly and seems to do it pretty evenly, too. It is definitely loud though. Being the first one up in the morning, the coffee making is my job. Since access to our garage is through the kitchen, I just step out into the garage and run the grinder so I don't wake anyone up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"There are many good features about the grinder which makes it more appealing to me than the \\"manual\\" grinders I've always used in the past. The self-timing feature works well for the grind and strength of coffee we prefer. The self-cleaning is good as long as you don't mind having a few grounds left in the bottom of the grinder. At least it cleans off the sides of the grinding chamber satisfactorily. It's also an excellent feature to be able to disassemble the grinding unit and put it in the dishwasher or clean it by hand. Can't do that with the Manual style grinders. I would suggest a design change for the manufacturer in that some of the coffee grounds get hung up around the inside lip of the grinding chamber when you pour the coffee grounds from the grinder into your coffee maker. This is not any kind of a serious issue with the product, just a minor annoyance that I think could be improved upon. All-in-all, I'm glad we bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grinder","review":"I had used the Mr. Coffee IDS77 Electric Coffee Grinder with Chamber Maid Cleaning System at a friends house and was so impressed I ordered my own. The grinder automatically stops based on the number of cups you choose (4-12) and how fine you want the coffee (coarse-fine). In my opinion, the system runs a bit too long and over grinds the coffee if you choose the appropriate expected number of cups and grind. For a full pot of 12 cups, I choose medium grind and 8 cups. The cleanup system is very good, it cleans well. And the lid and grind chamber as removable for cleaning. The cord is cleverly hidden around the bottom of the grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what its made for","review":"Had this grinder for over a year. Love it! Sure its loud, but you get what you pay for. Got it to grind my beans for my french press. Fill, grind, remove and pour. Too easy.Only issue is now the plastic cleaning arms in the chamber broke off. Still grinds. Consistency is still adequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Grinder","review":"The coffee grinder does really well, enjoy the fact that it turns off when it is done and don't have to guess at when to stop grinding. The coffee beans are fairly consistent in the ground sometimes get a few pieces a little bigger. When using the expersso is a residue at the bottom of the pot, no big deal you can pour it through a paper filter and that takes care of it. Overall, it is a good product and worth the money spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for a little over a year","review":"It worked fine for a little over a year. It was used nearly daily. Just stopped working one morning. Smells like the motor burnt out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmicks don't add value","review":"It's a blade grinder and works OK, but the Braun product grinds better. Grind quality is quite uneven at the recommended settings - need to grind quite a bit longer to get it more uniform, but then it will be quite fine. The automatic timing seems like a nice feature, but it has to be set every time you plug it in - easier just to grind by ear. The chamber maid feature doesn't really clean out the bowl, but it gets enough out that you don't have to brush it out just to make your coffee. Mine broke in less that two months and then it jams up the lid. It's not so bad with a relatively full load, but when grinding enough for a cup or two a lot of the coffee winds up under the lid and has to be brushed out anyway. Having the removable bowl is nice but the lid part is fiddly to assemble. I quickly got fed up and spent the extra money for a quality burr grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good machine but unclear on quantities","review":"Nice machine, good quality and easy to use but it is unclear how to calculate the quantities of coffee beans before you start grinding. This should be important since this is how the unit calculates the grinding time. I guess you have to use it and measure what you get with what you put in and sort of get some experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee grinder","review":"This was highly rated and I see why. It has so many great features. The only con is the finely ground powder sticks slightly to the inside of the grinding chamber due to the oily nature of coffee bean. It is not big problem.

After following the instructions I end up with unevenly ground beans. Not good. Also, the machine is not nearly as easy to clean as the product subscription suggests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grinder","review":"I've been a coffee snob for a long time. Only freshly ground beans make it to my coffee maker. I had used a burr grinder for years, under the supposition that it provided a better grind. My Cuisinart grinders would last 1 or 2 years and die. My burr grinder went belly up last week and I'm tired of paying a lot for grinders that die. I took a chance on this grinder and am VERY happy with the better tasting coffee from a perfect grind. It's well made and easy to use. It's not quite as convenient as having a coffee 'hopper' to hold a load of beans, requiring on this one to fill it with beans for every pot, but totally worth the trouble. If you're looking for good beans, try Trader Joe's French Roast. The best coffee maker I've used is the Bunn home version. The combination of this grinder, the french roast coffee and the Bunn coffee maker rivals ANYTHING Starbucks can come up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to clean","review":"It grinds well enough the timer is nice if you have no idea what you are doing and can't learn how long to grind your beans after a few attempts. The big downside for me was the time it takes to clean it out. I may have a little OCD I don't know but I like the grinder to be clean (relatively) before each use meaning I wipe it out with a dry cloth. The cup of the grinder has different plastic pieces in it you won't find in most grinders which makes it a pain to clean out. I have a very simple cuisinart grinder at home and it works just fine I use the Mr Coffee grinder at work because my wife decided she didn't like it (after she bought it). So I would recommend almost any other simple grinder over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I initially thought grinder worked well. I liked ability to wash grinding chamber. However, after 1-2 weeks my coffee maker started to backup and get clogged. I first thought it was my coffee maker but realized the grinder produces a fine powder even on medium setting. This powder clogs the filter and you end up with a big mess and risk damaging your coffee maker.I am going back to my previous grinder made by Cappresso. Don't waste your time with this grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinds fine, poorly designed","review":"This thing grinds well, but the grind settings are entirely pointless (you still have to hold down the grind button the whole time) and the cleaning system is hokey and awkward.

I recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Coffee Grinder","review":"This is the worst product I have ever used. In the description and on the box it states \\"it is great for coffee & spices\\", but the instructions state for best results \\"only grind coffee, do not grind nuts or SPICES\\"! It does not bring out the flavor of the coffee. I have read and re-read the instructions and do exactly what they tell you to do. I had a Cuisinart similar to: DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill. It was a VERY good product even those the reviews were not that good. I had it for almost 4 years and used it just about every day. Four years, everyday would be over 1400 grinds. I think it needed to be cleaned (never cleaned it) and started to have issues and then I think I broke it, unintentionally. Amazon is good with their policies and the products that they sell. I will be calling them to see if they can help me out with this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same old grind...","review":"I am what you'd call a coffee snob. I purchase my beans green and roast them myself. I've spent quite a bit of money getting just the right roaster.

But, after lots of reading reviews and research, I settled for this inexpensive little guy. I have had it a month now and am very pleased with it. It has settings for the amount of beans you are grinding along with the type of grind you want(coarse, medium, fine). I have been very pleased with the job it does and it's definitely a good buy for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be","review":"I bought this electric coffee grinder, because it was the only other choice in WalMart, besides the coffee grinder I had that had just died.The lid is a royal pain in the neck to fit back on to the main compartment!

Returned for refund.","review":"I read many of the reviews here on Amazon for this (and other) grinders before making a purchase. Since I have owned several types (Braun has been the overall best) over the past 30 years, I knew what I was looking for. This one seemed to fit the bill: Less expensive, larger grinding volume, quieter, longer lasting, etc.Well, I was disappointed with it. It took what seemed forever to grind the beans to the fine consistency necessary for our machine. Then, after grinding about two cups of beans (we keep a few days worth of the ground beans in an airtight container), it completely stopped working. I am not sure if it was defective or just not capable of grinding properly. I am thinking it was the latter.I sent it back and am not taking a chance on another one of these. I'm looking to purchase a better quality unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well, but don't expect it to last forever","review":"I bought one of these grinders two years ago, and it worked perfectly for exactly one year. After 12 months of gentle use, the plastic \\"chamber cleaning system\\" broke, causing bits of ground plastic to be mixed in with my ground coffee.I figured it must have been a fluke, so I went out and bought another one. 10 months later, the exact same thing happened -- the chamber cleaning system broke into pieces, and those pieces were subsequently ground up with my coffee beans.There's not much else I can say about this grinder that hasn't already been said in the other reviews. It's a good grinder for the first 10-12 months... but after that, you're on borrowed time. I won't be buying another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, efficient and easy to clean","review":"My old Mr. Coffee grinder stopped working after 5 good years of service. I used it mainly for spices. This one does the job very well, with the added bonus that it is easy to clean. Hope it lasts longer than the previous one. If you are looking for a spice grinder, I would recommend this one, because it is easy to clean, and the smell of one spice will not affect the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grinder","review":"This is much nicer than my previous grinder. I like how the grinding bowl easily lifts off the base for easy pouring. A quick twist of the lid, scrapes most of the grinds off the side of bowl too. Two buttons with LED indicators, adjust the courseness of the grind and the grinding time. The grinder automatically stops based on your adjustments. No guessing. Works perfect for me everytime.

Only this time, I learned from my mistake and simply bought the cheapest one I could find. My lesson: A coffee grinder doesn't need to be fancy; all it needs to do is grind beans, so don't be stupid like me and fall for a bunch of whistles and bells that don't really do anything. The second coffee grinder I bought was a Toastmaster 1119, your basic no frills grinder -it was half the price, it's much easier to use, and so far, it's lasted twice as long (I've had it about 6 or 7 months now and it's working fine).I hope this helps someone! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Coffee IDS77 Electric Coffee Grinder","review":"This is our Second replacement....Luckly both were under warranty..My HONEST opinion ....Look for something else made of a BETTER QUALITY !!!Again don't waste your $$$$...."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a coffee lover, look for another grinder!","review":"This grinder is not worth the low price I paid for it.

I repeatedly got a grind that ranged from powder to half beans reguardless of the grind size I selected or the amount of beans I put in it. When I first pushed the start button, nothing happened. I only got it to start grinding after removing the grinding chamber and lid and replacing them several times. It's advertised as being \\"hands free\\" but that is false.

Nothing, the mill was dead. I called Sunbeam service and they said that there's and internal fuse that likely went when the unit overheated. What, one pot and it's dead? I'm getting my money back!

It's not a burr grinder, and it's not meant to be. But I get whole beans along with fine powder, no matter how long I grind it for. In addition, the cheap design of the scraping blades means that they break and the scraping function becomes useless pretty quickly. Overall, I'm not pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable design","review":"I don't often write a review of anything, but this morning after the usual suite of inconveniences centered on this otherwise eventless activity, I thought I should share my experiences. Short cord. Yes, you can pull it out. Mine only comes out so far. I have tried everything short of breaking the plastic cover. Consequently can only stand by a wall socket. Biggest complaint: it makes a mess. The top flips open. When removed, the top tends to dangle in course of removal, spreading grounds everywhere. The motor is weak, or maybe the combination of cheap cutting edge and weak motor causes uneven grinds. Cannot fill very much in cup to grind, otherwise VERY uneven grind. Was an impulse buy. Too many pieces should make buyers wary. Go for simplicity in design and efficient cutting edges. Make it all happen in one move. Recommend paying more for satisfaction and longevity."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"Lasted 20 days before it stopped working. Don't bother.

I'm done with Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grinder with a 'cleaning system' that actually makes everything dirtier..","review":"Pros:- PriceCons:The advertised 'cleaning system' makes everything messier. This 'cleaning system' interferes with coffee grinds so it actually takes longer to get the grind you want. I had to run the 'fine' cycle twice to actually get a fine grind. Since the coffee grinds can't move freely around the grinding chamber - they fly everywhere inside and actually wind up getting spread all over the lid and lid/cup edge so when you open the lid, grinds fall all over your counter.The 'cleaning system' doesn't actually do much and is rather hard to turn if you grind your coffee fine. The grinds get stuck under the plastic ring and it doesn't turn smoothly.Plain and simple this is a poorly designed product. Yes it grinds coffee but there are other blade grinders that do just as good of a job, that are less messy and can easily be cleaned with a simple wipe of a paper towel in the grinding chamber.Returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I was not expecting a whole lot from a grinder that I paid twenty bucks for at wallyworld. It grinds coffee well enough for a drip coffee maker, but the grounds are not terribly consistent.I did get a bit more than a year of near-daily use out of it, but now it's broken. The inner plastic chunk of the grinding chamber broke off, and now it's useless. The motor assembly works fine, and it feels like such a waste to throw away something that is 90% functional. But seeing as that extra 10% of functionality is the entire purpose of this product, it's time to find a new grinder.I would only recommend this if you're strapped for cash and need a grinder quick, or if you don't grind coffee with any regularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after 2 months","review":"This coffee grinder broke after two months of using it once a week.

My Mr. Coffee machines last until I HAVE to throw them out just because they're so old. No so with this grinder. After a few months of grinding one cup of coffee a day, it broke. While it lasted, it did a pretty good job but the beans were not always ground completely. Plus it was a bear to clean. Now I have to buy another one which means that if I had spent a little more money on it initially, I wouldn't have to go out and buy another one. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing coffee grinder","review":"I bought this inexpensive coffee grinder because it had some nice features: grind settings, removable grinding chamber, clear windows, etc. The electrical cord only runs about 12 inches, not enough length away from the wall socket. Even with the finest grind the grinder shuts off before the beans are sufficiently ground. Worse the beans at the top of the cup aren't ground at all, leaving whole beans in the cup. I was so disappointed and dissatisfied with this grinder that I went out and bought another one just a month or two later. I've read where others were satisfied with this one, but for grinding large quantities of beans or for fine grinding, better try another model.

Sina Vodjani uses fast paced dance beats and synthesized instrumentation that at first seem to contradict the subtle vocals, but amazing the result is a great melding, and provides a very uplifting feeling.

I cannot think of another guide that discusses individual recordings so thoroughly.The reviews are highly opinionated, but there is no question that each reviewer is an authority on the subject. I do disagree on some counts, particularly when it comes to some favorite singers. For instance, it matters not to me that Grace Bumbry is attacked for her lower register; she will always be the greatest Amneris in my book, if not in this one, so to speak.I agree with my fellow Texan reviewer who described hours of pleasurable reading from this essential companion.

And I havnt even finished it yet, and I really dont want to. Its so boring watching them talk for hours at a time. I found another problem with the game as well the battle system is hard to use, I thought so anyway, and the items you need for battle are just way to much money, and usually you cant afford to buy them, atleast thats how it was for me.

The graphics at times are so darkened that you can't even tell where you're going. The AI also seems lessened then Frontline.

MOH Rising Sun is a HUGE letdown. It's short, the AI is terrible, the weapons are boring, there are very few extras, the levels are underwhelming, and they messed up the grenade function, which seems like a small thing until you play the game and can't really use grenades strategically as you can in Frontline (see other reviews for more specifics about how the grenade function changed). Also, the graphics are nothing special, with the exception of the opening sequence, which is where the makers of this game seemed to have spent all their efforts.

I assumed that the negative comments were from hardcore gamers that were difficult to please... but I was DEAD WRONG. This game was a disgrace to the quality I expect from Electronic Arts, and is an obvious attempt to grab the cash from unsuspecting fans of Allied Assault.

First of all, it's incredibly short. It took me about 5 hours to beat it. Throughout the game, if you don't look for large amounts of time for the different guns, you get to use about nine of them. Every single level is completely linear. In almost every one of the levels, you follow the path that is forced on you. I can only take one path to your objective. Even in the jungle mission, you are only allowed to walk down a VERY narrow path. Probably one of the most irritating things about this game is the jumping. You cannot even jump over the lowest boxes, or branches, or whatever. One other incredibly annoying factor, is the fact that if there is a desk with two chairs sticking out of it at either side, you cannot go in between them.Overall, this game deserves a 22/100"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ground Truth","review":"This is my first review ever and the fact that I felt compelled to write one after a year and a half of ownership should give credit. Bottom Line: EA dropped the ball. I really don't know how anyone could give this game 5 or even 4 stars. I routinely hit glitches in the game that forced me to restart. The AI is WEAK. Very little exploration and overall too frustrating. There are several times that if you are not in the right place at the right time, the game freezes. Hidden passages won't open or the controls lock and you can't move forward.One thing that is also starting to bug me is when game designers have to \\"dumb down\\" a game. What I mean is the graphics and details should have been leaps and bounds above what they were. But since the PS2 has to be able to play the game, voila. Dumbed down.EA owes everyone who bought this game and expected it to be like \`Frontline' an apology and a free exchange for a \`Rising Sun 2, The Improvement'."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down after MOH Frontline","review":"I'm not a big FPS games fan, but I got hooked on to MOH Frontline which I thoroughly enjoyed. So I bought MOH Rising Sun expecting it to be even better...what a let down it was! The game was way too easy and when it abruptly came to an end, I was very disappointed. The storyline and missions are not bad, but the level of difficulty and the dumb soldiers are ridiculous. The graphics are mediocre. In the single-player missions your comrades sometimes get in between you and the enemy, and your enemy can still shoot at you but you can't!

Wow, I'd forgotten (but now recall) that the graphics were so bad. Any indoor scene, the graphics are SO BAD that they gave me motion sickness. It seems to be a framerate problem, with a blur when you turn. I have component HD cables and a 1080P 46\\" LCD, so it's not my hardware. Other games, like Fable, look amazing. The models and everything in the game are so bad it looks like a Dreamcast port. I think it was a PS2 port...if I'm not mistaken. That explains it.

There really was not much even historically interesting about it, as you don't get much detail about anything happening politically nor even how women lived in the time period. Sarashina focuses on landscapes and her feelings about her experiences. Perhaps in the original Japanese, this is more effective as you could admire her wordplay and style.

Not all pod brewers are the same...we have a Gevalia pod machine that accepts various brands of pods and can fit two pods at once for a more robust flavor, offering a taste that is closer to fresh brewed.

I love the cappucino pods, all my neighbors have purchased one after tasting my foamy delicious coffee. My kids love watching the steam come out with each cup. The only reason I am not giving this machine 5 stars is that the switch to seal the pods had become extremley hard to open.

It a consistent cup of coffee from the Senseo.

When I tried it first, I thought that the coffee was pretty decent and loved the ease of preparing coffee. However, after having the machine for 5 days, it started getting very noisy and spraying coffee in a wide circle around the cup. Also, it did not measure correctly -once it just emptied the whole tank and the cup ran over, it was a mess. I called Krups. They have a special line for complaints with this machine - obviously, they get a lot! When I reported that the machine did not measure the amount of water correctly, I was told \\"We hear about all kinds of problems with the machine, but this one I have not heard about\\".

If you take the grate out of the bottom you can use a large coffee mug if you're used to grabbing a large cup on your way to work.

Since it only holds single pods (no double Pod holder), I couldn't get coffee to be more than watery. The coffee was too thin to add cream, even for the smaller cup size. I tried several brands of pods before I gave up. The other problem was the coffee was not consistently hot.

First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience. I'm still trying different varieties. The French Roast is so far my favorite. By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes. I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers. Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited. But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee. I find it of good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"KP1010 Review","review":"This machine is much better than some of the other ones we've tried. The coffee itself tastes much better and stays warmer longer. I love the cup size selections because it allows for a wider range than most machines.

What a reader usually wants is more of the same -- more of the characters introduced in the first book, more of the world, generally MORE.What an author often wants to do is something completely different. S/he wants to explore completely different characters, a different timeline -- anything to distinguish the first book from its follow-up.I ended up reading this series out of order. I read CAGEBIRD first, then WARCHILD, and now this one. I could see how BURNDIVE might disappoint if followed on the heels of WARCHILD, but I loved it. I thought Lowachee took a huge risk giving us the point of view of spoiled Ryan Azarcon and forcing us, page by page, to care for him. In a way, we were like the Captain... who comes to truly care for his son by degrees.It's a good book, and a true testimony to Lowachee's writing that I could read them all out of order and not feel like I missed anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story...VERY poor Kindle conversion","review":"Great story by Ms. Lowachee but it was marred by the extremely poor conversion to Kindle format.

The protagonist has got to be one of the least interesting characters in any book I've ever read. You know its bad when you're looking forward to the scenes with his bodyguard because that character has some personality! The entire book is much ado about nothing; little happens, the descriptions are vanilla and repetitive.

It was unrealistic that Jarrett McKenzie the hero hunk had to win a wife in a poker game. The dialgoue, writing and plot were predictable. This is your typical, lousy, run of the mill romance novel.

It is a clear, straightforward instruction on how to behave as an adult in a stressful situation.Being newly separated with a young child, I was hoping for some insight and guidance on childhood responses to stress and sadness.This book provides an overview of that behaviour, and addresses the superficial responses an adult can make.It's a simple book with straightforward assistance. If that's your bag then this book is ok.If you are looking for more than a review of adult commonsense- although that is lacking sometimes- this is not the scholarly work you're seeking.But to make sure, in times of mental stress, that you're still behaving as you ought, then this is a decent guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Zipper","review":"Don't let the low price influence your purchase.

How bout having someone go through the examples to make sure they work.This is what makes me angry about this. I went to the site that the author mentioned and looked for the errata that should exist with the number of documented mistakes and expecially with the word from the author giving us his assurance that any mistakes that are found will be posted there.

The book does cover this okay. But most features weren't clearly specified, especially whenever a new command or function was introduced. Besides that, too much of the book was used to cover the basic language, not to mention an entire day talking about software engineering, which isn't directly in touch with the learning of Delphi 3. Although it was informative in some ways, but it could have been just a part of the appendix or someting else. The only part that I really thought helped me was the chapter on databases. Other parts were just scratching the spot.I think this book has a lot to improve!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teach Yourself Delphi 3 in 14 Days","review":"Teach Yourself Delphi 3 in 14 Days does a great injustice to an otherwise excellent programming language. On almost every page there is a glaring grammatical or spelling error that should've been caught by the editor. In addition, the authors describe features without letting the reader know which version they are describing. However, the book does introduce some key programming concepts and practices. Even though the book comes packaged with the Delphi 3 Standard edition, I would recommend choosing another text from which to learn Delphi 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors spell trouble for the beginner","review":"A book of this nature has to teach via a useful, comprehensive set of examples. This is not the case with this book. Quite simply, the example applications do not work when programmed acording to the instructions in the book. In many cases, steps needed to get things to work properly are completely ignored. Controls that show up in the code examples have never been placed on the forms, etc.I've been programming close to 30 years, so I was able to eventually sort things out, but I feel if I had trouble getting stuff from this book, a beginner would be lost.

I was swayed by the initial positive reviews, the brand, its portability over the Rotozip, and that it complemented my other existing DeWalt 18V tools.My first use on a box cut-out was very disappointing. It had plenty of power and speed but quickly spent one battery before I could complete the entire cut. Other attempts yielded similar results with other charged batteries.I was not going to post a review but felt compelled when it was receiving so many favorable one. Besides the poor run-time, the spindle lock was awkward and not well designed. Unlike most solidly designed and built DeWalt 18V tools, this tool is not designed for prolonged or rigorous use.I would only recommend this kit if you needed the extra batteries or the case (it fits the DeWalt DW960 right angle 18V drill, charger, and two batteries)."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEWALT DC550KA","review":"This tool has excellent battery capacity and is easy to handle;has plenty of cutting power.

I can't argue with the professionals, who love the quality.But for a homeowner, the quality is severely limited by the lack of attachments. As a homeowner, how many cut outs are you ever going to do? Other brands don't have the same quality, but they have a lot more attachments, making them not quite as good for basic cutouts, but much better suited for a lot more jobs.Dewalt doesn't even have a circle cutter or side handle attachment for the DC550. No circle cutter?

I checked out a CoverMax product as well in person which was alot thinner than this material and none of their 3 sizes fit my scooter: were either way too small, or way too big... thankfully, Dowco has a 4th size (this Large) that is right in between CoverMax's top two, which ends up working out great, and with sturdy material! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cover, Great Price - UPDATED","review":"UPDATE: I down graded to four stars. I've been using this cover for several months and I still like the product; however, this cover is NOT waterproof and after a night of heavy thunderstorms the cover collected the rain water and funneled it in. Granted there was a lot of rain coming down but I expected the cover to offer more protection that it did. I'll try a waterproof spray on the cover.The cover was purchased for a Vespa GTS300 Super. Though it's a little large, I'm sure it will be perfect if I add a top case and windscreen to my Vespa. The elastic is sturdy and keeps the cover secure. There are grommets to further secure the cover if one is so inclined. The front of the cover has a fleece-type liner that prevent scratching the windscreen and heat-proof liner to prevent melting from the exhaust. The cover beaded the rain effectively and kept my scoot dry in the rain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit Kymco People 50","review":"This is just plain tiny.

Works pretty well. Not waterproof.","review":"The XL size fits my Yamaha Majesty with room to spare. It's big enough that it'd probably still fit if I added a large topcase. It's plenty roomy.As others have noted, it's not waterproof, which doesn't bother me since I just want to keep the worst of the rain off the bike when I park it at work in the wintertime.And as others have noted, it'd kind of awkward to deal with when you pull it off the bike. It doesn't have any kind of built-in pocket or anything, so I have to fold it and squash it down to manageable size to put in my backpack. Not a showstopper for me, just a mild inconvenience.You do have to be careful not to put the cover on a hot muffler, even with the heat-shielded panel.

This large unit had competed high levels of pre training before deployment to a war zone, so why so dumb? Its understandable that everyone was unprepared to deal with this event seeing they were given bad Intelligence before deployment. That noted why push young solders into battle in what everyone knew we unarmored vehicles? Any good officer in at this level of leadership reacts from his training not his emotions, these seem to rush into danger with little regard of the troops safety. I would love to hear why the rush when they could have sent their Bradley fighting vehicles which carry one squad each to the lost platoon. They are quicker, safer and more powerful then anything they sent in flatbed trucks.

(I generally prefer book and magazine illustrators to \\"classic\\" artists.) But I'm a bit puzzled why this book even exists. Some of the works illustrated are repeated with no explanation, some of those discussed at some length in the text are never illustrated at all, and the captions often misinterpret Rockwell's obvious (and long-recognized) themes or intentions. And there are more than a few typos and misspellings. If you want only one large pictorial treatment of Rockwell's seven decades of work, this ain't it. Instead, go with one of Thomas Buechner's several classic treatments from the 1970s, all of which have been reprinted several times -- and which Sonder himself even recommends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tactical RPG yet for Sega CD","review":"This is a must have item for any Sega CD game player or collector, easily worth the price of the most modern games.

Yusuf's faith very evident...yet songs speak to all faiths --or consciences-- for the most part. Not the same fiery Cat Stevens we knew. Subdued. Songs he might play and sing by himself, making them up as he goes, on his patio/porch. Instrumentals carry diluted flavors of past. Because of who he is/was, I couldn't help but to try to interpret meaning accordingly. Good thoughts, simple songs. Enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle music from a gentle man...","review":"Let me start off by saying that if you are expecting a Cat Stevens recording, you might be disappointed in this cd. Obviously there are many similarities; however, there are many differences as well. Yes, there are some religious overtones to a number of songs on this cd, but as I see it, this is a true artist expressing his true sense of being.Would I listen to these songs if they weren't sung by the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens? Probably not.I do, however, recommend this cd, but only to true die-hard fans. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is just new to Yusuf/Cat. Those recommendations are reserved to the albums of the 70s.Peace out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Study in Aging","review":"It might not be such a good idea that Amazon is selling An Other Cup along with The Best of Cat Stevens. The comparisons are inevitable. If you are looking for Cat Stevens, you will not find him in An Other Cup. Gone is the vigorous, forceful, rock and roll voice; the searching lyrics and staccato delivery. Instead, on An Other Cup you find a pleasant and melodious delivery of lyrics that reflect the complacency and self-asssuredness of middle age. Yusuf seems to have found his truth, love, and some degree of happiness, but it doesn't translate into universal themes that draw the listener in. More than anything, this CD is a study in aging.I wish he had done a remake of \\"Father and Son\\", with the now older Yusuf singing a duet with his younger Cat Stevens self. Now THAT would have been interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for the remakes","review":"It does appear that Yusuf has found a peace in his life and in his music, but at the expense of the power and excitement of that I listened to continually throughout my college career and later. I purchased the cd after reading the glowing reviews but was disappointed after listening. With the exception of some remakes, all of the songs sounded very similar and fairly bland. One reviewer noted that the music got better for him, but I don't think I am motivated enough to listen too many more times in hopes of that solution. I SO love this man's music and this cd just doesn't measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the same","review":"I remember Cat Stevens as the poet of lyrics and yes the fast moving words to remember. Even though he tried to use some olden songs and jazz them up, it just didn't have the same feel. I knew it would not be as it was 20 plus years ago, but I was hoping for some of the same caliber of celebration songs or even a \\"banapple gas\\" type would be good. I found neither much. Although mellow and lyrically ok, nothing of the excitement of \\"catch bull at four\\". I will keep it and play if from time to time, but only because I don't have cd's of the others I have in album form. Sorry Cat, your meow was more ow to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm happy for him, glad for those who like it, but.....","review":"....but...I'm sad to give it just these two stars. I agreed with one of the other two-star commentators. The music is complacent. Pleasant, reasonably well-crafted, but really lacking in the bold uniqueness of vision that Cat brought to his early work. I was really hoping the spiritual focus of his life - and the public attention he garnered in \\"coming out\\" to the world as a convert to Islam at a time when many Westerners look at Islam with distrust and disdain - would give the music a quality of depth and insight that the best of his past work, as I remember it, held. Instead, he sings in the last song: \\"let the wind blow hard, I don't mind.\\" The songs feel disconnected from the world into which he's sending them out. Perhaps his other Yusuf CD's are different, but I'd imagined more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Uplifting Music","review":"The more I listen to \\"Another Cup\\", the more I like it. In a time where music has become so commercialized and empty of real meaning, it is refreshing to hear someone who sings from the heart. Yusuf is all the better for infusing his life experience and wisdom in his lyrics. The CD is non-political, and its beautiful simplicity invites us to contemplate another perspective.Although \\"One Day at a Time\\" is slow and may require a certain mindset to appreciate, \\"The Beloved\\" and \\"Green Fields, Golden Sands\\" are so beautiful that they more than justify purchasing this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Gift !","review":"Joy. Beauty. Optimism. Peace. Not-so-subtle-jabs at his critics. Faith and Discovery of course. These are what Yusuf sings about on this album, and he does it so very well. This is a superb album and a refreshing return of a voice and spirit so badly needed in the music world. The album offers quite a variety. The couple poem-style pieces certainly have their place (though not in the car, heh). \\"Light\\" is good and fun to hear again, but drones a bit in places (reminiscent of some Arabic music). Heaven/True Love, on the other hand, is simply a perfect, jazzy song with pop hooks and Cat's familiar riffs. Some folks seem down on his rendition of \\"Misunderstood\\" but I think it's brilliant. I love this album more every time I listen to it and can only imagine the possibility of a tour ?...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back...You've been missed!","review":"I was a long time fan of \\"Cat Stevens\\" in the past and had the joy of seeing him in concert in 1975 in my early 20s...probably the last concert he gave before his conversion and giving up the years of touring. After reading positive reviews of his album \\"An Other Cup\\" (now recording as Yusuf) and purchasing it, I am ecstastic that he has returned to the wider music audience than to those he was recording after his conversion. I love, love, love, this CD and if it was in his old vinyl format of yester-year, the grooves would have been worn off by now! Thanks for coming back to a wider audience. You've always been filled with a spiritual gift, and I am greatly appreciative of you deciding to play to a wider audience than you have for many years. I look forward to more fine albums from you. WELCOME BACK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Other Cup? An Other Winner!","review":"He's back! A wonderful CD, marking a long awaited retun of Yusuf. Anyone who ever cared for Cat Steven's music should buy this limited edition CD. It showcases his music and his artwork. You will not be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Out the Cat!","review":"Never mind the weak material here. Cat's made that work before (remember \\"Izitso?\\") just on the basis of his great, passionate vocals. Remember that ragged edge to his voice pre-Islam? GONE. Remember the omnipresent, \\"Ohh--Ohhh--Oh-Awww!\\" he used to moan after every line? GONE.Instead you get something that sounds like his quiet voice (\\"Child with the Moon and Stars on His Head\\") material, but more polite. Like a Sunday school teacher would sing.In short: Moood shallow, mood shallow...Footsteps in the dogcrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little Too late","review":"Cat ..errrr... Yusuf \\"the magnificent\\" Islam, is nothing but a 1970's throw-back. His music hasn't moved an inch but people with working brains have moved on.There's nothing new here. Except for \\"Heaven (Where True Love Goes)\\". That stands alone as a powerful and beautiful song. Otherwise, the rest of the album has the same rhythm but with a much weaker voice than what we heard from the real Cat Stevens back so many years ago. He was a great musician until he gave it all up to participate in his in new found religion.I wouldn't waste money on his new stuff. Check out his old music and you'll see what a great musician he once was."},{"rating":"1","title":"One cup was one too many","review":"He's not Cat Stevens , so he should not be making recordings anymore. He gave up 'materialistic' decadent music decades ago, so he should make no more, and live the rest of his life in total obscurity. Changing your name only works if you stay in the same field. Total hypocracy using the mass media to spread his beliefs. Any cup he makes now should be just real tea that he and his fellow believers drink. These are just bitter dregs. and anybody who buys into his scam deserve the dregs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cup o' Plenty","review":"I found the music on this CD to be familiar in sound and yet possessing a different presence from Yusuf (formerly Cat Stevens). His sounds and messages are more serene, less troubled than Cat's, garnering the same beauty and simplicity that his older songs had. No one can write an absolutely simple song with such beauty except for Yusuf without sounding cheesy (as some critics have accused him of being on this new endeavor - -there is nothing \\"cheesy\\" about this CD!!). I hope you all enjoy hearing from the \\"Cat\\" again for the first time in 28 years as much as I have, though clearly he is Yusuf Islam now, and his music reflects his inner peace and serenity. His voice is as gentle, kind and soothing as ever. A hint of maturity can be found. You need not be religious to enjoy the beauty of his vocals, the rich orchestration, and spiritual lyrics. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Back","review":"Yusuf (Cat Stevens) is back, and since Tea for the Tillerman, I have waited for an album that speaks to the soul from the first track to the last, and many bands and artisits have tried, but always fell shy of the accomplishment; Yusuf has just shown us that when your heart is full of divine love, it spills over into everything you do, and in this case we have again 1 complete album that talks to the soul through and through. Thanks Yusuf"},{"rating":"1","title":"middle of the road to nowhere","review":"This new record proves once again the importance of clever arrangements and real live musicians. Steven/Yusuf's music was blessed with them and I still love to listen to his music from the 70's. 'An other cup' is another story - in the end I was just bored. Too average to give away as a gift, it lingers on my shelfs. Can't recommend at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard headed woman","review":"Long have I waited for somenew new from such a passionate and joyful entertainer!

As big fan starting back with \\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" loving all of the 1st 4 albums, having really enjoyed \\"A is for Allah\\", and even the little clips I heard of this new album sounded good. But,\\"An Other Cup\\" is unlistenable.Lacking the simple pure devotional, genuine presence of \\"A is for Allah\\" and without the clever lyrics and heartfelt angst of Cat's early work.His voice is good, surprising solid, but these lyrics are so awful, so droll, boring, I will not be listening to this album for a long time, not until i forget how much of a waste it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"new Cat Stevens CD","review":"Was happy he came out with a new one after all these years, but it wasn't what I was hoping for or expected. My opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat Lost His Muse When He Overreacted to A Traumatic Event and Brainwashed Himself","review":"This album is evidence that although the man that once was Cat Stevens retains his vocal ability and the ability to play music, his extreme religious zealotry (born of an overreaction to almost drowning) has killed the thing that made his work special art, the empathy and appreciation that life is all about the struggle, is gone. We only have true inner peace,Yusuf, when we are dead -- but isn't life also a gift to be savored? Isn't the very essence of life about the highs and lows, sorrow, anger, love, joy, and relating to and sympathizing with your fellowman/woman's struggles and having compassion for human frailties. The music on this album sound like the work of a bland, brainwashed person that is \\"so above it all\\" that he is in fact the walking dead. Please, Yusuf, your muse is a gift from above, recapture it and your humanity --- LET THE CAT OUT OF THE BAG!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat Steves \\"Yusef\\" returns","review":"This CD was amazing.

I love because I have missed his voice, and even tho his politics have changed, his soul remains intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and sweet cup to enjoy","review":"How nice to see Cat/Yusuf feel right about singing again. The songs are sweet and smooth. I give it 4 stars because I am comparing this to his high level. Midday, Heaven/Where true love goes, Misunderstood and In the End are my favorites. His quality, that he has not lost, is to make the words and melodies sound so natural almost easy when you hear them. It is only when you listen to other music that you realize how special this quality is. I hope more albums come...you can tell he has found a sort of peace with himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!!!","review":"This is the old Cat Stevens but even better with age.the lyrics and the mdelodies are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rose is still a rose... a cat is still a cat","review":"Don't be turned off by any of the bad press about Yusuf aka Cat Stevens.

Worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad Cat is Back","review":"I have always been a big Cat Stevens fan, and was sorry to see him disappear for so long. This is a worthy return, nice mellow melodies with hints of the old Cat - distinctive riffs and piano that reminds you of the old days."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolute Cat-astrophe","review":"As a lifelong Cat Stevens fan, I have spent the past two weeks listening to my Cat collection in preparation for this exciting release. Utter disappointment is all that awaits even a half-hearted fan. The lyrics are thinly veiled religious metaphors, the instrumentals are lethargic and simplistic and, at best, the vocals are weak and monotonous. The only aspect of this CD, which faintly resembles my beloved Cat, is the illustration in the liner notes which conjures memories of \\"Buddha and the Chocolate Box.\\" As much as it pains me to write a negative review about one of my favorite musical artists, I have to let other fans know...set your expectations low, this one's going to hurt. Oh, and let's not forget the two tracks which are merely spoken word. If I wanted a spiritual revelation, I would shop in the New Age section! Do \\"yusuf\\" a favor, and skip this disappointing comeback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment!","review":"Like other reviewers, I am a huge Cat Stevens fan and was thrilled to hear this was coming out. But not only are the songs weak, but even his voice doesn't sound very good -- in fact, he frequently sounded shaky and off-key to me. Even the best song was only decent, not great, and its main merits were good background orchestration, mixing and production, rather than good songwriting and singing by him! As someone else said, the lyric-writing seemed lazy, frequently just repeating the same line monotonously. I would have thought his record label would want his \\"comeback\\" to be a powerhouse, rather than this perfunctory and lame disc. I hope he does better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"How I've missed Cat Stevens, and how I looked forward to this album as a chance to reconnect. From the reviews, I expected something of the old musical spirit, but the songs are forgettable, the arrangements uninspired, and most disappointing of all, the voice is weak. He sings all the songs in a half-whisper, and even sometimes a bit off tune. I will probably not play it again, but will return to the exciting and moving earlier albums, with the strong, passionate voice he sang in then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie from Mpls","review":"this was not good, in fact I gave it away after many plays, His voice is still great but he needs some one else to write his songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not something new?","review":"After 30 years of being a Cat Stevens fan, I expected something wonderfully new and touching. Instead, I found revisitations of old stuff with an orchestral back-up, and not nearly enough of his sweet voice and guitar. The entire thrust of this album is \\"Yeah, I'm spiritual, and I've got a girlfriend.\\" It took him 30 years to find that out? Paleeeeze...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the old Cat Stevens - Too religious","review":"I bought this album with the hopes of adding to my Cat Stevens collection. I was dissappointed with the album in two ways. While Yusuf still has the voice of Cat Stevens, I felt like the music was more simplistic than my favorite Cat Stevens songs and I felt like I was being quietly preached to by YUSUF in almost every song.I wanted Cat Steven's music, not a religious sermon. I wish I had not purchased this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"YuSuck","review":"YuCat: 28 years of waiting for this? Dude--you've lost that magic touch! Very disappointing.

This CD is a huge dissapointment... My Rach collection spans some 10 disks, and this is the first that I will get rid of.To start off with, the audio quality of the first peice (Sonata #2) is horrendous. I am sure that there is a recording of this sonata that doesn't hiss so much. The quality of audio gets better with the preludes, but some of the interpretations come out of left field.This disk surprised the pants off me, since I own the Van Cliburn Debussy and Brahms, both of which I find to be top quality and highly recommended.

Why would it work on one type of growth and not the other? Millions of people have medical procedures--or die--each year just they haven't bought a tape from Wizell yet...As a teacher, I've worked with young people who imagined success and suffered terrible pain and disillusionment.

When people from White Gryphon go and meet the Black Kings they wind up in a mess of rules, regulations and protocol. This book is all about politics and has a very weak plot. It is like a third rate movie sequel. I usually love Lackey's work but she misses on this one. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Plot","review":"The White Gryphon was excellent in that it turned away a bit from the action of all of Lackey's previous novels.

I did not like this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action","review":"The scenes of battles between the rogues/wraiths and Zinj's forces are amazing, much like the first few books in the series.However, the author has taken the liberty of turning this into a 90210 dating fest, with almost every single character now having a lover, usually another squadron member - which is VERY annoying. We could do without the cheesy love stories and have more action and character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book is a good book.

This book has it all--nonstop action, humour, excitement, romance. Just as Wraith Squadron focused on Kell, Iron Fist on Face, Solo Command focuses on Myn Donos. The situation with Lara is resolved. Also, see how Wedge gets his revenge on Wes Janson. After reading this book, you'll never look at an Ewok the same way again!!

The plot was good, the characters were well developed, and it was exciting. I loved how the rogues and Wraiths worked together, and Squeaky and Chewie make a great combo. The reason I gave Solo Command only four stars is this: I felt the end could of been better.

There's not a sentence that doesn't fit. Every word is in exactly the right place and contributes to the whole, and yet the writing is so restrained and understated that you have no sense of the author's presence, but only of his many, extraordinarily vivid characters. The plot is the least interesting part of the book, but still it hooks you. The book, like life, has its melodramatic moments, but also moments of humor and lots of sympathetic insight into a host of interesting people trying, with varying degrees of success, to make the best of their lives. The abiding feeling left by the book is not the cliched angst of urban hopelessless, etc. etc., but something far more positive and difficult to describe, because the world of this book is far too complex and finely-drawn to be summarized in any string of adjectives.

Every single time I read it again; it makes me ask myself what I pursue, what am I after in this life? What am I directing my goals and energies at? What goals do I want to achieve and what occupies my mind... Success, financial power, career, esteem, fame, house, car, whatever feeds my ego? It feels like there is a written list in my hand, given/imposed by my family and the surrounding community telling me what I should do and what not, what is good, what is evil. This book made me realize that I am not living the life I choose; I am entirely blocked from the truth and a perfect role-player, acting in an apish manner. \\"Universal Mysteries\\" is one of the pinnacle books of Sufi Author \\"Ahmed Hulusi\\" that changed my personal perspective on life, on the meaning of human being.

The author accurately explains every detail of the universal system that we are living in. When you finish the book, while feeling the glory of your being in the whole universe, you also realize that there is still much to learn and practise as a seeker of your true being. The book also gives perfect knowledge and understanding about how life exposes itself in different dimensions and the reflections of it into our existence.

Listening to this CD is like having a peaceful, meaningful talk with an old friend whom you love and with whom you feel very familiar. The producers of this album managed to make it interesting (rather than boring) and also keep it peaceful and relaxed throughout, eliminating the irritation of being jolted by loud, abrasive passages in otherwise pleasant music. The songs selected for this album are varied enough to be interesting and make me feel like humming along to some especially beautiful passages. I use it at loud volume to perk up my morning walk, and at a lower volume as background music when we have company, and as peaceful music I can listen to if others in my family are sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great readings","review":"What I like about this recording is that they are all by interpreted by one artist--Gerhard Oppitz.

I ordered it because I knew the author, Harvey C. Parker was involved in CHADD, a support group for parents of children with ADD. This book does a good job covering the basics, but if you are already an educated parent about ADD and strategies, it offers nothing new or advanced. I'd say this book might be helpful for a parent who has a child aged 4-6, and who knows very little about ADD. The sticker charts in the book are definitely geared toward younger children. One example: there is a \\"Good Bedtime Behavior\\" chart with a picture of a bed with a teddy bear on it. There are ten circles on the headboard/footboard of the bed to put stickers on for behaving at bedtime. Definitely not for my ten year old boy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"After one day the switch broke. We had not turned it the wrong way and had not handled it roughly.

I gave one to my mother and hers did the same thing. I ended up ditching it and bought a counter top model by Aquafina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The Other Choices","review":"I really like this: water tastes great (ours has heavy clorine taste unfiltered); filter lasts us 6 months; easy to install and even easier to replace the filter -- just like a light bulb); the unit is not as bulky over the sink as other models I've tried; it is certified to filter out more bad stuff than any other product.For those who prefer a pitcher with filter, this is a much better choice. You can fill GLASS bottles with filtered water from the tap and keep them in the frig. No more fresh water sitting around in plastic jugs, which have their own odors and chemical break-down problems.The only negatives: filters are not as easily found as other brands; Amazon's price is not competitive for the replacement filters, but is the best for the initial unit, especially when they frequently have a promotional offer for Waterpik purchases (check \\"Today's Deals\\", then click \\"Health and Personal Care\\" to see if Waterpik is listed -- usually every 2 or 3 months)."},{"rating":"1","title":"breaks down fast","review":"I wanted to love this unit. Filtratrion/price was excellent by the books. But first, the green light that's supposed to change to red when it's time to change the filter never did anything but blink green. Then the automatic return to unfiltered water switch stopped working, but that was OK to switch back and forth manually. Then, the cartridges didn't last as long as they were supposed to - beware the expensive razor blade. Finally, the thing started spewing little streams of pressurized water out the back and sides of the cartidge. Hope I can find a decent unit elsewhere, I'm done with this one. It did do a good job of filtering the water though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit regular faucet","review":"I bought a new Moen faucet and tried to attach this filtration system.

I tried to install it and it seemed impossible. I wrote to the seller and they claimed it was so easy. I put it back in the box, and waited months till I just moved, and tried to install it at my new place. It is missing the part the adapts to the faucet, so it's worthless. Furthermore, it doesn't filter our fluoride, which is a poison. (If you don't know this, look at on your toothpaste tube--says if you ingest fluoride, to call poison control. Or watch some youtube videos about fluoride.) So with shipping and handling, I spent about $35 and it will be going in the trash. How hard is it to ship all the parts when there's only about 5 of them? Also, the directions are just drawings, so good luck figuring them out even if you get all the parts.

Spray it on an ALL NATURAL cotton pad and swipe it all over my face in an upward movement, one section of the face at a time. After you do this, LOOK at the cotton ball, you won't believe your eyes.My advice, be gentle when using it on your face. Don't swipe the cotton pad harshly over your face. Devote some time to your face, it's the first thing people see and last, give the product TIME to work! Don't use it once or twice and then decide it is not for you. At least three weeks.

I am writing to AMC and TV Guide to let them know that their names are used on the packaging of this shoddy item. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I would also advise everyone to avoid buying anything else from \\"Genius Entertainment/Classic Cartoons\\" as they are probably just as poorly made.

The first half of the book is agonizingly slow because of this, and when Abel does finally make his return the book remains very slow during the Utgard chapters.

The author makes you feel like you don't know your a__ from a hole in the ground when you finish this, and the reason why is basically there is no plot or if there is one it changes from chapter to chapter. UGGGH, do not waste your time on this. Awful.... I felt nauseated when I finished because I was really hoping for at least a sub-par finish, and got nothing.

I could not get a single one done, even after 15 minutes of cranking. All four kids (my kids had two playmates over) were quite disappointed, because all they got was a spoonful each.My arm was sore for a whole day after, just from getting four kids a spoonful.I don't remember it being this difficult when I was a kid.

In either case, it's not worth a full book outlining who wrote what when.And the book itself has problems: 1) it fails to make a convincing case that the argument is important; 2) It contains an unexplained foray into complexity theory that seems unrelated to the task at hand; and 3) Large blocks of text are written is very short, repetitive sentences reminiscent of a sixth grade textbook. In short, save your money and read Darwin's Ghost by Steve Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't see the forest for the trees?","review":"Morris' book is just another example of the worthless rhetoric that is put forth surrounding the controversial subject of evolution. Evolution, outside of limited variation, is NOT a fact. This book is dripping with ignorance. Invest your money in a coloring book - it's much more educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice except for odor","review":"The screen works smoothly and once you get used to the mechanism it's fairly easy to get it to stop where you want and retract when you want. My only complaint is that the screen has a very strong diesel-like odor that will stink you out of the room. You don't notice it when the screen is retracted, but pull it down and hold your nose. I have tried airing it out, but it still has a strong odor. I expect it to go away with time, but make sure you keep the room ventilated in the meantime unless you want a major headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information","review":"I'm surprised this book received so many high reviews.

As an anthropologist, Chavez should know better than to let bias enter into any of his work. When he does explain the other side of the coin, he portrays Americans as irrationally hating the migrants, even when the quotes he uses explain the contrary. It had great potential, but fell tragically short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clerical error","review":"Reading this book I could not get past the fact that my own parents stories are far more compelling. My father fleeing the communist Rushkies and my mother joining him from Italy. Proud hard working people who embraced America. Learning to read, write and work here as well as teaching themselves to drive. Both have told me that they would never have come here illegally. My father fled Lithuania due to persecution under threat of imprisonment but still would not have come here illegally. How could he flee lawlessness only to enter a country by breaking the law? The writer and readers of these books can't grasp this type of character and courage.They hide from the truth by using terms like undocumented workers. Leaving the incorrect impression that their lack of citizenship is only a clerical error. Decieving only themselves. My parents are the real thing and those who enter under a cloak of darkness are mere law breakers no matter how you spin the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Using","review":"I am an avid seamstress and follow difficult patterns on a regular basis, but these are almost impossible to interpret properly. The \\"pattern\\" has very few markings for good instruction and the instructions are NOT easy to follow, even with a lot of sewing experience. There are no helpful diagrams in the book to look at or follow. Also, the projects in the book are common sense items and can easily be thought of on ones own. If you want something that will give you good patterns to follow for dog toys, clothes, costumes, etc. Go to Wal-mart, Hancock Fabrics or a similar store and purchase multiple \\"real\\" patterns that will be much easier to follow and ready to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Money","review":"I payed around $48.00 for this and it wasn't worth it!

If these pieces could be easily found elsewhere, on albums with more continuity, then this disc wouldn't be worth buying. But probably 40% of the material on this cd can't be found in print, to my knowledge. In particular, the Mompou, Mozart, Llobet, Aguado, Henze, and Diabelli tracks aren't readily available elsewhere as of early 2003. Several of these tracks are nice hefty 6-7 minute pieces. In particular, the beautiful Andante from Diabelli's Sonata, arranged by Bream himself, is worth the purchase price by itself. If you're a Bream fan trying to get beyond his half-dozen easily available cds, add this to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar music","review":"This is an amazing CD.

All I had to do to change from left swing to right swing handle was remove a screw and flip the latch around.

It is broken down into simple small chapters for the woman on the go who doesn't have much time to read long and lengthy chapters. I also read this book again with my Bible Study group using the accompanying Bible Study DVD and Participants Guide.

Very refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall More in Love with Jesus","review":"It's no suprise that Lysa Terkeurst would write a book that's compelling, authentic, and filled with ways to help women fall deeper in love with Jesus. That's who Lysa is in whatever she does--whether that's leading a ministry, directing a conference, connecting with blog readers, or appearing on Oprah. Her book is written from the heart with honesty that will make you laugh out loud and passion for Jesus that will draw you deeper into a grace-filled relationship with Him. Lysa combines personal stories with practical ways of connecting with Christ--all with solid biblical foundations. This book would be a fabulous choice for personal use, gifts, or women's ministries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Do For Small Groups","review":"If you are looking for a new fresh Bible study for your small group Bible study, then I highly recommend Lysa TerKeurst's new book, Becoming More Than a Good Study Girl. One of things that I liked most was the easy conversational tone of the book. Every single chapter brought a moment of reflection and made me think through some of the assumptions that I have always believed.This book made me want to move beyond mediocre faith and move into a deeper relationship with Jesus. Yup, it challenged me to be more than a good Bible study girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real application for real women","review":"In this book Lysa meets women where we are right now in the hard places of life. It is not enough to just do the right things in life. The Lord has so much more for us. He wants a relationship with us that is more than us going through the motions. Lysa does not candy coat the events that the Lord has seen her through and the things that she has learned walking through these places. This is a real life book for real life women. I am recommending this book to all the ladies in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfu small group study!","review":"I did this book and accompanying DVD with a small group of young women (ages 18-30). It is very conducive to a small group study and is very challenging in the content. Lysa does a fabulous job of making herself very real and transparent to those who are reading her books. You feel like you have made a new friend. This book and DVD has prompted our small group to start digging in to God's word and really studying it. It also encouraged us to walk out what we have learned in our daily lives and share with others, especially teen girls in our church youth group. I am looking forward to Lysa's next book, whatever it may be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is so hard to put down!!","review":"I am really not a reader.

Becoming More than a Good Bible Study Girl is so much more than just a book, it is a conversation. A real woman who lives a life and has great advice to give.

This DVD is a great one to start with before going to Slim & Lean, which is much more physically demanding. Jari's style is great; she is neither perky nor condescending. This DVD will certainly push all exercisers (there are modifiers for all level), and it provides the number of calories you are actually working off, as well as the suggested weight loads for all exercisers. Note, however, that it is challenging. You do a substantial amount of repetitions for each exercise, increasing your heartrate and strength. You will need a step and dumbbells. I encourage you to go with a lesser weight than you might have been using with other exercise videos given the number of repetitions. My only criticism is that after awhile this might become somewhat boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Ripped dvd","review":"This is my favorite Ripped dvd, and also the first one I bought.

I have this and \\"Get Ripped\\" and I really enjoy the workouts. Jari's voice is soothing, which I like, and she is very supportive while she talks you through the workout. The people in the workout are all doing the exercises at different ability levels and you are told to modify the workout to your own abilities and comfort level. I especially like that she counts the reps out loud so you don't have to look at the TV to make sure you're keeping up! I used Cathe something-or-other's video and hated it and sold it.

The one big problem with the new Life Line gym is, they have shortened the length of the bands by about a foot. this makes it harder to perform over head exercises well with heavier bands. I do like the the new handles that are interchangable, so you can vary the band size for specific exercises, or body parts.Over all, I still give the life line gym a 4 star rating. One because of the great price. And two, because you can get as serious with it as you can handle.

He misses many details, and provides only scant material asto why the Crown ever started the campaign. The biographies of the leaders are good, as is his treatment of the Whig vs. Tory struggle in NC and SC. Overall, however, the author breaks no new ground and failed to use some obvious (and readily available) primary sources. Why no American accounts of the Seige of Charleston?

I also don't like that they have whey in them, whereas the other Greens+ bars are vegan. I can't recommend these. For extra protein, you would be better off with a handful of peanuts.

I like that they are circuit training with compound moves that work multi-muscle groups at once mixed in with some cardio to really kick up the metabolism.I like that they are broken up into segments so you can mix and match based on time.Some of the moves are challenging, but she doesn't have you doing them so long that it feels unbearable. You get a great burn. You can go at your own pace as she does have one exerciser doing modify movements.If you enjoy any of her other videos you will enjoy this. Some other instructors I enjoy are Kelly Coffee Meyer, Cathe Friedrich, Christi Taylor, Crunch Dance of The Inches, Jazzercise Burlesque."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superbody workout is a super disappointment","review":"Tracey Mallett is a talented trainer. However, her style doesn't translate well onto dvd. She wears these big palazzo pants that are very distracting and makes it hard to see the proper movement. It is obvious to tell that her team is not in sync and they don't reallly know each other ... it affects your mood & how well you engage with the workout. I purchased this dvd looking for a high intensity, fat burning workout. I did not work up much of a sweat at all. I followed the high reviews for this dvd and was seriously disappointed. My favorites right now at home are Crunch Boot Camp and Women's Health Total Workout in Ten ... I would highly recommend those dvds.

Sort of a loose concept LP in two movements: Older Than Ancient (Part1) and Younger Than New (Part2). There's some sharp guitar work from John Naylor, and the bass and drums are particularly tight, especially on the more driving songs with an upbeat, jazzy swing like \\"Dear Friends\\" and \\"Child of Peace\\". The liberal use of vibes and the spiritual themes in the lyrics give it a dated \\"hippie-ish\\" atmosphere. The vocals are not particularly distinctive (which is the main weakness), but there's enough complexity of composition to please lovers of early art rock. As an album, it holds together nicely, with a great deal of consistency. It alternates between quiter, melodic passages and more guitar and organ driven rock. Overall, a very satisfying example of American progressive rock of the period. The CD reissue reproduces the great original album cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deadly Venom will poison your ears with wondeful Lyrics","review":"The Deadly Venom album is a cold album with 4 females that love to rap .

Beautiful design.","review":"I read all the reviews and, since Sony has stopped production, decided to buy this expensive toy before it disappears from the market. The sound is excellent (I listen to classical music and opera,) even if the player is connected to AA battery-powered, cheap Sony speakers (SRS-T55). The Sony MZ-RH1 is small, easy to operate, and very elegant looking. I agree, Sonic Stage software is hard to use; however, I have figured out ways of working around some of the problems other people have mentioned in their reviews. I'll be glad to share this information in another forum.I have owned two older Sony Net MD and HiMD walkmans, both still work. The oldest one, bought five years ago, had an input jack and I was able to record my classical music tapes on minidiscs. Unfortunately I gave it away. Now I'll be able to transfer the rest of my old tapes to minidiscs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for transfers, not so great for editing and recording","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this unit at long last allows for the ability to transfer any minidisc to the computer. I really have to ask, though, why should we be so impressed and amazed by that? That feature should have been available all along.I have used many older MD, Net-MD, and Hi-MD recorders. This unit lacks the great \\"track wheel\\" of older models and has only a one-line display, so editing and moving between tracks and into folders is much more difficult than older bigger-display models. It also seem to have no option for an external battery pack.For recording, it works fine, although the T-mark button is poorly made and difficult to depress cleanly.In conclusion, I would recommend the older Hi-MD models, which also allow for transfer of at least Hi-MD recordings to the computer, over this newer model. The only benefit to this model is if you have lots of old minidiscs you need to pull onto the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The interface is difficult to use, the recording quality is actually worse than my 10 year old minidisc, it doesn't record to mp3, so you'll waste a lot of time importing in WAV and converting to MP3. The storage size is great, but navigating the contents is an incredible hassle compared to an ipod.That said, this is still great for line-in recording. So far I've recorded several things with my 50 dollar sony microphone, and they've all had horrible clipping. I might buy a better a microphone, but I'm kinda thinking whats the point. The interface is downright terrible with literally a button on each side of the device.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired version of larks tongue!!!","review":"Strongest recording in years!

This, however, is a pretty radical shift. Adrian sings a cappella on 'snippets' (albeit with his vocals run through a vocodor) and 'Crimson Blues' appears here from their last tour as \\"Potato Pie.\\" A nice thundering live version of Larks Tongue Part 4 rounds this out. The standouts, though, in my opinion, are the title track, the lyrics of which are hilarious, and the little bits at the end, where... well, you know. Just listen past when the last track is supposed to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"In one word: disappointing. I don't know why they bothered to release this CD. While the title track is pretty cool, the rest of the tracks are rather pointless throwaways. Belew goes overboard with rather trite-sounding angelic vocal effects. Eyes Open Wide is an interesting tune, but why Larks Tongues Part 4 yet again? I bought this at the same time as Heavy ConstruKction, and HC is great, while this disc blows. I hope this EP is not representative of the new upcoming KC release. Looks like KC hit their peak and are on the downhill side. Bummer since I have been a huge fan since the Bruford/Wetton days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"I knew these guys when I was in High School. I will still sit down and listen to this album a multitude of times a year. They stay there because if you listen to the album, no one song is unrelated to another. They run in triads, duos, and ridiculously awesome sets. It sounds like it is a concert constantly building and crumbling under it's own weight but then lifting itself up each time it is reborn to a new, and higher height.A truly excellent album from the NorthWest."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isnt even listenable","review":"I think The Ataris are better than this band. And I hate the Ataris, a lot. Theres probably 50,000 local pop punk bands across the country that sound exactly like this band.

The playing seems just effortless, and the chiming sounds of the recorder at the start are amazing. The selection of instruments used also gives this a pleasantly rounded sound.I have quite a bit of Teleman, but the Paris quartets stand out for me, and although I like all three volumes in this series of the quartets by Florilegium, this is my favourite. Quite stunning.Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not representative of the others","review":"This was the first Travis McGee book I read -- it's recommended as one of the best 100 mysteries by Keating -- and it really turned me off. McGee comes across as bloodthirsty and hyperviolent; not at all the sympathetic character he is in the other books. Luckily I read another McGee book and found out that The Green Ripper is not representative of the series. If, like me, you pick this book up because of Keating's recommendation, all I can say is I haven't a clue why Keating selected this as one as the best. He also choose The Blue Hammer as one of Ross Macdonald's best, when it was definitely his worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"18 of 21: The formula has been perfected.","review":"Travis McGee sets the world straight.

MacDonald is arguably one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century, and the Travis McGee series certainly proves why. His ability to transport the reader to another time and place with just a few short lines is uncanny, and isn't that what escapism fiction is all about? Green Ripper is one of my personal favorites, and I have purchased many different editions over the years as I always seem to be loaning out copies that never make their way back home to me.

But after I set up my PS3 properly, everything was great. I use component cables and leave the resolution on 1080i. It plays DVDs and games with a wonderful picture with no problems. I use an HDMI cable to hook my HD STB and that looks great also. The picture is great at all resolutions except when hooked up to analog cable, then there is a lot fuzz. My only real gripe is that there is NO audio out. I think that is something that all TV's should have. Other than that, I am very pleased with this product and I don't think that there are any other comparable products with these features at this price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Communism is not that scary","review":"I liked this book. It made me think that people aren't scared of Communism but of what happened in Russia. In Russia it wasn't real communism because everyone wasn't equal.

Everyone is equal isn't that what America was going for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Karl not as much fun as Groucho","review":"I believe that there are two aspects to \\"The Communist Manifesto\\": the extremely intriguing ideas it expresses about the problems of capitalism, and the somewhat impractical way in which it suggests to alleviate those problems. Many of our most cherished institutions are a result of Marxist thought, the problem is that the manifesto is a bit idealistic. Once the bourgeosie overthrows the proletariat, what's to stop the leaders from becoming a new proletariat? Also, Karl Marx wasn't much of a writer but, perhaps due to its influence, \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" isn't nearly as exhausing as some of his subsequent writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BELLYDANCE DVD","review":"A GREAT BELLYDANCE DVD NOT YOUR NORMAL RUN OF THE MILL BELLYDANCE DVD.

Despite all their efforts, I rushed through the music and frequently found myself tensely trying to perfect a move.One night with Jehan's Sacred Bellydance DVD washed all that tension away. It's as if everything my teachers tried to communicate suddenly made sense. Jehan combines tremendous musicality with a deep love for the dance and skill in communicating each move. I find that transitions that long escaped me have become second nature. An added benefit has been extreme stress reduction. Jehan communicates each move through breath, relaxation and pleasure. She is completely comfortable in her body and that comfort proves contagious. Even complicated moves feel like joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite bellydance instructor","review":"I have been a fan of Jehan's for a long time now. I got the honor of taking a few of her workshops, and seeing her dance at events,and in my opinion, she is the best teacher out there. She will teach you more than bellydancing. I love all forms of bellydance, but she takes her dance to another level. You will learn the basics and more here, but she will also bring out your inner goddess. The dvd is simple, but there is no need for special effects, etc. She teaches you so many different moves, and explains them very well. She is mezmerizing to watch, so you may want to watch it once all the way through, before you do it. You will learn alot from this dvd. Well worth every penny. So if you want to learn how to bellydance \\"for real\\" GET THIS DVD. She is a great dancer, and singer. Alot of the music is hers, that is playing in the backround. She will bring out the goddess, temptress, mother, maiden, and crone in you.enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Sydney","review":"I purchased this calendar because I love the show, and because I wanted some more images of Jennifer Garner.

I would suggest as someone else did that you try to pick up the old Corning version from a garage/yard sale if you see them. These new versions are much thinner than the old old ones and as a result have a \\"delicate\\" feel to them.They also have a slightly blue tint to them unlike the orginal clear versions which make me a bit pensive about their durability due to the issues other have had with the blue sets.Corning appears to have licenced their production out to World Kitchen, LLC now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be better","review":"I bought this set a couple of months ago when I moved into my new house. I can't be happier with them. They are very sturdy and easy to clean. And they actually look very good that I even use them as serve bowls to put on dinner table. This price...I can't ask for more. I bought more pyrex glass stuff after that. They are a bit heavy to use. But once you get used to it, it's no problem at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy work bowls for mixing","review":"I have variety of glass bowls for holding my measured ingredients prior to use. \\"Mise en place\\" as the French say. But those bowls are lighter, and whereas they might be able to handle vigorous mixing, these Pyrex bowls are proven workhorses.This is my second set of these bowls - not from breakage - but rather from wanting plenty ready to go when preparing multiple dishes when I don't want to wash them in between! I'd definitely recommend them and give them 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hitch","review":"Great product. Looks well built and heavy duty. Installation took a little longer than I thought.

My only gripe about this hood is that the mount was off a bit, and the hood is about 1 or 2 degrees off. This doesn't make a difference in it's function at all, just a nit-picky thing. It serves both the function of keeping off-axis light out of your lens, and protecting it as well.

Only \\"Emerge,\\" the sound of warped bubbles rising to the surface, is a let down.A warm pulse for background listening, an engaging release that doesn't require headphones or a PhD in techno history to appreciate.

There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying \\"Made in China\\" and that's it. The tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact.

It installed really easily and has fine-enough levels of adjustment. It is effective in closing my super-heavy 97 year old oak door. The only flaw is that the two arm pieces hinge together only with a peg and hole - there is no way to tighten the connection. As a result, you have to ensure that they align perfectly otherwise they pop out every time the door opens. I don't know if this is common to all modern door closers as my ancient model had a screw in order to keep this connection secure. Once I readjusted the alignment, it seems to work fine, but be careful when you're planning the installation to save yourself time and drilling new holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Succinct and Informative!","review":"This is a no-nonsense book that discusses everything from a growth plan to building your team to recognizing opportunities to starting a franchise, to name only a few. The book is well organized and the concepts are discussed in a clear and straight forward manner. What this means is that instead of going through the same materials from a thick textbook or a book that is too general, the information is just what you need and is clearly layout as well as easy to find. For the budding entrepreneur i also recommend reading this book in conjunction with Arnold Goldstein's 'Starting On A Shoestring: Building a Business Without a Bankroll' which is really a book that gives practical advice on building and financing a business. Anyway, 'Growing Your Own Business' is a must read for those who are serious about starting and growing a business.

Nothing new here.The only good thing is the presence of Jared Padalecki, known to TV viewers as one of the charismatic stars of the series Supernatural.

I think at this point, if you're watching any Friday the 13th movie, you're watching it for either the boobs or the gore, not the plot. Or at least, that's what the writers were counting on, 'cause there are a whole lotta boobs and a whole lotta gore, but no plot at all. \\"Who's Jason?\\" my mother asked when it was over, that's how thin the mythology was in this one.If you're a die-hard B-movie buff, you'll get a few kicks out of this remake, but if you're a purist--or new to the genre--do yourself a favor and stick with the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE OF THE SAME, NOTHING NEW","review":"Here is a remake or a new rendition of the Friday the 13th movie. Seriously, there is nothing new here. Basically in a nutshell Jason kills and kills and kills and then comes back to life, big surprise. This movie offers no new insight about Jason or where he comes from. There is also no real suspense, just the run of the mill killings and gore. If you liked the other Friday the 13th movies, then you will probably like this one.

There are a few good scenes that add elements from the first 4 four films, but if you want the original lines you are better sticking with the original film from 1980.

It seems in all the haste of the screenwriters to put the first four original Friday movies together, they only made more of a mess of the series begun with Jason Goes to Hell and the God Awful Jason X.I really would have like to see them expand on the Pamela Voorhees angle than just drop Jason in our laps the way that they did. It really would have been in great Friday tradition.I did like the kill sequences, they were quite crafty and kept my attention, but other than that, this movie totally falls flat.I truly hope there is no sequel in the works.

I guess its better than Jason X and Jason Takes Manhattan, but didn't have the seriousness and scares of the early films like the Final Chapter.

Non-talents Michael bay and Marcus Nispel have done it again! This isn't a Friday the 13th movie, this feels more like a sex comedy (and a very bad one at that) with some killing in it.

I feel like the people behind the movie had to show as much nudity they could to keep the viewer's attention and by doing so they made it more like a cheap porn movie than a horror flick. Apparently since \\"sex\\" seems like the theme of the movie, the spotlight was never on Jason, or even if it was, he didn't have much of it.

My advice would be wait until it hits cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrendous","review":"This movie is so bad, I don't know where to begin. I know this series of movies is not Academy Award material, but the previous films were somewhat entertaining. This feels like it was written by a 14 year old. It is moronic beyond description. Now, I have no problem with sex and drugs. Hell, I grew up in the 80's!! But that's all this movie is. Kids getting high, kids having sex, Jason dismembering kids. Not one of them is even remotely sympathetic. You will root for Jason all the way. At least I did. The killing scenes are somewhat well done, and the effects are pretty good. But that is hardly enough to make a good film. Now, I'm not a huge Michael Bay fan, and his company that does all these remakes has churned out some decent films. The new Nightmare On Elm Street comes to mind. That is a pretty good remake. But Friday the 13th??? As Archie Bunker would say: Crapola!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Even for a remake, this is a lousy movie. I'm sure the studio trotted out this old warhorse just to milk some more money out of the series, but they are beating a dead pony.

All the old characters are here: the rich kid, the floosy, the asian nerd, the black rapper, the misunderstood stud on the motorcycle, and of course Jason. There are no surprises and just about any other horror movie is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friday the 13th(2009)","review":"This Friday the 13th remake from 2009 is either a piece of trash or a decent remake depending on your standards. It takes 22 minutes to get to the film's title. The sex scene with Julianna Guill is very dirty for a mainstream movie! Most of the characters are very annoying. There's a lot of scenes of brutality where Jason Voorhees stabs people or smashes them into cars and sharp objects! This film preserves many slasher movie cliches. Still, the movie is photogenic and the acting is decent.You can hear a few seconds of Manfredini's Friday the 13th music score.

I like the remake of such old gems like HALLOWEEN, DAWN OF THE DEAD, and even TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. This can't come close.I was really hoping for Jason to be more in the background, to build up the suspense, but instead we get lame sex scenes and Jason running all over the place like he's a damn realestate agent.I liked a couple of the characters in this flick, more than in previous Fridays, but it was just lacking creepiness.

That's enough now, Jason.Horny, rambunctious kids just can't stay away from Camp Crystal Lake. They never got the memo in the 80s, and apparently not here in 2009. Just like you've seen before (in eight other films remember?) these kids were stabbed, slashed, impaled, and so on and so forth.Every \\"Friday the 13th\\" film has been indistinguishable from the last. So then what's new with the \`09 remake? Other than a modern look, not much. Same old story, same old characters and the same old ending.

I'm not a prude, I understand that for the most part horror movies have some nuidty and sex in them but this was excessive. I think the sex and nudity was a filler because the writer was at a loss for material. You'll notice in other Friday the 13th movies there's like 1-2 scenes of nudity and it's over with and on to the killing and gore. This movie was made for the sake of sex scenes, it was awkward and stupid. The kills were unlike Jason, he never ran like this, he never kept trinkets from his victims. This should have been a completely different movie. Sorry, this is not the Jason I know and adore. 1.5 to 2 stars, if that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect condition","review":"Seller is recommended and thank you for your fast service.Bought this movie for a friend for a early x-mas gift and she liked it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop After the Fourth Cut","review":"This CD is like two EPs stuck together, one good one bad.

Additionally the reverse end is great for cutting through roots if you have to dig a hole. The hammer is well balanced with a comfortable grip, but the lack of recoil is it's best selling point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good for ear-bud headphones","review":"I ordered these for my iRiver H10 and really expected a lot for that price, but what I got was even more than I expected.The looks, the accessories and the oppurtunity to make them really custom as it comes to fitting any ear form, that's fantastic.As it comes to the sound, it is just terrific!!! With the twist-to-fit-system and the sennheiser bass system you get an incredible sound that usually doesn't come with earbud headphones. I am afraid these can compete with big headphones that cover the whole ear; unbelievable:)))And just a minor hint: if you buy these be carefull what you do while wearing them cause the they are hook shaped and they try to get hold on anything around them; if you are not aware of this fact you might easily tear them apart!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"These earphones sound clear without the overdone bass and background noise.

The bass is deep and clear enough to hear all of Flea's intricate lines and all other sounds come at you well balanced and very clear. The design is a bit awkward at first, but once you're used to it, you realize that it allows a snug fit and therefore great sound. The only reason this product doesn't get 5 stars is because one of the main rubber parts came off and got lost easily, which is OK because you have replacements that can substitute. And speaking of parts, customization is good because you really want these buds to fit well to make the most of the quality sound they can provide. The volume control comes in handy too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser Earbuds MXL51","review":"Have used these now for 3 months. Very pleased with the sound quality and snug fit.

But this book got in under my radar with the droll concept and amusing cover. I feel as if someone who looked like they might become a new friend slapped me in the face, not once but repeatedly. I avoid books that signal early on that they will be full of fat jokes or dripping with contempt for fat people. As an author, I think that's the laziest sort of humor--like currying favor with prejudiced people by telling racist or sexist jokes. Let those who find that funny subsidize such humor. This book waited till p. 14 or so of what had been an amusing story, and by p. 47 I was offended enough not to want to read the rest. Life is short. There are many books. I don't have to read books that insult fat women. I won't totally avoid other books by this author, but I will examine them carefully before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This book is a really good read.

Lee Martinez displays a great sense of humor in his first novel. I liked the flow. It was easy to read and the characters were fun to read about. He sort of makes up the rules as he goes along, which makes for a work that doesn't take itself too seriously. The characters are not fully developed, but they don't have to be in this type of light comedy. It kept me reading to find out what was going to happen, and that is what I want from any novel.

First, it's very solid and heavy - much stronger than regular builder grade towel rings. Second, it sticks out further from the wall than other towel rings (which can be a plus or minus depending on personal taste). It's also shiny and doesn't look like it will scratch easily.

If the parent-child relationship has never progressed to an adult-to-adult relationship, then all of the childhood fears of being abandoned will be reactivated, no matter how old the child is.

This is not a recording that does it."},{"rating":"2","title":"creative storyline","review":"This episode's storyline is creative, yes there are the usual gun fights and chase scenes, but all of those scenes are tailored to mesh with a comic book forgery. I thought the little twists on the guns and chases were delightful. And I won't give away the ending but watch until the very last frame, that and the last few minutes are fun if you like comic art. Oh and Colby has an unexpected twist this episode, should be fun to see it emerge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numb3rs Season 4 - Short season - Full price","review":"I love the series and already purchased the first 3 seasons from Amazon. But, since season #4 was an abridged season (writers' strike) and you only get 5 DVDs for @ 720 minutes of viewing why would I want to pay such a high price? I suggest that the cost of season 4 should be discounted by Amazon to account for the reduced quantity of episodes. Even David Krumholtz would agree with these numb3rs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numbers individual show on demand","review":"I bought one show this way, and would not buy any others. I had missed seeing some of the shows during the season and wanted to see how this would go, but the quality was so poor that I did not even watch the entire program.

It is just a bunch of the guys work with a comment for each. It says on the back of the book that it teaches you how to hold a pencil properly which it does not do. The book is pretty much all based on composition not sketching. I'm sending this one back.I have just finished reading \\"The New Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\\" and I totally recomend it. It took about a week to go through. After that week I was about 5 times better than before. No joke, I was totally suprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Silly addition to Slayers","review":"This book contains the Slayers Special micro-episodes 15-21. Other than the last episode being a bit forced with the pseudo-introduction of Amelia, the writing is well above-par for Lina and Naga (with a delightful Pink Floyd reference at the end of episode 18, ta'boot). It's properly formatted manga -- that is, backwards, but you'll get used to it -- and the artwork is generally much better than the misformatted \\"Slayers -- Super Explosive...\\" series (which was the basis for the TV series and therefore a bit boring to those of us who know the series).So if you like to read enjoyably silly manga, this is certainly a worthy addition to the Slayers franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Pilgrim","review":"This is living the pilgrim religion yesterday and today.

If you are serious about your spiritual walk and/or frustrated and confused about keeping the faith and progressing, then \\"The Way of the Pilgrim\\" is full of inspiration and practical guidance. I read the whole thing in a single day and now read from it every morning to start my days. It has, more than any other book, transformed my spiritual life.

Everyone should read this.","review":"If you want to know the truth about the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City, this is the source. The author was one of the eminently qualified people who pursued the study of the bombing and produced this book. It is well researched, well written, and quotes research by many extremely well qualified individuals, including several eyewitnesses and victims of the bombing. The only qualification I would add is that it comprises 364 pages of fine print, with an additional 184 pages of pictures and supporting documentation.You have not read the complete story until you've read this. The \\"official version\\" is nothing like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throughly investigated! Great job!!!","review":"Rep Charles Key really steps up to the plate while investigating the controversial Oklahoma City Bombing. He throughly looks at all aspects and possibilities as to how the bombing could have taken place. He has many official documents to back up all of the text in the book. It is a thorough look at OKC through the eyes of a group of individuals who just want the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. They did this for the victims and I think they did a wonderful job. Great job Charles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Hard Core Fans...","review":"Since we see so little of Tower on conventional media (a head-scratcher for sure) I applaud the Germans for wanting to capture this great band--and if they had some audio folks that understood how to mix, this would be a very exciting disc.As it is, it documents a good performance with a good lineup on the band, but because the audio is so bad (it sounds as tho it was recorded with a cassette recorder at the back of the hall) it really brings the presentation down.I'm a fan, and would rather have something than nothing, but I really can't recommend this as a good representation of one of my favorite all-time bands.Sadly..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour Tower of Power","review":"Being a hard-core fan since the \\"East Bay Grease\\" days, I was thrilled that TOP was finally bringing to market a concert DVD. I've seen them in concert several times going all the way back to when they did a split bill with Cold Blood (still the best concert I have ever been to). Being an owner of Soul Vaccination: Live, I was expecting comparable audio quality and boy was I let down! The producers and mixers of this project should be ashamed of themselves! Not to mention those cheesy graphics that appear after the beginning of each tune. This may be the way they do it in Germany, but drop it for the USA. We know the tune by the third note coming out of the Funky Doctors Sax. I can't believe the boys in the band whole heartily endorse this project. Save your money on this one for the next time TOP is in town or pick up Soul Vaccination: Live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have T.o.P. on DVD","review":"This concert is taken directly from a TV-broadcast from 1998 (hence the slightly cheesy titles in between songs). \\"Ohne Filter\\" was a German TV-show dedicated to showing live performances of blues, jazz, R&B and soul artists, and since none of this is mainstream, the series was produced on a limited budget. Consequently, the visual and sonic quality of this DVD is not immaculate, although I think it is not nearly as bad as some people make it sound. The bonus material is redundant, but that is not what I bought the DVD for.Do not buy this DVD if you are looking for a visually impressive concert dvd, making full use of this medium - you will be disappointed! However, in my opinion it is the music that counts, and Tower of Power deliver what you expect from them, which already makes this DVD wortwhile to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Is The Power?","review":"I was so excited to see Tower was finally going to release a dvd. However , maybe they shouldn't have. The audio is terrible , it is all horns & lead vocals. Drums,keys,guitar,bass & backing vocals are buried in the mix. Save your money. Tower is much stronger than this. If you want to see a great Tower video , check out Francis Rocco Prestia's \\"Fingerstyle Funk\\" instructional video. It has some clips of T.O.P. in concert playing most of the classics & the audio is very good. They also have some great closeup shots of Rocco layin' it down.

However, even with the great collaborators he worked with, this was not Euge's best work, I'd expected way more effort than his previous albums. The only song I liked in the album was \\"Chillaxin.\\" Other than that nothing else caught my attention.My biggest problem are the interludes in the CD's. While some CD's include just one interlude, there is no reason valuable space on a CD shouldn't be wasted on 3 INTERLUDES!!! To me, that's laziness not creativity. Because of these interludes, this CD is one of the shortest playing CD's I have.Other than that, this CD is good on a slow relaxing day if you don't mind changing CDs in a short time. I'd rather keep listening to his Livin Large CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"APTLY TITLED!!","review":"I always like it when you can buy a disc and it has multi-tasty tracks on it.

As I was listening to the various cuts, \\"Straight Up\\" jumped up and surprised me as well. For you old heads, the cover of \\"Just my Imagination\\" will be enjoyable to you as well.

This book is just a compilation of meandering buzzword babble that makes no point and warrants no confidence. The topic is project management with lots of IT-ish buzzwords thrown around. Do not expect to learn anything reasonably classified as \\"engineering.\\" For the reader who is currently peddling management fads and looking to bother people who make software, then this is the book for you. On the other hand, if you are someone who programs or is learning to program and wants to know more about the process of creating really great software, then stay as far away from this book as you can get.

There has to be a better way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roger Pressman, thanks for Engineering Confusion!","review":"I used this book in my Grad class and I'm still confused. I don't know what to make of this book. On the one hand, I think the author tries to cover most of the important topics, but on the other, the book falls short in intellectual substance.Problems at the end of each chapter are very time consuming, and in some cases cannot be answered at all. This makes me wonder if the author can answer any of those tough questions that he wants you to ponder.If you're looking for a good SE textbook, don't buy this one. You will regret it!There is nothing much in this text that's closely related to what the author is asking you to consider. His book is based on fluff, and lacks the important stuff; just a bunch of snippets.You will get an \\"F\\".This is by far the worst textbook I have ever read, and isn't worth $128 dollars.Thanks for nothing Roger, but you deserve at least 1 star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pressman, you are not helping me","review":"This book will bring you up to speed on all the buzz words for all the methodologies, but thats the extent of the book.This book covers very little of actually process, how to analyze and existing process, how to setup a new process or improve a process. It actually does a very poor job of explaining what sofrware engineering is all about and leaves you feeling that is about writing documents, not about creating reliable, verifiable software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information, presented poorly","review":"This book has a ton of information, but the writing is so drab and repetitive that it's painful to read. I really wish that I didn't have to read this book for class, but what I'm doing is reading the main ideas from Wikipedia and the IBM UML series then going through the book and reading, because the book doesn't give a very good basis for a lot of their explanations."},{"rating":"1","title":"badly written and difficult to read","review":"this book reads very difficult and I cannot believe it is being prescribed to students.My impression of the book is that the author took hordes of sentences and 'wisecracks' from dozens of other books and just threw them all together in order to create a book of his own.I think he didn't filter through the information to only use relevant stuff in order to get the message across. He just threw in every bit and piece he could lay his eyes on.It is really hard to read through a chapter - it feels the same as reading through a dictionary or telephone directory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"It is just a collection of definitions, may of which are inaccurate.

Its coverage is broad though not deep. For example the chapter on Agile methods gives a brief description of the different flavours, including their strengths and weaknesses and summarises what Agile methods have in common. It is targeted at a manager/team leader whose responsibilities do not normally include cutting code. Also it is geared towards enterprise architecture as the \`Safe Home' running example amply demonstrates. So if you are writing parsers or numerical applications this is not meant for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thorough enough to kill the soul of any developer.","review":"I originally read this text in my first graduate class in computer science, and found it a dull read then.

I paid almost $100 and I can't read this with iPad! Horrible. Horrible. Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible out of date Software Engineering book","review":"This book is like a bloated piece of software. The author wastes so much of the book describing outdated methods and does not even seem to understand current methods. For example, many of the chapters describe procedural programming techniques such as data flow diagrams and then give a brief inaccurate description of modern techniques such as UML. The author also makes a big deal about comparing \\"traditional\\" programming and object oriented. Given that object oriented has been the dominant style for about 20 years, it just seems irrelevant to discuss it so much in the book. The examples in the book are also very confusing and hard to relate to. Instead of picking something simple that everybody knows like a banking system, he often uses something like a convoluted sensor system. This is just a horrible book and it's unfortunate that many CS students have to get stuck using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"This book is unreadable. I'm just three chapters in, and I can't bear the thought of having to read more. Nearly every paragraph is inflated with buzzwords, obscure new phases and acronyms. The author drones on and on about archaic software models when a simple table and summary of each would suffice. Pressman writes almost as if he is trying to fill a word quota.Before reading this book, I believed software engineering was dead. And after reading some of this book, I now know why: Software Engineering == Software Bureaucracy.Potential buyers of this book might want to read the article \\"Software Engineering: An Idea Whose Time Has Come and Gone?\\" by Tom DeMarco."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is actively harmful to Software Engineering","review":"I have never seen or heard anyone quote from this book or even list it as a reference in my entire career -- it is simply not valued. In spite of the fact that it is frequently used as a reference book in CS degrees, it does not reflect any practitioner's approach, and is appallingly misleading in both its approach and its grasp of the subject matter. Most software engineers would laugh themselves silly if you tried to use this book in practice.In particular, don't try and design using this book. If you're interested in design, I'd recommendDomain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of SoftwareorPatterns of Enterprise Application Architecture, and I also likeDesign Driven Testing: Test Smarter, Not Harderas one of the more practical books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy only if you want a narrow view of plenty of outdated topics.","review":"I've bought this book for my Computer Science course and I swear I've tried to read it at least 5 times but the book is horrible!

Those of you who are past menopause or who have had hysterectomys should appreciate this. I have personally found that I like the reusable/refillable style the best bacause I can adjust the amount to my needs, which is considerably less than what they put into the prefilled applicators. I have also found that if I use a little less of the product, but use it a little more frequently (like 3 times a week), and use it right before I go to bed (to sleep!), that I'm not as bothered with any discharge. In my opinion, as a hormone-free moisturizer, this is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does it's job!","review":"I've been using this product for about 6 months now and it gives me some relief and I like that it's completely natural.

Then, it was called a \\"quarantine,\\" because the term \\"blockade\\" means an act of war. Castro and his sycophants want people to believe that the U.S. refusal to trade with his repellent little dictatorship is an act of war. In fact it is an act of moral protest, comparable to the drive to \\"disvest\\" in South Africa when it was under apartheid. The whole point of the book is a lie, backed by dubious statistics and attempts to wrack the readers' emotions, all delivered in a shrill, self-righteous whine.In sum, it's a total waste of time, unless you happen to be studying leftist \\"solidarity\\" groups and their tactics. As such, this book ranks as classic - even exemplary - pro-Castro propaganda"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wonderful Name of Jesus","review":"This is a wonderful book.

Perhaps Dr. Deak is a better speaker than writer, but I have found little useful in this book, and (as a biologist) am frankly annoyed at her ignorance about hormones, dendrites, and even attachment theory. It's just a rambling string of stories from her own childhood and experience as a school counselor, without any original insight for handling my daughters. It also really bugs me how she under-rates girls' math and physics abilities, saying \\"girls tend to like arithmetic more than mathematics\\"--whatever that means. I'll confess I'm only halfway through, but don't think I can stomach any more of the stereotyping, pointless anecdotes, and obvious parenting tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go Girl!","review":"I truly enjoyed this practical, funny, touching and true guide to parenting girls from a real expert.

I found this edition in a bargain bin and chose it for its focus on modeling of finance-associated object types and transactions. It has some detailed examples that are interesting and helpful. Some programming concepts do appear confused or in error but they are not difficult to discern. Will be useful for intermediate programmers. A CD with example source code would be helpful. Developing the book to suit the needs of a professional audience may be another idea. The cartoons are inconsequential and a waste of space. The diagrams are helpful.

The only episode I truly remembered was \\"Time Lash\\", espeically the \\"I think I'll replay that\\" line. That one scene stuck with me for all these years.The problem I have with the Megaset is that the episodes are not in order. I didn't realize this at first, until I saw \\"Survival\\" (the 2nd episode on disc 2 but the 13th episode aired according to imdb.com), which obviously came well after \\"Exposed\\" (the 1st episode on disc 2 and in actuality the 2nd episode aired).

The special effects are often spectacular even by today's standards (I'd much rather see good model work than poor computer animation any day). The scripts are inventive and moody. The drama is occasionally great, but sometimes is cliche and serves as a distraction from the plot unlike, say original trek where the drama was a natural extension of the plot. The outdated view of the future is actually part of the charm, but also, if one considers that the future they were attempting to project was only 12 years off, perhaps it isn't that outdated after all. I found no rascism or sexism in this series however, unlike some overly sensitive viewers here (the freedom for women to bare their bodies was considered part of their \\"liberation\\" in the late 60s).

So The Andersen's effects became- plausible.The Science was questionable from a technical aspect. And there is plenty for a nitpicker to gnaw on. But the human element- the character development, the stories are believable.Watching the unfortunately (one!) season, gave me a notion to profile the Aliens.Though I still have NO NOTION why on Luna, the female officers on the Moon, insisted on wearing purple haired wigs.

As another review says, it's intelligent sci-fi, not full of hokey xplosions and wows. Sure it's dated(it was made in 1969) but it's still fun stuff. excellent acting, very good scripts puts this show heads and shoulders above most others. Also, for you computer gamers out there, UFO was the inspiration for the classic game X-COM:UFO DEFENSE created by Mythos games(from England) and published by Microprose.

The story line of a secret organization using high-tech equipment to fight off an alien invasion (which is admittedly pretty small) is a great one to watch. The music and the \\"futuristic\\" costumes are added bonuses.I've enjoyed watching episodes of UFO just as much now as I did when I was a kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Pretty Picture","review":"Like many, I bought the eponymous album for \\"Kiss Me\\". That album was very different to the taster track, yet well worth coming back to.This, on the other hand, is dreadful. There are a few good songs in there, but in the context of the others there it is just tiring to listen to virtually anything. The recordings are not top notch, and the sound quality varies noticably between tracks.

Missing from this \\"portrait\\" are Sixpence classics like \\"Trust\\" and \\"Meaningless,\\" a song the band still plays live at epic length. The artwork is second-rate and goes against the artistic nature of a band. Avoid COLLAGE unless you just can't afford both of Sixpence's early CD's. One positive thing I will mention about COLLAGE is that whoever selected the tracks for the album (and it was not the band) had the forsight to pick the best songs from the TICKETS FOR A PRAYER WHEEL EP It is still unforgivable that the same care was not taken in selecting LP tracks. It sounds as if the compilers of the album tried to find as many \\"Kiss Me\\" clones as they could in Sixpence's back catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"They have God given talent and are using it well!Awesome!","review":"I've been listening to this band for over 4 years and I am even a bigger fan now than I was 4 years ago.

They are a great witness to many unsaved kids out there just looking for good music to listen to.

The book explors in great detail the political mood our of young country and it's dertermination of talented and patriotic men of the times to steer the country towards their beliefs. Hamilton was just one of these men. He was a man of action and if he had survived his duel with Burr, it's no telling how many more great things he would have accomplished for the betterment of the country.Learn from reading how the New York political parties in New York were instrumental in shaping the policies of the new nation.

Steve Tuers."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Duel","review":"This is a very exciting, fast-paced narrative that details the rivalry between Hamilton and Burr for control of the Federalist Party during the early days of the American Republic.While both men shared an animosity toward President Thomas Jefferson, their rivalry for control of the Federalist Party led them to a dueling ground in New Jersey where Burr shot and killed Hamilton.I liked this, but I loved Ron Chernow'sAlexander Hamiltonand would recommend that over The Duel as a portrait of Hamilton and his times, but this is very well done book that looks at the two rivals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-layered and informative","review":"I recommend this book for people who enjoy historical narrative writing. Fleming has done a very good job in portraying the various characters and historical context of which this famous duel between Hamilton and Burr had taken place.It is also to Fleming's credit that the people are portrayed as complex characters and not straw men. I enjoyed learning more about the familial relationships and politics of the various founders. Fleming's prose is simple and he maintains good tension in a story that everyone is basically familiar with.I agree that with another reviewer that the potrayal of politics of the time period could be disturbing especially for those who hold more cherished and idealized views.There is not much in the way of historical analysis or \\"what if\\" but the work gives a personal texture to what some consider a dry topic, American political history.All in all a good narrative history that brings early America with its complexity alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Follow-up Reading after \\"John Adams\\"","review":"David McCullough's book, John Adams, and the HBO special based upon it, sets the stage for this fascinating book.

The book is a look at their personalities, but much more it shows the continued fractious nature of the young Republic after the death of Adams.

Jack Cady was one of those writers who tends to sit on library shelves as reader after reader wanders past looking for someone nearby. Don't make this mistake! This novel is short but layered. It can be read as a ghost story, a coming of age story (this is tucked in with a subtlety that might be missed), or just a novel of the sea in the great tradition of American maritime writers. Buy it, read it. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Warner Brothers DVD restoration in 2007!","review":"In general I like the Digi-View Cartoon Craze DVDs.

This, by contrast would be too shocking. At first, it'll seem to loud, too fast, etc. But after a song or two, it'll bring you up to its speed.

This text goes into detail as all the other reviews have stated, but doesn't offer alternatives to when the GUI and IDLE don't like to run a Tk Program that you wrote. I tried on my wife's XP machine a lot, and still couldn't get his GUI code to cooperate, and it is probably just a general python flaw for it's adherence to Tk driven programs. Plus, with the advent of Python based APIs for gaming and such (which the author has you download to write the games promised), there is no real effort in the Tk adherence regard.All in All, if you need a place to start, and are interested in a very simple to read, simple to write language- head to python and use this book.

Some reviewers mention a problem with the tuning dial. I grew up before digital radios were introduced. I don't notice any problem. The volume knob is another story. Movement of seemingly a few millimeters changes the volume from a whisper to blaring.A minor inconvenience is that there's is no way to know at a glance when the AA batteries are dead and the radio is instead running on the internal rechargeable battery. And it won't tune in the weather band which is mentioned in an earlier review.

Made from cast iron. Two sets screws came with the unit, one shorter for the smaller scopes and the longer for the larger scopes. The installation is a snap since all i had to do was to remove two screws that goes around the outside by the rear of the tube and attach the mount with the supplied screws. A word of caution is to make sure you're using the right length screws. One problem i had was that when I tightened the thumbscrew onto my Canon Digital Rebel, the camera body was still on the loose side on the mount. I put down a layer of rubber sheet on the surface of the mount so that the camera was tight and snug onto the mount. Oh by the way.. the rubber sheet also protects the buttom of the camera since the mount surface is pretty coarse. Overall its a good compact mount with the right price that gives me the tracking ability of the scope for my camera to get wide angle sky shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for book four","review":"Challenges moved much faster than the first two books did.

It lacks illustrations (except the one's I've drawn in the margins to aid future owners). The index might as well not even exist given its limited scope.

The side of the bigots is also given, as well as a disgusting interview with one of the murderers, but it helps the book to become a more complete anthology showing the sickness of the murderers (and others who thought like them) as well as the good guys in the case.As a historian, I'll admit that this does not make pleasant reading, but it is a fascinating look at what racism could cause and is a worthy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Strange, dark, and gorgeous at night.

The format in which it is set up first gives me a total review of the subject which can be from 2-10 pages in outline form. Then it gives me all the information on which drugs I need to know for that particular subject outline. The last part of that chapter are nclex type questions with rationales (I learned sooo much from these!). I would then do questions when I was too tired for anything else off of the disc during the weekend or after I had \\"quiet time\\" to myself. I highly recommend it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well spent","review":"I highly recommend this book. The content is clear and concise. The font is easy and pleasant on the eyes. The CD-rom is easy to download and I did not encounter any problems with it. The questions, 3500+ on the CD, test all body systems. The book is helpful in that it provides test-taking strategies to aid you in taking the NCLEX. I have read other sources for NCLEX, this one is far the best. I am preparing to write the NCLEX in May...Wish me a PASS and succes to you ALL...definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toe Socks are excellent","review":"Toe socks really make my feet and especially my toes feel better.

I Recieved the 580 last night for an early Christmas present and 24 hours later it's packed, ready to go back. After taking about 15 pics and messing around with the set up, the first set of Alkalines ran out. The second set didn't last one picture!! The third set three or four. It does state on their website that it doesn't recommend Alkalines but instead tells you to use a $13.00 one that lasts maybe 20 or 30 times more. And for rechargeble Ni's you'll probably need ten sets.I reccomend you move up to the Canon A95. For a hundred bucks more you get a much better camera. Check it out. It has dozens of better features including a state of the art processing chip, a flexible display, manual options, and a better focusing system. Save your self the trouble with this Olympus unless your daddy owns Duracell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst digital camera ever","review":"Batteries: I bought Olympus Ni-MH batteries. By the time you go through a few menu items red light on battery starts to come out. When it goes dead, you cannot even close the cover.Usability: Everything in menus which eats up battery power. Menus are confusing, blink out instantly and I thought Hieroglyphics went out of fashion with egyptians. You make changes, but the camera like resolution of the picture but it reverts back to another resolution all on its own.Quality: snapshots of landscapes are OK, but the camera cannot focus anything closer than 10 yards.I think the name fits this camera: Camedia but I think it is misspelled it shoud read \\"Comedy\\" of a camera.I own 5 digital cameras, this one is a big dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pictures themselves are good, design and value are poor","review":"As the title would indicate, I really don't like this camera. I saw it on sale at Best Buy for $199 and got it for my parents for Christmas. The actual picture quality is pretty good. 4MP is certainly quite crisp. It is fairly compact as well.I ended up returning the camera, and here is why. First, needing to slide the shutter to turn it on is not intuitive, and annoying. Second, I had some problems getting the lens to retract sometimes when I did close the shutter. Third, I was also surprised that the camera didn't come with a rechargable battery. Most cameras these days come with one, and it basically felt like they were skimping on accessories. Fourth, the screen on the camera was very laggy and low resolution compared to nearly all others I have seen. I was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery HOG! Just not worth it","review":"I had one of the first Olympus digitals - a 2.1 mp - and loved it. It finally broke after years of pounding - and decided to stay brand loyal.I'm getting ready to box the new one up and return it. I used rechargeables - as well as 6 other pairs of batteries to feed this camera - and it just burns through them like nothing. The \\"free\\" batteries it comes with lasted maybe 10 minutes - and that was just turning the camera on and playing with the settings. And I never even used it for video.The speed of the camera seemed just as slow as my 2.1 - and the quality was not as good for some of my shots. I'm not high tech when it comes to cameras - but this one just didn't seem to have the right speed or adequate lighting. It was too bright on some shots - and others WAY too dark.The good to the camera - it is small - but I guess in this instance - size doesn't matter - b/c I don't like this camera at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine camera","review":"The instructions were not congruent to the actual camera settings. However, after just a few minutes, I had it figured out. This camera is BY FAR easier to use than the D-510 that it replaced. As per the \\"beef\\" about battery life, that I have read: What is the difference if you change two batteries every 20 or so shots or four batteries every forty shots? Thus far, I am very pleased with this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful Olympus product","review":"My first digital camera was a Olympus D-390. It was great,but it was a fixed lens(no optical zoom). Then I tried a kodak cx6230 and really didn't care for it at all. I considerd the D-540 and Stylus 410. My wife sort of borrowed it,and seems like it very much. She likes the auto program mode and the sharp picture quality. I use rechargeable batteries and always have a spare set charged and use the LCD monitor to much to tell you how many pictures I get out of a pair of batteries. I have had this camera for a couple of months and shot over two hundred pictures and have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product; awful customer service","review":"I bought one of these as a backup to my more expensive camera, so I didn't use it much for the first 3-4 months. I took it to a company event about two months ago and the thing actually shorted out: I took a group photo and then shut the cover and when I opened the cover a few minutes later, the camera body was very warm and none of the LEDs would light up. I took the batteries out and they were too hot to touch.For the past month I have been haggling with Olympus. They do not seem willing to perform warranty repair even though I've still got 6 months left on the warranty. Every time I contact them via e-mail it is a couple of weeks before I hear anything again.This was my first Olympus camera and I guarantee it will be my last. Bad product, terrible customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats batteries","review":"I like this camera a lot, but as other reviewers have noted, it eats batteries in no time at all. I orginally bought rechargables but found that they didn't have the power depth to last more than a few shots (like maybe 10 or 20). I switched to alkalines, which last a little longer, but what a waste of money to keep buying new ones.It seems like the problem is that there is a huge drain on the battery on each shot taken because if you let the camera rest for a while, the batteries will eventually allow it to take another shot (after you turn the camera off, of course).I bought this camera based on Amazon reviews, which were very helpful. Next time I'll wait until the product has been on the market long enough to find out about these kinds of problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this show!","review":"Me and my 3yr old son love this show!

Of course, I live in Southern California so it is not very cold anyway. I would recommend getting a fleece cover for truly frosty areas of the country. I have the Baby Bjorn with the lumbar support so the cover does not secure as well to the carrier as it would to the regular Baby Bjorn carrier because the clasps are of a different design. I do like how you can switch the hood depending on which way the baby is facing. I have used it every time I have put my little one in the Baby Bjorn so far this winter so I guess that is a testament to it working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough to use.

We live in San Francisco - and after borrowing a friends for the afternoon - immediately bought our own. It's big enough to be non-restrictive - but also hugs close enough to baby to make sure the little one attached to you is a snug little sausage. It has no impact on the wearer (read: mom or dad). I highly recommend this helpful (and easy to attach/detach) addition for anyone with a BB carrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"TEsMOM","review":"We live in Seattle and this cover is a godsend in the cold and in the rain.

It provides zero warmth and barely acts as a barrier between the cold and your baby.

This was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not enclose the back side","review":"I had hoped that this product would be more like a sleeping bag, when in reality, it is just a cover with a big open back.

Depending when your baby is born and your local climate, this might be a smart purchase or not. We like to use it because our baby hates being put in her little snowsuit, so this this we can just snap it over her instead of bulking her up beforehand, and we are all happier.

It's led by a good and enthusiastic instructor, Tracey Mallett and she is all about having fun. You will need one of those X-ertube and that's about it.

To center this you have three very small hex head screws to adjust. If you are not carefull the inside lens moves and you end up turning the screw till it falls inside the tube. Then you have to remove it, take it apart, get the screw out and position the inside lens so you can tighten the three screws to hold the lens. Now you put it back together and install it again and start all over again. I ended up returning it, not worth the truble to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs lighting","review":"The product is well made but it's VERY difficult to center the scope in the mount - this is well before you even point it at Polaris...

To restate, you will read about all of the objective facts of the battle, and the maps help the reader visualize how the battle took place.To learn about the Battle of Poltava on a more personal level, I recommend reading \\"The Battle That Shook Europe: Poltava and the Birth of the Russian Empire,\\" by Peter Englund.

One problem: we couldn't locate the receipt for the camera. After calling Olympus Customer Service multiple times including speaking to their management, they were consistently arrogant and would not consider fixing the camera under warranty.So, we sent it to them to be repaired for a fee. After having the camera for TWO MONTHS, Olympus quoted a price of nearly the original cost of the camera. Now, that's real customer service.Olympus will NEVER NEVER get my business again.

So it makes this camera completely useless in low light or night time pics.

Our car seat almost slipped out on several occasions while walking on a bumpy path. The strap just adds one more step to the process of loading the kids in the stroller.2. The big kid seat(s) must be removed in order to fold the stroller flat enough to fit it in a standard trunk - I have a VW Passat with a large trunk and it barely fits. Again, one additional step in loading the kids into or taking them out of this stroller.3.The seat is too shallow and too short for my 30lb toddler.

If you can imagine someone doing a Los Vegas show of early music you may get some idea of how distasteful this cd is. Think Elvis in his late years. Think a large stage with smoke and mirrors and lots of flashing lights and scantily clad dancing. I think I need a drink.There are far better recordings of this type of music that are much more satisfying on every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"I've had two of these and both are broken now.

The characters don't get any more interesting, the last minute addition of the mystics seems bizarre rather than a throwback to the old series, and the ending is terrible.

Dreamweaver is a pro-level tool, and the documentation that comes with it addresses that audience. This book cuts one level lower to help us novices get up to speed. Note however, that this is not the \\"end all\\" book; it simply gets you started..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"My first exposure to Dreamweaver 3 was through the CD that comes with this book. (The CD also come with a trial version of Fireworks 3 and several other programs). I am very impressed with Dreamweaver and the explanations this book gives of its features. I'm about halfway through and I understand and can apply every bit so far.This is one of the first books out on Dreamweaver, so I was a bit wary of buying it. It's not for someone who knows absolutely nothing about web design (of course Dreamweaver isn't probably for someone who doesn't have at least *some* idea of what makes web pages work).If you want to learn Dreamweaver 3 and have had some exposure to web design, this book will teach you what you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreaming of a better Dummies Dreamweaver Book","review":"If you already know something about HTML authoring this book isn't too bad if you want a quick guide to the program. BUT if you are a newbie to creating websites, then this book is a poor place to start. I purchased this book for a friend who wanted to get up and running, and while I know there is no substitute for a human teacher - this guide was a poor textbook at best. The chapters don't explain the basic concepts behind websites, so while the reader can find out how to use Dreamweaver to make frames, tables and CSS - there is little to nothing on what a \\"dummy\\" would find useful (example: how to make text a specific color). This book has too much fluff with chapters like \\"Fulfilling Your Dreams\\" and \\"Making It Cool\\" but very little about the basic lessons a beginner could use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamweaver For Dummies","review":"If you want to learn Dreamweaver quickly, this is the book for you.

Learning a new program should be made as easy as possible-this does the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointing","review":"Y'know, I was just rarin' to go, to dive straight into Dreamweaver 3 and knock out my first web site. I figured the \\"Dummies\\" series might be a good place to start. Now I'd never bought a Dummies book before, but (silly me) I assumed from the title that one of these books would walk one through a project from ground-zero inception.Not only does this book *not* do that, but some of its commentary is inaccurate - as if someone had done a sloppy rehash of \\"Dreamweaver 2 for Dummies\\" and peddled it as the latest and greatest.So...I'm still, sadly, looking for a Dreamweaver 3 book as stylish *and* practical as Hillman Curtis' book on Flash. I strongly recommend against buying this book unless you're already a little proficient with this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"There are actually some really good songs on this CD.

This is \\"HARDLY \\" just piano music- which by the way- if you are a BLUES fan- this is very special music from E. Boyd. Just give a listen to \\"The Train is Comin\\" (Clapton at this time had lost his feel for this kind of blues and Green gives a lesson) -\\"Blue Coat Man \\"- a jump blues number is sweeter then honey- \\"Ain't Doin Too Bad \\" - THIS is the definative version of this tune-it just grooves along and Pete is in his element. Don't forget \\"Too Bad \\" parts 1 & 2 and \\"The Big Bell \\"- no- Peter Green is well represented here, and while the Horizon label did put out a real gem with Eddie Boyd- Peter Green- McVie & Fleetwood- this should NOT be overlooked-get it wherever- however you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size","review":"What was I thinking?

I just received this & the poster is bubbling inside of the frame. I expected much better quality for a $50.00 dollar framed poster. To call this \\"professionally framed\\" is false advertising. I could have purchased the poster alone & framed this myself for half the price & I could have made it look much better. In fact, I am sending this back now. It's also worthwhile to note that the thumbnail picture shown in the search results for this item does not have the same color scheme as the picture shown on the item's actual page.

I knew that the poster wouldn't include the whole piece, but it's just cut awkwardly. A piece of the man's head is missing. The manufactuaer should either re-scale the piece or shift the piece within the poster. I would go with another version of this.The seller gets 2.5 starts.

Slow-moving and rather predictable at the end. It seemed like two books, the first very interesting dealing with Martin's reaction to his condition, the second a drawn out 100 page explanation of what happened to the girl he was seeing. There was very little connection between the two halves of the book other than Nina herself and the man following her. Overall, I thought the concept was interesting but not well played out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Books In One","review":"I purchased this book because the plot sounded unique and interesting. It was about a man who was shot and as a result was blind. He had a rare condition which would let him see at night. It went through his rehab and entering back into what now would be his regular life. He meets a girl in a bar and after breaking up with him, she disappears. After that, the focus of the book changes to the life of this girl. It explores her life as well as the lifes of her parents and grandparents. It is very dark and definitely not what I expected to be reading about. Not a dull book but one that I wouldn't read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"I am fond of Fast's book's but was so disappointed with this book and with him. Fast where were you during World War II? Was your head buried in the sand? His book is full of lame excuses and errors. For instance, the Rosenbergs who were executed for being spies were in fact confirmed guilty per recent unsealed documents. The government was able at the trial, to find them guilty without using testimony from secret agents who would have been publically identified. The book is a portrait of a weak, uninformed,narrow minded \\"useful idiot\\" , as Churchill called ignorant, uninformed persons who unknowingly were used to help the enemy's agenda both during & after the war.If a reader is looking for a good read I'd recommend The Long Walk by Slavomir Rawicz, We Die Alone by David Howarth, The Shadow of War by T. Childers, or Intrepid's Last Case by William Stevenson-all of which are non-fiction & 5 star reading!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good, but somewhat monotonous","review":"This disk is exactly what it says. As a UFC fan, I would havepreferred a finishing moves disk instead of just knockouts.The UFC forum has a great variety of fighters and fighting styles. These knockouts are spot on! However, there are just too darn many punching knockouts. Those that weren't just boxing-style knockouts were far more interesting. Worthy examples were Merk Kerr's \\"knee to the head\\" knockout andRemco's (?) \\"elbows to the head knockout\\" from an arm hold position and two knockouts by takedown. I REALLY wanted to see Frank Shamrock's rapid submissions , UFC 1 finishing kick from the French kickboxer to the big Hawaiian dude (knocked his teeth out), some of and Keith Hackney's bout with the 606 lb black sumo fellow. I don't think thateither of the last two are on the UFC hits DVDs either.I wonder why.Anyway, if you're a fight fan, you should own this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super knockouts!","review":"This dvd is a must have for the UFC finatic. Nothing but straight knockouts. I love it, but wish it was longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Def worth the buy","review":"This double set is worth it mainly only because it's a double set. Most of the KO's are from the old school SEG days of the UFC, before Dana White and the Fertita brothers even bought it. There are a few where the fighters don't even have gloves yet. While there is plenty of shock value in the brutality of it, I wouldn't even quantify it as real MMA. But its a two in one, so why not? definitely entertaining, but your mother probably won't appreciate it whether she's 40 or 80."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal knock outs","review":"Wow, pretty gruesome. This DVD has some great knockouts, but doesn't show the whole fight. Sometimes that is hard to get into or follow as many of these fights are over before they get started....

But great for those who want to go right to the serious action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I am a fan of MMA and this video isn't that great.

It assumes a very modern point of view and neglects most of poetic history.

I would the narrator had ended his own miserable existence early on in the novel rather than devastate the lives of every decent person he encountered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time (or money)","review":"This book, in spite of the fact that it received the Governor General's Award for Fiction in 1997, is a complete waste of time. The talk about painting and art is incessant. The character development is minimal in spite of the books length. The last thirty pages of the story are moderately OK and, coupled with some of the earlier parts, PERHAPS would have made a decent short story. Quite frankly, the Governor General needs to read more if this is the best he (now she) can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"One way I measure a book is by how much it makes me think - and for how long after I've finished it. I first read this book two years ago, and still it haunts me. The characters are not especially sympathetic - least of all the artist - but what is disturbing is how well they are drawn from real life. The author has as remarkable an eye for character and human nature as a fine painter for his or her subject. I've recommended this book to many, but only to those who can appreciate a story of quiet depth. It's also a story that demands rereading."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as expected","review":"it deffinatley helped me out however I found that alot of the information and phrases are used over and over again through out the boook which made it boring to read .

However, she doesnt resist too much and ends up in love with him and they think there Bonny & Clyde or something.Then stupid things happen along the way like a Shiek wanting to buy moonshine that I guess they thought was a great idea.

The best story arc of this series, excluding the Enishi arc from the manga... in any event, this would have been 5 stars except for this particular box set: For some bloody ridiculous reason, they eliminated Bonnie Pink's gorgeous end theme \\"It's Gonna Rain\\" and replaced it with a L'arc~en~Ciel song from the movie. WHY! I need to know what the circumstances were for this horrific decision! It wasn't liek this in the regular DVDs!!!Otherwise, nice box that doesn't have a hinge, just a lid that could get lost and has no security value to the box itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you want in a anime series.","review":"This season of Rurouni Kenshin takes off where the first season endid a guy from the Shinsengumi named Saito pays a visit to the Battousai's living area the Kamiya Dojo and this is where stuff get's intresting.

This safety bar was too low and in face impeded his getting out of the tub. it was our fault for not realizing the problem having something low on the edge of the tub would cause.

This seems to go away after it has been pulled down for a while.- Terrible packaging, and there was a dent in the housing when I got it. Since it was still functional and did not damage the screen I kept it anyway. But better packaging and a little more care by UPS could have prevented the damage.Other Thoughts:The retract function is a bit tricky and takes some getting used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still loving it","review":"We bought this screen a while ago for our home theater. We put it up, and it was great (if a bit difficult for me to raise - my husband had no problems - Not fair!). It looks like you're in a movie theater. Sure, it might wash out a bit in direct sunlight, but not so bad that you can't watch even then. Since we moved (and it survived the u-haul like a champ), we have it in a darker room, and have no problems watching even during the day.

For people who don't know much about photography, it has point-and-shoot convenience; for those who are more experienced, there are lots of features you can set manually. The pre-set macro mode is great fun--it allows you take some gorgeous extreme close-ups. You do need to keep your hands extremely steady or use a tripod to prevent the picture from being too blurry (using the action shot mode also helps, since the shutter speed is faster). I bought mine for $339, and it's a really good value for the money. The only minor complaint I have is that the propietary XD card is pretty expensive and you need to get the Olympus brand if you want to take panoramic pictures, but I managed to find a 256MB chip for $40, so really I don't have too much to complain about. If you're looking for a decent mid-range digital camera, I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID! - Bad Hardware","review":"I bought this camera a couple of months ago. I chose it for its high optical zoom. The pictures that I took came out fine. After using it for 2-3 times I noticed there was a play lens assembly. When the camera is in ON mode and the lens mounts in extended position, the lens mount shakes laterally -up, down and sideways (parallel to the body of the camera). I sent it back to Olympus to be repaired. The camera was returned today and the only comment that the Olympus guys have, is that \\"the play in the lens is normal\\". And to my great agitation, now the lens mount shakes even in the closed position, ie. when it is mostly embedded in the body. So now I am stuck with a camera that I am almost afraid to use, because its lens feels like it could disassemble from the body any moment. And I am a good 300 bucks short!Also, I bought it from Adorama Camera, a vendor on Amazon, so I cannot return it.

A great idea seems to have been ruined by the attempt to be too hip for words. I was hoping for the creativity and wit of LET'S NOSH or the SUSHI board book. At least those rhyme (\\"Miso in my Sippy cup\\"). Instead we are left with an unrhyming, mean spirited, too hip for words board book. I expected more from this publisher. Still... it is a great concept, and a good gag gift, but worthless as a bedtime book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This five page book isn't worth the cardboard it's printed on.

It is only 12 pages long and has about 15 words in total. At $9.00 it is just not worth it. I understand this is a baby book, but a waste of money for what you get. This book should be around $2.00 for as small and as short as it is. The description makes it sound as if it's interactive or has ideas for activities which it doesn't. Tweleve pages with pictures of cocktails and short descriptions is silly for what they are charging."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO YOURSELF A FAVOR....","review":"and buy this cd! I have been using this disc for three nights in a row with much success. I typically have trouble going to sleep and then staying asleep. The first track I tried was Deep Sleep (4) and I was out before the program finished. Track 3 Go to Sleep was effective but seems more of an exercise program you would commit to. Finally track 2 Restorative Sleep provide just that. So far I have slept sound and awakened refreshed and renewed. You can go to www.hyptalk.com if you can't get them through Amazon. It is a purchase worth making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy with the results....","review":"I've been using the CD for about two weeks now and so far no success. It does tell you to give it time to work by using it morning and night for several weeks. My chief complaint is that there's no instruction in the case about which tracks to use, how long each track is, etc... I also find the warning about copy right protection at the beginning of the CD annoying. If you set the CD to repeat (and since I'm never asleep by the end I do) it takes you out of the rhythm of trying to relax. The first track is supposed to put you to sleep and wake you up. That wasn't really my goal. I want to sleep. That's why I bought this. If you skip to what you think is the second track it turns out it's really the part of track 1 that wakes you back up. I haven't given up yet and I wasn't expecting a quick solution, but I'm starting to wonder if it will work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reference book","review":"If you are reading this review, then chances are you are taking or preparing to take a Discrete Mathematics course.

Yet I frequently found myself staring at the pages in disbelief.The author states that in 1848 the population of California was several hundred. In fact there were thousands of Native Americans (tho many would be subsequently killed by white newcomers). This genocidal oversight admittedly caused me to cast a critical eye on the rest of the book.Still, with all the objectivity I can muster, the writing to me seems stodgy and halting, formal and uninspired, like someone published a research report. That's how the content feels too: the dots might be mostly there but few seem connected with analysis, commentary, or sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted Fingerprints 2 GREAT BOOK","review":"This was a great fast read.

I don't want to give away too much about the book, so I'll just say this: The author really has a way with words that make you fell like you experience what the character experiences. It is amazing. I'm surprised these wonderful books aren't more well known, and I am sure you won't regret making your purchase. If you are the type of person that likes a book that keeps you waiting for the next big event in the plot to unfold and gradually reveals (the book, not you) the answers to the questions you have had and continues to do so as the series goes on, I completely reccomend that you check this book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rae's powers are put to the test","review":"Just when Rae's getting used to her fingerprint reading novel, her powers are put to the test when Jesse goes missing her powers are put to the test.

Using Rae's ability to read fingerprints as there guide Rae, Anthony, and Yana set out to find Jesse. But as they look furthur they realise that the person that wants Rae dead might be involved.This book was suspenseful and just as good as the last. It was exciting and a real mystery.

They're very thin, made of cheap fabric that lets a lot of light through yet doesn't breath well. My face would get sweaty but I could still see light through the mask- the worst of both worlds. The elastic is also very thin and flimsy, so the mask slips out of position easily, and I doubt if it would hold up well to multiple washings. If you're buying them for a one time use like a long flight they *might* be worth it, but frankly the free masks I've been given on international flights have been higher quality than this. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs - not worth the low price","review":"My prior sleep masks kept having the elastic bands stretch out too much after a few months, so I figured to be eficient I would \\"bulk-order\\" like 6 of these to save me time. Bad idea. All of them smelled like chemicals/oil and the smell did not go away. I had to rinse them with water to try to get rid of the odor but no dice. Also one night I used one of them in a hotel with white pillowcases and when i woke up the mask had left black imprints all over the pillowcases. Nasty - all the chemicals/ink/whatever leeching off of it. I certainly don't want something on my face loaded with toxins like that so I tossed all of the masks and am using some different, more costly brands now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job Well","review":"I am a light sleeper, and I cannot stand light when I sleep. Even if the outside hall is lit up, I find it hard to sleep.This sleep mask is pretty good for a sleep mask, it blocks those minor lights (such as outside hall and the glow from my digital clock). It also blocks the sunlight pretty well, about 75% ~ 85% of all lights. I sometimes wake up wondering why is it so dark yet there are birds chirping, so it does work very well.However, it does not completely block 100% of all light (also a little crack in the nose part also glows out). Also the mask does touch your eyes so when your eyes get wet while to yawn your eyes water when you sleep you will feel dampness around your eyes.Overall,it gets the job done well.Pros:Blocks 75% ~ 85% of lightLight, doesn't irate skin or headComfortableCons:If it is super bright, light will leak throughSmall crack where the nose isMask touches the eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleep mask review","review":"While inexpensive, keep in mind that you are getting what you pay for with this product.

This mask fails in every category. Light slips in from all sides (not just around the nose which is typical of cheap masks). What really surprised me however, is that in a dark room at night with just a TV on, I could see the light from the TV right through the front of the mask! As others have stated, it's incredibly tight on my head, and I woke up in pain from it. The material is light (normally a good thing), but somehow still abrasive to my skin. This is a cheap mask, and it performs as such. As an owner of 6 or 7 different types of masks over the years, this is without question the worst I have had. I was looking for complete darkness and comfort in material, as well as fit. This mask offers none of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck to my face","review":"Besides not blocking light around the perimeter, the mask stuck to my face.

It's strange but it's not that big a deal.What IS a big deal is that this meter stopped measuring flash accurately. For some reason it just started going from registering (inaccurately) to not registering anything below a certain f/stop....nothing in between.I did like this meter while it worked (with the slight caveats that I mentioned above)and it works fine while it works.For myself, I should have spent the extra cash to get an L-358 because that's what I'm going to do now and I could have avoided a $160.00 lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"not accurate","review":"I got one of these light meters.

By 2 stops!!!!! I had my suspicions confirmed by comparing my friends correctly exposed shot, and comparing the results of her Sekonic meter. Yep, 2 whole stops off. There is no polaris customer service so no company to even repair it. Im going to contact amazon and see if they will let me exchange it, very frustrated!! Will update after I talk to amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for one shoot","review":"This meter worked great - for one shoot. It's accuracy declined rapidly thereafter and, within a few days, exposures that should have been shot at F22 were being registered as F2.8 (or sometimes f4.0 depending on the whim of the meter).I have an important shoot this weekend so I had to order a better quality meter and overnight it out so that I'm not left in the dark. The Polaris is going back in the morning.Spend a little extra and get a higher quality product; buying cheap is NOT worth the heartache, inconvenience and cost!On the positive side, I was surprised by the accuracy of the readings for the day that it did work; it was spot on."},{"rating":"2","title":"My own.","review":"I am glad that I have my very own and it will be put to use. Photography has so much to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"With this book learning idioms will be as easy as falling off a log","review":"I have been studying English since I was a kid. I can say that almost everything I learned was through self study, and I think people who have been learning English the same way I have would agree to the point that nothing is better than having good reference books especially that ones relating to idioms and phrasal verbs.I am not afraid of rating this book as excellent because every time I need it there is an answer. I have recently bought some other books from Amazon.com (business books) and when I am challenged by what seems to be an idiom I look up in the dictionary and... THERE IT IS!!!I strongly recommend it and also the following books from Longman: Language Activator, Dictionary of Contemporary English and Phrasal Verbs Dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off elsewhere","review":"I'd been curious to listen to Tyrannosaurus Rex based on friends' recommendations over the years, but this CD was not the place to start. The songs themselves don't impress, but that may be in large part due to the terrible recording--distant, boomy, and indistinct. But not to put it all on the engineering--the songs start to sound the same, and the group's format didn't lend itself to great sonic variety. And you've got to be a real fan to want the second CD with a Bolan interview."},{"rating":"2","title":"sure i could get it right this time","review":"Not bad for a bunch of songs that were never supposed to surface again. Newcomers to this recently broken up Champaign, Ill., quartet should try 1998's The Glass Intact for a more comprehensive introduction, but this collection of unreleased or rare studio and live tracks shows off all their strengths unprepossessingly. For metal-edged jangle-punk, you have the new \\"Detroit Star-Lite,\\" about the heartbreaker who fronts a Kiss cover band. For winning charm you have the high-energy rendition of \\"Time After Time\\" you've been waiting for. For heartbreak, you have Elizabeth Elmore coming home from the road, finding her man gone and staggering around the house trying \\"to remember every crack in the paint instead of remembering you.\\" The thing you have to love about punks is that if their hearts are big enough, even a posthumous mishmosh can be affecting enough to come back to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fond Farewell","review":"Beautifully packaged, this album wonderfully recreates what it was like to see Sarge live. Coincidentally, the six live tracks were taped at the farewell concert for another fine Illinois band, Braid, at The Metro in Chicago. It is a shame that \\"Beguiling\\" is not included, but not as much as a shame the band's parting of ways. The demo tracks are of high quality, as are the cover tracks; Elizabeth Elmore's remake of \\"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\\" is a special treat, except maybe for diehard fans of Nancy Sinatra. While no substitute for the band's studio albums, \\"Distant\\" nevertheless stands on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie","review":"I watched this movie and it had the genre of a gay movie. I think this movie should of had a better script. I think this movie is over priced even at fifty cents for 24 hours. This is not how to make a gay movie. I expected to see more personal, intimate interactions between the men and less of a movie about someone getting married. If you are going to make a gay movie, then make a gay movie. Don't just skirt the edges of what you can get away with and try to make it for everyone to see. In my opinion this movie is an absolute joke. The only people that really benefited from this movie production were all the hired people behind the scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment.","review":"A Disappointment.I found this movie/DVD to be very ephemeral. Bob, the main character, especially, was so shallow and untrusting of his own feelings that the movie just did not work. All grown up, no gay character took their relationship seriously. Maybe this film works for people in their 20's but not people in their thirties and forties. Sure, call it a comedy. I didn't laugh. Some of the acting was so rigid and stereotypical. The only saving grace in this movie was Guilermo Diaz, the straight savvy friend of Bob. His acting was believable. I was expecting something more mature. It was as funny as the Partridge Family is today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this video","review":"Too many subplots. The writing wasn't very good. The only thing that redeemed this one for me was Tuc Watkins' hilarious performance as Sterling, and I liked Maddie Corman as well. Incidentally, if I were Bob, I would have chosen Sterling by a mile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, but gay","review":"There's nothing in here that would be very interesting if it weren't for the whole gay angle. Alexis Arquette looks a little too caveman-like (the sloping forehead, the lazy jaw) to be the object of so much affection. The only one in the entire movie who seemed really gay to me was the groom! But despite all those negatives, I would still see it again for the performance of Christian Maelen. What is he doing lately?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Hilarious Romantic Movie","review":"Well worth buying. I have watched this movie many, many times. For the serious-minded, it is an excellent study on interpersonal relationships. For those who just like fun, it's a rip-roaring laugh-a-minute comedy. You'll find yourself either laughing or grinning ear-to-ear throughout the whole movie. The ending is well-written, pure perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Rom-Com.","review":"It's a cute Rom-Com, 90s style. The characters and situations come off as real. The premise doesn't. But then, this is a Romantic Comedy, so that's a given. Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This one is a definite must see! I absolutely loved thismovie! I only wish I could afford it . .. I am also a student at George Washington University and thought this film was very true the way DC really is. It is hysterically funny, and be enjoyed by straight and gay alike. I urge you to either buy this movie or go out and rent it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I Think I Do\\" have to see this movie again!","review":"As a student at the George Washington University, I have to say that this was a great movie (not like I'm partial or anything). It was great to see a topic such as this come out of dormitory closets, and into mainstream! Right on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny twists and enjoyable","review":"\\"I think I do\\" Is an entertaining and funny movie. It takes place over years and shows a group of friends in school and in the careers they take on. It all comes to a head when they get back together for the wedding of a friend and the comedy begins. It was well acted, well scripted and the film quality was great. Its not overly sexually graphic and is actually a sweet romantic story that would be great for mixed crowds. It is very funny, not heavy or dark, has no social message about getting sick or addiction. Its about being with the one you love and accepting that some things take time. It is a good investment and a possitive addition to your video collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried, I really tried to like this film...","review":"But for the most part, these actors, (term used lightly), could not act their way out of a wet paper bag. Or was it the script writers that are to blame, because a lot of the script was, well...lame. The story idea was a good way to start this project, but it all just fell apart as this production kept playing. Jan. 2013."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Movie was good. Had seen it many times before. But the quality of the copy was without a doubt the worse of an rental I have ever downloaded from anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Alexis Arquette was a woman","review":"So, this movie was made before Alexis Arquette had transitioned from male to female. It is astonishing to see her back when she was a handsome, masculine dude named Robert. Masculine, now, not butch. I saw this movie back in the 1990s, forgot about it, and rented the other day. It has held up surprising well. The wonderful Lauren Velez and Tuc Watkins turn in great comedic performances. And Alexis is lovable as the neurotic, slightly nebbishy gay boy who has a crush on his allegedly straight roommate. Fun footnote: I lived in Washington, DC, when this film was made, and where it was set. The movie captures accurately the look and feel of Georgetown during the William Jefferson Clinton epoch."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I do","review":"I Do I Think I Do is a delightful comedy. However, the audio is severely wanting, which is irritating at times during the viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This movie is a masterpiece! Every frame is full of real human elements. This movie should be seen by every budding director. It will teach them how to write characters. The acting is just fabulous. The story (friends gather at a wedding and become involve in various triangles) is refreshingly adult, and it's a wonderful life-affirming look at love, laughter, and commitment. It also has a wonderful soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute gay formula comedy - based on straight \\"who-loves-whom\\"","review":"A cute romantic comedy set around a wedding reunion of college roommates, where old crushes and frustrations are awakened. While formulaed, I found myself chuckling with the good timing of the curves. Like modern video, you must believe that everyone but kooky relatives have near-model looks. One well acted sensitive scene near the end brought a tear and a smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"We waited years for this","review":"A comedy that portrays gay relations in an unexpected way.No shame and a happy ending!A wonderful cast,that bring the talents of Christian Maelen to the general public,tell a tale of intrigue,ingenue and general mishaps that leaves you feeling sad,happy and ecstatic all at once!If you can survive the train-station scene,then \\"Beaches\\" is child's play!(Who wouldn't like to have someone say that to them?)May Christian flourish as an actor(and as a gorgeous man!)and show us what he's really capable of.A MUST.For everyone.How's about a sequel guys?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Painting Composition Information","review":"I bought this book after having borrowed it from the library.

Fortunately, lightbulbetc.com offers the bulbs at a competitive price. The shipping charges seemed a bit high; but they arrived in excellent condition and work perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but.....","review":"The rating is based on the units function. It does exactly what is claimed for it, and is easy to use. The only drawback is the method (glue) used to secure the adjustment dials to their screws . On my unit, the altitude dial broke loose from the screw due to glue failure, but I reattached it with superglue and it works well.I would recommend the star pointer to astronomy buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad very bad finder quality","review":"is a product of low quality, my telescope nextar8 brings one, which stopped working 15 days after starting to use it.

One lite was complete but the other had no hardware for mounting to the wall. I had to drill some holes and fix some screws 'creatively to get the second one mounted. However, the hardware was such crap that it was easier to mickey mouse the installation, and it is much more secure than the recomended hardware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Light","review":"This light was easy to install and a surprisingly bright wall sconce.

You can find a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Collection","review":"I am just learning about Sarah Vaughn. I discovered her around 2006, and I bought the Sarah Vaughan Anthology collection. I loved her voice instantly. Recently, I have become addicted to her voice, and so I looked through many collections that were out there, as I wanted to get a handle on many of her early recorded works. I thought this collection fit the bill. I have not regretted this purchase, I listen to her all day long, at work (I'm an instructional designer), while I am writing my workshops, etc. I listen to her constantly in my car, and also while cooking for my husband. I'm only 29 years old, but I love this collection with all my heart! It's a great one! I also got the Gold collection. There is so much depth to her voice even in these early great recordings...It's a steal for the price. Get it today if you can get your hands on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Glaring Oversight!","review":"I was thrilled when this set was released. True, it's way overpriced for one half of a season (the ALIAS box sets, for example, offer much more for the money)! But the video and audio are adequately restored and Kevin Spacey, in particular, and most everyone else makes it highly entertaining stuff. However, with this being the ONLY DVD I own that has neither closed captioning or subtitles, I find it to be a CHEAP release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why was it edited?","review":"In the first television showing Kevin Spacey had a wonderful diatribe about how people will eventually rip open the bellies of others for the food inside. In the re-runs a couple of minutes were cut from each episode to make more room for more commercials. For some reason the DVD uses the \\"edited for more commercials\\" versions, so this wonderful scence is missing. You can hear a brief audio segment of the diatribe during the episode where Roger Lococco plays a tape of Mel Proffit in order to drive Susan insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Settle Down","review":"This is not the greatest game ever, as some would like you to believe. This is an OK BBall game. Forget all the great crowd chants and mascots. Over time we all know it's about gameplay. This one is OK. Not even good but OK. I am off to try ESPN, let's hope it's better."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET Game","review":"This game was just what I was looking for. I was reading some other reviews and got kind of nervous because they were saying that this game was sorry. Im glad I got it. The game play is great and the Dynasty mode if fantastic. However, if you enjoy creating teams and players, and want a game just because you like to do that, this is not the game for you. There are about 5 team colors and you dont get to make your uniform like in NCAA Football. The school creating really sucks. But all other parts of the game I love. Great announcing, gameplay, and graphics. I LOVE this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it before you buy it","review":"Allright, I have been an EA sports fan for quite a while now, and because of that, there have been times where I have bought crap that I thought was good because of their name. This leads to this game, I love their football games, Considering that I thought that maybe this game was going to be close to their NCAA College football game, which I cant stop playing; But its not, it's graphics and sound are a good 4/5, but the gameplay and dynasty mode are horrible, its just not fun playing, because sometimes it seems that I have no control of the outcome of the game, please, there are better games to invest your money than this game, so rent it, and learn from my mistake"},{"rating":"2","title":"let's face it,EA will always be #1,even if the game isn't.","review":"I just got this game on December 17.I play with UK and it seems to me that,yes, getting off rebounds are hard to get, but it doesnt really matter. The gameplay is relatively smooth.Don't get espn college or nba bball games,trust EA. There's a reason every game they sell is #1 in the franchise,because they play better and have the most authentic atmosphere.Also,the feature where you are making your own scheduale is interesting.

I picked March madness just because the makers were Ea Sports.I also liked their college football game. Now when I got home andopened and played March Madness I was really dissapointed. I like simulation games and this is far from it. This game is 100% arcade.

In years past i never would have even dream of getting this game. Because of the poor quality of the gameplay and graphics. EA finally got it right they made the gameplay similar to NBA Live,which gives this game a better feel. this game just about every college program you can think of,and authentic looking basketball player, improve rebounding (both defensive and offensive), crowd goes crazy with chants and taunts, improved dynasty mode draft your players to the pros and use them in the NBA Live 2004. A must have for any college basketball fan.

I own both of their albums and listen to them both regularly. After hearing this CD and the unbelievably talented songwriting, awesome musical performance and powerful voice of lead singer Jon Chinn, I think that you too will wonder why these guys are not yet HUGE!

I've been listening to it since I saw a live show. I can't stop listening to it. I would still be listening to it if it weren't for my roommate who finally said \\"Look, these guys are cool but can we listen to something else?\\" So I begrudgingly put in The Bends by Radiohead. They play Ski Instructor on the radio and it simply inspires me to jump around like a lunatic. I usually laugh at air drummers but I find myself snapping the wind right along with Neal... The violin is interesting and fitting with Jon's powerful vocals. I think there's something for everyone on this disc. I suggest you download the mp3 of Deafening and crank it as loud as your PC will allow. Then buy it, because the rest is as great as Deafening is..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A recording that gets you excited about rock again.","review":"This CD pulses. All the sounds are not pretty, that's how this band works it- but everything is comtemplated and calculated to reach the end result: Living modern pop/rock that breathes, clenches -kicks you around a bit. This is not \\"end all\\" recording- I don't think they'd want it that way, but it does remind us why we started listening to rock in roll in the first place- this is music that you feel in your gut.

It's a fun game if your into that kind of thing, but I was looking for something more then just puzzle after puzzle. I like the games when you are actually the character and are having to complete task.... like the laura croft tomb raider legend game.

Much better than the original issue, which was only one CD (for the record, I have the single disc soundtrack as well).

There's also a cooperative mode where you can play with 2 players, and play in completely new missions.Although I have been stuck at times, I look around and find my way to the next part. One of the only things I don't like about this game is how you have to unlock multiplayer.

The best part of this game is the fact that its not just another typical run-and-gun gameplay but instead allows you complete missions is various ways by using the included stealth elements. It reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid but with a lot more engaging action. The graphics are excellent, from the detailed backdrops to the real-life likenesses of the characters. The sound if very good and I was for one was glad to hear the real voice talents of the actors portrayed in the game.

The worst part about this game is the other multiplayer modes, like VS, it has the worst camera angle because it's only on ONE screen and the play area is only the size of the screen, there is no where to hide or make traps like place trip bombs, etc. A really, REALLY disappointing VS mode, especially compared to Nightfire. The new Bond view is actually a good change.

However, the one thing I do not like about it is that you cannot talk to people on the internet during a game. In order to talk, you need to buy the USB Headset which can cost $25-$40. If you have more than one online game, like SOCOMII or Champions of Norram: Realms of Everquest, than it is worth it to buy the USB Headset. If you own one of the other James Bond games, like Nightfire, then this game would be great for you. The multiplayer isn't great, but not bad either. It could use a little work and give you some more locations. Even though it costs $50, it was well worth my money. It will be well worth your money too.

However, it ends up working very well.James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing has great varity. The third person view makes stelth easier. The manual aim feature (like in Nightfire) puts you in frist-person ofr precies aiming. There is a fairly forgiving auto-aim feuture, as well. There are driving levels, with a better variety of cars. There are also more explosions, more opportunities to use tight-ropes, and the levels have multiple ways of being beaten.James bond 007: Everything or Nothing is one of the best games around.

All you have to do is press a button to lock on and another to shoot, it is that simple. Third person is terrible and not a real shooter. You dont do anything. Multi and Co-op are terrible and no challenge and way to boring. If you can stand the early levels which I couldnt I heard there are driving levels.Why cant EA make a good game like Goldeneye only with bots. In goldeneye there were great levels lots of different guns and gadgets, interesting missions, and all the levels where there are parts you dont go till higher difficulty settings.

Diane Ladd, who plays Mama Angeli, hits an all-time low. The competent, often excellent actress gives an amazingly terrible performance and happens to sport the single, most awful Italian accent ever in the history of movies.

You can easily get so far ahead of the field on the first day of the tournament, but you still have to play the other three days, with no competition it kind of sucks.The next game should have an increase if difficulty as the season goes on, not just be a little longer or difficult pin placement.

Well you can even make the player look like you. Mine is almost a spitting image. Good looking guy!

It stretched into the overall length, and with it went the tension.Patellar straps are relatively cheap (compared to full-blown braces), so I'm not crying a river, I'll continue to use the Mueller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good support but elastic stretches too much","review":"The main issue with this product was that because it uses elastic it stretches out as you play/run. I play basketball a couple times per week, and have had tendonitis issues for the last couple months. I find that this works well for a game or two, but that I constantly have to re-tighten it as I play. I don't know how it works for running, but would not recommend it for basketball or other sports that involve jumping. I ended up exchanging it and got an Ace knee wrap that doesn't use elastic and finds it gives me much more support as I run and cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't stay put","review":"I think my leg may have been on the smaller side of what this contraption is made for because it just would not stay in place while I was running! I loved the straps small size and, for the first few minutes it would be of obvious help but it slid down my leg and required constant adjusting. I ended up returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compression too tight","review":"I bought this as a preventative measure as I train for a half marathon. I've used other compression bands in the past and they were a good support without changing my stride. This band restrained my stride and actually caused my knee to hurt more than using nothing at all. I used it a couple times and now it retires in my closet permanently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patella Strap","review":"Strap has done exactly what it was bought for. Has helped the pain in the injured knee during athletic competitions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stay on!","review":"I was all excited to try out my new Pro-Tec Knee Strap. I put it on before my workout and everything seemed great, it fit perfect. But the moment I started running it fell off. I put it back on and it fell off again and again. So I decided to try it another time when I was taking a class at my gym and sure enough as soon as I started to move around, anything more than walking I could immediately feel it slipping. The Pro-Tec Knee strap seemed great, but not if you want to use it to work out. I guess I will just order a new TruFit Knee Strap. I've used one for years and loved it, but it needs to be replaced and now I'm regretting trying something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong Item","review":"I already have a Patella Knee Strap and was very satisfied with it. When I went jogging or cycling it pretty much removed all pain. Hence, I ordered another to rotate them. However, I got the wrong item---a knee strap combined with a rubber knee brace which I did not need nor want. Considering the low cost, it was too much of a hassle to return it, so I gave it away. So, I would give it a good score if you actually get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap! Save ur money","review":"I brought this thinking this would help suppress the pain, instead it only aggravated it.. I ended up throwing this away in the trash..It's very uncomfortable to wear and it make the pain worse during long period wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the size description?","review":"How can anybody purchase this item when there is no information stating what size you should get? I cant gamble on buying an item not knowing whether I should get a small, medium, large, or extra large."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent knee band","review":"I have been using a knee band like this for the last 6 years. My old ones finally wore out so I replaced them with exactly the same brand. It is great for knee problems, especially chondromalcia patella. I am a regular runner and don't ever run without my knee bands in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that effective","review":"I don't know that this brace is really doing much for me because there isn't much to it. I think it almost needs a top piece as well. I've gone back to leg weight exercises to strengthen my arthritic knee with better results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"My doctor Told me I had torn my meniscus. I really didn't want to get any surgery on it so I decided to try and order a patella strap to see how it worked. I ordered 2 different straps but this one worked PERFECTLY. I can now play basketball, airsoft, workout and do just about everything I could to before the tear. I would definitely recommend this to anyone else whom also has a bad knee and is sick of being held back. Trust me this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shampoo Bar Ever","review":"I absolutely love these shampoo bars! They make the most luxurious lather and leave my hair so soft and silky!

It is just meandering Indian sitar music that never comes to any conclusion. I really liked volume one and am a fan of the show, but this really was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xena cd volume 4","review":"I'm a huge fan of this show. I have all 3 prior cd's. I enjoyed this cd more than the 1st because it doesn't have all the funeral durges of volume one. I like the Indian music. Definitely a cd of last season's (music) trip through India. If you're into it I suggest buying it here. I wish I did because I payed way too much elsewhere. It would've been even better if they would've added the theme song to this volume for the heck of it. In my opinion at Amazon's price it's a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Music on this Soundtrack","review":"This CD has a number of tracks with Asian and Indian influence. It's a really great mix of tracks for those of you who know and love Xena, and for those non-Xena people who enjoy \\"World Music\\" sounds.This is the first Xena soundtrack I've bought, and because of it's beautiful music, it won't be the last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've read this far, you might as well buy it.","review":"If you bought the first and second soundtracks, you might as well buy this one too. Joe Lo Duca's composing just gets better and better. It's hard to imagine that this soundtrack is for a television show. Much of the success of Xena can be attributed to him...and the coolness that is Joxer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Xena Soundtrack Yet","review":"If you're going to buy any xena soundtrack make sure it is volume four. So far it is the only xena soundtrack that has not disappointed me. The first two volumes are okay, the third was very disappointing, least to say I have not and probably will never purchase it. This fourth volume, however, is good with the exception of the last track 'I'm in heaven'. What was Joseph Lo Duca thinking? The Chin, India, and Adventures in the Sin Trade sections are the best. Listen to tracks like--Caesars' Mark,the bath, Tataka, traveling with Eli, Xena v. Alte, Released/Spirit Dance and Everybody Dance Now. It would have been perfect if Lo Duca had included tracks from episodes of Sacrifice and A good Day. They are not found on any of the previous soundtracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Ginny","review":"Finally some italian rap...besides that other guy.The Unit is sick and i bet they will be the next big rap group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible book - As entertaining as it was informative","review":"\\"Wow\\" is all I could say after I read this book. With the Internet and email so commonplace, it made me realize we can either get on board or get left behind.This book shows and tells in simple terms how to put this technology to use to put more money into our pockets. From \\"Steps to Making a Simple Photo Brochure\\" to how to build a website and much, much more...this book has it.The author, Bob Boog, has been in sales since 1978 and from reading this book it is obvious that he knows his stuff. He teaches hard cold experience: what's worked and what hasn't and not just theory.This book is really a must-read for sales people and business people who want to use technology to increase their revenue. I read Bob's first book, \\"Selling Homes 1-2-3\\" and was so informed and entertained that I had to get this book, too. I'm an avid reader...and this book is up toward the top of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xmas gift for a huge Pats fan","review":"You made a Patriots fan in my family very happy on Christmas morning.Thanks for getting it to me on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers Every Inhabited Continent","review":"Bigfoot, Yeti, Yowie, Orang Pendek, and Agogwe. All the most recognizable names in the world of mystery Cryptozoological primates are here. But the not so recognizable names really sale this book. Names like the Jimbra, Ngoloko, Tjangara, and the Tano Giant. And then there are those you may be a little more familiar with, like the Alma and the Didi. How about the Chinese Wildman, or the Yeren? Whether familiar or not, its probably mentioned in this guide. But that is also one of the shortcomings of the Field Guide; so many subjects, too few eyewitness accounts. My one reason for not giving it a 5 star rating.

God Bless."},{"rating":"2","title":"what to expect when your not expecting","review":"The book and the author are simply AWESOME!! A wonderful book written straight from the heart!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Book Description!","review":"The book description belies the content of the book. There is nothing about Christianity in the book description, but this book is all about dedicating your life to Jesus, with prayers in Jesus' name. As a non-Christian, I am extremely annoyed that I had to buy the book before I found out that it was not only not relevant to me, but contrary to my religious beliefs.If you *really* want to find out about \\"What to Expect When You're Not Expecting,\\" check out something like \\"Experiencing Infertility.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What not to expect from this book.","review":"Please don't buy this book looking for a comprehensive book on infertility with Christian overtones. This book really should be listed only under the sprituality or inspiration section. It has no realistic information about infertility. While I empathize with Mrs. Canady's experiences, having had my own, I did not find comfort in her words. Some people, however, may find her comforting as long as they know the book does not give you scientific or medical answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"looking for answers.","review":"This book is not what i expected at all it was more religiousthen i expected.Its for people that are searching for answers through god.I thought it was more of infertility infomation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I could barely get through the first few chapters. The book is more of a religious book than a book on infertility. There are prayers and scripture throughout the book designed to open your eyes to God and trust Him in your quest for a baby. Although I was raised Catholic, I find this book to be highly annoying. I found the author to be completely over the top. She was obsessed with becoming pregnant and now she is trying to force her religious enlightenment on her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I read the other reviews before purchasing and held out hope that this book would be helpful and comforting. Instead, I found it to be really over the top. Not only does this book have numerous grammatical errors, but the author drones on and on about how she became obsessed with her inability to not have a child. I can understand that somewhat as we all deal with infertility in different ways. I'd say that nearly one-half of this book includes pages for journaling and writing your thoughts. Prayers are also included in each section. As an active Catholic, I didn't really get much out of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I'm sure this book is very powerful and helpful for some. However, be aware that this book does not provide any medical information but instead discusses the author's feelings and frustrations and how her faith in God helped her through infertility. The book is heavily religious. The few reviews I read did not provide this information, and I expected something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOLY OVERKILL BIBLE THUMPERS!","review":"OK. I tried to be flexible getting into this book, but I don't know about the whole preaching part of it. What a waste of money. Glad I got mine used.

It helped me in areas that most books do not. I highly recommend this to those experiencing infertility or any type of adversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Basketball Sim but NO 3-Point Shootout!","review":"EA generally does a good job with sports titles. NBA Live 2004 is a bit of a regression for the company. The game is servicable, the graphics OK and the gameplay average. But, coming from such a highly regarded video game maker this game should have been much better. For instance, the menu and navigation are confusing to say the least. Trying the Dynasty mode's fantasy draft it took me awhile to learn how to order my picks and positions. The absence of a 3-point shootout really takes away from this title for me. What EA did include was a practice mode which I couldn't care less about. Bottom Line, EA Sports NBA Live 2004 is not worth the money but maybe a rental. Hopefully '05 will be better. Not Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Did you ever seea game soooo fun. you could sit in front of your tv and school AI with shaq and Kobe. What i thought was cool was in nba live 2003 all the teams were even (you could beat the lackers with the cavs w/o lebron) now the lakers would kill them. Also there is so many things you can change to make the game better. For example if your really bad then change the game sliders so that all yours are 100 and all theres are 10 and you would make every shot! last i want to say is that i gave it a 4 only because if it had the madden format it would be the best game ever even better then madden and i'm not kidden.

The band might be on, but the person doing the recording is not. No bass, no drums, tinny guitar etc... With Johnny Thunders it's just the opposite. There are dozens of soundboard quality recordings available, but very few where Johnny is lucid enough to give a quality performance. This album, recorded at the Roxy in 1987, is rarity in that the sound quality and Johnny are both firing on all cylinders. The band features 2 of Thunder's former New York Dolls bandmates; the late Jerry Nolan (arguably punk rocks greatest drummer)and Arthru \\"Killer\\" Kane on bass. Any rock fan needs one Johnny Thunders live album in their collection and this one will do just fine.But let me warn you, once you hear Johnny...there's no going back.Rock on & R.I.P>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this set","review":"I love Caleca.

Just be careful when you microwave as the mug handles get very hot, and the bowls do too. Use potholders and you'll be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully written book","review":"Really, the only problem this book has besides not being written for \\"Average Joe\\" is lack of character development. Many of the background characters recieve little to no description, and the main characters are sparsly described in places. It would seem that Benford concentrated on the locations and technology in the story more then the characters.This isn't a book for your everyday reader. It takes a lot of work and time to understand the details of why things work like they do, especially because most of the technology used in the book is based on cutting edge theoretical physics. In spite of these shortcomings, this is a well written book, but not one that can be simply picked up and read. If you want to read this book, be prepared to set aside a substantial amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Belief","review":"I would like to know what the writer of this novel has done with the real Gregory Benford. I honestly can't credit that this book was written by the author of the Galactic Center series.This exercise was at best reminiscent of an early Andre Norton - heroine plus furry companion wanders through a jungle and some mild, uninvolving perils.I started skip reading - about 1 paragraph in 4 - at 70 or so pages into the book. I know I didn't miss anything in character or plot development and it let me get to the denouement (such as it was) a lot faster.Amazon insist on a minimum one star rating. This novel was so poor that even that rating is one star too many. Bad book - stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and descriptively challenged!!!","review":"It is seldom that an author truly upsets me with their writing. Benford has become one of those with this book. The story had its good moments, however those moments can be summed up in fifty pages or less. I do appreciate a good descriptive author, but in this book there were too many that didn't truly related to the story and dragged on for 'beyond infinity.' If I am to compare this book to a movie, I would compare it to a pornographic film without sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Weak and Silly","review":"Lots of interesting ideas but an extremely weak plot. Barely worth reading for the ideas. Supposedly happens a billion years in the future, but the changes are weakly justified and, except for the scale of the Earth's having been moved closer to the center of the galaxy, could have taken place in a few thousand years from now. The climax is rushed and silly - Life as super-duper all-powerful force."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just didn't connect with my mind's eye","review":"I'm a big SF fan, and it takes a lot for me not to like a book. But this was a truly painful read. With the story set in the far future, Benford's challenge was to convey aspects of the universe that lie well beyond our conceptual horizon, such as multiple dimensions, creatures based on magnetic fields rather than molecules, and the \\"galactic mind\\". In my opinion, he fails miserably; his prose is simply not literary enough to handle such difficult-to-put-into-words concepts. Nothing about the descriptions \\"sing\\". No grab-you-and-hold-you plot swings.In the Afterward, Benford writes that he might do a sequel. Hopefully it will be cowritten by a \\"wow-can-that-guy-write!\\" type author like William Gibson. At the very least, Benford needs a much more aggressive \\"you-can't-write-that...it-just-doesn't-make-sense!\\" editor. A lot of the shortcomings of this book might have been headed off by such.All in all, a real glad-I'm-finally-done-with-that-book! experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible and boring","review":"I found it incomprehensible, chaotic and boring. Character development was non-existent. Description of scenery was unclear.The premise of people battling machines with clay overlords weighing in for reasons unclear, \\"you are not a high enough phylum to understand\\", in a region composed of somehow solidifiedspace-time is just plain silly. [I wont mention the magic genetic bullet installed in us by the \\"Ancient Ones\\" that saves the day...]The one-two page chapter literary device does not work well without continuity.Very strange for a writer of Mr. Benford's caliber and capabilities, I expect better from him.Maybe it's me, I couldn't understand \\"Dalghren\\" either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Round and round with no direction","review":"This book, like many Benford offerings seems to mistake confusion for art.

Every key scene from the movie is represented in some fashion, and the game's spooky musical score is on par with Hollywood's best. Unfortunately, while the game is a joy to sit back and take in, it isn't much fun to interact with. The movie has been transformed into a third-person action game that mainly involves fighting the same cookie-cutter enemies over and over again in the same cramped environments. To make matters worse, various other dubious design decisions bring about fits of frustration along the way that really shouldn't be in a game that only takes about four hours to complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a good cd.","review":"I love this cd.

I had already bought the sacd when it came out a few years back(2003).I just loved it. Now to have the DVD is just icing on the cake. To see them play and talk to each other is really something special. it's like father and son the way they look at each other and you can see the respect they both have for each other too. Albert is genuinely proud of Stevie and vise versa. They created a session of music with the help of their supporting cast that will be one for the ages; it will be hard to beat.We lost 2 of the best period. Thank you Stax for this masterpiece. My only complaint is it would have been nice to have a 5.1 surround track on the DVD. Now what would really make this PERFECT is to put this session on Bluray with a 5.1 lossless track. Maybe some day it will happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I Could Have Been There","review":"Albert King and SRV appeared on the Canadian TV show 'In Session' and the result was incredible. The music itself is really good, with two great musicians playing the tunes they loved. But it's the dialogue between Albert and SRV that puts this over the top.Albert's story about Stevie sitting in with him about 10 years earlier when he was just a skinny kid in Austin was amazing. And while SRV was coming into his own at the time of the session, he was still paying a lot of respect to Albert. There was this aspect of passing the baton from one generation of blues players to another about this session.Finally if the combination of 'Who Is Stevie' and 'Pride & Joy' doesn't have you smilin' and hummin' along - then you just don't like the blues.You can't go wrong with this CD. In addition to the good music the recording is also pretty realistic. I keep wondering what it would have been like to be in the studio when this session was recorded..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"If you love guitar blues this is truly a must have IMHO. The sound is great, but i wish it was on blue ray. To watch the two of them play is just incredible. Albert gives Stevie a lot of advice and praise.

It seems to me the more senses involved in the experience the better the enjoyment of the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Licks","review":"Two types of SRV fans: blues lovers and classic rockers.

Think of it! All the great established blues players loved Stevie and it was because Stevie had magic. What a pity he had to die after he'd cleaned up his act. He was just a boy when he started out and everyone recognized his talent. The fact that Albert King did this record with Stevie Ray Vaughan is living proof of Stevie's great talent. One of my fav's of Stevie's is Tax man - not on this album and originally written by the beatles but when they sang it - it just didn't have the pizazz that Stevie's voice lent it. Any case, this album is great if you are fans of these two blues men.If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.If you get too cold I'll tax the heat,If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passin it on","review":"Saw this on tv years ago.

A small chapter at the end of the book owned up to some of the serious back problems that are, in fact, serious and would need special treatment sometimes (rarely) even surgery.

The book looks at research done on sufferers of back pain and by the end of it you have a whole new outlook on what has been causing your pain and, most importantly, a new way to work with that pain.If you suffer from back issues, I hope you buy this book.

Sales were very strong, but fans were disappointed in the overall product with its VERY poor graphics, constantly flickering ghosts, the \\"wonk\\" sound Pac-Man made when he ate a \\"video wafer\\", the bleeps and bloops when Paccy ate a ghost/power pellet/special treat, the weird layout of the maze, and the notorious and infamous Pac-Man \\"death scene\\" sound effect.

What Atari was making when concieved to market this pile of junk for a game I don't know. Yes as Law said there is terrible sound effects with the \\"Wonk\\" sound, terrible graphics and poor control execution, also the same map repeats itself over and over again. This game should be picked up by the U.S. intelligence agencies and used to torture people during interrogation. If you see this game say a prayer and walk away quickly because it is certainly from the Devil. The only reason I gave this game two stars was because there is some skill too it as the ghosts get faster and harder to escape, but that is being generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud","review":"This seller did not leave accurate information.

The graphics looked nothing like the arcade version and are among the worst for an Atari 2600 game, even for the consoles limitations. This game is still playable and fun, but I'd recommend buying Ms. Pac-Man or Jr. Pac-Man over this, but it's still not bad.

The only Original Toa you can play are Tahu and Kopaka, and then you play all the Toa Nuva in turn EXCEPT Kopaka Nuva. Oh well.Still, don't be put off by video game review websites or some lousy customer reviews. It IS a fun game, has some challenging parts, and has good graphics(not amazing, but still good).

In that sense, it is a pity that prof. Hobsbawm, who is admittedly a prolific writer, invalidates any thesis he would have liked to present in this book by using marxist philosophy in writing history. By focusing on Russia as being the determining force of 20th century history, he presents a distorted view of what were the central issues in international relations in the 20th century, of which Russia was only one of several.

For sure it would be better then and certainly more accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't become a communist","review":"I may not be an expert as I'm only 15 years old but here goes what I think about this book. It's Hobsbawm's view of History and it's strongly influenced by the remains of Hobsbawm's commitment to the communism I think this may have twisted his vision. This is very bad because so many people read the book and sometimes when you don't have enough knowledge you are influenced by the author's thoughts and his vision becomes your vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was dumbstruck and amazed by its comprehensiveness","review":"I come across this book when I am studying to pass the exams to become a diplomat and I realize that it is not only a history book, but a 20th century reference book that covers most of its socio-economic-cultural \\"événements\\".

The relative lack of footnotes and references (compared to the earlier three books in the series) attests to that. Also, although this isn't the same scholarly work as the first three books, the writing style is just as recondite -- there are better, easier ways to get at the history of the 20th Century!His account of the role of the Soviet Union merits reading, if only because Hobsbawm is a Marxist, and so he has a lot of sympathy for the Soviets. With the Cold War over and the USSR dead, it's actually quite interesting to read viewpoints from the other side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marxist Propaganda","review":"This book is written by an avowed Marxist, and as such, neglects to mention the horrors of Soviet Russia. Not only that, Ol' Eric discusses how horrible capitalism is, even though it was only because of capitalism that he was able to publish this waste of paper. He does not spend much time at all on World War II, and has the gall to called Richard Nixon a horrible president (which he was) without heaping abuse upon Stalin or any other Communists. The book also glosses over most historical events and goes for the \\"Big Picture\\" of history. I hated this book. Until I read it, I actually enjoyed learning about history. Now I am not so sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Age of Extremes, A twentieth -Century Life","review":"It is hard to believe that this book,\\"autobiography\\" is written by one of the gratest living historians.Not because of the awkward sentences but because of the obvious lack of depth.

Hobsbawn takes on what he calls the short 20th century, from the beginning of WWI to the effective end of Stalinism in Europe.Hobsbawn combines crack knowledge of historical details with a will to look at the big picture, and of the political and cultural trends which paint it. I learned lots in both regards - about specific historical events, as well as about sensible interpretations of the course of the 20th century. Hobsbawn is quite obviously on the left-wing, which though, I think, colors only his interpretations, but not his facts. Additionally, this book is very vividly written, which guides the reader more quickly from cover to cover than the hefty number of pages would have one expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Take","review":"20th Century world history from the perspective of a communist historian. It is a great accompinanment toTony Judt's book, Postwar, which describes Europe after WWII. Both books speak to the development of democracy and socialism (including communism) as new governing models although Hobsbawm's book expands the contrast beyond Europe to the whole planet. Hobshawn is no Communist apologist but neither is he a repentent Communist and it is this tension that gives the book it's drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini light with a Big punch!","review":"This mini gizmo I found to be one of those great things that come in small packages.

In practice this doesn't work as well as I had hoped. The spot illuminated by this light is small enough to make it annoying to keep it on the subject of interest. The quality of the light is very blue, causing eyestrain if used for long periods. And the earpiece is somewhat uncomfortable and hard to adjust. On the plus side, the light is very handy for working under the desk when cables need to be moved, because it frees both hands and provides plenty of light to locate and orient plugs and such. And it's very handy to have a small flashlight in a dark office even if you don't hang it over your ear. I found it a worthwhile purchase even if it didn't turn out to be as useful as I had hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a reading light","review":"There are some serious flaws with this unit. The most serious is that with the batteries inserted, the slightest bump - which means something as simple as tossing it into a laptop bag - activates the on-button and turns the light on. So there it is, draining away the cell batteries as it sits inside your bag.Second, it doesn't really fit comfortably on the ear if you wear glasses. It's awkward and falls off easily.Third, there is no way this has sufficient illumination to read with, due to the limited ability to direct the light where you want it to go, especially wearing glasses.UPDATE: I subsequently purchased the Kandle LED Book Light from amazon for my Kindle 1, and it works MUCH better.

You can take others advice that have probably played about, maybe, 1 bond game in their entire life, as to me, but DO NOT come home crying when you buy this game and you find out it's DEFINITELY not as good as the others. If you are 'oh so desperate' to play this game, RENT IT! Then you'll see for yourself.<br />I give it- (not even 1 star... but the computer thingy can't do halves. lol)<br />"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Bond. Your games suck","review":"Is it just me, or is that the 007 games have just been getting worse and worse since Goldeneye? In fact, with the latest addition to the Bond franchise, \\"Everything or Nothing\\", you could actually say that \\"Everything\\" about it is \\"Nothing\\". This game is just plain dumb. I thought when I just had herd about this game \\"oh great! a third-person Bond game\\". I was highly mistaken. This game has terrible gameplay, terrible controls, and terrible cutscenes. Bond fans, gamers or not, will be highly dissappointed with this game, because it has NOTHING compared to Agent Under Fire, and Goldeneye. This game's predecessor, Nightfire, sucked equilly as much, and if they make another Bond game after this, it will flop so badly that the entire franchise will go out the window. People tell me that it's \\"my opinion\\", but theyr're wrong. This is THE opinion. This game is a waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This game was good allround. The Multiplayer fetuer was very good and indepth. It evan had it's own story line wich was cool.

Very good game"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Or Nothing.","review":"This is the best Bond game so far. Between the gadgets,guns and cars I don't know what I like best about this game. they even use real names of guns unlike other games, i love it how you get the aston martin and the cayenne suv and a motorbike. the controls are simple enough that you can easily pick it up and start playing and after twenty-thirty minutes of high octane playing you have beaten a level or two. Everything Or Nothing is one of those games where some levels are easy but the ones that are hard...are hard but not so hard to where you just can't beat it and try over and over again. this is an incredible game."},{"rating":"2","title":"spectaular game","review":"the best game in gaming history this is a wonderfull game with great graphs a good wide range of weaponds ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Tough","review":"this game is very fun. u view it from a 3rd person mode which is wierd because all of the other 007 games have been in 1st person. it makes stealth easier though. u also get 2 do more than in the other games such as ride on a motor cycle, and use more gadgets. once u get 2 about the 5th level it gets a little hard though. if ur a 1st time gamer, then this is not a game 4 u. but if ur experienced, u can blow by it easily.overall this game is very fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this game.","review":"Total dissapointment. Issues with freezing during gameplay and disk read errors cancel out any fun on the ice.

You can \\"boost\\" your team at the selection screen making them faster and your goalie better. So play a realistic game of dump-and-chase grinding it out in the corners or have 10 breakaways and 20 one-timers a game, it's up to you. Either way, the game looks and sounds great and is a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hockey game bar none, but no XBox Live support","review":"This game is the best hockey simulation on the market. There is a long learning curve, especially for \\"advanced\\" moves with or without the puck, but as one review says anything that's worth it is hard to learn. Once you learn the controls, it is awesome. Almost every setting in the game is adjustable, so don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away, just play with the settings. Dynasty mode is great, and so is the Stanley Cup celebration if you win it! There is no XBox Live support for this game, as with other EA titles, because EA and Microsoft refuse to play nice with each other in the online gaming market. Until they do, it's us the consumer that will end up getting screwed as usual. Get this game, but if there is no Live support in 2005 and forward, I for one will refuse to be a pawn in the MS EA power struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!

This was the kind of book that as you read, the story gets more and more involved, so it is hard to put the book down. I could really visualize the characters, all of them, but especially Ben Stillmen; the marshall, and Crystal. The way the author described the things like the smell of tobacco, whiskey, coffee or the air was so concrete you could feel how much the characters enjoyed these things. He made me want to sit outside in the crisp mountain air, chew tobacco and drink whiskey in my coffee. The way he described the landscape of the Hi-line was sensational.

To be honest, I was surprised that the second album lived up to the quality of the first Zero 7 album, because THAT one has to be the best chillout music ever made. (And believe me, that's saying a lot for me.)This new disc is decidedly more upbeat, which is a bit of a disappointment in itself. (I was looking for more stuff to take the stress out of my day.) But, I am always a fan of a band that is willing to take a chance and to grow, rather than stick to their standard formula. The music is good, even if not as expected. Roll the dice and give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"When you fall in love with an artist you naturally want everything they've made. And even when they grow and try new things you open your mind to it, knowing that they've still got 'that sound'.... well Zero 7 has lost it. Too much experimenting and not enough focus. Album is all over the place and lacks stylistic cohesiveness. I bought the 'throw it all away' single that has a video and 2 b-sides as well. The only song that kind of works is that single. Otherwise, all other songs on album & b-sides are a folk mishmosh of odd sounding Carol King, Beatles and Mamas & Papas songs. I miss the soothing creamy vocals and how they were well proportioned to the innovative electronic music. If they stray any farther from the 'downtempo' style we all know and love, they will surely lose more fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"hegmannreview","review":"This group's first 2 CDs were tranquil, soothing, smart, innovative and just darned interesting. In marked contrast we have Garden, their latest release. I have barely been able to listen to this 2 times, with plenty of skipping forward. This album, despite its name is full of harsh sounds, grating singing and some annoying song endings. I am saddened by this release, as we listen to their other CDs in our office regularly. Garden will be placed on the shelf, where it shall stay, save for moments of masochistic urges."},{"rating":"1","title":"awww, what a disappointment","review":"i've loved zero 7 forever. their first two albums, are faaaantastic. this, however, was not. i don't like it b/c it's a bit different from their other two, i don't like it b/c i simply thing the songs are just overall too boring! i'm all about artists changing their style if they want, it's their music, but...i don't know, i could barely get through a couple listens of the entire album. i had to give up.(good thing they totally redeemed themselves big time, on 'yeah ghost'!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"pales in comparison to earlier work","review":"The only song on ths album I find myself going back to is the instrumental \\"Seeing Things,\\" and that track isn't even representative of Zero 7. Simple Things is a far superior album with some excellent melodies and instrumentation. The Garden doesn't even come close. There isn't even a \\"Warm Sound\\" to redeem things like on the overall mediocre When It Falls. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid, disappointing pile of poo - save your money","review":"I have really enjoyed Zero 7's previous releases a lot and thought they were great in concert. I was looking forward to this release, but it is really a major disappointment. In deference to my respect for Zero 7's past releases, I've given this CD several listens, with the hopes that it would grow on me, but each listen merely reinforces my original opinion. This is not just a \\"not good\\" album; it is a BAD album. If I could give it zero stars, I would. With the exception of the first song, which is ok (in a relative sense), the rest of the CD is as bland as anything I've heard in a long time. The songs have no hooks, go nowhere and even good singing can't redeem bad songwriting. This is one of the most disappointing CDs I've ever purchased. I'm going to sell it to the used CD store pronto before too many reviews get published and there is no resale value for this steaming pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointing...","review":"I ran out and bought this cd the very day it came out. Then sat listening anxiously for something to stir inside of me. Alas, nothing. A few weeks later, still nothing. A month later, I tried again. I yawned... Then I got up and cleaned the kitchen finding that more interesting. When I first started listening to Zero 7, I was drawn, pulled, attached to their music. I got it, it got me--we connected. My friend Mel asked me the other day how this cd was and I let her listen to it; she yawned and said, \\"I guess they've lost it\\". Should they release another cd, I'd borrow it from the library first and then buy it only if I really love it. But this cd was deeply disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone Commercial","review":"I used to be a fan, but the damn anti piracy front end software on When it Falls will not allow me to create a custom CD from my selected cuts.

Relaxing but exciting, pleasant melodies with great musical textures. I strongly recommend to anyone who has an enjoyment of fine music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It needs a chance","review":"It seems there a lot of mixed feelings about this album. I think it is quite good, yes a departure from Simple Things, but different is not bad it is just different. I will admit at first I had mixed feelings about it, but after a few listens it really grew on me. I think it could be their best album yet. I do miss the vocals of Sophie Barker, but change is sometimes a good thing. It is nice to see a band move away from the more typical sounds of this genre. The acoustic guitars really add a nice touch. The most important ingredient is still here, the ethereal atmospheric sounds. If you keep an open mind and give it a chance you may really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolved, engaging and smooth...","review":"I seriously over-played their previous \\"When it Falls\\". The first few tracks of this CD had me hooked, especially with José González collaborating. If you haven't heard of him, check out 'Veneer', he's a true talent. Then the album took me into new stuff for Z7. Interesting lyrics, always tuneful, and the production is again terrific. Some nice sampling effects subtley enhance the careful mix. It's wonderful to watch them evolve and resist just 'knocking out' a clone of previous work. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero 7, what have you done?","review":"The ethereal, dreamy, triptronic sounds that we fell in love with on Zero 7's first CD are a distant memory. I bought their latest CD with high hopes (never heard their sophomore effort), and was sorely disappointed. The opening tracks remind me of Steely Dan--ugh. And the rest is a mishmash of cheesy sounds and a much less sensual-sounding result. C'mon, Zero 7. It wasn't broken...why'd you have to fix it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bury it in the Garden","review":"I gotta admit, this album really let me down. It doesnt have the touch that the others have.

Going away from some of the more ambient and instrumental themed tracks of their first two major releases, and choosing to make most of the tracks lyrical and pop'ish.The artist they kept, the eclectic and flexible Sia Furler, and 60's sounding Jose Gonzales add just the right touch to every song they're on!Id have a much easier time finding my least favorite tracks , then my favorites, cause my favorites are pretty much every one!Im proud to see Binns and Hardaker continue to take their music to the next level, a great cd from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zero 7 - The Garden","review":"Zero 7 goes for a stroll through THE GARDEN for their third album, and they seem to find folk inspiration amongst the foliage. Jose Gonzalez appears with his guitar and gentle voice on the opener, \\"Futures,\\" which has an interesting glitchiness towards the end, while \\"Left Behind\\" is much more straightforward in its acoustic simplicity (the electro beat follows right after on \\"Today,\\" though). Sia pulls out the stops for the summery \\"Throw It All Away\\" or the swinging \\"You're My Flame.\\" The horns and easygoing vibe of \\"Your Place\\" bring to mind a jazz combo playing their hearts out for a drunk audience, but only Sia could make a song with a title like \\"Waiting to Die\\" sound positively cheery. While it's not a 100% return to form, it's definitely plants the right seeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great listen","review":"Wonderful array of songs from a group that has a lot of talent.

If you expect them to live up their best, this album will leave you very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed","review":"I love their first CD which is one of my all time favorites. but it seems like they stopped trying...the first song in this album is great, and just kind goes downhill from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jose Gonzalez ruins this CD","review":"Who convinced Jose Gonzalez that he can sing? Trotting him in front of a microphone seems like a cruel fraternity prank, along the lines of convincing a blind friend to take up archery. The problem is pretty simple. He can't, um, you know .... sing. His range is about half an octave and his sense of pitch is so shaky that for the most part he doesn't even pretend he can hold a note. His delivery is halting and almost nervous. The overall effect is of listening to a sixth-grader reading a book report in front of the class. So unless you want to listen to his wavering montone you have to skip a third of the disc.And while I have no problem with the band making a more pop-oriented disc with a brighter chord palette than they used in their previous two releases, the third track is so bad it's actually funny. They seem to have distilled the worst of 80s pop into it. It sounds like it should be played over a montage from a bad teen comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilted Garden","review":"The first track on this new album suggests that Sam Binns and co. are taking a cue from early 70s prog-rock/folk, much as OPETH did with their sublime, beautiful Damnation in 2005. However, the rest of the album retreats back to the soul/lounge styling of the first two albums, but with none of the gorgeous, swooning melodies they offered. The whimsical, kitschy instrumentals from Simple Things are gone as well, replaced by some flat, childish sing-songy pieces like 'Pageant of the Bizarre'. Even a mostly beautiful track like Throw It All Away is marred by an odd chorus. Very disappointing, especially given how great a find Simple Things was when it came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The title should read, \\"The Garden of Hell\\". I loved the first album, the second effort was different but acceptable, but this is beyond description. I don't know what genre this would fall under, but alternative/fusion dance chillout or deep house is miles away from this effort.Binns and Hardaker should have stuck with the formula which had worked for them before. I expected a follow up to Waiting Line, Spinning, Destiny, but got nothing.I should have listened to the sample clips before buying this album, a practice I choose to avoid only for Zero 7. This effort is a major disappointment for me. I guess I'll stick to the first two Cd's and let this one gather DUST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator Music","review":"This is a boring album.The first song, Futures, is deceiving. It is a masterpiece of a song. It blew me away the first time I played it. The end of it is pure electronic bliss. I always turn up the volume here. The rest of the album is nothing like this song. It is largely lounge pop and accessible elevator music. It is not very engaging. It sounds like the well-produced work of a jam band that picked out \\"best of\\" selections in a long, groovy session. There are a couple of interesting sections and songs like \\"If I Can't have You\\", \\"you're my flame\\", and \\"waiting to die\\" are good songs. \\"This Fine Social Scene\\" is a close second to \\"Futures\\". It is very eerie and very good. Unfortunately, the connecting songs are filler. Maybe this band should stick to singles and wait longer between albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALMOST TOTAL GARBAGE","review":"I loved the first Zero 7 Album and thought that their second release \\"When It Falls\\" was a musical masterpiece, however \\"The Garden\\" is just plain awful! This CD is not worth purchasing or even downloading for free, most tracks are just plain corny and soul-less. Absent from \\"The Garden\\" are vocalists Tina Dico, Mozez, and Sophie Barker (dumb idea) who were outstanding on the previous \\"When It Falls\\". I will no longer continue to blindly support any future Zero 7 releases!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fourth book a quadruple bogey!","review":"Troon McAllister, beloved by many for creating Eddie Caminetti and using him so wisely in his first three books, The Green, The Foursome and Scratch, completely missed the ball in Barranca. This book has less than 1/4 of it's pages dedicated to the man we love to see hustle, Eddie. The rest is filled with half-developed characters who we really have no interest in. We spend more time hearing about Mona Bertram's hair care than Eddie's golf hustle with the coffee revolutionary Barranca. While revisiting characters can be difficult the cover says \\" An Eddie Caminetti Novel\\" I don't think it was and wish I had followed the advice of other reviewers who suggested avoiding this one.

After reading The Green, The Foursome, and Scratch, I was willing to do just about anything to get my hands on another Eddie Caminetti novel. For all intents and purposes, this is not an Eddie Caminetti novel. Eddie plays almost a minor role in the story, and there's none of the depthy cleverness of the first three novels as it pertains to the world of golf. Troon McAllister (a.k.a. Lee Gruenfeld) missed the mark on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep into the rough with no hope of redemption","review":"I have followed this series with passion.

I have yet to finish the book! I have read about 80% of it and could not go further. Although some of the commentary about society and corporate sponsoring is amusing, the book was conspicuously lacking enough of Caminetti. I read the books because of HIM. If you want to write social commentary send an editorial to the newspaper or go on Larry King. I paid to read about Eddie and escape the issues of society. I hope that the next (if there is one) is stongly focused around eddie and his adventures.

Although I didn't like the fact that at the end of the game you don't get to go save your brother who was captured by the Japanese. You get a pretty good variety of weapons, although you only get to use two Japanese weapons, with I would like to know more about. The B.A.R. is a good weapon, though you only get to use it in one level, and you don't really nedd it in that level. It would come in handy in other levels though.The multiplayer is fun. You can play online or just with a friend.

The reviews that this game is getting are pathetic! The gameplay is amazing and the action that the missions give make you feel like you were really a young soldier fighting [japanese] in WW2! By the way, the Pearl Harbor mission is awsome! Also, if you're looking for a great time with your friends as you kill (...) in extreme war sequences, this is the game to buy! Theco-op gameplay is fun and i can garauntee a great time. The plot of the game is cool like the one in Frontline but i really think that it would have been better if they would have showed the legendary bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

I learned quite a bit with this book and I commend his effort. It is a book that we needed. Could be a little be deeper, but, once again, it is a non-ending subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not quite up to par with author's Wagner book","review":"The author also wrote a similar book on Richard Wagner, which is better in several ways and indicates how this book could have been improved. First, every Verdi opera, no matter how minor, is givenn some space. I prefer the approach he took in Wagner of omitting the less significant operas. After all, these books are introductions. Next, he has a chapter on different approaches to staging Verdi, but I find this less appealing that having a section on this subject within each opera. There is more integration of analysis with synopsis in this work, whereas the Wagner book has the analysis seperate, which I prefered. Still, this is an enjoyable book and beginning opera fans will benefit highly from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney Party","review":"I bought this game for my six year old daughters birthday, but what a confusing game! I thought it would kind of be like Mario Party - which is pretty easy to play for little kids. I'm an adult and had a hard time getting the gist of the game. It's not very interactive, you don't get to move along a board - it does it for you. Some of the games are fun, but the explanations on how to play are sometimes vague. Even set on easy the computer players are kind of hard. (For a six year old) I wasn't overly impressed with this game, and after Kindom Hearts, kind of dissapointed that Disney would make such a lame game. In my opinion I wouldn't waste the time or money on this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Confusing!","review":"My family loves the Mario Party series and the kids can't get enough Disney. This seemed to be a perfect match.Unfortunately, it took over 3 hours for us to even begin the game after reading screen after screen of confusing instructions. Once the game started, it was difficult to figure out what was going on.There are so many layers to this game that don't seem to match up very well. Others have said that this game is great with persistence, but it's very difficult to keep a 4-year-old engaged in a game that us parents don't quite understand yet.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone with young children or anyone who wants to pop in a game and start playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Mario Party clone, but could have been improved by it.","review":"Disney's Party is, as stated in the title, not a clone of Mario Party. The minigames have more variety and are more skill based rather than button mashing or chance based, but the AI is cheap and merciless and the game has long unskippable scenes topped off with an insistence on tutorial every time you play. You can skip the tutorial, but still. The controls are good, but I just can't recommend this game. It could have been very good, but falls short. It's simply mediocre. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney's \\"potty\\"","review":"AArgh!! Clean, colorful graphics cannot conceal how confusing and bizarre this game is. After placing the disc in and getting to the actual game, it was nearly 1/2 hour!!! before the \\"game\\" even began; endless, boring text instructions seemed to be all there was. I'm appalled at how awful most Disney games for Gamecube are but this one leads the pack in tedious, endless, vague tutorials. Time to flush this \\"potty\\" down."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fun when you're bored","review":"It's good. It's fun, but it's not great. Mario party is a bit more fun...but if you're planning to get this for a little elementary school kid, it might be hard for them. There's some mini games that have math in them and it's a lot to do with education. The instructions at first are a little hard and the gist is hard to get used to.The basic point of the game is to win mini games to get stars to fill up a bingo board. You can also use items bought in shops to fill up the board. There are also power notes which give you an upgrade in mini games, which can be bought in shops or you can get trade an item for three.Overall, it's a fun game when you're bored. Since it's this cheap, I say it's worth getting.

Jurassic 5 is an extremely talented group of emcee's, but I can't help but feel cheated by this EP. Out of the 8 tracks, only 4 are actually real songs. The other four tracks are brief, rather pointless interludes. When I paid $10 for an EP, I expect to get 8 actual songs, which is standard EP length. It's bad enough when an album is full of interludes, but it's ludicrious to put them on an EP. Still, I'll be looking forward to Jurassic 5's new, full length release this fall, which will hopefully contain more actual music from these entertaining emcees.

If you are a fan of Blackalicious or any real Hip-Hop, you should pick this up.My only gripes about this CD is th tracks Setup and Sausage GUt are just \\"filler\\" material. Also In The Flesh (hey, don't get me wrong, this is an excelent track) is edited and edited music gets on my nerves. Lesson 6: The Lecture doesn't really float my boat either. If it was a 6 minute beat production with some solid rhymes I would love it but listening to beats (even good ones like these) can get tired quickly.The rest of the Tracks are great.

I felt the acting was terrible, Sam the 16 year old daughter that the mother's spirit goes into plays a poor part as an adult. Frankly its just too weird seeing the daughter come on to her own dad.Although its not really her, its the mother. I turned this movie off aftering watching half of it.

It brings up many moral and ethical issues that might arise with psychological disorders and traumas. Olivia Thirlby is brilliant and extremely effective in her first role in this film.

I had read many bad reviews and I almost dont buy the game, but they are all wrong, the game is challenging and hard to master, there are more stadiums and teams and more chants. Much of the gameplay was improved, like headers, corners, free kicks, lobs, and even the free style was improved, you can also walk with the ball and perform tricks in any direction just by moving the joystick, just as if you were controlling the ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defenitely buy","review":"This game is great!!!! I must warn you, Off-The-Ball will take some time to master. Once you learn how to use it, you'll be making Beckham-like pinpoint crosses when you're attacking. But over all, the game looks and feels more realistic. Especially when you see all the famous players.4.5/5 Stars. The only thing keeping this from a perfect game is the right analog stick again. It's highly useful for using Off-The-Ball control. But it still needs to be worked on for doing step-overs and stuff like that. They need to fix that for 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"True soccer fans game","review":"FIFA '04 is a really great game for true soccer fans. it has all the club teams like Real Madrid and Ajax to DC United and the Metrostars as well as many international squads from france and brazil to costa rica. the graphics are great and the commentery is entertaing and the free kicks are unbelievable. The one drawback to this game is the lack of ability to perform moves from other later versions like the meg and the rocastle.

But these were a disappointment. Some parts were either cracked,others machined poorly,the holes in the security bits are off center, and one bit was missing with another in its place. It seems that Isomax has various grades of bits. These were marketed as Contractor Grade, But they are not. This bit set is no different than others costing as little as one third as much. Probably from the same manufacturer in China, just branded differently. I would recommend looking at Klein or Wiha for good screwdriver bit sets. Brownells Gun parts also has good quality bits that they guaranty for life and will replace if they break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screen protector kind of works","review":"My son received this for Xmas and he was happy to get it. It's kind of tricky to apply on the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS. I didn't have a problem with the top screen. I think the bottom screen is a little smaller than the screen protector they give you so the edge of the screen protector doesn't really fit perfectly. Otherwise, it works fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"tricky to install, but worth the hassle.","review":"Got these screen protectors to protect the touch-screen. Once I figured out how to install them, they are great. The installation of the protector is tricky though. Make sure the screen is CLEAN. The screen protectors come sandwiched between clear peel-off sheets on each side and little paper tabs attached. When you get the protectors, and after your screens are clean, you peel off the thin film that was keeping the screen-side of the protector dust-free and squeegee it on (to remove bubbles) and then, and this is the part that got me, you have to peel off the thin film that is now between you and the actual screen protector. I had trouble getting the top film off, and for a minute, was very frustrated because it looks like the paper tab is all that needs to be peeled off, but it's not. There's a whole film there that gets peeled off. After you manage to get that top film off, the screen protectors are GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"smuggy screen","review":"The screen would have been great for the price but....there are stickers on the screens labeling the top and bottom.

These labels were attached with an adhesive that adhered to such an extent that when pulled as instructed, the label tore, leaving paper fibers and, yes,adhesive permanently attached to the screens. This renders the screens completely useless. In addition, each screen is slightly warped. Because of the way the product is packaged, there is no way one could return the flawed screen to Amazon for a refund. Therefore I would strongly recommend that you not purchase the Nintendo DS Lite Safe Screen.Intec Safe Screen - Game console screen protector - transparent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Urban Sloth","review":"What a disaster. You apply the plastic protector to the video screen and then remove the sticky tabs from it. The sticky tabs are provided as a convenience for helping you place the protective screen. Easy enough right? Wrong. The tabs leave a film that you can't remove. As a result, you can't see through the protective screen to the game screen.

It works, it does what it claims, it's pretty well built, but the pictures are terrible. Even perfectly aligned and focused, your pictures will be blurry and sad. I will try to upload two pictures. I used this a few times and it has sat unused for two years now. I only used it on an old telescope, never bothered on my new one, so maybe you can get better results, but I wouldn't endorse it.I was able to reuse the t-mount I bought for this with a t-adapter and take great pictures of the moon using my Canon Digital Rebel SLR and some okay pictures of the Orion Nebula, but that was about it. If you want to take pictures of planets consider a webcam-type camera like the Celestron NexImage (it works ok) for $100 (and use software like Registax) or spend many hundred dollars on a good imager.

After playing it, you begin to realize that this is not an ordinary compilation. With Fetish and Baby Blue being the only new entries, the others are definitely worthwhile!! What Joan Jett does best is project sex appeal, and this record sums it up! From the controversial \\"Star Star\\" to the angry \\"Coney Island Whitefish\\" to the seductively masochistic Fetish, this CD ROCKS HARD!

I had hoped with the sterling reputation of the Dualit brand, the toaster would give us many years of service. The good old American-made toasters of the past are still around, but sadly do not have wide enough slots to accommodate bagels or today's larger bread slices.

My surprise was it had three european leagues German, Finish and Swede and FINALLY NATIONAL TEAMS. Game play could be better, but I have had lot of fun playing with Team Italy, Germany, Sweeden, Finland, Canada, UK and USA, but it includes other teams from the former soviet union, and other european national teams. This feature is the one I like the most, and I can unlock new features in Fifa and Madden while I play with my son this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you never liked hockey, buy it!","review":"Ill start off by saying hockey is very underrated. It is fun to watch and best of all, it is fun to play. Especially if you have NHL 2004. Load up for a bone crunching hit or wind up for a slapshot that breaks the sound of speed. With a wide selection of teams to play with, including all NHL teams and most of the European teams, you can always play with a new team. The create a player and create a team function is a very detailed option and is fun to use. The twenty year dynasty mode could use a little improvement, but it is very good with a wide range of options including improving the team facilities and even changing the look of the GM's office. There are also unlockables that you earn by playing the game.

Pianist Richard Zimdar's consummate musicianship also requires acknowledgment. Despite these salient points, I cannot say that Fischer is particularly listenable. His technique, while developed, does not reach the levels of artistry one would expect from a DMA in performance--particularly in the altissimo range; it is almost painful to hear so much portamento (that is, unintended scooping into and out of pitches rather than landing directly on them). Further, there is little to no evidence of musicianship in Fischer's performance. Compare to Mule, Bongiorno, and the superb if less-known Clifford Leaman (check out his interpretation of the Bassett) and you will find that this saxophonist has many superiors in every aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multiply the power of your applications with ActiveX","review":"This is the comprehensive and official reference documentation on Automation!

It isn't, and I'm glad the writers went in another direction. It was surprisingly exciting. Vaughn does a great job of playing a well-meaning but somewhat overwhlemed man with a (well, you hopefully guessed it) a major dilemma. He finds out his best friend (James)' wife is cheating on him.

The reel could have been better because the dilemma is very dramatically portrayed as well as Vince Vaughn's performance. It is scary and violent at moments, and an unexpected Oh my g-d I cannot believe this is happening especially the intervention. Wyonna Rider plays a serious cat and player where the film could have turned sinfully evil. There is a humorous scene at the hockey facility where an argument takes place right in the middle of getting beer. Jennifer Connally plays her perpetual role and can be a downer. The movie gets confusing as to whether or not this is based on a love relationship and engagement or the significance of being best male friends. I felt the engagement was Rider's diversion and the gambling addiction needed to be developed to grab the audience more; however, that may be the pulp at the end of my orange juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had a good and important message...","review":"Seriously, what would you do if you found out your best friend's spouse was cheating on them?

The girls were nice enough, and thankfully the day never came when they jammed me in a corner to ask the important questions.After the film was done, it took a while for that old feeling to go away. My stomach was churning, and I wondered what I would have done in a similar situation.I thought I signed up to watch a comedy, but instead I viewed something that was mean-spirited and made me feel uncomfortable. Don't let the previews lead you to believe this is the Vaughn from SWINGERS or James from KING OF QUEENS. Everyone involved, from Queen Latifah to Ron Howard, are underutilized.The infrequent times when it tries to be funny are actually mildly amusing, but such as FUNNY PEOPLE, it doesn't know what it wants to accomplish.If the goal was to confuse and aggravate the viewing audience, then mission accomplished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Here's the Dilemma; making a quasi-romantic comedy/buddy film with (usually) funny male leads and throw in (IMO) random whiny, unfunny female leads and what you get is a runaway train wreck.

There are a few key issues with the game, though.

Second, the game seems to be very short. I haven't played it much, since I got it today, but I've already played as three of the six Toa. I'm just worried that if each Toa gets only one level, I'll be finished by tomorrow. Make sure you look into that for yourselves, though; I haven't to avoid potential spoilers.

But I think this NBA LIVE is great. It's fun, it's entertaining, the commentary is much better, the music is good, the franchise game mode is killer, and it's just fun to play. It's a great game to play with a bunch of friends or to play alone. I've just finished an 82 game season and I'm in the conference finals right now. Also, I thought the graphics were great. I have the S-Video cable for my XBOX and I think everything is crisp and vibrant. Creating a player is cool, too. I didn't even play NBA LIVE 2003, the last one I owned was Live 2002 on PS2 which was sub-par. This exceeded my expectations and I think it's worth buying.

On Live you cant see whos got higher votes for the Rookie award. Also in dynasty mode you dont get people wanting to trade with you. You have to pursue them and they normally turn down your trade. The graphics are poor during gameplay and the game speed is crazy fast! It needs to be more realistic like ESPN Basketball. Also what is up with Ben Wallace's hair?!?!

The action was just OK, the fight scenes (the reason I watched the movie) were poorly done. Special effects were not so special. Van Peebles is a much better actor than what he showed here. OK, he was playing a robot, but Arnold set the standard for android actors and Mario, handcuffed by the script, looks like he walked out of a 1950's SciFi B movie.If you can watch the movie on TV for free, give it a look.

If my understanding is correct, it was written specifically for people living in the United States or other comparable countries whose emphasis is principally on the material. But the USA was a different place when this book was written and I think that that may be why it didn't leave me with as positive an impression as the other works by S.A.W.I get the impression that this work attempts to teach some basic Gnostic principles to those who are adamantly pursuing material success in life and so the lessons and teachings themselves seem a little 'heavier' and 'clunkier' to me. Overall I recommend it, but there are other works by the same author which may provide a better introduction to Gnosis for some, though if material pursuits are still very much important or necessary for you this may be the place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana","review":"My daughter loved it.

I'm a lover of science fiction, so, of course, when this movie aired, and with my favorite actor in it, I enjoyed it. Even though this was a sci-fi movie, space is infinate, and expanding.

The premise is interesting-a duplicate Earth on the other side of the Sun. The effects, done with models and opticals,(pre CGI era) are amazing, particularly the launch pad sequences. Unfortunately, it falls into the same old rut as most British SF-too much chit-chatty talking, too much time spent on machinery close ups, and spiritless acting. A pity that a portion of the time spent on close ups of punch cards, flashing lights and countdowns wasn't reserved for plot development. The story just falls apart at the end. The ending, which I won't spoil, is not a clever plot twist, it is just inane. If you turn it off after the ship lands on the \\"other\\" Earth, you've missed absolutely nothing.

Niema Ash was fortunate enough to be there. Not having any previous knowledge of the situation in Tibet, she soon discovered that behind the smiles of the Tibetans were lives of pain, suffering & loss under the rule of Communist China. Despite this, the warmth, hospitality & good nature of the Tibetan people shines through.Niema gives wonderful descriptions of the Potala, the Jokhang, the Tibetans & Lhasa in general. She was also priviledged with a rare opportunity of seeing a sky burial. Her visit to Tibet certainly touched her more than she expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT!?!","review":"Not Clinic...the British Band, but Hip Hop -- haven't listened to it yet, but disappointed that is not the Band Clinic and in fact the actual group name is not Clinic...They may be purposely misleading people to sell CDs, it was only a couple bucks but it is was not the Clinic I was looking for.."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a piece of JUNK!","review":"I purchased several of these at Home Depot, which are actually made by Melnor.

I am happy to say the sound, while not the quality of the CD scores recorded today as would be expected, was excellent. I was aware of some of the themes from previous offerings of suits of the score but was amazed at just how many other themes of unbelievable beauty and complexity are throughout the complete score of Song of Bernedette. This CD proves just how remarkable and prolific a composer Alfred Newman was. His style was always reconizable but each score had new and never rehashed melodies. If you were only going to add one score to you collection to represent the talets of Alfred Newman this would be the one to add."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very solid score by Newman","review":"At last the entire score to the movie The Song of Bernadette. Spread out on two CDs is 90 minutes of 'Newman strings.' The sound quality is quite good for a recording this old (60 years), however I still have trouble listening to too much of this at once. Certainly it is a masterpiece, and I am sure it fits the movie perfectly from what I know of the plot, however for me it isn't as interesting a listening experience as other scores from this time period (Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, etc.) Nevertheless a very strong score by Newman and this score shows why Newman was 'the man' at Fox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, you know....","review":"...this was a bit campy and fun...Robert Newton is over the top and the rest of the cast could barley keep up...lots of fun.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay money for a disc you cant use","review":"***WARNING*** false advertisment.

The vivid colors were muted, and the stark white stars were light gray. I threw both posters away, rather even than give them to a friend. (What kind of a gift would that be?)

This book will literally change your life and how you see the things in it. Get on your Path, whatever that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly insightful","review":"This is a brief, easy-to-read book (I zipped through it in one evening), but I found it remarkably enlightening about the learning process in general. What especially struck me were three points: (1) The \\"plateau\\" is just as important in learning a skill as the rare moments when you exceed yourself, so don't become impatient (or quit) when you hit a plateau; it's where you consolidate your skills, make them automatic, and get ready for the next step. (2) To learn something new, you have to become a beginner again. (3) If you focus on achieving ever higher and higher goals, you'll burn out; but embracing the process and the attitude of being a learner will last you a lifetime. (About 25 years ago, a group of Apple Computer employees paid for a billboard in honor of Steve Jobs' birthday; it read \\"The Journey is the Reward.\\" At the time I thought this was pseudo-Zen fluff, but I know better now -- and that's exactly the point of this book.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This is a book of joy.

I have called Amazon, and I was told by the representative that he can not process the exchange until a week later (the system do not allow him to do it now).3/16/12 Amazon sent me the new Blu-Ray DVDs a while ago, I have a chance to play them lately. still same terrible sound track. I will keep the Discs, only for the pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Show","review":"An incredible dvd set. It was extremely well written, directed, edited, narrated, and filmed. And what the film crews had to go through to bring such beautiful scenery, people, cultures, and wildlife to the screen is nothing less than amazing and awesome. They endured extremely grueling, harsh, and dangerous situations in order to capture a moment of perfection to create a legacy for future generations when those things no longer exist. The making of this set is just as awesome as viewing it. I can't wait to sit through it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See!","review":"This series was excellent! The cinematography was great and beautiful, the stories followed are very interesting and revealing and the conclusion (human cities and our effect on the environment) was very well thought and brilliantly done. I highly recommend seeing this series and am very happy with BBC's Human Planet, Planet Earth and Life :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and educational","review":"My high school students chose to watch episode after episode during a long road trip. It kept their interest and was fascinating to us all. I liked that a lot of the segments included kids and teens who had to adapt to their environments and join in the help or adventure of living where they do. The photography was excellent, so beautiful. I recommended it to my son's human geography teacher. Segments could easily supplement what students learn in class. Arm chair travelers will enjoy it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"This series is very entertaining. Beautifully shot in HD. If you liked Planet Earth or Blue Planet as I did, you'll like this. On Blu Ray the shots look absolutely gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomeness","review":"This is so far the best TV series I've seen in a long time. The quality on the image, the narrator, the stories. Everything is perfectly put together.The perfect show to watch it with the family. This series pack is simply awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series by the BBC","review":"The BBC makes the best documentaries. Even though David Attenborough isn't narrating this one, it's still just as fascinating. highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Incredible Series I've Seen","review":"I was absolutely blown away by this series. The cinematography is amazing, the musical score is perfect, and the vignettes into the lives of people are fascinating. Each section on a person/people/people group was based on people living on the same Earth as me and yet living in a completely different world than my middle class, Midwestern USA lifestyle. I could not recommend this series more highly, especially for anyone intestested in people groups around the world, and how they interact with our natural world. Bravo, BBC! Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"No need to ever take an anthropology class, ever. Just watch this series from front to back and you will have a broader scope of understanding of the human experience in its unfathomable diverse form than ever before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal cruelty?","review":"The images are splendid, of course, and you cannot help but marvel at BBC's technical achievement. Yet, somehow, as you travel through continents and environments, you soon start to expect a rather unpleasant pattern. At the beginning of each story, you find yourself wondering: 'OK, which animal are we going to kill this time, and in what clever way?' No, I'm not one of those animal-protecting nuts, I'm not a vegetarian, I'm not one to turn the blind eye to the killing that eating requires. But when you start dreading the next chapter because so many of them are painful to look at, you just have to wonder why you're watching this DVD. Honestly, weren't there other feats and achievements to focus on? The few stories that don't involve animal killing are so much more fascinating (fixing the mud mosque, crossing the Mekong on a rope, building amazing tree houses, tracking water under the desert, facing a frozen river to get to school...). That should have been the focus of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Wow what a great series. Every segment delivers stunning imagery and immensely entertaining and informative information. We are all so different, and this celebrates that."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST SEE - not even close to planet earth","review":"Amazing series. Doesn't matter what I say, you have to see it for yourself.I have seen Life, Planet Earth, and Blue Planet. While they are all spectacular, they have a ton of overlap that gets redundant, especially if you're watching them marathon style. I was a bit worried this would have the recycled feel of some of the current BBC shows and Blurays.This series is BRAND SPANKING NEW (at least to me) and you'll be surprised every single time.Just buy it you won't regret it. I saw the Oceans episode and had my mouth open for maybe 50 of the 60 min.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary!","review":"This is one of the best documentaries I have seen so far. My husband and I were amazed by the lives of humans around the globe. We have been urging our friends and family to see it. One can learn so much about the survival and adaptability of the human race. This documentary takes the viewer through so many emotions and, honestly, can change the views we have about the humans that inhabit this wonderful world of ours. It may sound like a cliche, but seeing Human Planet can be a life changing experience. I urge the readers of this review to buy it or borrow it. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping series. (DVD)","review":"I bought this for my wife and it inadvertently became an Indian-gift. She thought the human stories were good but I was riveted with the feats and the lifestyles many of the people had. If you are a person that really loves story-lines through a whole episode this isn't the greatest series. If you really are into footage and seeing some different lifestyles to survive in the planet this show was great. I became so interested in the show that I actually finished the 8 hour series within 3 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!!!","review":"IF you liked planet earth you will also like human planet. visually and intellectually stimulating. Worth every penny. If I had a blue ray player I would have gotten it to see the incredible images in HD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I enjoyed this video, but wish I could've seen more nature in it and less human stories. It's an interesting look at the human experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can honestly hardly believe how amazing this is.","review":"This is amazing! Every episode so far (I'm only 5 episodes in) has blown my mind. I wish there was less nudity in some of them (I opted against showing some episodes to my students), but from an informational standpoint, it's a perfect 10 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% recomended!!!!","review":"Excelent BBC production, narrated by John Hurt. I have seen it on Discovery channel and then y bought it.3 Hours of scenes. 80 stories, many never filmed before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product fair price","review":"Looks & works well on my 2001 Buick. The shipment arrived in good shape and in a reasonable time. Happy with purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personality sketch of Alexander the Great","review":"This edition combines great greek lives, but most will be buying it because of Alexander the Great. Originally intended to be published as one of his \\"Parallel Lives\\" series with Caesar, this short biography of Alexander is one of the three main sources used to derive what little information we have on Alexander. It is also the only history that survives that discusses his childhood. Not necessarily accurate, but Plutarch never claimed to be a historian. While not always successful, he does attempt to explain Alexander's complicated personality. A must read for Alexanderophiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Open Letter to Penguin Classics:","review":"This is a wonderful book. The translations by Prof. Scott-Kilvert are lively and interesting, especially for undergraduates. But the book is a pain in the neck to use because the editors have not thought it necessary to include an index. I have had to do one myself on the life of Alexander for my students who are using the book in tandem with Arrian's Campaigns of Alexander and Quintus Curtius (both of which are your books, Penguin, and both of which have indexes!).Penguin, you have tarted up all your other books with new covers, and you have jacked up the prices accordingly, so when you get around to Alexander, who, after all, is the selling point of this eponymous tome, please include an index so that the book will become useful as well as entertaining.Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinked Arrived","review":"This CD is for everyone tuned in to Dave Davies' unique (and much-loved) music.I think this is excellent, and have given it My 4 Stars for:-God In My Brain-Give Me Love, Give Me Peace On Earth-When The Wind Blows (Emergency)-The brilliance of recognizing that the 1997 Bottom Line renditions of Strangers, Too Much On My Mind, as well as Picture Book, can't be topped or overpraised, and including them on this.I'm of the opinion that replication like this is justified: it will not only lead listeners to the Bottom Line recording and its other delights, but, in combination with these selections, forms something new and great.I recommend this CD.I, also, wish Dave Davies a continued recovery, with music in plenty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't work for a PS2 in a Sony Bravia Full HD","review":"I bought this component cable to play my PS2 (cause in the box said that it can be used to PS3 and PS2) in a Sony Bravia Full HD model KLV-40BX400. Unfortunately it didn't work because the picture appeared green. I wrote to Sony for some help and they responded \\"Sorry but the PS2 don't work in LCD HD\\". So now I have a useless cable.
