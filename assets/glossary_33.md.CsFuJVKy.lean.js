That comment really made me take notice, especially after considering Mr. Smith, Vertigo, Rear Window, Philadelphia Story, etc., etc. And I think he may be right. His character is a more mature, moderated version of George Bailey, but the role is especially challenging because the parameters of belief and subsequent disillusion must be so much more contained. Add to Stewart's performance the others by this perfect cast, along with a steady directing hand but the often erratic Preminger and Duke Ellington's best movie score, and the result is the ultimate courtroom drama--not to mention a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG ASPECT RATIO!!!","review":"The USA DVD has been panned and scanned to approximately 1.33:1 from what IMDb says is an original aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Although the German PAL version claims to have the correct aspect ratio, customers on German Amazon have complained that it has been chopped to 1.33:1 there, too, despite what is stated on the packaging and on the Amazon Web site. The only version which seems to be close to authentic is the British PAL version at 1.78:1, available through Amazon.co.uk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and Overrated","review":"Anatomy of a Murder is an interesting period piece, however I was stunned to learn that the period in question was 1959. The sexist attitudes in the film literally made me feel ill. The most stunning moment is when the entire courtroom brakes into full-throated laughter at the mention of the \\"panties\\" that are missing evidence in the alleged rape.This movie does not stand the test of time. It seems like an overly long endorsement of those ancient falsehoods that good women don't get raped and bad women lie about it. Beyond that, the courtroom antics are a bit over the top and the judge unbelievabley lenient about it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"About One Hour Too Long","review":"Well-acted (but almost THREE hour) drama about a attorney who takes the case of man who has killed his wife's rapist. Or was she really raped? Or did the husband really not remember the circumstances surrounding the shooting? Or did it matter? The writing was too much over the top with Jimmy Stewart and George C. Scott trading barbs over what would be allowed in the trial....The part at the end about Mary the hostess was pretty darn unlikely to say the least, so only two stars for the huge insult to viewer's intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Court-Room Masterpiece","review":"Preminger's 'Anatomy of a Murder' has stood the test of time. The black and white cinematography remains superb; Ellington's score a reminder of how film music has lost atmosphere and style, and the direction completely engaging and focusing. James Stewart, stalwart as ever, convinces as the humane and vulnerable attorney, and Lee Remick shines as the teasing, taunting rape-victim-or-not -- a fabulous portrait of complexity and range. George C Scott has the Mount-Rushmore grandeur of a figurehead of legal absolutness, and Eve Arden comments sagely in her secretarial capacity. At 160 minutes, you might think it's a long haul. In fact it's a centred journey into stylistic, haunting movie-making. Very engaging.

It's one of the all time classic films - it deserves it.

As the plot develops, we are never quite certain who is telling the truth, who deserves punishment, who is taking the law into his or her hands?

All of Biegler's thoughts and emotions play across his iconic face revealing a subtle, journeyman performance. Lee Remick is wonderful as a sexpot wife on the loose, and Ben Gazzara is scary as the accused, murderous husband. Enjoy Duke Ellington's brief appearance, and music underscoring the film creating a blue mood. Also notable is Joseph Welch as the patient judge best known in real life as the lawyer who brought down Joseph McCarthy during the Army/McCarthy hearings.

The only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is that the handle is not completely cool after water is boiled so I usually have to use something to pick it up. So it's not 100% perfect. But all around, I like it a lot. I have the red one.[edited to add: OK, I see it will drip more if you let it boil for a long time and then pour immediately.

The only parts I found worth the time spent reading them were the descriptions of the garden and the flashbacks and dreams. Her take on sibling interactions seemed a realistic one to me, though the lengths to which she took them did not. In the end, it wasn't really worth the reading.

Those not too sure about end-times prophecies, please get some books on the subject that are honest interpretations rather than fiction.Otherwise, some of the characters and scenarios are rather unrealistic and or simplistic (Mossad members being anything but professional in a crisis?).

But, it is a fiction trilogy and I was disappointed beyond words in this last book, when most of the characters I had become emotionally involved with, just disappeared without a mention. Phase them out, kill them off, but give me some closure, don't leave me wondering. I enjoyed the new characters, but I did not get as emotionally involved. I did read it as fast as the others, but I think I was trying to hope each new chapter would bring my beloved characters from book 1 and 2 back.

The instrumentals are as soothing and fit-into the album as well as the other songs that paint stories with dry, humorous and dark, satirical comedy, that all blend-in together and to create a rolling mood and feel much like a pulp film, dark comedy or book that stands on its own.I don't think Stan's music was ever very good for pairing with video or film, but instead stood on its own and highlights the ability of a great songwriter to convey ideas and characters without the need for visual stimulation - which is what great music is all about ultimately.If you're just getting into Stan's music or seeking him out as a result of Wall Of Voodoo's popularity, this is a great early place to start, despite its release later in his career in 1999, as he slowly mellowed with time and age into the current era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stan Ridgway - masterful storyteller","review":"Ridgway continues his spinning of tales & stories in a slightly off-beat, slightly twisted way.

The strange tale of the psychically-connected boy and dog moving through time allows readers to exercise their minds with philosopical and spiritual ideas. At the same time, the writing is very accessible. As these two qualities are not often found together, I highly recommend this book for readers who like a light read that still has some depth to it.

But I was wrong. Its getting boring how all of Jacques' books follow the same plot.There is always some cryptic puzzle to solve, the plots are predictable, and the characters aren't memorable. This one actually starts off better then most with the scenes onboard The Flying Dutchman, but quickly becomes boring. Brian Jaques has already written too many similar books- I wish he would write something completly different, like one of his earliest books, Seven Strange and Ghostly Tales. For now, all I can say is skip this one, and if you're looking for a real plot and some surprises and good writing, read Robin Jarvis' books. They haven't had the recognition they deserve for being twice as good as anything Brian Jacques could write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many riddles...","review":"I have been reading Jacque's \\"redwall\\" books for almost a year, and I have been loving them.

These all-too-familiar words of our faith life are brought into focus by Kathleen's personal reflections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fable Found in this book","review":"Amazing Grace, Kathleen Norris, P. 322 & 3.The USMC stroy told here is an old urban type legion type fable that has been told since before Norris was born yet retold here as real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic religious terms are explained in ordinary language","review":"This book contains two memorable stories. The first deals with being a Member of the Body of Christ even when you don't care for the other person sharing your pew. And there is a memorable answer to the question,\\" What can one do if one finds it impossible to affirm certain tenets of the Creed?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This book brought me comfort and delight","review":"This book found its way to me during a stressful time in my life. I was expending an enormous amount of energy trying to do something to end the strife in my small Presbyterian church. Our congregation was deeply troubled and divided and my efforts were proving completely futile. Kathleen Norris' book was a great comfort to me. Her voice is calm and reassuring. Her writing is beautiful. She understands the complexity of faith. She helped me hold on to mine in a difficult time."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it!","review":"Once again Kathleen Norris has written a book that recognizes the sacred in everyday life. The brief essays and anecdotes that she offers are colloquial and universal. The points of view offered are stimulating and unusual in today's jaundiced view of religion. This book gently invites you to stand on your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking At Words In a New Way","review":"I really enjoyed the fresh look at words used in faith discussions. I particularly liked the one on Silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't live up to the promise of the premise","review":"When I first heard about \\"Amazing Grace,\\" I was excited to read what I thought to be another person's thoughtful examination of and meditation upon some of the concepts and language that are used in the Christian tradition and that often block the light of the essence of that tradition. What I found was a series of essays, enough to make a book, that felt as if they were dashed off with some thought, but none of the depth or profundity or clarity of thought that I had hoped to find. The title promises excellence, but the book does not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Page 15 is outrageous and irrisponsible on The Clintons.","review":"I enjoyed most of the contents of the book and found it in line with a mature Christians view and I would have given it 5 stars but for the remark that could be contrued as many seemingly innocent things have and cause harm to people. I would not like someone to say such a thing about me. How about you Kathleen Norris?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This is NOT what I expected. Unless you want to be uplifted spiritually, don't buy it. Not helpful in growing intellectually or thinking logically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one","review":"This book is theologically \\"lightweight.\\" Don't waste your time and money reading it. Some of Norris's \\"definitions\\" are so outlandish as to be comical. This book is total spiritual fiction. She never goes to the source book, i.e., the Bible, for any help. Who cares what her experiences are? I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, particularly to someone who is \\"searching\\", because to do so would be directing them to the path that leads to hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"I read this book to see what someone else had to say about the faith of a Christian. All I can say is WOW. I have shared passages with non-christian friends and christian friends alike. They all were touched by Ms. Norris' words. I have this listed on my webpage as a must have book. God Bless Mrs. Norris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking the fear out of Christian terms","review":"Ms. Norris has taken those terms that are part of the Christian vocabulary and given them new life. Even for those who have been on the Christian journey for many years can appreciate the thought and love Ms. Norris has given each theological term. In this era when many find that it is the \\"words\\" that separate us and not the beliefs, Ms. Norris' treatment can be helpful in bringing the different factions into closer union. Ms. Norris' ability to bring these terms into her own faith journey, gives each of us a way to incorporate the terms into our own journey, with love, and knowledge and wisdom. This book is an excellent read for both the new Christian and those who have been on the Christian journey for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetic but Not Biblically Accurate","review":"After reading Kathleen Norris' book \\"A Cloister Walk,\\" I eagerly sought out this book but am very disappointed. What's interesting about \\"Amazing Grace\\" is that she makes a good point of riding the fence about being a Christian. She voices several points that are not Biblical, such as suggesting that all paths lead to God and that one can earn one's way to Heaven. Where is the Grace in that? Also, she rarely mentions Jesus who is at the center of Christian faith. It leaves me wondering if Norris actually believes in any of the things she espouses."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I found and read this book","review":"I enjoyed every page of this book and I am reading it again--more slowly. I am now about to read A CLOISTER WALK. Thanks for this book. It meant a lot to me to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-changing book!","review":"This book changed my mind and my life! I pre-judged Ms. Norris, thinking that she was some off-the-wall writer wanna-be but I was sorely mistaken. Her writing fills the heart and delights the imagination. This book is filled with terrific real-life stories of people in her life and every story is simple yet profound in its spiritual depth and insight. Kathleen Norris is one of the most gentle Christian writers I have ever come across outside of Philip Yancey and C.S. Lewis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquent, thoughtful, and nuanced--wonderful","review":"Kathleen Norris is my bedtime reading of late. She pokes--sometimes gently, sometimes with tough leather work gloves--at the words which mean so much in Christianity. Sometimes my own version of Christianity is affirmed; sometimes it is seriously challenged. I am thankful to Norris for both her intelligent thought and the eloquence with which she expresses it. This book would be a fine gift for anyone who appreciates a nuanced discussion of Christian faith. I'm thinking of giving a copy to my pastor for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A contemplative poets view of the christian life","review":"Rarely do you come across an author who can tackle such an immensely complex and controversial subject with so much poetic grace. Her style ranges from contemplative to humorous to dead serious, sometimes all within the same paragraph or two.This is a fantastic book. Especially for those of you who wonder why people choose a liberal, christian lifestyle - you ought to take the time to read it. It's good writing, and it's important reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt like I traveled with him....","review":"I read Brad at a chapter or two a day. This made me feel like I was taking the trip with him. These are places I'll probably never go, but his descriptions make me feel like I was there. Very, very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written","review":"I must disagree with the few reviews that state this book is poorly written. I found the writing style very clear and captivating. Perhaps these comments originate from some kind of snobbery towards taxi drivers !!I can't put my finger on exactly why, however I am slightly uncomfortable with the concept of the book. Having said this, I found the book to be one of the more enjoyable travel books I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Writing!","review":"This book really captivated me in the bookstore but when I brought it home to read, I was immensely disappointed and could barely stomach it for its wholly mediocre, third-writing writing style. The author seems like a really nice guy, but he has to go to some writing classes! I'm surprised so much of it slipped past the editors. I don't believe a travel writer should get away with publishing a book just because he had a few adventures. He has to know how to write too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Days on the Road","review":"\\"Take Me With You\\" is the dullest travel book I've read in years. The author failed to inspirie me on several levels and I'm not certain whether this was due to the fact that he's not really a writer, but a traveler, and therefore perhaps thinks he can get away with writing a travel narrative on this basis alone, or else it's the fact that the book drags endlessly, listlessly, boring the reader to tears. I look forward to all new travel books and this oned failed to measure up to even the poorest of them. For a much better read, try Bill Bryson or Dervla Murphy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Measure Up","review":"I was quite disappoined that this book failed to inspire me due to its insipid writing style. Also, I hate the idea that this white guy from America goes off to find some poor brown man from a poor country so he can bring him back to the good ole USA to show him what he's missing. The book drags on and on and on and I only stayed with it to find out who he'd take home. It turns out he doesn't take anyone home after all. What a let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs An Editor!!","review":"I looked forward to this book because I thought it was a great gimmick--a guy goes to find someone to take home. I love the concept but the writing needs A LOT of work, and an editor!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a miss","review":"The theme of this book is excellent: Brad Newsham wants to travel the world and invite a stranger home to see the US. Having said that, if you ever wonder why the American Traveler (Yanqui, as they say in South America) has a bad name, you should read this book to find out the answer. I've traveled a lot and read a lot of travelogues, and this is easily the most superfluous, pompous and arrogant travelogue I've come across. It's so very judgemental of other cultures from Philippines to India to South Africa and I really had a difficult time seeing past the huge turnoff that is. At the end of the book, the immediate feeling I had was \\"Boy, I hope I'm not that negative or judgemental about anything, ever\\" rather than an impression or good feeling about any of the many beautiful places he visited. I'd give it a miss - a good theme destroyed by a bad traveler & writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rolls forward at a great pace","review":"This author seems incredibly liberal and nieve, however, behind that lies a wonderful idea and great writing in this book. In the past the majority of non fiction books I've read have been slower paced and often tedious. This book rolls forward at a great pace and the details of the many cities the author visits are intense. I would recommend this for any person who wants to read a 'feel good' book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"I just re-read this book and loved it all over again. Perfect for anyone who has traveled and longs to travel more. I could really empathise with the author's near-painful lust for seeing new places. The book is insightful, thoughtful, warm and funny. It has a beautiful and heartwarming surprise ending when you discover what happens after he invites that mystery person home to see the US. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FOUR AND A HALF STARS","review":"Griffin has a big, deep tone like Coleman Hawkins, although his playing is more \\"outside\\" than Hawkins.

I hate to say it, but the guy or gal who spends their hard-earned bucks on literature deserves to know the truth. This story would have been great if it had been written by a high school junior for his/her Creative Writing class. Coming from a man with King's abilities it is inexcusably bad.

It's a so-so story, but awfully short. I had to go back to see what I'd paid for it. Too much: $3.99 for 400 locations while 'Infinite Jest' with more than 25,000 locations was $9.99 - what's up with *that!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off","review":"I bought this book, and it won't open up.

I tried peeling the sticker off but could tell it was going to tear the dust jacket so I stopped. I returned the item and explained why I had returned it.

So far, I cannot get it to work at all, but think I will be able to find a work around. Also, it is somewhat challenging to make it work with the included microphone. The documentation is non existent and there is no other information available, so you are on your own. Undoubtably this is good software but sadly neglected by the provider, so I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very mobile","review":"Works okay when using a microphone. Works very poorly when using the recorder that comes with the package. I have trained Dragon, but the translating from the recorder is very bad. If I try to translate 3-4 sentences, it may get 2 or 3 words. I have used Dragon before and this is not typical of Dragon and it is not typical of using the microphone.

This book is a serious attempt to reimagine Rome's alien culture, and to refine and revive conceptions of honor as people now dead 2000 years regarded it.Unrepentantly a book for experts, yet written with a verve and sheer joy in language that makes it accessible to the more casual reader. As Lendon begins: \\"On what was to be the last day of his life, the Emperor Nero awoke to find that the palace sentries had abandoned their posts.\\" The reader is--on some level at least <g>--in for a wild and glorious ride from that point forward!Whether the author himself would appreciate this or not, this book would do well in the library of the fantasy role-playing expert, looking to build a convincing scenario around a \\"Gladiator\\" style setting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifts the heart","review":"THE HARE AND THE BIG GREEN LAWNHare bought a house with a huge lawn of green grass, but while his neighbors, Skunk, Bobcat and Raven, work hard to keep up their lawns of clipped, perfect grass, Hare relaxes and waits.

The outcome is one of color and fragrance that brings his neighbors together.The book is filled with color and colorful characters and the ending lifts the heart and makes me want to go out and start a wildflower garden.While, at first, the book may appear to reward laziness, the objective is quite different--valuing the beauty of our native plant and animal life.

It covers Giselle, Coppelia, Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, Spartacus and finally, Songs of a Wayfarer. Both the performances and the recording are of a beautiful standard, displaying the dramatic action, the costumes,and the sets admirably. It is also notable for the dancers - who have a very unique, athletic and \\"real\\" quality. Filmed at varying intervals between 1984 and 1990, the video gives a chance to see some of the better known of the Austalian Ballet's stars. Notable is the stary partnership (and amazing virtuosity) of Lisa Pavane and Greg Horsman in Coppelia, the lyricism of Miranda Coney in Swan Lake, and the very masculine Steven Heatcote in Spartacus. A great video for anyone who wishes to sample little of everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I bought the Sony walkman with TV tuner and was quite exctied, this didn't last very long.

I've seen abstract art before and can guess at some of the inspirations--I didn't need the collection of abstract artworks that are in the book.

I'd seen this book a few years ago, and researched it before I actually bought it, and before I bought it, I read a sample. Once I bought the book, I felt SO let down!This book is a huge jumble of overly large words, assumptions, and guesses; I've found more profound knowledge on Youtube regarding BGLO's. This book reads like a master thesis with no entertainment value or real substance. This book does have it's plusses (though I can't think of any at the moment), but it does not live up to the hype.

I appreciate this book because it gave me the basis to converse about change and being better role models. We come from different backgrounds and to be able to mesh personalities for the greater good of the community is a wonderful thing. Although I disagree with physical hazing to the extent of pain one should be educated on the benefits of physical wellness (one could do push ups and be a leader of a group which in turn may give him/her the tools necessary to being a leader in their community.

First, to the 'reviewer' (in quotes since he didnt read the book beyond the very beginning) -- very little of the book makes any use of softice. The tool mostly used is Interactive Disassembler (a commercial tool available from datarescue) but any disassembler will do.The book is about the code typically generated by compilers of various forms (mostly c and c++, some pascal as well). If you want to understand the disassembly, you must grok what Christina Cifuentes calls idioms (instruction sequences that have an effect different than the usual intended meaning).This book is very much a collection of idioms. It's a good primer to the art of reverse engineering, and maybe readers can move on to general decompilation papers for further study, starting with \\"Reverse Compilation Techniques\\" by Ciguentes, and moving on to more modern papers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be called \\"Cracker Disassembling Uncovered\\"...","review":"While I agree with all many of the other reviewers here, I have to profess that I thought many of the main topic areas really weren't consistent with hacking. The author takes great pains to write in terms of the circumvention of copy protection mechanisms such as passwords and serial numbers. While I will admit the author demostrates an exceptional knowledge of assembly code and debugging, it would have been nice if he covered a more diverse set of examples. Regardless, taking this book for what it's worth, I would say if you read closely and experiment with the recommended tools you'll take away a far greater understanding of assembly code and the debugging process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"This book is mostly how-to reverse engineer, and precious little about how to safeguard against it. Sure you could work out your own techniques to frustrate the reversing used in this book, but the author provides few suggestions of his own.The book is therefore misleadingly titled. If you want a book to reverse engineer, this is it. If you want a book for how to safeguard against it, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo English subtitle","review":"I was disappointed as there was no English subtitle, even though you have it listed as haqving one.

A lot of the 3D animations didn't have a good control on the timing, \\"gravity\\" and \\"Ummph\\"!The story line for most of the animations also doesn't impressed me. I've seen an animation collection VHS from PIXAR 3 years ago (actually it was out 5yrs ago) and the quality is superb!

Would not buy this again. I expected more from Mannheim Steamroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing attempt at writing on important topic","review":"This book appears to have been butchered by non-scientific editors who have removed essential explanation of diagrams and shortened any sentence that appeared to have syntax that would trouble anyone over the age of thirteen. I opened it with high hopes since I was looking for a gentle introduction to an important topic that I could recommend as initial reading for students. But I hesitate to let students near it since it has so many mistakes and blunders. (One quote: \`Together with Niels Bohr, Wheeler discovered fission'. Has any scientifically educated person looked through the text before publication??)The fact that diagrams are full of elements that are not referred to in the text is symptomatic of the very unprofessional way that this book has been produced. Aczel actually has some nice persnal anecdotes... what a wasted opportunity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, bad publishing","review":"I enjoyed the book until about page 200, when the pages were out of order (not the page numbers, the text) and diagrams were missing. This edition of the book should be pulled from Amazon. Buy the paperback instead, the publisher got it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished book","review":"The book seems to be unfinished. Incorrect Spelling: \\"Shroedinger\\". Material is generally superficial and not scientific. References are very limited. Interesting material on the personalities of the physicists such as Schroedingers education and his affairs with a series of women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entanglement, get a ghost writer - please","review":"I have read many science books. This one was has a strong start but then petters out. The problem is that when he tries explain the experiments involved to prove entanglement is real, its just impossible to understand what he saying. I have read other books on these experiments and have been able to understand them. He just seems to loose his interest in clear writing about half through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really excited about reading this book when I first bought it and really disappointed when I finished. As mentioned by an earlier reviewer, the biographical information is very interesting, but the physics stinks. I found the technical explanations incomplete and difficult to follow.In addition, the book was written as if the author was in a hurry to meet a deadline. There was a lot of repetition, several editing errors, and the illustrations seemed to be thrown in just to take up space.For a much better explanation of this mind-blowing topic, I recommend John Gribbin's \\"Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality.\\" Gribbin does his usual excellent job of explaining thing simply enough so you understand what he's saying without needing a Ph.D. in physics. The final chapter of this book wraps everything up with Gribbin's preferred explanation of entanglement and quantum reality. After you read it, you'll be saying to yourself, \\"Hey, cool!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this mess...","review":"As a physics buff I had high hopes for this book. The subject has always fascinated me. Sadly this book is a mess. The author has no ability to communicate clearly. This book is more of an historical account than anything else. Who cares where a scientist is born and how he grew up. There are numerious un-explained cryptic diagrams. When the author does explain an experiment it's a confused jumble. Don't let the intrigue of this subject trap you into reading this very poorly written book.You will end up more confused and frustrated then enlightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak first draft of The Getaway","review":"Recoil is not a terrible book, but it is not as strong as most of Thompson's other work. It is a predecessor to The Getaway, and the latter is a much better reworking of the former. Like The Golden Gizmo, South of Heaven, and Trick of the Tail, it is worth reading, but only after Population 1280, Savage Night, Hell of a Woman, Swell Looking Babe, Killer Inside Me, Nothing Man, Kill-off, Criminal, etc. You get the idea. It is better than The Transgressors, however, and I suspect it is better than Cropper's Cabin."},{"rating":"2","title":"an atmospheric and entertainingly silly crime story","review":"'Recoil' is in some ways classic Jim Thompson noir. The characters and dialogue are delicious 1950s trash. The women are floosies, the men are dopes. In 'Recoil' we have a lame brained ex-con who was released from prison courtesy of a guy with whom he had yet to meet. This guy turns out to be a nasty piece of work, and the company he keeps isn't much better. Soon the ex-con realizes something is wrong. Was he being set up just to crash and return to prison? All is revealed in the end. Yes, the ending is kind of goofy ... as if the author just smashed the words together arbitrarily. But this is not uncommon with Thompson novels.Bottom line: certainly not among the better Jim Thompson novels. Nonetheless it is the sort of fast read perfect for a rainy afternoon or for that long, boring flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this documentary","review":"Nowhere near as produced as Valentino: The Last Emperor (Which is fabulous), this is a simple documentary on an extraordinary man. Something almost meditative about it at times. Yves was a deeply complex man, and this gives a beautiful and honest glimpse at this amazing man. This is not a documentary for those who just want to be entertained, but rather a fascinating character study at a person who changed the fashion world forever. There is not much footage of his clothing, but that is fine... there are books and books and websites that cover that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, But Not So Good. Not what I expected.","review":"The DVD wasn't as good as I expected. St. Laurent talked about his life, but did not show many garments. I expected a runway show of some of his creations, but didn't get one. I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Primer on Differential Geometry","review":"I bought this as a primer for reading General Relativity and did not give five stars for a few reasons:no symbol index, the intro on Topology is almost worthless and I would add a few more required subjects before bothering to tackle this besides the ones suggested by the authors including introductory Linear Algebra and Topology. My other complaint is that there are only 21 small diagrams which is kind of disappointing considering the highly geometrical nature of the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Great book. Very clear explanation of what manifolds are and how to use them. Also, the prerequisites are minimum. You'll get a lot of mileage out of this book if you have a semester or so of advanced calculus and some topology and linear algebra under your belt. I wish there was there was a chapter on bundles because I would love to read what these guys have to say about them. Very readable. Definitely a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A color feast!","review":"What an incredibly talented writer! In a book such as this, which requires lavish descriptions, it would be so easy to succumb to cliche. Yet the author presents what she sees in new, fresh, exciting ways. Interesting anecdotes create layers to the information being presented. This book is to be read cover to cover, and re-read again and again.

As a caregiver and a professional in the field of geriatrics for nearly 20 years, many of the situations described in this book really resonated with me. Also, kudos to the authors for addressing an underappreciated and underserved population: male caregivers. I think this book will appeal to individuals who are embarrassed or anxious to ask about those uncomfortable questions or who think that no one else is experiencing the same difficulties they are as caregivers. I also found the Q & A format to be immensely readable and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribbles all over","review":"I bought two OXO kettles, stainless finish for use at home and green for use at a cabin.

It does have that look of 'pressed wood chips' but being where it is, it's doing just fine.The rack was easy to assemble, it's functional and, as far as the looks are concerned, not too many people get to see it.

If you know his work, buy this for the new song and the old favorites included here. If you don't know Tom Rush, this is a great intorduction to a performer without peer. I hope he and John Leventhal soon do an entire album. That's a match made in heaven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Awaited Outstanding Anthology","review":"I've been a fan of Tom Rush from way way back. His song \\"No Regrets\\" has to be one of the best folk songs written. It is hard to decide which version of the song I like better (the version included on this collection or the version on \\"The Cicle Game\\" album). The songs cover his entire career chronologically. This is a great introduction to one of the finest singer/songwiters in folk music. Tom Rush's versions of Joni Mitchell and Jackson Browne songs often rival and surpass the originals. The styles range from blues to folk to rock. My only disappointment is the absence of \\"Who Do You Love\\" and \\"You Can't Judge A Book By It's Cover\\" from his Elektra album \\"Take A Little Walk With Me\\" album.

Alan Finger has been practicing yoga since he was 13 and is a very good teacher. He focuses on breathing and form, and his prompts come at the appropriate time so you can follow the moves easily. I own several yoga zone dvd's and think they are among the best for real yoga. I'm a beginner at yoga, and I think the beginning and intermediate levels are appropriately named. The poses are moved through slowly and thoroughly, and he encourages you to push but not strain yourself, to work at your level. One assistant performs the poses fully, while another performs them at a limited level for those who are less flexible or have physical problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this DVD","review":"I really enjoyed this DVD; I liked the teacher's voice and yoga directions as well as comments on the effects of yoga on the body and health.

Great reminders throughout that each body is different each day, so do what you're able this day and let go of the rest. Really great video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"A great video for yoga practicers of all levels. Even if you never learned yoga, you would still find this video right for you.

Strongly recommened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after reading other reveiws!","review":"I borrowed this from the library hoping I would love it enough to purchase it after reading the other reviews here. I'm glad, after veiwing it, that I didn't buy it first.As a beginner, I do need instruction on proper breathing, posture, etc.. but I found this program involved too much instruction!

Now be quiet so I can concentrate!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Zone, next best thing to a live instructor","review":"I've been practicing yoga for 3 years and once a week go to a yoga class with an excellent instructor. These Yoga Zone DVD's are the very next best thing to a live teacher.

I would recomment all the beginning and this intermediate DVD to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT TAPE!","review":"I am very advanced in yoga but I cannot seem to part with this intermediate level tape. It is very well put together, well taught, and is a great total body workout. Alan Finger provides many variations of the poses so beginners can do it as well as intermediates. The scenery is beautiful as well. Does this explain why I love this video so? No. I love it because the relaxation at the end is so unique and wonderful I cannot get enough.

Most of high end Ginseng farm is watched over by the government and they are not easily exported to 3rd vendors. High end Ginseng is grown for 6 years and after harvested they are steamed . When steamed, the Ginseng turns to red color. So, if you want the real deal, get 6-year-red-ginseng from Korean market. Powder type is not permitted to be imported by US, so only liquid type and dried jerky type is imported. They are very expensive and you can tell it by the look of the golden package they are in. Red Ginseng is safe for people who has high blood pressure. Red Ginseng has no known side effects albit some first time consumers might experience insomnia.

I liked this book just as much. Vande Velde has a way of weaving words that will completely draw you into her story. You relate to this character, even if he is a 16 year old boy who spends his life going back and forth between his wolf and human forms. And though the book has a very young main character, the writing does not talk down to the reader. Weiland is very child-like in the way he doesn't understand the world, be he learns and grows. He is a strong lead for this book, and you will fall in love with him the moment you meet him. This book is fantastic, and keeps you guessing all the way up until the twist ending. Don't miss out on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Take on Shapeshifter Theme","review":"What would it be like for a wolf to be compelled to take the form of a man? Starting with this premise, Vivian Vande Velde writes a riveting story about Weiland, who was captured by Daria as a young cub and raised mainly as a human. However, Daria, no matter how brutal her tactics, had not been able to destroy the basic decency of Weiland's nature.Daria, who heretofore, had been content to live in the forest served by her transformed creatures, has decided to move to a townhouse in St. Celia's. Weiland is one of those who are to accompany her. In St. Celia's Weiland comes in contact with large groups of humans for the first time including a thief named Shile.Through Shile, Weiland learns a great deal that he he never knew before about what it means to be a man.Well written and compelling, Vivian Vande Velde draws the reader into Weiland's world with a sure touch. This one is guaranteed to appeal to adult fantasy lovers as well as younger readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic, evil, conscience, compainionship and secrets...","review":"The Changeling Prince is exciting, suspenseful, and thought provoking. Weiland is a wonderfully complicated character. The reader is let into his mind as he is torn between obeying the woman that controls his well being and escaping her abuse and magic. The reader, along with Weiland, never knows what the evil Daria will do nor how he will save himself. The book is complete with heart pounding action sequences and flurries of magic. When Weiland meets Shile, the intrigue continues as they develop a friendship, something Weiland has never known.

Many of the previous reviews of the European release of this disk stressed Green's songwriting and sugary vocals, but what made SP for me was the incredibly syncopated, interweaving, and just plain PERCOLATING synth and bass lines. That's not here on this disk, anywhere! I see that David Gamson is listed as a producer, but not a musician save for an occasional bass line. While this disk has other strengths, the profusion of beat loops, strummed guitars, and blah pads make this disk sound like everyone else. Finally, Green's voice just is not a good mix with in-yo-face rap; what's next, an Art Garfunkle/Limp Bizkit collaboration?"},{"rating":"1","title":"...Green come back to life!","review":"After waiting over 10 years for Green's new set of tunes, I am somewhat dissappointed. I can listen to this CD and enjoy some of the beat loops,grooves and guitar induced rock tunes. And thankfully there is one song I REALLY like, \\"UMM\\", but I just don't find enough melodies, enough of Green period. He's almost backround noise on many of the tracks and his whispery harmonies that made Scritti so unique are few and far between. DOn't get me wrong, I'm all for updating their sound but not eliminating their sound. I don't mind if a rapper guests on a song for a bridge the way Culture Club does, but on this CD they just outnumber Green!What's even more depressing is that the tunes that are reminiscent of their old style, Mystic Handyman, Brushed WIth Oil,Born To Be,and First Goodbye are just not that good. Melodies are weak and it's shocking! Green has always previously been such a pop craftsman. Truly dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your looking for Scritti Politti Look Again","review":"I read the reviews before I bought this album and felt fairly well informed. Unfortunately, too many reviewers here on Amazon are people trying to impress someone and try and get all philosophical and artsy (or maybe get into the critic business). Plain and simple I love Scritti Politti as most people that are reading this do. I would buy just about anything they produce. But I have to tell you stay away form this album. If you are looking for a Mos Deaf album knock yourself out, cause this one is sure to satiate your thirst. I just don't get the collaboration. 9 out of the 11 tracks are unrecognizable as Scritti Politti all together. They are flat out Mos Def tunes with a SP as the back up band.A message to the band.

Glad I listened to it here first before buying(thanks Amazon!). Scritti fans- you've been warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unmistakeable Green","review":"Although the rhythm of the first track, \\"Umm...\\" throws you at first (very UN-Scritti-like), you cannot mistake the distinct breathy vocals that are Green. This collection of tracks is the perfect re-entry into the music world for Green after a lengthy hiatus. It is definitely not a rehash of C&S-85 or Provision, but a very smart integration of today's sounds with his trademark vocals and Gamson's production. Be advised, as with all things new or re-invented, it will take a few runs through the CD before you get into the new \\"sound\\" that is Scritti Polliti. Can't wait for the next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like their last two albums","review":"I couldn't have been a bigger fan back in 1984 when I first heard Wood Beez but that certainly has changed after hearing this.

Not the \\"Perfect Way\\" to stage a comeback.","review":"Being a huge fan of Scritti Politti since the early 80's, I feel justified in saying this is a major disappointment. Green is a very talented musician and songwriter, but this experiment was a total waste of those talents. Gone are the smooth keyboards and samples that seemed to mold into Green's falsetto voice. Gone are the danceable tunes that remind you of checkered shirts and Ray-Ban Wayfarers. I wasn't expecting the 80's...just something that sounded like Scritti Politti. New Wave/Synthpop doesn't mix well with Hip Hop. Enough said. I hope you read this Green. Your delving into Reggae (Take Me In Your Arms) worked. It was different yet it was still the Scritti Politti we knew. Take a lesson from Ivan (Men Without Hats), Heaven 17, OMD, or Howard Jones. You can still change with the times, just don't abandon your fans and those that helped make you famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have believed the one-star reviews...","review":"What a drag. I was such a fan, but after ignoring the lesser reviews of the Amazon folk, I bought it anyway. Big disappointment. The only positive thing I can say about Scritti is that their production is still exquisite. But \\"you cant make a silk purse out of a sow's ear\\" as the saying goes. I hope they do try again soon, and that they bring along some of the songwriting chops Gartside brought to Chaka Khan (he produced a great deal of her more recent stuff) and Meshell Ndegeocello (ditto)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech.","review":"I was one of those longtime fans who anxiously awaited the release of this album, hoping that somehow in ten years Green could culminate the mastery in pop music he was building from Cupid & Psyche through Provision. But Whoa! What a letdown!I know Green tries to encompass modern musical styles in his music, but geez, you hardly hear him sing on this album with all the rapping and stuff. Just about every track sounds the same.The only shining moment on this album is First Goodbye, but it's too reminiscent of Oh Patti from Provision to be considered fresh.Congratulations for trying to break some ground, Green, but you could've done better. I'm gonna pretend Provision was the last album you've done and anxiously await the next one, again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete fiasco!","review":"I've been a Scritti Politti listener from their beginnings, and was looking forward to hearing another album from them after so long. Well, looks like they felt they had to jump on the rap bandwagon and wreck everything. Anomie & Bonhomie is a thorough disaster...six out of the eleven tracks are run-of-the-mill rap, the other tracks are just basically lacking that Gartside snap. When are artists going to realize rap isn't a career saving move and that not all of us even want to hear it! I hope Peter Gabriel learns this after his latest screw-up rap track on his release Ovo. Leave rap to those who do it anyway, so Scritti Politti, please try again and give us what you're normally good at and stop trying to be a part of a trend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beat-smart and beautiful","review":"\\"Anomie & Bonhomie\\" is a honey of a disc, a sly fusion of Brooklyn hip-hop, perky lo-fi guitar rock and the earthy R&B at which Scritti Politti's frontman, the angel-voiced Green, has always excelled. Bassist/vocalist Me'shell Ndegeocello, rappers Mos Def and Lee Majors and producer David Gamson help Green realize his best work: a record that bobs, rocks, thumps and swings like nothing else out there. Not for everyone, but those that manage to grasp it will likely hang on for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite CDs","review":"Many reviewers here have complained that this CD doesn't sound like Scritti Politti. But when has Scritti Politti ever stuck to one style? Before the synth-heavy new wave of \\"Cupid and Psyche\\" and \\"Provision\\", there was the experimental punk-pop now collected on \\"Early\\" and the acoustic alternasoul of \\"Songs to Remember\\". Why would anyone expect a new album from Scritti to sound anything like what had come before? This is filled with incredibly catchy, funky songs that constantly take unexpected musical turns. \\"Umm\\", \\"Die Alone\\", \\"The World You Understand...\\" and \\"Here Come July\\" are particular standouts. If you don't like hip-hop, you may get tired of the guest rappers (who are hardly as ubiquitous as some reviewers have complained) -- but I'm not such a hip-hop fan either, and I really enjoy the rap numbers on this CD. Given how cheap it is to acquire a used copy of this album, you really have no excuse not to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green doesn't disappoint.","review":"After reading the reviews of Anomie & Bonhomie I was reluctant to try it out. I am no fan of rap music and longed for Scritti's pure pop sensibilities. If you're a fan of Cupid & Psyche and Provision then BUY THIS CD. Green hasn't forgotten how to write and David Gamson is still a great producer. The 1st two songs should convince you.Then treat yourself to 'Here Comes July'-worth the price of the CD itself. The rappers actually enhance the songs and without them the album would not be as strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Lagerfeld for Men Purchase","review":"We have reason to believe that the Lagerfeld Classic product that we received is a counterfeit product.

Although influences such as Marvin Gaye are audible his style and tone are still unique. On this, his debut album, he uses his voice in beautiful taste with the dark, progressive R&B grooves throughout. The exception is the track \\"Whoever\\", a very catchy, more pop orientated R&B song (although still in the Lewis Taylor style) which gives the album more range.Overall it is highly atmospheric and its dark production technique, haunting riffs and sensuous vocals sets a mood like no other, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prince, Stevie & Marvin rolled into one","review":"... the way the songs take you in one direction then midway spin you round and take you off somewhere else and your whole body tingles (yes it lifts the hairs on the back of your neck) I really can't praise this album enough, it's without a doubt one of the greatest CDs Iv ever heard. Yes I know that sounds a bit corny but it really is that good.There's a line in the title track of his 2nd Cd where he says....\\"I was only trying to make you feel Good, Strange, Different, a Different kind of groove\\" ...which says it all!!Lewis Taylor is the best kept secret in music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT SO LUCKY","review":"This album is truly a work of art. Lewis is highly intelligent musical genius the best of London Soul talent.

Every week I search the listings for the chance to see him and sit gagging for his new album , so youre definitely not missing out on the party! Very few have even heard of him over here and his work lies rather hidden away amongst the soul, R&B sections of record shop which for the non expert is a maze of ridiculuous sounding names and a section of the shop one feels to be daunted in unless wearing the right label.

I always squeezed her body so the water would squirt out the holes of her feet to drain her too but I guess we just weren't able to get her dry enough. The mechanism for the shower is very difficult for a young child. It's hard for them to attach the fish to the tube and then squeeze to activate the shower mechanism.

However, when it stopped functioning (i.e., turned into a paperweight), their tech-support department wouldn't even pick up their phone. The only exception was on about my 10th call over a three-week period, when someone finally picked up and then slammed the phone back down without even saying hello.

This is roughly the number of soldiers we lost in the entire Vietnam war; despite losing that many men in one day, Rome didn't give up. They refused to surrender because no one in Rome shared Cindy Sheehan's philosophy. Those who did back then lived in Carthage; that's why we learned about the Roman Empire, and not the Carthagenian, when we went to school.This silly, illogical rant is a testament to the intellectual and moral bankruptcy of the \\"peace\\" movement.

Ever.","review":"I picked this book up on the suggestion of a friend who said it was by and far the worst book he had ever read. Having read many thousands of sci-fi and fantasy books I scoffed. I have to rescind my original opinion however, it really is as bad as I was told and in some ways far far worse. It easily ranks in the top 5 worst books I've ever read if not the worst. Do yourself a favor and let those who have read this dismal trash before you prevent you from suffering unnecessarily. The author either has a horrible vocabulary of incorrect language or the editor just hit \\"replace all\\" in the spell checker leaving about a dozen horribly misused and out of place (but correctly spelled) words spread throughout the book. The story is at best mediocre and the protagonist is a predictable bore.

Say your son or daughter reads \\"Shadow God\\" and then reads \\"Mein Kampf\\"--MEIN KAMPF will seem like a good book! I've already contacted the Parents Literary Resource Center (PLRC) and the Family Fitness Society to let them know that this book is the literary equivalent of a gateway drug to moral confusion.

The watch holds up nicely to anything I throw at it. The watch, so far, is fairly accurate for an automatic at around +20 seconds/day. I can definitely live with that. I do wish I could wind it, but that's a minor thing. My only real gripe is the jubilee bracelet - it's flimsy and cheap. It IS comfortable but that's about all. I swapped the bracelet out for a gray NATO strap and it looks fantastic and wears much better. The lume is bright and lasts a long time. The bezel turns with a nice click. The watch is fairly tall at 14mm and it wears taller than that, but it's not absurd (it looks nice). The day/date function is nice to have and easy to set. It's not the dressiest watch around and I probably would not wear it with a suit, but for daily wear it's hard to beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WATCH!!!, okay band","review":"The fit, finish, and construction of the watch are superb for the price, it's a great value. I was looking for a rugged ever day watch that looked nice and could take a beating, this fits the bill and doesn't break the bank. The band however is somewhat cheap. I would recommend looking into either the Seiko super jubilee bracelet, or the Seiko super oyster bracelet. Both of these can be found on Amazon (and elsewhere). They are solid bracelets but with hollow end links. On eBay you can find either Seiko super bracelet with custom made solid end links added to them for about $90. I purchased one of those (jubilee) and am still into the watch less then $300. I believe that for the money the band watch set is the nicest looking best value around for a rugged dive watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"My BEAUTIFUL Seiko SKX007K2","review":"The watch looks stunning !!!i don't think you can buy a better watch for that kind of money,it's manly design sometimes is mistaken for a rolex,the only minor thing I am not crazy about is the bracelet is a little weekfor this heavy watch, but it makes up for it in looks perfomance style.I own a rolex but i don't want to use an 7k dollar watch every day,so this seiko is my \\"second every day rolex\\"Buy it, you won't be dissapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Best Buy","review":"This watch is fantastic. The only drawback is the weak band, it is too light and does not feel as substantial as the watch itself. Other than that do not waste your money on a more expensive diver, the watch can easily be worn as a dress watch. All around best buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I ordered a seiko watch from bodying, the watch shipped from Malaysia??? and came in a broken box. I was so excited about the watch I looked past that and started wearing it. The watched advanced about 1 minute everyday, and when I didn't wear for about 3 hours it stopped, So pretty much every morning I had to adjust the time. When I wore it continuously I still had to take the time back 1 minute everyday. When I tried to contact them, I got an e-mail full of the word \\"KINDLY\\", there was nothing kindly about the e-mail, they refused to do something about the defected item. I wrote to amazon, and they refunded me immediately. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS RETAILER. DO NOT TAKE A CHANCE, THERE ARE TONS OF GOOD SELLERS ON THE INTERNET."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the money","review":"Outstanding value is what Seiko offers and the SKX007 is no exception. Fit and finish is unmatched at this price point. I've been wearing this watch for about a month and the movement has settled in at about +5 seconds a day, well within specs for this movement. Solid end links would be nice with the jubilee bracelet but again for the money, I'm not complaining.If a solid, reliable classically styled divers watch is what you're in the market for, this is definitely one to seriously consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great diver","review":"I received this watch for my birthday and I really love it. The watch itself is a big change from my normal Seiko 5 because of the weight and size difference. After getting used to the weight I really fell in love with this watch.

Very durable and I like that the front face is flat, minimizing scratches. In addition, it has a very clean look which allows the wearer to quickly glance and observe the time. However, about 2 years into ownership, the watch started to run fast, by a few mintues a day. I sent it back to Seiko for repair (US Customer service center in NJ) and it appeared as if the problem was fixed. However after about a year, the watch now runs close to 40-50 minutes fast PER DAY. As nice as it looks, a watch has to tell time correct.

They are right, it feels a little weird at first to have a light strap and heavy watch. Don't worry, you'll get used to it very quickly.However, after about a year of use with no problems, suddely the watch started running fast. Now it's usual that automatics run a little fast, but this is ridiculous - 20 minutes per day.Being up to 20 minutes out on any given day simply isn't acceptable. There's no way I'd use it as a dive watch - wouldn't trust it to tell me whether there was gas left in my tanks. I sent it back to seiko - who serviced it and there has been no improvement. Time to send it back again...Worth buying anyway because of it's great look and feel, but you'd be gambling that you get one which doesn't run fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for money; Sturdy Watch - but poor strap","review":"I have owned this watch for almost 2 years and it has far out-lasted other 'budget' watches I have owned. It keeps good time and the glass has resisted scratches and breakage. The strap ('bracelet') is the literal and figurative weak-link though; the links stretch and I have repeatedly had to repair it. Great value for the money overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the watch, but...","review":"One of the spring bars that came installed is a common thin one, not the thick original it should be. So it rattles very much, the bracelet is loose, and it just feels insecure in my wrist.

The \\"day\\" reading is bilingual (spanish/english). Not something I want or need. The display needs to be set on either language, but because the day reading must flip past the spanish it first shows the spanish day (at midnight) and then does not switch to the english day until about 3am. This is not something that has any value for me and since I am often up past midnight its kind of useless. Seiko was simply trying to save money by engineering one watch for two languages, but failed as the display is a clumsy attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad service, watch nice","review":"since i got the watch is being slowing down (loose like an hour every day), i tough it was me (the watch works with your movement) that i wasn't using it enough, finally i contact the seller and they ask me to pay for shipment (fine) PLUS 20 dlls to get it shipped back!!!!!!!!!, they receive it 11 days ago (i have the confirmation) and no word from them!!i like the watch, but the seller is not committed to the costumer.update: i just got this answer...\\"According to our system we have not yet received your watch for repair.

Postwar records from the former Soviet Union show that the ratio was more like 3 to 1. Inaccuracies in the photographs state f-84s as f-94s ect. However, the work would still be acceptable if not for the poor writing style of the author. When recounting the first hand stories of aces, I found I had to read them three times to get any clear picture of what is going on.

I was worried about it picking up sprays and spills from things cooked nearby, but so far that hasn't been a problem. It still looks great. A word of general advice, reading reviews before purchase I noticed people had different comments about how loud or soft the whistle is (for any kettle, not just this one). I realize now that's kind of a moot point, as it's so highly relative. Personally, I need a louder whistle so I can hear it down the hall. This one is loud enough, I just have to make sure no TVs/music are playing.Update Feb 2013: Still satisfied, but as commented elsewhere the black plastic on the spout has melted. Kind of disappointing - if it continues I will find a new kettle, as I don't like the thought of breathing the fumes in."},{"rating":"1","title":"black plastic on the spout melted","review":"Nice design but poor materials. I've had this tea kettle in the past and loved it. Unfortunately the old one was dropped on a stone floor and damaged -- understandable. I thought this would be a good replacement. It does not seem to be the same quality as the old one. The black plastic on the spout melted. I don't have an industrial stove just a regular household stove. I didn't boil it for hours or let it go dry. It's quite shocking that a reputable brand like OXO would use plastic with such a low melt point. Why? This plastic became soft and disfigured within a few days of purchase and use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement","review":"I used this tea kettle for about one month and I already see rust forming around the spout. I also noticed steam coming out of the cover area when it's starting to boil, which makes the handle moist. The steam doesn't make the handle hot, but it's just a nuisance to grab a wet handle. The spout also opens a bit too easily compared to oxo's older model tea kettles.

I don't particularly care how much this guy loves his wife, how he spent all those years in the merchant marine, or how he sees his run as a triumph over adversity.

I found Goss's feats to be impressive but the account disturbing. I finished the book wishing I hadn't read it. He comes across as quite impressed with himself and has little of the modesty and understatement that I have found more typical of good adventure writing. (Compare Bernard Moitessier's books about equally difficult sailing accomplishments.) If you are looking for a philosopher/adventurer, Goss is not it. His reliance on expletives in key passages gives the account a vulgar quality. Like many others I was mystified as to why so much ink was spent on the fund raising effort. There probably was a good story there but I don't think he told it. Clearly Pete Goss is an awesome sailor, but this book portrays him more as attention seeker and even his website still boasts about the rescue.

The music serves mostly as a back ground to Young's droning and sleepy vocals. I bought this album (like the previous two albums) unheard and I sure regret that. These days, Neil Young seem tired and he's a million miles away from the stuff he delivered on albums such as \\"Harvest\\", \\"After the gold rush\\", \\"On the beach\\", and \\"Comes a time\\".

Bandit is an excellent acoustic cut. Falling From Above, Carmichael, Sun Green, and Be the Rain are all excellent songs. This is just a really good album.If you love Harvest or Comes a Time - the CD might not be your bag, but the DVD will.This is an EXCELLENT value. The DVD is Neil acoustic - the CD with Ralph and Billy backing him. The only thing the CD could have used was some guitar chops or organ 'color' from Pancho."},{"rating":"2","title":"He pulled it off !!!","review":"What can I say? This guy (Neil Young) is incredible. For somebody his age and of his accomplishments to come up with something so fresh, original, and at the same time, entertaining, is amazing. I just heard the CD in its entirety at a friend's house. Also, I saw Neil in concert in St Louis on August 10, where he performed the whole CD live. The show was fantastic! Neil has stayed true to his ideological roots while at the same time making them relevant to the year 2003. A great concept album which doesn't just have great concepts, but great music, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil's Best Work since Rust Never Sleeps!!","review":"This story-album is great. It grew on me with each listening. The tale each song tells is intriguing, eliciting powerful emotional and social chords in a way only Neil Young can. While the songs are long they are never boring. And one can feel Crazy Horse in every song. They may start out a bit mellow but by the end of the album they kick it in just like in the old days! The bass and drumwork reverberate in a way that will make you want to keep cranking up the volume!"},{"rating":"2","title":"neil young","review":"at 19 i have witnessed only a fraction of neil youngs career. but with greendale it is time to admit, neil young is a genius. he has already reached a plateau in the world of rock where he can't be touched, a small category of people as many of these died young. whether it was the weed and honey i can't tell you but this album carries you away and leaves you feeling refreshed and eased by the knowledge that we have artists such as this to play to us. people inexperienced in neil youngs work might find this slightly inaccessible at first but keep listening and you'll fall in love. neil young fans will be pleasantly satisfied. thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"its 2012 and Greendale is still alive!","review":"Nine years later and I still enjoy this album as much as always.the more you hear it the better it gets,yes even 9 years later..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequal to harvest","review":"Folks, the genius of music, Will travel has created teh true sequal to Harvest, Not harvest Moon. As you recall and y9ou shuld harvest was all about Family Values farms love passion nature. here we returnt o Greendale which He makes up in his mind like Garrison Keiller's. All the ongs harken back tos impler times. An album for blue and red states!! And all songs are hopeful and about traditional except bandit, which is about killing a cop. If you dont like ti you are like teh people who dont like it when they changed the Double L to the sdouble E, also read teh grapphic novel (not comic book) and Sun Green will break you're heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greendale","review":"Greendale being Young's 2003 release and is a concept album that can be comapared with The Wall by Pink Floyd and Autobahn by Kraftwerk and tells the story of a family in a fictitious town in California called Greendale. The album met good reviews and Allmusic gave it 3.5 stars and Rolling Stones gave it 4 so I also give 4 since a strong 3 feels a bit cheap. No lyrics are included but we get well-written liner notes for each track and some interesting sketches of the family. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss This CD","review":"Neil Young unleashes his immense talent once again. The songs are original. His insights into the characters, citizens of the fictional town, are deep. Young, at times witty, at times sarcastic, just tells it like it is.The songs are in no rush to end. You can enjoy their fullness and immerse yourself into them. The band, Crazy Horse is, as usual, terrific.The music stays with me, the emotions linger."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Neil","review":"To be fair I am a long time Neil Young fan.

I have missed the days of good theme albums and it wasnt untill I heard Greendale I realized how much I missed them. Thank You Neil."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterful story telling","review":"The story of a town and its inhabitants, told with the charm, wit, and musical genius of neil young. Probably the best neil young album to come out since the 60's as far as I can tell. I picked this up the day it came out and have played the cd or dvd every day since. I personally prefer the dvd to the cd as the live acoustic songs with the stories inbetween are beautiful and have a bit more depth to them lyrically. One cannot deny that the music of crazy horse on the cd adds its own twist to the stories. This is is my favorite neil young cd to date. Great concept, great story, great music, buy it now while it still has the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing brilliance","review":"This is my album of the year. It is built by an old favourite using some of his pet sounds but constructed differently. Robert Christgau seemed put off by the length of the songs and others have commented that the basic blues shuffles are predictable and boring. For me the music grows with repeated listening and the sparse sound of the three piece Crazy Horse is different. It reminds me of the acoustic moments on Zuma. The guitar shuffles remind me of those on Jimmy Reed's Greatest (on Rhino). (Neil has been dropping enough hints in interviews) A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greendale Is More Then It Seems","review":"Greendale is much more then new songs from Neil Young. The songs take you on an adventure into the lives of one family the Greens. From Grandpa to Sun Green you can feel their loves, hurts and passions. Neil Young has created something special with Greendale and I'm glad I had the opportunity to see the show performed live. When the movie is released it will all fall together. I've seen all of the videos of the songs that have been shown to date. The only ones that are left to see our Sun Green and Carmichael. Neil Young's web site helps you understand all you need to know about Greendale. Thanks, Neil! If this would be the last work he ever did it would be a wonderful way to end a remarkable career. I hope that he has many more years to be as creative as he has been over all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Neil","review":"This is the first Neil Young CD with an \\"theme\\" running through every song. Set in the fictitious town of \\"Greendale\\", the songs tell the story of Edith and Earl Green, their daughter Sun, Grandpa, Grandma, and cousin Jed. The package comes with a Bonus DVD that features a live, acoustic version of the songs, with Neil offering narrative in between.What can I say? If you're a diehard Young fan, you will love it. If not, you'll find it uninteresting. Listen especially to \\"Falling From Above\\", \\"Sun Green\\", and \\"Be the Rain\\". They are among the best efforts from Neil in a long, long time.There will also eventually be a \\"Greendale\\" movie which looks interesting. Young fans can go to his website and preview certain \\"chapters\\" of the movie.Neil, Long May You Run."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one-play CD at best...","review":"I got to hear this new material live this summer-- more than I wanted to hear as it turned out. He played it start to stop, it was an hour and a half but it seemed much longer. This is going to be my only time listening to this.

The lyrics on here are terrible, so cliched it could be a parody. There's not one memorable melody on the whole album. I think Neil should take a break..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concert Goer Beware","review":"If you go to a concert misnamed \\"Neil Young and Crazy Horse\\" expect to hear every last cut from this dreary, banal, droning and relentlessly painful exercise in self-indulgence.The only reason most (former) fans stayed at Radio City last night was the forlorn hope of hearing two or three songs from Neil's creative past. Fat chance. Concert goers streamed out the door when it became clear that Neil was determined to inflict every last measure of pain possible on his audience. If, when the lights went on after the encore, the theatre was 1/3 full, I would be amazed. Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio City - Greendale sucks!","review":"Wow, my wife warned me about what she heard about his concert at Meadowlands. I didn't believe her. I thought it sucked and I did not appreciate being surprised by a Michael Moore concert. Should have went to see the Allman Brothers Band at the Beacon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Neil Young's worst album ever?","review":"I've really liked a lot of Young's (fairly) recent albums, such as Ragged Glory and Harvest Moon, but this thing is bloody awful-- standard Young noodling that never quite turns into a Neil Young song, nearly all of it to the same monotonous drumbeat, several examples of it running as long as 13 minutes, over which he speaks-- improvises?-- some lyrics aimed at painfully obvious social topics like TV news, that hit more than a few moments of Spinal Tap-level inappropriate hilarity. By the time he starts singing through a megaphone, as if he were Ken Nordine's alter ego, it's hard not to think this is the followup to Trans. Bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"This is the best record Neil Young has released in about a decade, and is at least as interesting as Tonight's the Night if not more so. The story can be a little difficult and confusing to follow at times (no lyrics included), but I found it hard NOT to pay attention closely to each song. Although I don't agree with some of the political views expressed (enough of the liberal save-the-environment-agenda already), it's still a compelling take on modern American life. And the music is outstanding!! Some of the best guitar Neil has ever played and Crazy Horse (without Pancho for some reason) sound fantastic. The music has almost a Mirror Ball-ish feel to it in the production and roughness, but that's a good thing. Especially coming after Are You Passionate, this album is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio City - An amazing experience","review":"The Radio City concert was an amazing experience - at the end of the Greendale performance a full house was on its feet cheering for two-three minutes. Yes, in the beginning I saw a few people leave but it was an honor to hear the work of a talented songwriter and performer who obviously believes in the importance of growing and changing as life goes on. Open your mind to Greendale and you are in for a treat. It's a courageous, original and brilliant work. I highly recommend the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Neil!","review":"This is a great CD which goes along with his current tour. I never get tired of listening to these songs. We had to see the Greendale show live twice this summer, because once was not enough! This CD and the DVD of Neil performing Greendale solo are a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. Thank you, Neil Young!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"what an amazing album, He has guts to put out something like this. you never know what to expect from neil young. His best work since sleeps with angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"great new album; the best neil sounded in years . all songs are a 4 stars. Crazy horse sounds great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work Of Genius","review":"Neil never ceases to amaze me. After seeing the crowds reaction during the the shows prior to the release of the album you could tell who the true Neil Young fans were. Many people were dissapointed but not me. I just caught the show in Atlantic City about a month after the release and the audience reaction was like night and day. Standing ovations. This album is a masterpiece, a work of art by an artist who continues to be an innovator.This is the best music Neil has put out since Rust Never Sleeps.The songs flow together and it's impossible to turn off the CD without listening to the whole thing through."},{"rating":"1","title":"humdrum","review":"I was sadly disappointed to hear Neil's opera cd, \\"Greendale\\", fall short of his potential. The songs on his new release sound tired, lack melody and are not very stirring. While the story about the Greens show Neil in a new direction with songs about an imagined family in Greendale, such as Double E that are listenable although the songs sound too identical to one another in their simplicity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Working title: \\"Dullsville\\"","review":"I've always admired the way Neil Young fearlessly goes wherever his Muse takes him, but the problem is that sometimes she takes him to places like Greendale, where there seems to be some sort of melody ban in effect. I asked a couple of locals about all the two-chord noodling but they just stared...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it either","review":"I'm a big Neil Young fan, but this one leaves me cold. The lyrics are interesting, but the music sounds like it was written in about 10 minutes. Maybe that's the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil is cool, but this is Booorrrrring...","review":"I admire the scope and amount of work he put into the multimedia aspect of this project, but this music is just plain dull. All of the songs sound the same and barely have coherent melodies. If you really want to subject yourself to Greendale, you might as well watch the DVD or go see it live, at least there's more going on to hold your attention. The second star of the two stars I gave this was for sheer effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"more cliches than you can shake a stick at....","review":"Neil can be so good and soooo bad. This one's pretty lame. The song writing sounds real labored and the music just isn't that exciting either. I read a review that said his guitar playing was like \\"Santana on valium.\\" Seems pretty accurate to me. Not much of a concept either."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE NEW WORE OFF REAL QUICK","review":"I am a big Neil Young fan and have almost all his albums, but I am somewhat dissapointed with Greendale. It was very bland until I watched the DVD. This brought a little more interest to the songs, but still, I could not get into it very much. I am afraid this one might gather dust like Trans and Landing On Water. He has made some of the greatest music of all time, but he has had some real duds also. I cannot even remember the name of his last album before Greendale. I probably played it twice.He is a big talent so maybe his next offering will be more rewarding. Hang in there Neil, I love Ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Neil Young is new again...","review":"There's just something that grips you when you listen to the album for the first time. It's raw. It's powerful. It's good.Neil Young's latest album \\"Greendale\\" is a story-driven concept album, almost to the point where one could consider it a rock-opera. The difference between this rock-opera and others (i.e. Tommy, The Wall) is that Young allows for a raw, almost under-produced sound, the sound he's become known for in his live performances with Crazy Horse. But it's not just those long-rockin' songs a la \\"Cowboy in the Sand\\" that are the jewels of this album. Young introduces a touch of smooth R&B, relaxed country, and hearty rock-a-billy into both the music and his lyrics in that lazy care-free style that only he could deliver. Whether you're a fan of early works like \\"Harvest\\" or later works like \\"Ragged Glory\\" you'll enjoy this back-to-basics sound of Neil Young at his best. Oh yeah, make sure to check out the DVD too. Definitely a worth-while purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another twist in the road","review":"Allright. By now you either get Neil Young or you don't and time should not be wasted trying to bring new converts to the fold. This is an ambitious,sprawling effort that misfires at certain points, but overall it works for me. The songs are spare, to be sure, but convey an earnestness and freshness lacking in most overproduced fare. You get the sense that this was a one take recording which sounds live and vibrant. The cd builds narratively and musically to a powerful conclusion, despite the muddled storyline. I would liken it to a stripped down \\"Ragged Glory\\", with a more consistent musical theme.The bonus dvd is a treasure and is worth the purchase in its own right. It was featured on the Neil's website last month. The liner notes indicate that Pancho was not part of the studio mix, which accounts for his nominal contribution on tour. To conclude, buy it, get in the car, crank it up and go for a long drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Ain't Harvest !","review":"If you have been a long time lover of Neil Young's music you should enjoy his new cd. By now long time fans of Neil know to expect the unexpected. If you are just a fan of his hits you will probably hate Greendale. I recently witnessed Greendale live and was completely blown away by the performance and story.However many \\"fans\\" seated near me were griping and booing because Neil wasn't playing his classics. The live Greendale is a very beautiful and moving story. I am not sure how people who have not seen it performed live will take to it. It's a concept album with themes of anti-violence, distrust of goverment, and love of the enviroment. If you're a true \\"rustie\\", put on the cd and enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Legendary lineup presented poorly.","review":"Great artists. Great songs. A great night.

I loved the poems and songs, especially how they help the charactors of the story. I also enjoyed the fact that all of the charactors in the story were animals. I like how the dialogue really went along with characters,and every animal has its own accent and uses different choices of words. I really found the story very intersting. It had some adventure (which I liked) but mainly dialogue and description. One thing I found most amazing was that at the beginning of every chapter the author makes a beautiful description of the setting. I really enjoyed the story and I hope many people do too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair","review":"I;ve seen better books by Brian Jacques in the past.

However, I found Triss a huge disappointment. For me, it was just too much of the same stuff in the other Redwall books. I thought it was so boring that I never finished it. And my friends all agree that Triss is sadly lacking the magic of the other Redwall books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"Personally, I thought Triss was one of the best Redwall books yet. I liked it much better than I did Taggerung. The story was great, as were the characters. Princess Kurda is my favorite villian, with Tsarmina from Mossflower coming in a close second. Definitely worth the time to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Jacques novel","review":"People who complain about the book being much like the others seem to think that Jacques owes it to them to write increasingly more complicated books for them as they get older and more mature. The books stay the same, it's how Jacques writes, and it's what he writes.Triss is a good representation of many of the books in the Redwall series. It is a fantastic book for young children, and one that anyone can enjoy as long as they are okay with good and evil being black and white concepts. The book itself is quite entertaining, has a good moral, and is perfect for young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brian Jacques is Losing His Touch","review":"I'm a very avid Brian Jacques fan, but Triss has to be the worst one yet. Nothing in the entire novel was original; it was all the same gluttonous hares, naughty dibbuns and smelly, stupid vermin. I think it's about time for a change of pace. Nothing seems to be changing, it's just a recycling of old, overused ideas. Now, I shall definitely keep reading Jacques's Redwall books for as long as they continue to come out, but I seriously think it's about time for something different and radical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its getting worse","review":"At one time I was a true Redwall fan, and all I did was think, eat, and read Redwall, but times have changed. This series has gone from good to horrible. Triss is a complete copy of all Jacques other books, he has done nothing new, absolutely nothing. How is it that a young squirrelmaid is able to defeat \\"a bad guy\\" who has been training with swords their whole life, yet Triss has never touched one. This series is hard to believe and not worth my time anymore, and I don't think it will be worth yours either, so stay away read something else, focus on Eragon and Eldest by Christopher Paolini, books one and two of the Inheritance Trilogy. Paolini is the new king of young adult fantasy, hail Paolini not Jacques, Jacques has been dethroned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Triss sucks!!!","review":"I thought Triss wasn't that good.

Make sure to purchase extra umbrellas if you are interested in a soft lighting - because I can guarantee you that the knobs are going to pop off within few days and that means that the fabric of the umbrella is going to come off.I still gave it two stars due to the fact that the lighting itself is a great buy and I am happy with it and the results of my photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Not exactly a pro grade kit but for what you pay its good value. Can light up a family portrait on location with no problems. Not so portable as there is no included case but light enough to carry around in a box if you have to.

The light stands are really nice and sturdy. I plan on upgrading to the 500w bulbs for portraits though, the 250w are not quite at bright as I would like.My only complaint is they were a little tricky to put together, and two of the three bulbs burnt out the first time I used them after I bumped into them.*Update 3-3-09:The more I have had a chance to use these lights the more disappointed I am with them. I needed the light stands and umbrellas anyway so im glad I got them for that reason, but the lights are just not powerful enough even with 500 watt bulbs. They light they put out is really ugly and yellow and they get so hot, I never fail to burn myself when I use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable Sayings of a Sage Compiled.","review":"'My writings should me cremated with my body', that is what the Mahatma said.

The Brothers Quay are grimmer, grittier and lack the subtle humor, warmth and humanism of Svankmajer...a side of the filmmaker that shines thru especially in THIS film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre, humorous, and sexually charged","review":"This was my first Jan Svankmajer film which I bought not really knowing what to expect. I loved it but please be advised that this is not for everyone. The movie has music but no spoken words... but don't let that deter you- actions speak louder then words.

However, the CD booklet says that : \\"The concert suite recorded here was made in 1911 and published in 1912. It was the first of three made by Stravinsky and uses almost the same orchestration as the complete ballet score. The two later suites of 1919 and 1945 use a reduced orchestra\\". How could I know that there were three versions! On the other hand, this cd includes some of the early works which are not easy to find (there is always a cd with Rite of Spring and Firebird), like Fireworks, the Symphony no 1, and the Scherzo Fantastique.

You have to set it to low or high, whichever you want, and then you need to push down this start button.

This was particularly troubling in the night when I was trying to do this in the dark so as not to disturb my child. It is virtually impossible to know if it is on or not.....you literally have to wait for the unit to warm up the water enough to start the steam feature....which can take several minutes.

While she meticulously footnotes every source, the sources are from newspaper clippings and magazine articles. This supposed definitive biography of Elton John doesn?t have one direct interview with the subject, his band mates, collaborators, friends or enemies.

However, I was hoping for more; some new and/or different information than has previously been distributed via all of the usual sources, including Elton himself. No such luck. The title is apt: this book ultimately reads like a well-researched and documented paper on the music of Elton John, with no new information regarding the man himself. My only true quarrel with this work would have to be the author's occasional tendency to editorialize and let her preferences and biases toward (or against) periods of his music or specific songs slip through.

The film was made with a odd kind of video camera were the viewer can see 2 to 4 things at once along with Subtitles to the Japanese and Chinese (it is set in Japan and Hong Kong) language of the film making it like a book you read then a film to watch. The story is mote about the live of a woman (Vivian Wu) who is obsessed with recreating two childhood rituals one of them being to use her body to write words on and to write her own \\"Pillow book\\" (diary).

Lots of male frontal nudity, which was a refreshing change, though not for Greenaway, the narration was torture and the storyline was not only so farfetched and boring, but insulting and slow.

The image is great, the sound is just amazing, and the trailer included is astonishing. GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay Viewers Beware!","review":"Peter Greenaway has made one of the most homophobic films in the history of English-language cinema. The plot simply boils down to this: A young woman takes vengence on the wealthy gay man who seduced her father (leading to his suicide) and whose lover she also loved. Replace \\"the Homosexual\\" with \\"The Jew\\" and you'd be back to the Nazi-era atrocity \\"Jud Suss\\". Fortunately, all of this is wrapped up in an artsy enough packaging that most of the queer haters would find the movie incomprehensible. But, somehow, the art-house audiences are caught up enough with Greenaway's visual smoke and mirrors not to realize what they're watching either. A truly evil piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never watch this movie","review":"I am a Ewan fan and I paid by 7 dollars to see this movie thinking that it would be good. This is the WORST OF ALL TIME!!! I have never seen a movie that I disliked as much as this one. This was the only movie that I have ever walked out on. I really hated it!

It is simply a stunning visual experience. However, it seems almost criminal to me that the DVD has been butchered into a full-screen ratio, thus losing much of the visual impact. I suppose seeing 55% of the movie is better than nothing, but I sincerely hope that someday, somebody releases the entire film on DVD, so we can experience as it was meant to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good movie, but...","review":"...two flaws that seriously detracted from my enjoyment of this otherwise fine film:1. Vivan Wu is simply not believable as a Japanese woman. Her speech patterns, gestures, mannerisms, appearance, and attire are all wrong. She makes an excellent effort, but fails to convince.2. Two of the \\"chapters\\" are mixed up - i.e., the numbers as written on the bodies of the characters do not match the captions that appear on the screen. Hello? Continuity?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TRANSCENDENT WORD","review":"In the strict and rigidly defined gender roles of women in feudal, Imperial Japan, one solace women had were their \\"pillow books\\", journals where they could pour out their thoughts, yearnings, fears and hopes. This beautiful movie is a modern \\"pillow book\\", one woman's attempt to define herself in a world where traditional definitions are falling away. All around her, the main character watches in pain and confusion as her world changes, falls apart, reconstitutes itself and falls away, again and again. The transcendent thread of continuity is The Word, the beautiful calligraphy of language; time passes, the world changes, The Word remains. In The Word the woman finds her definition, her hope and...even her revenge. This incredible film is a celebration of the Magic and Salvation of Language, one woman's amazing strength, and the Immortality of The Written Word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Vanguard Cinema","review":"Simply the best movie I've seen, from of course Peter Greenaway, magical, with a totally new exploration of visual coherence, a contemporary sublime, a total evolution from one of the world's best directors. This movie will change the classic thought and way of movie making."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pillow Book","review":"Whatever were they thinking? The cinematography was wonderful. The techniques were unique and innovative. Ewan McGregor, as always, was superb - and as an added plus we get to see ALL of him. That alone made it worth watching. Vivian Wu is stunning and compelling. But even these fine actors could not salvage this story which was highly convoluted, incredibly difficult to follow and totally lacking substance. Once the very brief interlude between Wu and McGregor is over, there is little to hold your attention. I never tire of watching McGregor, however this is a film that I would gladly have missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"Check out \\"Iron & Silk\\" to see what Vivian Wu can do when she is given an opportunity to act. Here she is saddled with a superficial script and Greenaway's chaotic story-telling. There are some striking visual images and some inventive filmic presentations, but the movie feels tediously pretentious because the characters have no depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad mastering!","review":"This DVD has the worst mastering I have ever seen.While still images are often exquisitely detailed,moving objects detach from their backgrounds andwallpaper patterns dance.

Simply superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"ahem....","review":"If your idea of a good movie is watching Ewan McGregor walking around naked with his uncut equipment flopping around going from sex with one fat old asian man to another then yeah you'll love this movie and you can hide behind the same critiques about the films mis en scene that these other critics are blowing hot air about. Otherwise forget it. This film is both boring and disturbing and not in a cool way either. There are some colorful visuals with the beautiful young starlet and her fetish for writing Mandarin on bodies but it doesn't save the film. How are we supposed to take him seriously as Obi Wan after seeing this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie came on televsion, that's why I watched it.","review":"Ok, lets get it out. This movie was strange. I get offended when I see women doing full frontal nudity especially while the men are fully clothed, but after seeing this movie, I realize that I just don't care for nudity of any kind during movies that are not rated XXX. The suicide was uncalled for. There wasn't a justification for it--if we all killed ourselves because the person we loved (... had sex with) wouldn't talk to us, the human race would be near extinction. The rejection could have been written in a far better way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"As an unabashed Ewan McGregor fan, I was eager to watch this movie. Even a young, charming and frequently nude Mr. McGregor could not redeem this film. I would rate this as one of the worst movies I have seen lately. While I find the premise interesting, the actual film itself is truly dreadful. I must agree with many previous reviewers with regards to their objections to the film. Vivian Wu as a Japanese woman? Bad idea. I missed several sequences of the movie due to white on white writing and other poorly mastered effects. The entire film was bizarre and disjointed. The few interesting and sensual scenes that involve the beautiful writing on the individual bodies do not make up for the overall displeasure I experienced while watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"bring on that colostomy bag.........","review":"Watching this so called movie was as entertaining and pleasurable as getting my teeth pulled(without anesthetic).In every possible way the movie is suppose to be touching,enlightening,imaginative,spiritual and so on.....when it is actually disconnected,confusing \\"designer trash\\".At no point and time could I relate or connect with this movie or it's characters... and in my final analysis; Pillow Books'gratuitous full frontal male nudity(gathering from what i've read from other reviews)has \\"profoundly\\" compensated some women for the female nudity they've seen in other movies.If that is not corruption of one's sense of decency..what is?Me personally..I would rather slurp my next can of soup through a used colostomy bag than have to view this trash again.Easily, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Watch it, and you'll be begging for those two hours back when you pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously overrated","review":"A director tosses in some \\"artful\\" shots and full nudity for most of the movie and suddenly it's a \\"beautiful film\\"???I kept expecting to see Marilyn Chambers pop up in scenes.

Admittedly I rented this movie with the full knowledge it was not going to anything more than a bad B-horror movie; so bad in fact that it could possibly be humorous.

Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed. Although the story line had potential, the writing was so horrid that it was a complete waste of my time. The dialog was contrived, the interactions not at all believable, and the characters only a sketch of what they could have been. Brewer also included way too many subplots, without fleshing any of them out enough to make them interesting. I'm sorry, but this book couldn't hold a candle to Dee Henderson's Uncommon Heroes series or to Suzanne Brockmann's SEAL books."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WOULD BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN","review":"This was one of the Christmas toys for a 3yr old.

Enjoyed every page in both books. Night Fall moves with bravado in the style of film noir. A very visual and exciting detective story, with a political theme -- the loss of lives on TWA Flight 800. Esau Swindle has more believable characters and is written in a more literary style. Set in the glamorous locales of Buenos Aires and New York, Esau Swindle follows art dealer Jacob Rose and his pursuit of his brother's killer and dirty money. Both books lead to surprise conclusions. Congratulations to Gerald Rothberg for Esau Swindle and Nelson DeMille for Night Fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engossing piece of speculative fiction","review":"Starting from a horrible true event, DeMille takes us through a convoluted and fast-paced chase for the truth. The characters, especially John Corey and his NYPD detective pal Dom Fanelli, are well drawn and believable. The dialogue between them adds what little humor that can be had in this situation. As the plot proceeds, there is a sense of foreboding (upon which I will not elaborate here)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Conspiracy Theory Novel","review":"Nelson Demille has done what some authors have failed to avoid when approaching sensative real time events: Sensationalism. Armed with solid data from the TWA 800 incident, the author presents both sides of the events that occured on that day without the 'Oliver Stone' formula. Five years after the event (and shortly before 9/11), two ficticious ATTF agents search for the truth as to what occured on that day only to find alot of government screwups in regards to how the case was handled. This novel is a wake up call for those who easily fall for the whole 'we never went to the moon', '9/11 was an inside job', or 'Alex Jones thinks that government jack-boots will be kicking in our doors at any time' attitude !"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't put it down or go to sleep","review":"I have read all of DeMille books but the ones I love the most are those books with his characters Kate and John Corey. I hope to heavens he writes more, with Kate and John Corey as his central characters. How can you not love a man who is a little on the wild side, and with a wife (who is his boss) with the FBI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story and Characters","review":"In my opinion this was a very skillfully crafted story and the pages turned quickly. If you enjoy police procedurals and anything regarding the terrorist activity prior to 9/11 you will very likely enjoy this book. I found the main character's humor very entertaining and added a lot to the story. I found the premise of the plot to be very believable and that the investigation proceeded in a plausible manner. I do agree with some of the criticism that the end came sudden and a bit too easy, and I would have found it more palatable had the author not given credit to someone at the end of the work that gave him an easy way out of the problematic corner he had painted himself into with his plot. No matter. In the end, I found this to be a most enjoyable book and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a well told mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very disappointed","review":"I'm an avid DeMille reader. I waited with anticipation to read Night Fall. After 200 pages I told my husband, \\"Nothing is happening.\\" I said the same thing after 300 pages and then, the ending. I smell sequel. The plot, what there is of it: a man and woman, not married to each other, have a night of sex on the beach and decide to tape it. It's the night TWA 800 went down after takeoff from JFK. What took it down? The official answer? Or, a missile? )Where's Pierre Salinger when you need him?) Did the couple get the downed airliner on their video? And was there a missile to be seen? There are some plot angles that just don't jive and you get no answer to. Why doesn't anyone question the return of Ted Nash from the dead? Or, in the world of spookdom, does that happen all the time and is status quo? The ending leaves so many questions unanswered, and I don't just mean did the missile take the plane down, that it's got to mean sequel. I was terribly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame assed ending","review":"This book is an intresting mix of fact and fiction and I enjoyed the conspiracy elements. However the ending is just crap, what a lame way to end and it leaves the reader feeling completely unsatisfied. On further inspection it is revealed that the authors 24 year old son came up with the idea of the ending which only helps to leave the reader even more let down. I for one will not be reading any more of this so called writers novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate surprise endings","review":"Many years ago I had a freshman English Porefessor who taught us the fundamentals of English composition. There was a beginning, which logically proceeded to the middle, which logically led to the conclusion. Neat and simple. Mr. Demille has written a book which takes care of two of the three elements. His begginning was great, and held my attention. His middle was perhaps even better, leading me to stay up later to get to the end. The ending is a bummer and left me cold. A surprise ending is only for someone who cannot make up their own mind about where their work would lead them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This book starts out with a totally unnecssary lurid sex scene that would make a sailor blush.

This is all rapidly culminating into what you think is going to be the final showdown.... when the book abruptly ends. I was massively dissapointed, it sounded like a 7yr old finished off the last five pages.I give it two stars for the quality of story telling and interesting content, however I couldn't help but feel that the ending was cheap and reading the book had been a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeMille is a shadow of his former self.","review":"Nelson DeMille began his career with a series of terriffic, riveting novels. \\"Gold Coast\\" remains amongst my top 5 books of all time. Other novels like \\"Charm School\\" and \\"Cathedral\\" were riveting page turners.But in his last few novels, DeMille has become lazy. \\"Night Fall\\" is by far the worst of these and is a massive disappointment to this former fan. In the liner notes, DeMille even credits his son for coming up with the (terrible) ending when he had \\"written himself into a corner\\". After reading the book, it's clear why he needed help. There is no structure. No suspense, save for the single question as to what really happened to the downed plane, which is never answered.Mr. DeMille, I have great respect for you as a writer. Your early works were engaging, well-plotted, and respectful of the reader - who you always managed to stay a step ahead. As a former fan, I'd love to see you take us and your work seriously again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mundane plot with a disappointing ending","review":"This book is pathetic. It begins with an interesting concept, but as the story develops (or fails to), I was left asking \\"is this as all there is to this story?\\" I expected much more. Yes, there are some funny lines from the dry-witted humor of the main character, but his dialogue quickly became stale and obnoxoius. Way too many pages were spent on trivail details, resulting in a slow moving story with a shallow plot. After reading the disappointing ending, I felt like tossing the book out the window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great character but disappointing ending","review":"First off, let me say I love the character of John Corey & hope to see a lot more of him. But I was so frustrated at the weak ending. Some reviewers have praised it, but I was unhappy with it. Despite the realism of the novel, this is a novel after all & the reader deserves better. We never know who set the rocket off & why, or why the government (or rather some elements of it) are covering it up. Subsuming it all under 9/11 is a dirty trick on the reader. Most readers, if they are paying attention to the dates, will figure out fairly easily that 9/11 is coming soon, but that's no excuse for not providing a suitable conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Night the Plot Fell","review":"I cannot judge DeMille fully because I have only read this one book. And before I send my guided missile for a review let me say that I will read another of his book, but this one ...Well, I'll tell you this: He has a knack for dialogue. Is there no end to the interviews John Corey makes? After three hundred pages and he's still going, talking with other characters about the same thing (the streak of light, the missile, the conspiracy, the streak of light, the missile, the conspiracy, the streak ...). Oh, and about eighty pages before 'Book Three' I knew where he was heading ... hint: two planes aimed at two behemoths.His plot, in this story, is his dialogue, and nothing else. The missile that tore a hole in his plot came early, probably when he sat in front of his computer screen for hours and hours trying to come up with the opening sentence. Hey, but only for this story, alright?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting, thought provoking!","review":"I'm an inveterate, lifelong reader, (68), and have about 1,500 books in my personal library. I love to re-read favorite books; have some I must have read a dozen times.But \\"Night Fall\\" is impressed on my brain like I read it every day! I think of it often, and re-reun parts of it in my head. I won't go into the plot, but if you haven't read it, go find a copy and do so. It's an amazing book. The book unfolded for me like I was there on the spot, and I actually stayed up all night to finish it. Boy, it was worth it!I read so much that when I finish a book I kind of forget about it and move on to the next one, but this one has stayed with me! I just couldn't figure out how he was going to end it, and I think my mouth actually fell open at the conclusion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspense but no conclusion","review":"Once again Mark Twain's formula for an American crime writer of killing everybody off at the end is followed.

Too bad!!For almost 500 pages we surely want to know who targeted this flight and why was there a cover-up?There is much humour and suspense through-out but the essentials are unanswered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read","review":"DeMille starts off by explaining that he has taken certain literary license with the facts of the TWA 800 crash. The book was suspenseful and addictive. If you don't read this book, you're really missing out. The best part is, you'll never see the ending coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author Pulled Out A Gun And Shot The Plot To This Book In The Head","review":"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!! ZERO STARS!!!This book HAD everything going for it up until the last 6 pages. That's all it took for the author to pull out the biggest Deus Ex Machina in recent American history. On top of this pathetic literary device, the author threw in exploitations of not one, but TWO tragedies.I was wrapped up in a lie for the first 479 pages. I could hear the 800-pound gorilla settling into the chair beside me as soon as the epilogue ended and the main story began. I knew 100 pages out that everything was closing in on the plot. I had hopes that the 800-pound wouldn't ruin the ending. So why am I complaining? Because I wasted a week of late night reading on this book. The 800-pound gorilla stood up and choked the life out of the plot.What a despicable use of actual lives to sell this fictional garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP Nelson Demille...Part 2","review":"I totally agree with harleys review....As a fan of Demille's books and have read em all, this one really stinks....I was disappointed with his last book, Up Country, and this one is no better....It's basically Corey walking around, finding clues that the whole FBI could'nt find. He's conviently shipped to Yemen, and the ending is very predictable. This book feels like he just putting out any crap based on his previous works....Plum Island and the Lion's game the best of his writing. I will not by his next book simply because it's a Demille book. Very poor effort, Nelson, try harder next time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and contrived","review":"Well, my review title says it all. I really enjoyed DeMille's first two books featuring John Corey, but this one was a major disappointment. I found the first half to be like slogging through quicksand - though I kept reading and turning pages, I didn't seem to be getting anywhere. So many pages, so little action of consequence.... I skimmed the last half, only to come to an incredibly contrived ending. Although I like DeMille in general, I would suggest skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did he not have an ending when he wrote this?","review":"This book was terrific! Until the end.......

I felt totally cheated after wasting hours of my life reading this. Its not even a good beach read, don't think I\\"ll pick up another book by Mr DeMille. This is a great lesson on how to end a book when you just don't know how and want to take the cheap way out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a cop-out","review":"The theme of this book interested me, because I was one of the hundreds who witnessed the terrible explosion and may or may not have glimpsed streaks of light. I'm happy with the official explanation, but was prepared to go along with de Mille's proposal that a missile could have been involved, and that various governmental agencies hushed it up. But, if they did -- as the plot theorizes -- WHY? What was the point? I waded through yards of the protagonist's stupid and occasionally amusing wisecracks, kept going with a really rather easily put-down book, just to find out the answer to the mystery. And did I get it? No, I did not. Using a tragedy of the magnitude of 9/11 to cover up the author's inability to come up with a gripping, plausible ending was mildly criminal, in my candid opinion. Well, I certainly felt robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleazy cop out","review":"I have always like Mr. DeMille's work, until this book. What a cheap and pathetic ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible plot, useless ending","review":"The plot (or lack of a plot) in this book in terrible. It's more of a random set of spew typed into a word processor. The book spends hundreds of pages describing an hour in time, has a bunch of random things happen, the 'I' character babbles semi-macho nonsense.The ending in completely useless and a total rip-off. It was as if the author couldn't figure out how to end the book, so he didn't have to work to tie the plot together.I read the book at the same time a friend and my mother-in-law read the book. We all got together over lunch when we finished the book. We all looked at each other and said, \\"that was the biggest waste of 500 pages I've ever read.\\" It was unanimous that this book is terrible.If you want the macho main character, go buy a Robert Parker book. If you want a cop story, go buy a Michael Connoley book. If you want the overly flip lead character, go buy a Robert Crais book. Just don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Chapter 1 grabs your attention when two people inadvertently witness and video tape the crash of TWA 800. However, from Chapter 2 to 20, I had a difficult time staying with the book. How many times can you talk about 200 witnesses that saw a streak of light going UP to the plane. As it was the only book I had with me on a trip, I continued. Finally, it became engrossing when John Corey starts investigating the crash by going to the Bayview Hotel (Chapter 23). When Corey returns from Yemen in September, it was obvious that the ending was going to involve September 11th. The ending had no resolution regarding the TWA flight and the conspiracy, as I suppose the author intended, so I felt the book was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I love Nelson DeMille. I can't wait for his new books to be published. This one is very disappointing. Mr. DeMille has a clever idea and spends 500 pages writing and re-writing the same thing. It is redundancy to the point of being maddening. As usual, there is clever dialogue but without the usual depth and richness. Don't waste your time. Read (or re-read) Charm School or UpCountry instead. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Just to lay the facts out, I usually like Nelson Demille's works. This book had a lot of promise. I found myself flipping through the pages following the story, waiting for some sense of closure.Instead the ending was \\"the past 650 pages were just a preamble to the next book which may actually have something to do with the plot established in the first chapter and then ignored for the rest of the book\\".Very disappointing. I expect, when reading a Demille novel, to have purpose and closure at the end, even if they end up somewhat vague. This novel really disappoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Night Fall - A Disappointment","review":"After reading \\"Plum Island\\" and \\"Upcountry,\\" this book was a real disappointment. The characters are weakly drawn, the plot challenges any concept of verisimilitude (is there any reason why the FBI and CIA would conspire to hide the truth of TWA Flt. 800's crash?) and the ending (the idea for which the author attributes to his son) is a total copout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit From Demille","review":"As a big fan of Demille's \\"Plum Island\\" I would rank this his third best book, behind Plum Island and The Gold Coast.Night Fall marks the return of the always witty, wise-cracking detective John Corey, who was also the main character in Plum Island and The Lion's Game.I won't go into detail about the story as enough is already mentioned here. I enjoyed reading this book and always look forward to another from Nelson Demille.I would also recommend: Plum Island, The Gold Coast, The Lion's Game, The Charm School, The General's Daughter, Spencerville and Up Country all by Demille."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop cheating the reader","review":"A crime story needs a proper ending.

I want my money and my time back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment for a true Demille fan","review":"As a Nelson Demille devotee who has anxiously awaited a follow-up to \\"Lion's Game,\\" I was extremely dissapointed with \\"Night Fall.\\" While Demille's style describing the inner workings of John Corey's mind remains superb, the story itself is unrealistic, unenthralling and predicatble. If this book were a movie, I'd have left halfway through."},{"rating":"2","title":"great thriller","review":"Mr. DeMille presents a very plausible story regarding the fate of TWA flight 800. A little research on the internet revealed that his facts were in order and to the point.The story moves along rapidly with detective John Corey and his wife Kate involved in uncovering what really happened to flight 800. Corey was first introduced in \\"Plum Island\\", then reappeared in \\"The Lions Game\\". Like most of DeMille's characters, he is sarcastic, flippant and always stirring up trouble. The action moves along well and you have to pull for Corey and his wife in their dealings with some rather shady government types. It will probably drive the conspiracy nuts wild.This is a good book but leaves the reader hoping for a sequel to see how Corey and Kate deal with the disastrous event and the scary information they uncovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another page turner","review":"Without a doubt, DeMille is the greatest writer out there today and I eagerly await his next books. This is another page turner for sure.It's not his best work (that is unquesionably 'Up Country') but this book never the less has the Corey wit that we have grown to expect.I agree with earlier reviews that the assigments to Yemen and Tanzania left a void in the book but it did fit into the plot pretty well as you can imagine this happening at the FBI. He chooses not to write dialogue about the 6 weeks absence, rather allowing the reader to imagine an absence, which I did. It also allowed him to connect two important events in a timeline more closely.This is not his best by far but I enjoyed it thoroughly. There are too many books nowadays that take forever to liven up but this book took off on page one and never stopped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb read, but not his best","review":"DeMille scores again. He tries to blur the lines between fiction and fact, and does so quite well. John Corey is a great hero, good at what he does, smart alec in a likeable way, and true to himself. It's easy to see where this one is going early on, but I still enjoyed it, as I always do with DeMille. He's probably the best at the conspiracy game."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it!","review":"I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books. I love the dialogue and the attitudes of his characters and this one was no exception. The story was a good one, maybe a bit farfetched...or was it? It gave me pause! Anyway, I loved the book, I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelson DeMille: Captivating Authur of suspense novels.","review":"If you are looking for a fast moving \\"can't put it down suspense novel\\" then look no further!

This is one of the book that you cannot put off.John Corey is brilliant, with excellent sense of humour and courage. He portrays a true ex-NYPD cop and ATTF detective attitude with lots of guts and courage to find out the truth. Ofcourse, his wife Kate was the one to ignite this within him.A must read for some one who like dark humor, thrilling chases and ample use of grey cells.The only negative side of the book was the end. Its like, a surprise, oh! the book has completed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"After mediocre Up Country(well, in my opinion), this is as refreshing as a breath of fresh air. Truly excellent book. I was always interested in what really happened in TWA 800 crash and official explanation doesn't ring true for me. This book explores a theory that's different from mainstream explanation and that's what makes it interesting. A page turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 5-star trip with a 4-star ending","review":"All the other reviews tell the story and tell it well.

When that someone is Nelson DeMille, the result is a well reasoned page-turner. Was the TWA flight to Paris shot down? The answer is here. Bravo! The best cover-up novel since NOMAD/Y. Read it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"too predictable","review":"I agree with the reviewer who found this book to be a snooze. I really like some of DeMille's books, and was looking forward to this. I expected to read something inventive built around flight 800. Instead, he wrote the most obvious conspiracy theory. Not only does this lack the suspense of how it turns out, but the journey itself doesn't engage, as it does in some \\"airline crash\\" thrillers where the thrill is in the \\"how\\" it happened. For me, a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Mailed It In","review":"I had great expectations. I've enjoyed every one of DeMille's prior books, and marvel at how different each was from the others. Night Fall was set in the area where I live; my family had literally heard the explosion which forms the basis of the book. BUT, much to my surprise (and profound disapointment), after you got by the gross and engrossing opening, there was nothing more. All talk, no action. And a cast of characters who kept doing things which made little sense. I hope DeMille hasn't gone lazy 'cause he seems to have coasted on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Night Fall\\" by Nelson De Mille","review":"If this were not written by Mr. De Mille, I would have never sloggedthrough it. The subject matter - an actual airline crash - nevergrabbed my interest. John Corey, the street smart wise cracker ofpast novels was not witty - just henpecked. The book never wentanywhere. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one?","review":"Okay, am I the only reader who was put off by the premise of this book? I'm a huge DeMille fan, but this smacked of tasteless exploitation. While it's interesting to use real life tragedies as fodder for novels when they are way in the past (the sinking of the Titantic, bombing of Pearl Harbor, etc.) and the people who were affected firsthand are no longer alive, it's a whole different thing to expound conspiracy theories about things that happened just a few years ago. People are still grieving for their loved ones, for God's sake! And tidied up so neatly at the end! No need to actually offer any meaningful basis for the supposed coverup. Sorry, but the whole thing left me feeling cheated and disappointed in Demille."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read...but, don't listen to those who complain about the ending!","review":"Look, the ending is certainly different, but all the speculation about the real cause(s) of TWA 800 are only that: speculation.The cause of the crash is really the book's \\"MacGuffin\\" (for all you Hitchcock fans) a plot device critical to the characters but not critical to enjoying the chase.It's very fast reading, with an ending that is sad, exciting, a little predictable, but true-to-life and the only possible choice.It's fiction and entertainment...on that level, it is one of DeMille's best books in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial pap for those ensconsed on the commode","review":"The dialogue was unbelievable. Will anyone notice, I wonder? Much preferred Sisters of Glass to this one. Compare and see what you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of your time","review":"Decent premise. Plays on nitwits conspiracy theories. If you are one of them (you know who you are), you'll like this book.Lots of useless filler dialogue. And the ending you could predict from page 3. Don't waste your life like I did hoping for some payoff at the end.Here, I'll save you time: All the \\"evidence\\" goes up (I guess down is more like it) in the Twin Towers on 911, so the conspiracy remains hidden by the CIA and FBI. Ironically, the FBI and CIA are supposed to be capable of creating this conspiracy to keep the public from learning the truth, but they are too stupid to prevent the attacks. Got to love the idiots who actually believe such patent nonsense to think anybody who is brain dead enough to work for the Gov't would have enough intelligence to actually think this stuff up.This book had promise, but the execution was miserable and the ending was a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Disappointing","review":"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Nelson DeMille. He is my favorite author. But this was a weak effort. The first 100 pages (of 485) slog along at a snail's pace. The action picks up soon thereafter and builds strongly to about 450, but then it treads water for about 30 pages before fizzling out. DeMille states in the acknowledgements that his 24 year-old son helped him with the ending - - and it shows! I found it a giant cop-out and utterly dissatisfying. Now I anxiously wait for DeMille's next novel, due out late this year. I only hope it's the \\"old\\" Nelson DeMille who authors it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is adequate thriller fiction, but the lame, limp \\"ending\\" is especially trite and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"\\"Thriller\\" based on the TWA #800 disaster off the coast of Long Island. You could wait for the mass-market version or you could skip it entirely. I recommend the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"98% AWESOME...2% makes it 2 stars!","review":"I have read every Nelson DeMille book as soon as it has come out ever since picking up Charm School (<-- UNBELIEVABLE book! 7 stars!) Night Fall really grabbed me early, as do most of DeMille's books. However, the end of the book is a complete cop-out. A MAJOR LET DOWN. I am surprised that he went for this ending. Too bad. Maybe next time he won't take the easy way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"much ado about nothing","review":"I am an avid DeMille fan-I have read all his books. The last two, Up Country and Night Fall, are not up to his previous efforts. I was most disturbed by Night Fall because it lacked a sustained conflict. There is considerable repetition that doesn't move the plot forward. You can basically skip the whole section from around page 100 to 273 and not miss anything. I like the cynical John Corey. In the past he has been a much more dynamic character.The ending of the novel also seemed contrived and served to only frustrate me as it obliterated any chance of resolving the whole issue of Flight 800. Maybe Flight 800 can't be resolved, then why didn't he create a fictional flight?For my money Mayday, Spencerville, Cathedral and Lions Game are richer stories and keep you riveted. If you haven't tried DeMille yet, chose one of them. If you have read DeMille, you can only hope that he will pull out if his tailspin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated at the end","review":"This book is fun to read, and DeMille had me turning the pages all the way through, but I felt cheated at the end. It's hard to say more without giving too much away, but DeMille resorts to a fairly obvious bit of Deus Ex Machina that lets him off the hook (but leaves the reader hanging) in a big way. CHARM SCHOOL was much more satisfying. This book feels incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic page turner!","review":"Just finished \\"Night Fall\\". could not put it down. I thought that \\" The DaVinci Code\\" was exciting, but now I know that \\"Night Fall\\" makes the \\"code\\" seem bland. Mr. DeMille is back in top form. I say \\"back\\" because I did not like his \\"up Country\\" and I dont think it sold very well nor was it very well received. However, \\"Night Fall\\" will surely be an entertaining block buster as word of mouth spreads rapidly. A boffo, exciting read that will grab you by the throat and will not let go till the last page is finished. My only concern was the excess use of the \\"f\\" word. It really was too much as in many of today's movies. When this diologue becomes excess, it turns many fans off and movies do poorly. This work really did not need the excess as the diologue was great without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book, Disappointing Ending","review":"Night Fall has a good plot, is well-written, and has a thoroughly abrupt, disappointing and unfulfilling ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamest, limpest ending to a thriller","review":"No spoilers here. I love John Corey, wisecracks and all. \\"Plum Island\\" is one of my all-time favorite books. John Corey + Kate Mayfield = the most improbable pair of Federal agents since Maxwell Smart and Agent 99. The fast-paced story unfolded and kept me riveted, even though it was set up at the beginning. But the ending -!! I read that DeMille didn't write the ending himself; his son did or helped him write it. Well, maybe that explains it but it's still no excuse for the lamest, limpest ending to a thriller I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great writing, great characters, cop out ending","review":"I agree with nearly every other 1 star reviewer. After investing a lot of time reading this, I was holding out hope for a clever ending. But it felt very empty. My question to the author is this: did you come up with that ending first, and then try to build a story that ended there? In a sense, it seems to be a clever way to deal with the conspiracy of Flight 800 without actually altering the universe of his books (which is supposed to be the real universe). But it leaves the reader empty and angry at the lack of a true ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ending ever","review":"There are many reviewers who feel the same way as I do, but I really felt like I had to add my one star rating. It would be zero if possible.I've never been as disappointed with a book's ending as I was with Night Fall. I got the feeling that the author was up against a deadline and hastily finished the book with publishers breathing down his neck.I think that the author's use of 9/11 to conveniently wrap up the book is obscene. If this was the author's way of stirring up controversy to kick up sales, I find it despicable. I will never buy, read, or listen to another book by DeMille again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Ending Ruins A Good Story","review":"I agree with the reviewers who were disappointed in the ending.

When I finished it, I threw it away . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GOOD READ","review":"I am in the process of reading everything written by Nelson DeMille and really enjoyed this book which is another great story about John Corey and his wife Kate. This book is based on a true story; the crash of TWA 800 off the coast of Long Island. Is DeMille's theory correct or is the story given to us by the government the truth? This book questions the government's story and left me thinking about other possibilities. Other reviewers, my husband included, didn't like the ending. I won't spoil the ending but I, personally, loved it. Read the book and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Very predictable.

I was always thrilled when a new book came out. But,his last two efforts were really disappointing.Everyone else has told the story,so,i won't bore you. I just could not believe the storyline, how he took two incredible true stories and used them as a storyline. I really felt offended by this and I am NOT easily offended. It felt like a cheap shot,particularly the ending.I am saddened that this really good author felt he needed to use these two incidents to write a novel. I'm sure there is allot left in his brilliant mind.I hope that his next effort will prove this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing - not worth the time","review":"I've read a number of DeMille's books & this was by far the worst.The story could have been told in about 200 pages, not the 496 DeMille wrote.The ending was terrible.

Steer clear...."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor end - repetitive content","review":"Well, the concept was great, and parts of it were very interesting. The ending was a huge disappointment, and so much of the basic story was repeated a lot. Of course part of the problem could have been we listened to 15 hours of unabridged Cds which could have been cut to 6 hours without losing anything. I read the comment about why no better end, but since it was fiction - including the video that was the main plot element, why not a ficitonal end that was more satisfying? In any case I enjoyed Plum Island, and will likely read more of DeMille's books - just not on cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ending EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have read all of Nelson Demille's books and have enjoyed every single one thoroughly. Infact I started reading this book at 9am this morning, and honestly could not set it down for more than 5 minutes, before I HAD to pick it up and see what was going to happen next. Well the book was awesome all the way up until the last 5 pages. I have never, ever, ever seen a book end as bad as this. EVER. Even books that are not that good thoughout the whole thing, most of the time won't let you down like this at the end. I seriously threw the book in the garbage 5 seconds after reading the last paragraph.I have never in my life felt this let down by a book, it will definately be the last Demille book I read.If you have ever seen the movie Rudy, imagine watching that, then its the very last game, his family is there, waiting and watching, and all of a sudden they just stop the game for no reason and the movie ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"It sounded so real","review":"I just finished the audiobook version of Nightfall and it was superb!! I had only ever read one other Nelson DeMille book (Plum Island) on a friend's recommendation but this one sounded like it was right up my alley. And it was.!! I remember the TWA 800 accident and this brought it to life for me. The initial affair and then the story five years later with John and Kate re-investigating the crash made for a very suspenseful story expecially when the FBI told them to stop. And, of course, they didn't. I liked the voice of the reader. He had John Corey's tone down pat. Eventually I'd like to read Nightfall so I can read what I missed in the abridgement. I highly recommend this audiobook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting - could it be true?","review":"I found this book engrossing. Could all of this be true? The author makes you believe it could be true. The writer has developed the main character (the man) into someone that people can identify with. The main character in this book is hysterical - I laughed out loud at the sarcastic remarks. Very good book - enjoyable read. The ending is very ingenuous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.

He makes John Corey come alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Fall: Interesting read.","review":"Interesting read. Prescient writing preceded 9/11.Nelson's humor is infectious. His sarcasm enjoyable.John Corey books should be movies not starring Tom what's his name!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and doubly exploitative","review":"Not nearly as good as, say, Plum Island, this book often feels like it is dragging and contains filler because the plot is rather simplistic and really not much actually happens. I also am not impressed with what I consider a rather revolting ending to what is already a book exploiting a national tragedy. In case you happen to read it, I won't reveal anything about the ending, but I do think it's an enormous cop-out and very unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink-O","review":"The only thing DeMille proves in this work is that he can use the word \\"fart\\" 4 times by page 140. This book is so repetitive that I kept thinking that I read it before - and I have - in every newspaper that covered the horrible crash of flight 800. This one should make it to the \\"half price\\" table real soon. It's certainly the last DeMille work I'll ever buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst possible ending for what could have been a great book","review":"I have read everything DeMille has ever written. I anticipate each of his books and have for many years. I didn't read any reviews on Night Fall because I didn't want any spoilers (and I won't be giving any). BUT - the way he wraps up this book is a pitiful excuse for writing. The book itself is engaging and well-written, a typical DeMille great read. Until the end. You can see it coming and you just hope that he has a great twist waiting. But he doesn't. He cops out with basically no ending at all. What a total and complete letdown. No more money from me for Mr. DeMille because I would hate to be disappointed by him again. If you choose to buy this book - tear out the last 10 pages before you start - then make up any ending you want. Anything you can dream up will be better than what DeMille came up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"a shadow of his former books","review":"i have always eagerly waited for the release date of a demille novel and for the first time was dissappointed, it may have been a clue that he was running out of steam when he first started using recurring characters a few books back, but even on his worst day he was streets ahead of other writers in his genre, but it seems in his authors notes at the end he offers a backhanded apology for the ending and if he knew it was that bad why release it at all, i have read that nightfall may be his last novel, i would implore demille to write one more and go out with a bang instead of a whimper, i also would implore readers of nightfall that havent read his other books to read his others, notably THE GOLD COAST or CATHEDRAL before they judge his work, if mr demille reads these reviews i would like to say thank you for so many hours of great reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"The means were not worth the end","review":"Nelson DeMille and his great character, John Corey, are fun to read but the ending to this book was so disappointing that I would not recommmend it.

I don't want to give the plot away, but to me, the whole thesis is flawed from the lense cap of a video camera left on a blanket outside making police wonder if there is a video of the TWA flight 800 incident (isn't that just wishful thinking?) to the notion that every move John Corey makes is being monitored by nervous bosses who are covering up what really happened.Nelson, this book was ill conceived and didn't work that well even though your sense of humor is still pretty good. Focus, quit drinking so much scotch and do a better job next time. I'm a disappointed fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Book By Demille.....","review":"And I immediately ran out to get another. This book is fascinating in the way it deals with the TWA 800 tragedy. The other reviewers who \\"hate\\" the ending fail to see that this is the only way to end this book. Keep in mind, this is a fictional book. He can't exactly tell you what the government knows, b/c he isn't in the governement, he's an author. I thought the whole book was great, and I can't wait to read the rest of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"night fall","review":"This book was so boring and drawn out. The first 300 pages were so repetitive that they could have been condensed to 75 pages....Hating not to finish any book I trudged on hoping.... but nothing. At page 400 I just couldn't waste anymore time with this book so I stopped and skipped to the last 50 pages. Sadly, I was able to pick up the story from there and then when I finally thought something was actually going to happen, Mr. DeMille used a national tragedy to end this horrible book leaving unanswered questions and dangling storylines...Having suffered lose in 9/11 I find his use of this event insensative and cheap. Mr. DeMille should be ashamed and it certainly does give hope to any amatuer writers because if he could get this published than anyone could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Fall","review":"This was absolutely spellbinding. It held my attention through the whole book. The characters were charismatic and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"I've long been a Nelson DeMille fan but, after Night Fall, will probably not invest any more time only to greatly disappointed in the lack of an ending. Mr. DeMille credits his son with this travesty -- the young man probably deserves better. I would have felt much better if the last pages had just been ripped out and my imagination had taken over. It is truly a shame to see a story with such potential suddenly drop off a cliff (not to be confused with \\"cliff hanger\\" which does have some merit)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused about the tapes","review":"I thought they made a second copy of the tape at her home. If the first tape was taken from the hotel vault, where did the other copy go?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I usually enjoy DeMille's books but this was a true disappointment. I kept waiting for something to happen. He took the whole book for a story line that could have been done in a few chapters. I kept waiting for a terrorist to appear in the book but all we got were some on his old government \\"friends\\". I was looking for an explanation ( fictional) answer to TWA 800 and all we got was a a lot of questions and not very good one at that. I could see this book becoming a prequel to the next one where we find out who shoot the missile (if there actually was one). Best thing about this book was I go it from the library and didn'thave to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I have just finished the book. Horrible ending, waste of time. I will never read another DeMille book. And I have enjoyed them in the past, even bought them as gifts for people. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing - schoolboy trick for an ending","review":"Alarms bell started ringing when he brought back to life a character from another book who'd been shot dead. The real problem is the ending. As someone else wrote you can see the end coming from a long way off but as someone who previously respected Mr DeMille's writing I thought he couldn't do it to us. But he did. He gave us the equivalent of the \\"I woke up and it was all a dream\\" school kid author's ending. OK so the event he used has such tragic resonance that it masks the lack of originality somewhat but not enough.If you read the thanks after the end of the book you discover that he admits that he didn't know how to end the book and it was his son, starting out as an author, who came up with the ending when he was stuck. It shows.The rest of the book is well written and pacy but the ending is of course vital to a thriller and I was left feeling robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, till the last 10 pages.","review":"Most of the favorable reviews for this book are pretty accurate; however, the end was a huge disappointment. After building up suspense, conspiracy, danger, and tension, no questions were answered at the end of this book. It's like you couldn't come up with an ending, so you took a national tragedy, 9/11, to tie it all together. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Disappointing","review":"Wow ! I've read a lot of fiction. This book was a total waste of time. The book is about 650 pages (he could have pared it down to 300 w/o wasting any meaning whatsoever. After reading for an eternity, the plot was so disappointing I was annoyed at myself for wasting my time. I was waiting for resolution between the characters, for all to be revealed and justice done.... instead it felt like the author just gotlazy at the end and killed off everyone in one felt swoop. Shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...the worst DeMille I've read yet","review":"I've read Plum Island, Charm School, and By the Rivers of Babylon all of which I thought were great. Night Fall, however, was a long dragged out boring read. It was very slow. I don't recommend this as a DeMille read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"I bought this book for my husband (who is a big DeMille fan) and ended up reading it in one day. It follows a slightly cliched DeMille story-a hard nosed ex-intelligence rebel with a gorgeous wife/girlfriend, but it still does the trick. DeMille obviously did his homework and it is scary. I loved the premise-an illicit video of a world-altering event, as well as the follow-through. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelson DeMille is the best!","review":"I have read all of his books. Not only are they interesting and suspenseful, his characters, especially John Corey, have a wry, sarcastic sense of humor that I love. I look forward to his next book, and his next..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been A Great Book","review":"This could have been a great book if it weren't for the last chapter. I really enjoyed the story, even if it was fiction based on fact. However, it appears that Nelson became extremely bored or rushed as he was trying to finish the book. That or he suffered from writer's block. To blame the fact that we will never know the truth about TWA 800 on the horrible events that happened on 09/11 is disrespectful and disappointing. I will NEVER pick up another DeMille book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ending?","review":"I'm so dissapointed that I wasted several hours of my life reading this book. Any reader with a hint of intellegence and logic will figure out where DeMille is going within the first hundred pages of this novel. The dialogue is witty and engrossing but it just isnt quite enough to make up for the miserable dissapointment of his ending and denouement. Or as my title suggests, what ending?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read but I want a better ending","review":"Great read as all of DeMille's books are. Yeah, so he writes with similar styles book after book. Still, the best ones were his early ones like Charm School and Gold Coast. I thought Plum Island was mediocre and this was better.Great mix between fact and fiction - I still don't know what really happened. Have never read a book that mixed the lines so clearly so you never know what is and isn't.I recommend it - heck i finished it in 5 hours on a plane. Quick reading for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST sleep sack out there! A Must Have.","review":"This sleepsack is so convenient. Just tuck the little one in and there ya go - no blankets needed. This is very nice especially if your baby tends to kick a regular blanket off when s/he sleeps. We found that the Halo sleepsack was the best over ANY others b/c of how soft the material is and the zipper zips down rather than up towards the neck so you don't have to worry about 1) having their skin get caught and 2) having to unzip the entire sack if you need to change a diaper. Also, the material is so comfortable but it also is a good climate control, our daughter was never too warm (warning for SIDS) or too cold (which can wake a baby up). She was very comfortable all night long - however, I would recommend that on cold nights, you put them in a long sleeve onesie or sleeper since the sack doesn't have sleeves. This is a MUST HAVE for all parents. I'll probably get one in each size for the rest of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe, comfortable and calming","review":"We've used the sleepsack since our daughter was born. No worries about blankets getting wrapped near her head/mouth. The last few months we haven't used one as it was summer but now that it is cooling off (and we found her with her blanket bunched under her head half covering her face) we decided it's time to buy more (in larger sizes now that she is 16 months old).It definitely brings peace of mind regarding safety and that your baby is nice and warm (but not too warm thanks for the armless sack) during the night. Definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - soft and safe","review":"We love these. We have several Halo sleepsacks and have had 2 boys spend their first months sleeping in them. Not much to review about the product itself except that they worked well and nothing wore ever out.Two comments - everything I've ever seen indicates that sleepsacks like these are much safer than loose blankets, so please consider if you're on the fence. Second, we had one that had velcro \\"wings\\" that could be fastened to simulate a swaddle... garbage. It didn't work at all and actually the velcro straps rode up around our first sons' neck in a way that was pretty worrisome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very large!","review":"This sleep sack came and I was shocked at how large it was get a size down for sure!! Our son wont be able to use this for months but it is soft and cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sleep sack","review":"We have been very happy with this product. We had two smaller ones with sleeves (different brand), and when my son outgrew them at 5 months, had to find a replacement. I was concerned about not having sleeves, but it still works well. It's very soft and cozy. We went with the bigger size since my son is big, and it's very long, but fits well and helps him sleep. It's also very easy to clean and dries quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"stretch strap","review":"This strap does what it's supposed to do and I like it.

Great product for self stretching.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay stretch out strap!","review":"I like the stretch out strap. It's really good for back flexibility. Unfortunately I'm a little too flexible in my legs for it to be very good to stretch that way - if you have splits, or near splits, or anything where you can exert a good amount of force with your own arms on your legs, it's really not good for leg stretches. However, wonderful for back stretches, especially stretching your back out while in the splits! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"talk about help out","review":"I am just starting yoga so everything is a challenge. I love this strap because it has so many places to put hands and feet when stretching. This is just so much better than a plain strap.

Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I use an item similar to this in personal training sessions at my local health club. I wanted to buy a similar device to use at home following aerobic workouts. This device is essentially identical to the one the trainers use at the health club and works just as it should. I am very happy with its performance. Here are some specifics:Pros* Sturdy construction.* Strong, heavily stitched loop joints.* Multiple loops for various applications.* Helpful and informative instruction manual.Cons* End loops could be a little bigger to accommodate larger foot/shoe sizes.Comments* This product does what it is supposed to do.* The only recommendation I have for improvement would be larger end loops.* Overall, this is an excellent product (four-star) product. I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Sturdy Stretching Strap","review":"This strap is very well constructed and stands up to all sorts of pulling and tugging in all directions.

It won't break and holds up through repeated washings. The loops make it easy to do a wide variety of stretches.If you are interested in trying out how the strap would feel, or just don't want to spend the money on this strap, you can use a dog leash instead. Just put the loop of the dog leash around your foot and pull on the other end. You could use a sturdy belt or a towel as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Invention!","review":"I love this thing! So simple but so useful. There are several slots throughout the length of the strap allowing MANY options in a stretch position. Really a great tool for anyone beginning in stretching as well as the rubber man! You can manipulate so many positions by yourself and really pull yourself into a great stretch.

About two months ago, I got serious about 'fixing' my mobility problem in my legs. This helps a lot with the hamstring, and to a lesser extent my hips and lower back. It hasn't helped a lot with the actual calf (it takes a LOT of tension to stretch the calf, and I find body weight is a lot easier to use than this and my arms).But the improvements in hamstrings, hips and lower back have helped my whole overall well-being. I notice is particularly in the morning as I am less stiff (I stretch with this about for about 20 mins, in the evening before bed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I'm going through physical therapy right now for a pulled quad and adductor and this is what they use at the facility I go to. I absolutely LOVE this because it is so much easier than using a towel/band, and because of the different \\"notches\\" that you can grip/use. I highly recommend this as a \\"must-have\\" to anyone who is active or likes to stretch. I never liked to stretch (although it has always been recommended), whether it was before or after exercise which is probably why my muscles get so tight and make me more prone to injury. This product made me a convert after feeling tremendously better during my therapy, so I will continue to use it as part of my daily recovery and workout routine. I also recommend the Pro-Tec Roller Massager for loosening tight muscles - it is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that's how a stretch should feel!!","review":"After a recent back injury I needed something to help optimize my stretching routine, that's where the Stretch-Out Strap came into play. I used a towel and other \\"home remedies\\" to help with my stretches, but never felt I was getting what I needed. Self stretching is made so much easier with this device, and it comes with an easy to follow 40 page booklet. It's like having a personal trainer do manual stretches for my legs and back. As for the price, I paid under $20 (shipping incl.), what a steal! I would highly recommend this item for maintaining your flexibility and ROM(Range of Motion), especially after an injury (providing your doctors OK), or for all people who are athletic or enjoy Yoga and Pilates. Don't worry about this strap falling apart, it's made a highly durable Nylon...which will probably last a 1000 years. If it gets dirty, just throw it in the wash.

The valve on this matress has a little flap on the inside that is supposed to stop air from coming out while you're securing the screw-on valve. Unfortunatly, the design of the pump is such that you have a plastic nozzle that pushes the flap back to far to shut properly.What this means is that you pump it up nice and firm, but the flap does not properly prevent air from escaping while you secure the valve cover. So you end up with not nearly as firm a matress as you would otherwise have.I will say that the mattress did stay at the the less than firm inflation point while we slept on it overnight, and the pump was robust and quick. However, the valve flap problem is serious enough that I am returning the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Nights Sleep","review":"I was skeptical at first but upon reading Empyreal's review I went ahead and bought it.

All the other reviews are correct, the mounting nut is too high, the bracket won't fit over the lip of the hitch receiver tube. The nut was soldered into place misaligned so the bolt just threads into the side of the bracket and wouldn't lock anything into place even if I could get it over the receiver tube lip. It's such an inexpensive item, it's not worth returning for a replacement or refund (not that a replacement would do any good).

The bridge information is helpful, but with the continual construction of new bridges some of the info is already out of date.

Some obvious side trips (e.g. Banana River) are omitted and would have helped increase usefulness if included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Effective","review":"I have done this workout now about 6 times and I am really liking it. I alternate it with the Booty Barre.I was looking for low-impact but effective with muscle toning and fat burning and I think this was a great choice for me. Especially alternating with the Booty Barre I've had great results!Although the description says 2 workouts, I just consider this to be a single hour workout. It seems to me that it was intended to be done as one workout and that the whole \\"2 workouts\\" thing is just marketing.Part 1 is the cardio dance section and is a fun mix of different kinds of moves. It gets your heart-rate up and gets you warm for part 2.Part 2 is my favorite, I love her toning moves and I always feel I've had a great workout afterwards! Also I definitely see positive results from doing this and the Booty Barre.I definitely would recommend this dvd, especially to Tracey Mallet fans - she is a fun personality and I love her attitude, it makes it very enjoyable to do her workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough work out","review":"I am a Tracey Mallett fan, and this is another of her great work-out routines. Tracey produces some of the toughest routines for women, but she keeps them interesting and fun. You can be in terrific shape by sticking with Tracey."},{"rating":"2","title":"11 years later, but as good as ever","review":"Man, it took these guys long enough to give us a follow-up to their excellent 1990 self-titled debut! Sons of Angels was one of the better Swedish melodic hard rock bands back in the day, but for whatever reason they went missing in action for more than a decade.Apparently the band didn't get too rusty during their absence, because their 2001 release Slumber with the Lion picks up right where the self-titled album left off. This is another fine melodic rock album that features 12 very upbeat melodic rock songs in a style similar to Bonfire, Gotthard, Fair Warning, and fellow Swedes Treat. Slumber with the Lion is a solid album from start to finish, and a welcome return to the music scene for Sons of Angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting!","review":"This was an interesting read exploring the Gospel of Judas.I am no religious scholar, but I found it an interesting additional facet to consider.As someone interested in human nature and philosophy and related topics, religion falls into all of these, I found it a worth while book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I bought this book thinking that most of it would be the actual translation of this lost gospel. The translation only is 16 pages long. The rest of the book tells the story of how the author came to acquire and then translate this \\"gospel\\". It was a big disappointment. In fact, the translation doesn't say very much about Judas himself. It is very confusing reading because the translation bounces from one event to another. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious","review":"After reading this book and knowing what I know from many gospels, Ifind this book very hard to believe. It just is far to away from allthe other gospels out there. I have read the \\"Other Bible\\" and manyof the gospels not found in the Bible of today, but none talk like thegospel of Judas. I do not know who actually wrote this book, but Iwould not put a whole lot of faith in it as truth. Why would Jesuswant to be crucifed in order to go back to the spirit world. I canthink of a lot of ways to kill yourself that are less painful. Tothink Jesus wanted Judas to turn him in, so that he could be killed,so he could go back to heaven, is just plain stupid. Jesus couldhave just drank poison to do that. No one would ask for such apainful death as crucifixion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"If you like murder mysteries you'll love ths book. I read it in 3 days, couldn't put it down. Some of my friends see it as a threat to Christianity but I see it as informing people of the written documents that were once sacred to a group of Christians we now label as Gnostics. If all the tyrants in the world have not stamped out Christianity in 2000 years, I don't think Dan Brown will."},{"rating":"2","title":"These books are not for everyone","review":"The Gospel of Judas is the lost Gospel of Judas Iscariot with commentary. It is considered a Gnostic gospel since it discusses things not generally accepted by the Christian faiths. People reading these gospels will need to be open minded and willing to draw their own conclusions about the validity of the information. There is a lot of great historical information about the discovery of this gospel and several other Gnostic gospels including the Dead Sea Scrolls. I have been able to draw some new conclusions for myself since reading this and other lost gospels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disregarding Scholarship","review":"Some might argue that Dr. Ehrman has shed light on a new perspective that went previously unnoticed, but the truth is that when the gospel of Judas was originally written around 300 A.D. it was utterly condemned by virtually all of the church fathers.To suggest that this mystic writing which is dated more than 250 years after the life of Christ is somehow more reliable than the gospels written less than 50 years after Christ is absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly gnostic fantasy","review":"Dispite all the hype, the small volume is yet another of those third or fourth century \\"mystic\\" manuals of the so-called secret teachings of Jesus, who says we all have our own star, and instead of the ethical sayings of Jesus, the focus in on who does the god really like. Speculation as to what Judas thought and when he thought it seems to be the only new thing in this. Its a speculation one can find in the real Gospels and traces in such modern works as Jesus Christ Superstar and Godspell. There really is not much new or useful in this. Sure, the Apostles didm't understand Jesus. But the claim that Judas did is undone by all mystic claptrap in the rest of this thin volume. If you are looking for another Gospel, try Thomas' - at least in it there is some things to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I doubt it is true","review":"My thoughts are did Judas have the time and clarity of mind to write this account or tell someone the account so they can write it in the rapid timespan of events prior to his suicide? I don't think so.This is mysterious writing. It may be interesting to some but the fact is that it was dated 250 years after Christ died. The four Gospels were written less than 50 years after Christ died.Make up your own mind but keep these facts in the back of your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Gospel","review":"The book takes us on a long journey. Author keeps the reader interested right up to the last chapter. Mr Krosney does not try to mislead or oversensationalize the contents of the Judas perspective.

Don't bother with this float."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pool floating","review":"I weigh 165lbs and this float supports me just fine.

Great gift someone or as a treat for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Float, Saw Them in Mexico","review":"I don't own a pool but I first experienced these floats when I went on vacation in Cancun, Mexico. The resort I stayed at had about 50 or so of these floats. From what I can tell, these floats are very durable and stay afloat extremely well, no matter what the size of the person.My fiance's father commented on one of these a few months ago and I decided to get him one for his birthday because he does have a pool at his home. He's owned it for about 4 months now and it still looks as good as the day I bought it.One of the great aspects about the float is that there is no inflation required. So you don't have to deal with any huge bulk and it's easy to store (just roll it up). It's made of some kind of foam that stays afloat, so that's how it works.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great float!

I reccomend this book to all lovers of Latin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy Mozart Will Never Do","review":"Given the cast of characters, this should be much, much better than it is. But Abbado seems intent on keeping everything buttoned down lest anything exciting happen in this traversal of Mozart's valedictory work. It all sounds anemic; chorally,orchestrally, and interpretively. You would have no idea the work is about death and it's associated dramatics from listening to this cluelessly uneventful read-through. I feel bad for Terfel who seems to be the one participant who knows a turkey is being hatched and does his best to stop it. Alas, even his best efforts aren't enough. (He royally mixes up his words at one point in the \\"Recordare\\", though by then it's too late to care.) With Barenboim's first account for EMI (Armstrong, Baker, Gedda,Fischer-Dieskau), Colin Davis on Philips Duo, and Marriner's second recording of the work (also on Philips) all still available, this is utterly superfluous and easily avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"DECEPCIONANTE!","review":"El CD aparentemente es ideal, Mozart Réquiem en memoria de Herbert Von Karajan, grabado en vivo desde la Catedral de Salzburgo, Pero la realidad es otra, la interpretación de Claudio Abbado, es floja, inexpresiva, hasta medio ligera, este es un disco para obviar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly dull, lackluster Mozart","review":"Could this be the same Abbado who just gave us on CD a wonderfully exciting, vibrant and expressive performance of Mahler's \\"Das Knaben Wunderhorn?\\" You'd never guess it from the enervated, plodding and listless versions of Mozart's Requiem and a couple of other sacred pieces here. The singing is adequate but not great or memorable, but it's the seemingly perfunctory conducting that deadens the entire disc. Go for Davis (especially), Marriner, Schreier or Gardiner if you want a spirited, gripping Mozart Requiem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here","review":"The book is slim to start with, and page after page is devoted to reproductions of cards -- something anyone can see by visiting the nearest drug store.Information about contacting greeting card companies is so scant as to be almost useless. For example, only a quick mention of query letters.The section on self publishing is 4 partial pages long, with yet more samples of art work.The book is so padded with fluff and white space that it's [not good]. I read it cover to cover in 40 minutes, and that included looking at the dozens of pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the weakest Holiday movies ever made","review":"The actor who plays Santa Claus is wonderful, but even he can't save this horrible script.

You mean to tell me after all those centuries, Santa never realized there were poor kids in the world?? And I suppose there's only one child in all of NYC that's homeless???

Well, it is the only film I've ever regretted purchasing as I could not even watch it through without fast forwarding cuz it is so awful. It is wholly without irony in its subject and its so relentlessly optomistic that it becomes oppressive. Who wants to watch looooonnnnnnng sequences of elves making crafty looking toys that no child would want to play with while the most insipid music ever scored drives you to suicide in the background. This is like a remake of a George Pal puppetoon stretched to over two hours and coated with enough sugar to make the entire world diabetic in just one sitting.

I ordered the blu ray version and it did not work on my blu ray player. I returned the movie thinking that maybe something was wrong with the disc and when I received the replacement it still did not work. I had my husband look at it and I guess it was something about the region of the disc where it only plays in certain countries.

It is great for the kids as it is clean, i.e. no swearing or immorality and it incorporates the legend of St Nicholas through to what the kids know Santa Claus to be today. The costumes are bright and fun and the role of the two children in the story doing what probably many children have always wanted to do. It has become a tradition in our house to see it once a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I loved this movie.

In the middle of the movie I remember thinking, \\"Please God, Make it Stop.\\" The actor who plays Joe evokes a visceral response in the viewer bordering on homicidal rage. Better casting could have been done by simply picking random people in Central Park. The only redeeming acting is done by John Lithgow who is so evil on screen, that he is actually endearing. There should have been more of him and less of everyone else. I did survive this movie, but it has left an indelible scar on my soul. Please God, end my agony -- stop the movie or just kill me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christmas turkey, if you will excuse the pun.","review":"If you are a conneuisseur of bad movies, then this one's for you. Dudley Moore, a fine Brit actor, is totally wasted(must have been the money) as an elf who leaves Santa's workshop and gets sucked in by an evil, corrupt toymaker BZ(played by John Lithgow of THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN fame!) who wants to commercialise Christmas for his own ends. Well, this bit sounds familiar, note the media tycoons who hype parents into beating each other up over the hottest toys(Ho-ho-ho)(Oh dear, groan, bad joke). One could say that was one of the movie's merits, being ahead of its time! I give it two stars also because it is a very colourful film for young children who don't have half a brain to realise that Tim Allen's recent THE SANTA CLAUSE is far more enjoyable and answers more questions about kid's interests in Santa Claus at that time of the year . . .

But by the time Santa reaches the 20th century, all the charm is lost. The movie doesn't seem to go anywhere, and Lithgow is just WAY over the top. Too many segmented plotlines clutter up the story, although the film does have one of the greatest Santa and Mrs. Claus combos I've ever seen!Also, although it says it is close captioned, it is not subtitled, so most people won't be able to get \\"the words\\" if they have a high-def or blu-ray player."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Christmas movie EVER!!!","review":"I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl after it first came out.

In many movies and books they have tried to explain and even mock this process, but none have suceeded with such greatness as Scott Westerfield did in this book. I feel that since so far i have shown my great enjoyment of the book, I must explain why i gave this story 4 stars and not the full 5. This is because although it is a great story and I would recomend it to anyone who likes mysteries, fiction, and appreciates a little humor about consumerism; I feel the story itself lacked a little bit of the passion that it takes for the reader to really relate and take comfort in the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Yesterday?

He is witty and just plain funny.Jen, his girlfriend, is also very funny and a good second main character.I was, however, a little confused throughout the whole thing, but it doesn't really matter, so don't be worried.Read this book and spread the word around, I am begging you.

I sometimes feel lost and cofused and I'm not sure if I even understand the book but in the end it's interesting and different. Atleast try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read Book","review":"So Yesterday is a must-read book! It's a book by Scott Westerfeld. It is about a kid named Hunter who is what they call a cool hunter. He's one of the guys who would find who wore their hat backward or would tie their shoes a certain way. He's the first guy to find something cool and new. One day Hunter ends up meeting a girl named Jen. They become good friends. Hunter took Jen to a cool hunting meeting and Hunter's boss, Mandy, liked Jen and told both of them to meet her at an abandoned building. When they showed up, they found nothing but Mandy's cell phone and a pair of really awesome shoes that Mandy wanted to show them. So the book is about Jen and Hunter chasing after the people who kidnapped Mandy. It's got excitement, action, adventure, and a bit of romance. So, my opinion is that this is a great book. I bet your opinion will be the same too!Max M.Grade 6Ms. Kawatachi"},{"rating":"1","title":"why bother?","review":"Until trying this razor, I never knew it was possible to cut yourself with an electric..

I have pretty coarse leg hair and a problem with ingrown hairs. I rarely wear shorts even in summer because of the unsightly bumps and scabs. So for the legs this shaver is great. As for the underarms....not so good. I didn't get far. I got a few scrapes immediately and stopped, finishing with a razor. But since my only issue with a razor is my legs this shaver is perfectly fine for my needs. Highly recommend it for the legs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this razor!","review":"When I first started to use it, it left some red (scratch)marks on my underarm skin...no big deal. HOWEVER, after a few more uses my underarms actually had these huge welt-like bumps. They were incredibly painful and incredible ugly...it's taken 3 weeks and only now are they starting to disappear. Naturally, I immediately stopped using this razor and have every intention of writing to Remington (whose products I've purchased for years). I don't understand how they allow this product to continue being sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"This razor is great...if you have time to shave your legs 3 or 4 times each time to get all the hairs! I have had several Remington razors over the years and this is THE WORST! It seems to be that, like everything else on the market today, the quality of Remington razors has gone out the door! It's too bad too because good ladies razors are hard to find and this used to be one you could count on!Anyone know of a good brand because I would love to know of one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This razor is only supposed to be used on legs (it says so in the manual) but even then I haven't been able to get a close shave at all. It specifically says to put all of the blades evenly on the skin but that definitely doesn't yield good results. Also, the top broke off the first time I tried washing it, but I was able to repair it.To sum it up, after I shave I need to go back over the area with a disposable razor which provides a 10 times closer shave than this razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Fast My Head Is Spinning!!!","review":"WOW!

The shaver broke when I dropped it and I bought this as a replacement. It shaves closely, almost like a razor, and did a good job on my legs. Unfortunately, on the underarms, I got razor burns and stopped using this shaver. Went back to the old one with no further problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spring for the next level","review":"For some reason, even after reading the largely positive reviews of the more expensive, higher-model-number Remington shavers, and the largely negative reviews of this cheaper one, I still went the cheap route. For the benefits I've received so far, I think I would have been better off just sticking with my old razor.The shaver has been fine on my legs - not very efficient, or quiet, but it hasn't caused any damage and if I'm careful enough I get a pretty close shave. It does seem like I have to shave more often, though. What's really bad is what happened to my armpits: painful red welts for several days! Reading the other reviews, it seems I'm not the only one with this experience.The two positive things I can say about this shaver are that it does hold a charge for as long as I need it to, and I like being able to shave dry. However, you could probably get these benefits and better performance with a more expensive model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxell is the best","review":"My Husband uses a lot of DVD-R with his hobby.

Fortunately, they arrived unbroken, even with the rolling and banging around. These tapes are great. They have played in every DVD recorder and player we have, unlike Panasonic tapes and other brands.

So I'll just say there are better ones in this Banks series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Done Police Procedural","review":"Robinson spins a very well-crafted novel about Inspector Banks and the other fascinating characters he encounters in his baliwick of Yorkshire. Robinson has a good eye and sharp ear for the psychological travails his characters face, often providing a nice counterpoint to his nicely honed plot. The magic of the Inspector Banks series is the author's careful pacing of the plot and the characterization which carry you (usually)gently to the end. This is not a fast-paced crime story that you can't set down. It's not like a shot of gin or vodka; but rather, like a fine single-malt Scotch which you'll savor to the end. Robinson has become one of my favorite authors and, for my money, ranks with the best of the authors of his genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bit disappointing","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed \\"In a Dry Season,\\", I looked forward to reading this, the follow-up. Sadly there is a chasm between the two. \\"Cold is the Grave\\" is one of those 'body count' books. Just when you think there cannot be yet another murder, along comes another body. I know the areas in which the novel is set very well, and Robinson has a real knack of getting the feel of different parts of England absolutely right. This book is also, like other Peter Robsinson novels - a very classy piece of prose - it's a joy to read. But the story is actually preposterous and it protrays a weird Britain where everyone smokes like a chimney (England is largely a non-smoking country these days) and the story - which starts well - becomes just a chain of ever-more unlikely events. Here's hoping Robinson and Banks get back on track with the next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're considering home schooling, consider this video","review":"Although I am not a firm believer in home schooling, I found this video to be very informative and professional.

I think if it had been written in more of a \\"story/novel\\" form and not the Him/Her-He/She format, it would've had a better flow. But the author did keep the language real.

His accent is simply unbearable (he even has a few lines in German & Italian, which are nearly incomprehensible to native speakers), and he never manages to give his character any credible feelings whatsoever.

Although the story is a bit far fetched -- a Super-Rich man desparate for the affections of a pretty girl, and going to many typical Hollywood devices to try to win her over, in the end it falls to chemistry and charm to make this movie a pleasure to watch.

For the mere nature, they are different from what I am used to when reading straight Piers. But after reading Quest, I have to say that I am not dissapointing at all. It is a wonderful, warming story from newcomer James Richey. This novel is beyond my expectation. It has great characters, specially Chentelle. It has a really nice story to tell. The world and goals of this universe are outstanding. I really love the small poems and songs that James used to give feeling to the novel. As James said in his author's notes, Allan Riggs addition of the Ill-creatures is excellent. They are evil and cunning and different from the regular description of goblins and other monsters. I love the elves in this novel. Not stuffy, aloof creatures, but hearthy and down to earth, but still different from humans.So if you haven't bought it yet, don't wait, you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"involving fiction, and a fun read","review":"I had to get this book because I am a self-admitted Piers Anthony addict. If you're like me, don't be fooled by his name on the cover. According to the author's notes, this book was really written primarily by the al in et al. Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic book, it's just not classic Anthony. There's a great deal to this story; it's involved without being overly complex. It's smart, but the ending is perhaps a bit strange. It does have a moral of sorts in the questions it asks. Is peace and harmony the ultimate goal? If so, what means are justified to that end? Different characters embody empathy, honor, frustration, and faith quite well, while maintaining their human nature (despite their sometimes non-human status). Look for more from these authors in the future, you shouldn't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy lovers beware","review":"This book lacks any of the grace ,originality or humor we associate with Piers Anthony. It is derivative, trite and cumbersome; even for a first novel it is very poorly done. Ten pages into the book I began to suspect it was really written by a nine year old girl and in the next chapter the beautiful elf princess, who sings harmony into the world, will become sad because her mean father won't let her have a pony.

I knew that I was getting it and I was not expecting it to be that great because it is so cheap. This pedal is great if you just want a little distortion undertone, or a lot of it for a solo (I for one think that the guitar solo for Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb\\" sounds great with a lot of distortion). I didn't have any problems with my amp broadcasting a radio station, and I didn't mind the batteries because there were a bunch of them in a drawer in my house. I think that a distortion pedal is a great thing for me to have because it opens me up to so many different sounds to experiment with. I sometimes mess around with it for an hour! Its so much fun! I would recommend this to any guitarist who doesn't have one anyone who doesn't want to waste money on something that sounds almost exactly the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds just like it costs","review":"The only reason I'm not giving this one star is that I didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal. I got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals. We have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs. I thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile. NOPE.

I needed a low-cost solution to get a much fatter, overdriven sound with great sustain, and this 'Fab Distortion' pedal more than fits the bill. Using a Fender 'Telecaster' and an old Ibanez 'Roadster Series' guitar, I am able to get a cleaner sounding sustained sound good for bluesy hard rock, as well as a more overdriven, fuller metal crunch sound that works well for playing stuff like Rush, Sabbath, Dio, Schenker, Malmsteen, etc. This thing has amazing range and versatility for the money! My jaw dropped when I found out these could be had for under twenty bills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sounded great, didn't last long","review":"So, I bought this for a pop punk band: sounds amazing, light weight, etc. What everyone else said, plus the fact that after a few shows/months, the input went loose on the inside and doesn't work anymore.

I'm still looking to replace it, but I'm not sure I'd buy another one due to my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Classic Distortion","review":"I was looking for a good distortion pedal that was cheap, and I came across this one. It was a great price tag and had good reviews, so I ordered it. It came in a couple of days in a nice little box. Worked good after I put in a battery for it (it didn't say batteries included on product page, so I made sure I had one). It also doesn't come with a guitar cable (wasn't expecting one) so make sure that you have one lying around if you order. I've had the D-1 Fab for about a week now and it still works great with my electric guitar and amp. There's a few dials to change the output, and I can go from a heavy rock riff to a nice classic solo. All in all this is a pretty cool pedal for the price, and it works great for what I use it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"Save your money and purchase a good quality pedal.

They're very quiet and sound great. For someone who wants to explore effect processing, these are a great start. Same goes if you are just expanding your pedalboard like myself. The only cons are you can't see the setting of the knob from the top (but it does give you the experience of trusting your ears and not your eyes to create the right effects) and the footswitch is difficult to trigger if the box is sitting behind another pedal.And to the review whining about not getting a battery with the pedal...WWWAAHHH WWAAHH WWAAHH!!!!

I also bought the other two models... This one picks up a radio station and broadcasts it thru the amp, yet, there isn't a radio station tower within 5 miles of my house.

The insulation on the wire is pretty thick, but the copper is very limited and looks more like 8 gauge. Before buying this I called Boss Audio to get the fuse rating and they said it was 100A.

I definetly recommend this as I have installed many amps in different cars and this one kit rates high with the price.

It was 1.30 a foot so 21 feet of wire cost over the price I payer for the kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Trash","review":"Everything in my opinion is halfway decent, yes the 4 gauge is more like a 6-8, but I knew that it would be like that before I purchased this item.

Before reading this book, you sort of get the impression that most yeerks are evil, and all they want to do is take over the universe. After reading this book, you can really understand how the yeerks work, and also, why they don't think taking living, thinking creatures is wrong. It's their way of life. They're parisites, so thats what they were made to do. It's very interesting to read how they began to infest earth. It's also very interesting to read how visser one was once a low sub-visser, and how she rose to power. I thought the whole book was imaginative, original and perfect for anyone who reads animorphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense, very suspenseful...somewhat dark.","review":"**Spoilers within** I just got \\"Visser\\" for my birthday...and I jsut turned twenty-one. I have been hooked on the series ever since a friend of mine mentioned them to me. Visser tells how Visser one eventually took the host body of Marco's mother. There are sone good one-liners in the book, but the overall feeling is dark. It deals with a trial before the Council of Thirteen, in which Visser One will either be killed or exiled if found guilty. Visser Three is her accuser. The outcome is a tlitle bit of a surprise, but not so that one would think it was written purely for shock value. Overall, an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!!!!!!!","review":"Wow!!! There's no word on how to describe on how great this book was!! It's on my definate top 10 of all time! This book should be given an award! Visser, Visser, Visser, VISSER, VISSER!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visser One's novel is among the best","review":"The book really gets six stars. KA Applegate has dared to journey into the dark side of the most evil forces ever. Visser One, who controls the body of Marco's mother, is under trial for treason. She must prevail, or else the irrational Visser Three will take her place and kill everything. This is a great book because you know that Visser One is an evil character,and then the author makes you feel sorry for her that she is so close to death.The fact that Miss Applegate can take an evil and make the reader sympathize with the evil is amazing. KA Applegate is a very talented and stressed out author who obviously worked hard on Visser and all of her other non-ghostwritten books. This book will leave the reader in awe and amazement. But when you do finish it, make sure to read #45: The Revelation - for a surprise of what happens to Visser One in her final trial, the trial of all trials."},{"rating":"2","title":"mechanics tool bag","review":"My dad has had one of these bags since vietnam....after seening just how reliable it is I just had to get one for myself...and I am amazed...keeps all my hand tools from being scattered in my truck, easy to transfer to other cars, holds plenty of tools for going to bone yards and pulling parts...i would recommend this tool bag to anyone...wish i had bought one earlier it would have saved me from buying new sockets and rachets from my previous nylon tool bag.. its the most durable tool bag i have seen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"camo tool bag","review":"gave this as a gift.

Quality control is pretty spot on, every bag I inspected was identical to the others. This bag is a simple large main compartment with 2 smaller compartments cover by a flap secured by 2 button snaps. The main compartment is a lot larger than I expected. I was able to fit all of my automotive tools from a larger bag comfortably into this one. The materials feel tough yet soft and the stitching is well done. Overall, if you need a simple bag for your tools (or whatever) this is definitely an option to consider, especially b/c it is not overly bulky or too small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made and durable quality","review":"I bought this bag to toss in the back of our SUV -- to keep a few tools, tow rope, small folding shovel.

This Paramore blu ray doesn't have the super cool blu ray pop up menu that can be accessed while the concert is playing...to see the menu you have to go back to the root menu of the disc. First blu ray I own that doesn't have that sweet feature. I have to turn my audio receiver up higher than usual because the audio is a bit weak. The live audio for this disc is mixed well! But, the audio and video are not synced correctly, they are slightly off. I play drums and got frustrated watching the drummer because I saw the drummer do a sick roll...then heard the roll a second later!

As a TWILIGHT FAN, I am stoked to have bonus Twilight soundtrack clips with unbelievable audio. \\"The Decode\\" music video plays back in 720p and \\"I Caught Myself\\" audio is featured in Dolby TrueHD.

The image quality is that of a standard DVD with a few snips filmed on HD (and even those seem to be upscaled). The video quality is sub par for a blu ray. I would have been much happier paying less and getting s standard DVD. After about 25 minutes of watching, I couldnt take it anymore. I turned off the tv and let the concert play through the surround sound.

I hadn't watched it yet, and the other night I was curious to see what people said about it. After reading the \\"review\\" from the lady that said it was \\"Disgusting\\", I was completely bummed and hesitant to watch the movie. Well, I just got done watching it, and now I am left wondering....LADY, DID WE WATCH THE SAME MOVIE??First of all, in the beginning when the little girl says \\"shut up\\", it was said in the context of \\"nooo way\\", which is how kid's say it these days. And it was the ONLY time it was said. There is NO bad language, and NO HISSING CHILDREN.It was a cute Christmas movie, with a happy conquers sad theme. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to share it with my nieces and nephews.As for it being scary, the only way your child will \\"soil their pants\\" is if your child is scared of candy and puppy dogs!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Christmas Classic","review":"This is going to be a Christmas favorite for years to come.I would say that it will become a Christmas classic.Everything about the movie was great.The animation was some of the best I've seen.Having the voice and music of Harry Connick Jr makes it even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taser gun not necessary.","review":"We watched this with our kids one evening. It was a decent movie, certainly not the high quality of the christmas classics. When Eubie the elf went down to help the small town get off the naughty list, the Santa security team arrives to take him back to the north pole, not with a net, or a bag but with a TASER GUN. They shocked him with it, or so you assume because they show him blacking out after they \\"Zap\\" it into the air. It was not the type of thing I had expected to have to explain to my young kids while watching a christmas cartoon about a happy elf. It was in very bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Christmas classic... wish I didn't own it :(","review":"This movie is really not that great. It's not awful, but it's just not great. It definitely does not give you that warm, magical Christmas feeling. The attitude and words coming from the kids' mouths is not very little kid friendly. I promise you you'll be happier if you buy a different Christmas cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute Christmas movie","review":"The children (ages 2-3) love this movie, and request to watch it all the time. It is a very cute movie, but the little girl in the beginning of the movie says \\"Shut up!\\", which is something I don't want the kids to pick up.

It is short, quite strange, and whenever I watch it I run to my room and slam the door. I cannot stand this movie. The best part of this movie is that when you touch a certain place on the case, it (the case) lights up and sings.

By throwing Bee's husband into the mix, the reader is taken from one sexual extreme to another, and it's all in the name of living out a fantasy. Even though the novel wasn't as graphic as I had assumed it would be, it is still easy to see how people can be caught up in living out their secret desires just by being enticed from the most unlikely of sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"i would not read another nelson george book unless someone told me that it was really good. i wasn't too enthused about this one. it was a quick easy read but i was not drawn to the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, hot , hot","review":"Nelson George gets down and dirty in this tribute to sex, sex, and more sex. Dean appears conservative to the outside world, a producer of a highly rated talk show, he resists turning changing the format of the show to a more sexual theme. But it doesn't take long for him to warm up to the idea though he still as his reservations. The research is the best part of the job. He loves his fiancee Millie, but the allure of Bee Cole is too much temptation. How far will he go? How low will he go? This book explores some of things you may have dreamed or thought about but don't have the nerve. On-line sex chats, menage a trois, swinging; this is the world that is explored. The book however gives just enough and doesn't saturate you with detail that would could otherwise make this a work of borderline pornography. This is very tastefully done and has some humorous scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?!?!? Did I miss something?","review":"What started out as an interesting story about people testing their sexual boundaries turned into a contrived mess by the end. Yes, the story has twists and turns, but I did not understand any of the characters' motivations for doing any of the freaky things they enjoyed doing. Midway through the book everything stopped making sense. The only thing this book can offer is titillation, but if you are looking for more, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Call This Jazz?","review":"More like low-end fusion and smooth jazz.

Dudley, a reader of YEARS OF RAGE","review":"Breathtakingly insufferable. Self-importance and satire are usually uncomfortable bedpartners on a page, but I can see how a literary project of this nature could make a fertile pairing of the two. Unfortunately, in this case, the one has become so bloated that the other has been rolled right off the bed; a (not necessarily very) observant reader will quickly discover what exactly it is I mean. As for the prose on offer in this jeremiad, there are moments that truly strain credulity with regard to their audacity.

I guess I get what the author was trying to accomplish by showing the extreme case of high school abuse, but it really was to much to swallow.

Strengthened by good raps like \\"What You Want\\" by The Roots, bumping tracks like \\"Best Man\\" by Faith Evans, and ballads like \\"Liar, Liar\\" by Latocha Scoot, this album is perfect for any music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing songs!","review":"why would I buy this most of the songs I want to hear aren't on it - not everyone goes for sappy mediocre R&B wannabe love songs! NO STARS AVAILABLE FROM ME"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful mix","review":"This soundtrack was bad. The songs and the mix of artists was not effective. Seems like it was all thrown together at the last minute. The only good song is Kenny Lattimore's smooth Beautiful Girl. Particular disappointment goes out to Maxwell with his two tired, full of fluff songs. Pass on this CD or dub it from a friend. Spend your dollars on Amel or something else"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Man Wins","review":"How often does a soundtrack come along that actually contains music pretaining to the actual movie? The Best Man sountrack is conglomerence of tracks from today's most well respected artists. Hip-hop/r&b's reigning queen, Lauryn Hill teams up with the late Bob Marley on a beautifully redone track of \\"Turn Your Lights Down Low.\\" Introspective and contraversial rap group The Roots start off the album with their upbeat \\"What You Want\\", and the very soulful Maxwell contributes two new tracks to the album, \\"Let's Not Play The Game\\" and \\"As My Girl.\\" Though the love infused ballads and sultry r&b cuts are enough to keep the record on top, \\"The Best Man\\" has it's low points. The Sporty Theives' \\"Hit It Up\\" seems to be misplaced in the ocean of love songs, and \\"The Best Man I Can Be\\", which teams up Ginuwine, Tyrese, R.L., and Case, is a musty, ill-fated anthem for men with morality. However, \\"The Best Man\\" is able to hold it's weight and hits hard with passion and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack is the bomb because...","review":"I give this soundtrack an A because it's diverse with hip-hop beats from The Roots, some R&B from Case, Ginuwine, RL, and Tyrese and also Dru Hill (hidden track), and regaee/soul from Lauryn Hill (who delivers the hip-hop beats) and Bob Marley. It's an all star soundtrack and it really is soulful and diverse with the artists and the lyrical skillz and production. I promise you that the movie is also phat with the tracks played within the film. Go and get this soundtrack and see the movie because it's funny with some drama and romantic secrets and friendships secrets and betrayals. It really soulful!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For the most part it's the same old tired RNB even with artists who usually put out quality music. Surprisingly, even Maxwell's songs were useless. Advice: Borrow this from someone who thinks this CD is great and dub the songs you like. But beware....."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"I had the pleasure of taking this class from the author of this class. Dr. Henderson is not only absolutely excellent teacher, he is an equally good writer. I was not an economics major, and was somewhat fearful about taking \\"Economics of Medicine\\" as a class, but this book is thorough, organized, and easy to understand. It is an excellent book for economics majors as well as those majoring in other health care related professions who have an interest in learning more about the current health care system and related policies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated for a 2005 edition","review":"The text is quite dated for a 2005 edition. All of the citations are over 5 years old. The material is written at highly advanced economics level and may not be appropriate as a multi-disciplinary text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Mr. Clayton obviously knows what he's talking about; the user will not. IF the CD is organized at all, it should really be accompanied by a companion CD of tutorials that will explain the methodology of that organization. The tutorials are abstruse and require more time to decipher than the program should to learn. I bought Mr. Clayton's CD by accident (I meant to buy a different one), but even if I had intended to buy his, doing so would have been a mistake. (One star by duress)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did some kid burn this these CDs from his bedroom?","review":"There is no organization to these tutorials at all and they run very poorly. From the looks of the packinging (a jewel case with a crappy ink jet printed picture for an inside cover) I wouldn't doubt that this set was made by a complete amature. There are many other books and references out there that are much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a classic","review":"The singer has a fine voice but there is little else favourable about this recording. As with many Naxos recordings they sacrifice quality in favour of price. Yes people want to be able to buy budget CDs, but not when they are of such a poor standard. As someone who speaks German I was appalled by the pronounication and general diction. It is a great shame that Naxos cannot find consistency, given that there have been many fine CDs, like Handel's Messiah and the Bax Symphonies. Try again Naxos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I use it for my Dell Inspiron E1505. Plenty of room and padding.

Totally unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good recording for a very good price","review":"This budget recording by Naxos is in the top five of all available recording of this piece. Only the performances by Robert Shaw and Colin Davis are clearly superior to this one. However, anyone who wants this amazing choral work for a very ideal price will not disappointed. The conductor has a good sense of tempo, and the tenor is very good. In fact, he greatly betters the soloists on the Shaw and Davis recordings. This work balances between the grandious and the intimate. Some movements are huge and enormous, and others are quiet and contemplative. This is a highly recommended piece of choral music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A leader in the renaissance of Spanish music","review":"Manuel de Falla is considered to be the central figure in the renaissance of Spanish music that took place during the opening decades of the twentieth century. He drew upon many traditions including gypsy music and folk song and dance. While living in Paris he was encouraged by Debussy and Ravel. This is a two CD set and the first CD contains the Nights in the Gardens of Spain, my favorite work by Falla. The music is varied, shifting from one pleasant interlude to another. The second CD has The Three Cornered Hat, music for ballet that was first performed in 1919 in London with sets by Picasso. The ballet is about a jealous miller who has unfounded suspicion of his young beautiful wife. Falla's work often consists of reinterpretation and reinvention of the historic music of Spain, baroque or religious, folk or country fare. Some of the work is a bit too modernist for me but the primary compositions listed above are very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is AMAZING!","review":"What else can I say? This is truly a one-of-a-kind movie...It's one of those movies where, right after you see it, you end-up showing it to as many people as possible... it's so outragous and just downright fun.The DVD doesn't offer much in the way of extras (hence the four-star rating), but hey-- the exploding heads are clearer than ever...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riki-Oh - The Story of Ricky","review":"This movie is great if you like gore.

First I wanna say, this is not a kung fu flick. It has absolutely nothing to do with martial arts. I don't know what to call it, but drink a few beers and watch it with your friends and the movie will be entertaining. Its actually pretty funny. At the end, Rikki Oh fights the chinese version of the incredible hulk or something. Don't buy it if you're starting a kung fu collection. Its more of a funny-horror type movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"RENT IT FIRST!!!!","review":"I should have just done that FIRST!!! No way would I have purchased it!!! However I went by way of some of the reviews. Not a good thing!! The movie had good production values however the acting was WEAK, and I was really hoping for MORE OVERALL. This film was talked about in a review I read a of the film \\"Dead Alive\\" which was WAY BETTER!!! If I were you rent it first before you consider purchasing it!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Riki-Oh I just wasted 25 bucks!","review":"I had high hopes for this film--based on the reviews I read here. I'm a big fan of kung-fu and silly horror films like Evil Dead. I thought this movie would be the best of both worlds. WRONG! This is not a kung-fu movie, it's just a gore film. The \\"fight\\" scenes don't even last 30 seconds. Riki simply makes one attack and punches through the bad guys' chest or head. Buy this only if you're a fan of Dead Alive, not if you're into kung-fu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asian attempt at Troma type entertainment.","review":"I enjoy the genre of over the top gore comedy but this one didn't interest me. The story was very slow paced and uninteresting with some pretty unimaginative gore.It was also ridiculous and not in a comedic way but a 'that is stupid' way. People are smashing through stone walls a lot.The final 'ultra' gory finale really didn't interest me either.Watch Troma's Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie if you enjoy this type of movie. Or wait for Poultrygeist which will probably be pretty Tromariffic.I don't know when this was made but I would guess it has to be inspired by Troma. I appreciate the effort but it didn't match let alone surpass Troma for gore comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gory fighting and that is it...","review":"Story of Ricky is set in the near future when prisons are run like franchised companies. The main character, Riki, is sent to one of these prisons where his superior martial arts skills help keep him alive as he finds out that the prison is run by a corrupt warden and four powerful prisoners. Story of Ricky is a carnival of gore and martial arts which often becomes nauseating. The story is not the main event in this film, but rather the ultra violence is what keeps the audience's attention. There is a feeble attempt to display Riki's sensitive side, however, this becomes abundantly awkward. In addition, the poor cinematography, mise-en-scene, sound, acting, voice over, and music makes this a terrible cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gift that keeps on giving","review":"The joy of this flick is not in viewing it alone but in sharing it with your friends! The over the top gore, bad special effects, absurd plot adds to it's charm. I bought this movie and it's one of my joys in life to share it with as many persons as possible. Every single time we always have a GOOD LAUGH and a great time! I'm talking about rolling on the floor laughing especially when it comes to the film's 'defining' moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"So bad it's funny","review":"Story of Riki is a must see.It is so bad it's funny. Especially the laughable dubbed version of the film.The plot is pretty dull but still holds a grudge.The film is very very Cheesy too.The violence is over the top but very unrealistic but Still over the top such as the part were Riki pumbles through a guys stomach or of course the part were riki smashes through a guys hans. This film is very very violent and graphic but in a funny way.The music was acctually pretty good! The story of Riki Rules! And I recomend this too some one who just wants to see some thing F-d up.Over all this is a horrbily but funny movie even though it's not tended to be funny.Get it...NOW!!!Later"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.......bad acting but bloody and i guess kinda cult","review":"i buyed this movie cause i thought it was gory as hell! pffffft it was gory but only in a few scenes but opaqued with the awful plot and verry bad acting especially from the extras. it wasnt funny neither, riki oh was 24/7 drama queen and the subtitles.........totally different from the voice acting. english at least wasnt accurate with the english language.

I am a big fan of Hong Kong cinema, \\"wire-fu,\\" zombie movies, and cheesy horror movies like \\"Dead Alive.\\"Upon mentioning \\"Dead Alive\\" to people, many mentioned this movies, saying that I HAD to see it and that it was SO funny and SO gorey.I finally broke down and bought it and watched it yesterday. The dubbing was great, the voices and some of the lines were hilarious; but it didn't make up for what the movie lacked.....The gore was a bit silly, but not so over-the-top as I had expected.Overall, I was dissapointed and would recommend VIEWING this movie, but not OWNING it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"I guess I was expecting more from this movie considering all the hype I've heard about it. But this movie just didn't do it for me. Don't get me wrong, it was good for a laugh or two but as far as the quality of the movie-it was completely horrible. The special effects looked like they went out and bought some fake body parts from a costume and joke shop, then picked up a few cans of chung-king and there you have it. None of the gore was even remotely realistic. This movie does not even come close in quality of gore or movie making in general to that of DeadAlive, Re-Animator or even Zombie for that matter. I guess Rikki-Oh is a movie you would have to see to believe, but I would see if a friend has a copy or try renting it before you buy. I paid $30 dollars for mine and felt like kicking myself after I saw the movie. It is now just a novelty item in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gore, gore, and more gore","review":"Save your money unless your just want something to watch to kill some time.

With only one particularly fake looking sequence near the beginning, the effects are pretty sick n' twisted... nice use of intestines as a garrote I must say. This movie ranks up there with the best of Asian Gross-Out Cinema (\\"Untold Story,\\" \\"Audition\\") and would be a great double-bill with either \\"Master of the Flying Guillotine\\" or \\"Escape From New York\\" (futuristic prison setting that doesn't look the least bit futuristic is pretty funny on its own). A definite must own for gorehounds, and an excellent party DVD for gatherings where no one expects something like this. Bring the bloody Chex-Mix and some breath mints!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious in so many ways","review":"There's so much violence and gore in this movie, it'd make a sane man sick to his stomach. Fortunately, I'm not a sane man. The story is a little ridiculous and a few things are pretty dumb but you really stop caring after the first disembowlment. The action is so intense that it can only be described as the \\"Fist of the North Star\\" of live action movies. Memorable scenes and characters make it even better and it is accompanied by quite possibly the worst dubbing ever to make it that much more of a masterpiece. If I seem sarcastic to you, you're mistaken. I genuinly think this is one of my favourite movies ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"bibical wisdom for the 90's with bone breaking humer to boot","review":"Kinky, has some of the most heinous humor with a direct in your face harmony woven into his own lifesytle observations.

Cleanup requires scraping the food from the bottom to get it clean. Then, a white discoloration begins on the inside of the pots. The instructions say to use denture cleaner to remove. I tryed everything and it did not budge. Instead, the texture of the inside enamel is no longer smooth but rough. They look so bad that I am embarrassed to use them in front of guests.

I was at this live performance when it was recorded and the songs that are missing are some of the bands' best and most moving to date.Im very glad I got this and of course all fans should make the purchase. because there's good stuff here!

Highlights include early tracks Career Opportunities, I Fought the Law, and Complete Control, with great versions of London Calling and Train in Vain, a better than album version of Magnificent Seven, and an epic close in Straight to Hell. The uncompromising intensity we've come to associate with the Clash is present throughout, namely in a particularly charismatic version of Should I Stay or Should I Go. A few songs I could do without, not that they sound bad here, I just never was a big fan of the songs, such as the earlier tracks What's My Name and London's Burning. Armagideon Time is some of the best live dub I've ever heard, Guns of Brixton also features a good bit of (successful) live experimentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply incredible","review":"A must own for anybody who calls themself a Clash fan.

Although I'm sure it could have spanned to 2 or 3 discs, I am happy that we have a good solid 17 song collection of live songs.You get some good solid drumming from Nick. Deep anchoring from Paul. Choppy chords and great singing from Joe. And great lead guitar and vocals from Mick. The songs highlight the band in its best performances and in great unison. This captures the magic of some of those golden live shows. Melody plus rock plus message.This is the best live Clash album out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An album of a single tour please","review":"Now really. Who ever heard of a live album that was a sampling over shows from many years? One can only suspect The Clash for having a personal hand in FHTE. If so, bless their hearts for trying something different, but it doesn't really work. A lot of the energy of a single show is lost in the potpourri format of this album. The Clash were hands down the best band I saw live---and I'm not the only one to think this. Surely, Sony can find time in their schedule to publish from a single show or tour, something to show everyone what The Clash were really like, something up there with The Who's \\"Live at Leeds.\\" On the other hand, until _that_ album comes out, FHTE is better than nothing and I for one was glad to buy it. The three songs from the Bond shows, especially Complete Control, are worth the price all by themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I like this album a lot. However, a few things bother me: (1). tracks 2, 3, and 9 have some overdubs (2). There are too many tracks on this album with Terry Chimes instead of Topper Headon (3). Quite a few tracks have been recorded from the Combat Rock tour ( this bugs me because Combat Rock was their worst album and their worst tour with their WORST DRUMMER [terry chimes]! ) (4). There is no Rudie Can't Fail, White Riot, or Brand New Cadillac on this album. It is still a good cd. I hope they release another edition of this album with more classics performed live."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clash come alive with this one!","review":"Believe it or not, I started becoming a fan of The Clash just this year!

But for reason, after borrowing \\"Eternity\\" from the local library and listening to it, I was very impressed with these various recorded live performances! So impressed that I went out and bought my own copy! Anyways, what makes this CD so special is that it captures the band at their rawest, finest, and most spontaneous! What you get, IMHO, are some of the best live performances I've heard in a long time! If you haven't bought anything from The Clash, \\"Eternity\\" is a good starting point.It's sad to know that Joe Strummer is no longer with us. For I'm sure he will be remembered for an eternity to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome CD from an awesome band","review":"If you are any type of Clash fan, buy this CD! I've been searching for quite a while to find a live album from them, and finally I found one that suprisingly meets (and at times surpasses) all of my expectations. They have so many great songs though, that they need a volume 2 in order to portray an even more accurate representation of their \\"live\\" power. One complaint I have is that it doesn't have any songs from \\"Give 'em Enough Rope\\"; that CD rocked. All in all, it's great, BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Public service announcement with guitars!","review":"Captures the excitement of seeing this great band live. It also shows how much the Clash progress over a short amount of time. A little studio magic makes it seem like all the songs were recorded during a single gig. The sound is crystal clear and only three songs have instrumental overdubs. This release reminds us what Punk Rock was really like back in the beginning, before it turned into corporate commercialism (Turning rebellion into money). My only gripe is so many great songs was left out like Janie Jones/Safe European Home/Bankrobber...I hope there is a volume 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally, a live album from The Clash. This is an album I've been waiting to own for a long time.I'm not quite old enough to have seen The Clash perform live so this album is one of the few ways I can experience them live. I can only picture in my head what Strummer's bionic leg must have looked like pumping away as the opening chords of 'Complete Control' come through the speakers. All of their great songs are on here, but the standouts are '(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais,' 'London Calling,' 'Armagideon Time,' and 'Straight to Hell.' A defnite must-have for all fans.The only downside is that it's a constant reminder that I'll never experience this band live. If this CD is the only way I can do that then I'd say that's a pretty happy downside ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"small enough for 1 year old","review":"My little 12 month old LOVES these babies (my 4 year old son likes to play with them too--feeding them bottles, etc!)

She really liked the face with the pretty round head and blue eyes...so I set out to find something smaller. Most dolls the right size are cheaply made, and have painted eyes. These look more real yet don't move (blink like some dolls) The bodies are nice and soft, and the shoes are molded plastic right on the feet so they don't come off.

Many projects call for specialized beads (some of which are no longer available, or require a lucky find). There's room for substitution of course, up to a point, but I think other books such as Margie Deeb's 'Beader's Guide to Color' do a better job if you're just looking for inspiration. That said, this book does have some great tips in it, such as a method for stringing small beads together to act as spacer beads.There are plenty of great photos, although the tendency to focus on a small part of larger projects such as necklaces sometimes made it tough to know what the whole would look like.Basically, if you're the kind of beader who prefers to work from projects, this is a great project book. If, like me, you prefer to design your own works, it's okay for inspiration but not amazing. Decide based on your own needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super book for the beginner, great ideas for everyone!","review":"This will quickly become a beginning beader's best friend! Clearly illustrated with large photographs of each project, the directions are simple and easy. LOVE the fact that materials required for each project are accessible and listed down to the last spacer bead. More advanced beaders can still find inspiration from some clever designs and innovative uses of materials. If you like to bead, or would like to begin beading, I recommend this resource. I have heaps of beading books, many of which I've only gone through once or found only a project or two that seems interesting and attainable. I can see myself returning to Easy Beading again and again for fun, simple projects that provide almost instant gratification. NOTE: this book does not cover intricate woven bead projects -- which is just fine with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bead Book Ever!","review":"Blows the other bead books out of the water.

It is such a sweet, nostalgic book and the writer is very gentle, hard sometimes but always realistic in telling her tale. She brilliantly expresses the workings of the tween/teen minds.A literary treasure for all times, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, too small to stand on, and a waste of money","review":"The weight measurements fluctuate +/- 10 or more pounds on back-to-back uses.

This product does not do that. It gives highly fluctuating readings such that one never knows their actual weight. It is advertised to be accurate within .2 lbs. No way on earth is that correct! You'd expect a digital scale with these features to be more accurate than a mechanical scale, but that is just not the case. This is an awful product. Do not buy it! Either go with a good mechanical scale that will be consistent, or invest in a reliable scale. I bought this thing and have no idea what I weigh. Awful...just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!!! Another useless Health o meter!","review":"This is my second scale from Health o meter. I would not have purchase a second one, but my hubby purchased it when I asked him to get a scale at Walmart...should have told him NOT to get this brand again. Our first one (a different model) was from a family member and it was fairly new when I got it. It just stopped working for no reason after less than a year of use. It looked almost brand new still. I felt horrible throwing it away...what a waste. Now with this model the SAME thing happened. About 18 months after purchasing it is now just not turning on. I even wasted additional money buying new batteries (which is a waste because it uses a special lithium battery that I can't use on anything else). I am staying clear of this crappy brand!!! The landfills are probably full of sleek new looking scales made by Health o meter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge variability","review":"I've been using this scale for a couple of years now on a nearly daily basis. There is a huge problem with the numbers not being consistent. While I'm sure it does fairly accurately track my weight *trend*, I can regularly weigh myself three times in a row and get three wildly different readings. It seems slightly less problematic now that I've moved to a place with new, concrete floors, rather than the old buildings I was in before, but it is definitely still a problem.It's also kind of a small scale. I have size 7.5 feet, and I'm not a very big person, but it's hard to feel like I'm placing my feet on it correctly - and there are times when I'll step too close to the edge and the whole thing tilts. I would not recommend this scale at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works exactly as expected. Accurate results.","review":"We're happy with this purchase. I especially like the increments in 10ths.

So I am not sure what my weight is around. I think digital scales will fluctuate somewhat but by smaller amounts but there are other issues with this scale. This includes how one steps on the scale, places their feet and how much pressure one places which will rapidly change the results. Since there are no instructions how to do this it is hard to get a real result.I agree with some of the other reviews. I have seen on occasions 5 different readings on 5 different attempts. When I decide to weigh myself a little later, my weight is probably much different.So... It is worth buying a better scale even if it will cost more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad!","review":"i tried this scale both in the bathroom (ceramic tiles) and in the kitchen (hardwood flooring) literally over 30 times. i got a range of weights between 184.3 and 112.8!

It was very accurate at first. A month ago (7 months after purchase), it began to go wildly wrong. Weight would vary 2 lbs in successive weighings just seconds apart. Changed the battery. Didn't help. Website for Healthometer in the frequently asked questions section indicates that the scale can vary up to one pound either direction. Not good enough even if my scale was within that standard, especially since it purports to weigh tenths of a pound. A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply not the best","review":"The scale looks very nice. It is lightweight. It takes way to long to calibrate and if you want to weigh yourself a second time, you have to stand there and wait for the screen to clear and then recalibrate.

It uses 7 segment LCDs for it's numbers and some of the segments became erratic and you could not tell what the real reading was. For example; if the 3rd # was acting up you might not know if you weighed 207 lbs or 201 lbs or 203 lbs or 208 lbs! It would become more pronounced if it was the 1st or 2nd digit.

The only downside is the plank is very sensitive to touch. The directions say to step on it once then wait for the 0.0 to appear before getting on (there is a sticker on the plank that shows you where to touch in order to activate it). Well, once you see the 0.0 and step up, if you touch the area where the sticker is at all, it will start over and reset to 0.0. So, you have to position your feet in a way that you don't hit the sticker when weighing. I hope that makes sense. Not a huge deal, but something to consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"It's a great value and clearly works well.

I was convinced the scale I owned already (different brand) was no longer working as if you weighed yourself 5 times in a row on it you got 5 different readings so I purchased this new health o meter one.However after unpacking it, testing it by weighing myself it seemed to work. I then decided to put a gym weight on this one and my old one to really test it's accuracy. My old one was correct and this health o meter was way wrong - it said 5.2lbs when the weight was 10lbs.I think it could be a design issue. The platform you stand on is curved - perhaps to match your foots curve, I really don't know.

First, it's impossible to clean between the glass plate and the metal, and it's rather gross. Second, I have never had the same reading in a row ever, it's impossible to figure out where to put your feet especially since the curve will not accommodate the arch of very large feet like mine. Third, it takes forever to start once you tap it and it shuts off quickly once it flashes. I would recommend investing in a good scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"May have 2 Pound Margin of Error","review":"I find in my use that this scale has shown a 2 pound margin of error in my weight range of around 195 pounds. Depending on where I place my feet, I can get a 2 pound variance. That it offers tenths of a pound in its display is ridiculous in light of this broad variance. I can use the scale consistently however, though it may not refleect true weight, if I am careful to always place my feet in the same location and always stand with the same weight distribution on ball and heel and take 5-7 weighings and accept the weight that comes up most often. That's a lot to do and maybe its not worth the low cost to put up with this.

Thielemann's vision of Schumann comes across quite appropriately in the dark, thick textures he draws from the Philharmonia and in the notably elastic tempi (though less elastic than in No. 2 under same conductor/orchestra). The recording was made in the Watford Colosseum and is one of the better 4D results achieved by DG. I would have preferred a slightly slower rendition of the \\"Cologne Cathedral\\" processional 4th movement, but this is very fine Rhenish symphony nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Rhenish Symphony","review":"Thielemann takes a very Romantic view of Schumann's scores in this fine CD. He is most successful with the 3rd Symphony, which is one of the most riveting performances I have heard; nearly as exciting as Leonard Bernstein's Vienna Philharmonic version. Yet it is darker, more somber in tone than Bernstein's. Although well played by the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Genoveva scores aren't as exciting as its vibrant performance of Schumann's 3rd Symphony. Deutsche Grammophon's sound quality is fine, but I have heard better, most notably on its Sinopoli Schumann symphony cycle with the Dresden Staatskapelle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong and emotionally written \\"coming of age\\" story","review":"Tom Finder by Martine Leavitt is a novel for young adults about Tom, a fifteen-year-old boy living on the streets.

Suspense? Scariest?","review":"The book jacket implies this is Patterson's best and compares it to Hitchcock. It is further touted as 2005 International Thriller of the Year. The book chronically lacks suspense and has rather predictable twists and turns. I fail to see how it qualifies as a thriller or a whodunit. The writing is common and fails to engage the reader. It is billed as Patersons sexiest and scariest and fails at both. The sex is repetitive, not sensual. The murders are predictable and repetitive. If you want a quick, not much to ponder read - this is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the real James Patterson.","review":"A good book to read when you have many other things on your mind.

Nora's Mother wrote a letter and dropped it in Nora's purse. The end...no further mention of the letter. Too many loose ends in this book. Like what did the title or the sail boat on the cover have to do with any part of the story?I still gave it 5 stars because it provided me with several hours of enjoyable reading and I'm a huge fan of James Patterson's. This book was definitely not one of his best but I've read worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popcorn","review":"I found it like Popcorn. Tasty and filling but not that nourishing.

Its the type of story that you don't want to end. You are immediately drawn to the characters and their lives and when you think you have them figured out you become delightfully surprised.

The villain, a women, is one of Patterson's best. She will uses whatever she can to get what she wants. When one of the main investigators gets involved with the women, things go from bad to worse. This book has some quite steamy love scenes that can get a tad too detailed at times, but the twisting thriller will leave you shocked and thoroughly entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Honeymoon was over at the first chapter. I kept waiting for my feelings to become engaged by any of the characters. It never happened. I love the Alex Cross books and the Women's Circle books. There is a passion that Mr. Patterson normally creates in in those books that never appears in this one. I never cared about the persons who were killed,the killer or the FBI agent.There are usually strong surprises in his novels. The surprises in this one were \\"oh really\\" or \\"I knew that\\". I truly hope Mr. Patterson's next novel makes me care about the people involved. This is the first novel by him that I would not recommend as a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was gypped!!!","review":"I first read Four Blind Mice and liked the pacing, the plot and the way the reader was led to discover plot twists and outcomes. I then looked forward to London Bridge. Woops, a big mistake. I figured that anyone can crank our a lemon once in awhole and read the reviewes for The Honeymoon and bought it. Geeze, what a dog. Its a good example of verbal product placement whether it be food, antiques or clothing. A scattered plot line and awkward to read. Sometimes its as though the authors mixed up the sequence of chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"literary trash","review":"Patterson had been one of my favorite authors, but recent novels have lost something. He's made his name in the publishing business and now can submit anything and get it on the best seller list, at least until people catch on to the fact that it was dashed off with shallow characters, printed with fewer words per page. Anything to make a buck, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Wow, this book was by far one of James Patterson's worst.

Although the novel was not exactly an original, it was rather a page turner. There were exciting moments--in fact quite a number of them-- the incidents were related, and the end justified the original body of the novel. I enjoyed reading it and I believe it merits some credit.In defense of JP, I must say that almost ALL authors, at one point or other in their concoction of fictions, do have uneasy times to create an original and a worthy work, and when that happens, critics have a field day. So easy to NOT understand. Would you say the master fiction-writer, Charles Dickens, was an excellent author? I would say yes. But even old Charlie couldn't escape the claws of bad criticism in his career.I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeymoon was a page turner","review":"Great book, gets your attention right away and hard to put down once you start.

Save your pennies and buy something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Recommend This One","review":"Nora Sinclair is a black widow. She kills the men in her life for financial gain. This isn't an original premise and it isn't done particularly well. I am surprised by all the glowing reviews for this book. I can't find much to recommend here. Nora is a truly despicable character. Some of the dialog is painfully silly. The sex scenes were gratuitous. The suspense...well, there wasn't much. It's all fairly predictable. The twist at the conclusion seemed like it was added at the last minute to save the story. It didn't work. Thankfully the chapters were short and the pace quick. I was grateful to be done with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have saved my money!","review":"When James Patterson is \\"on\\" -- there is no one better. Unfortunately, this book is lame and he is way off his game. Honeymoon and London Bridges are two books that I was very sorry I spent money on. I don't know if he has a certain quota of books he has to fill each year or what, but Honeymoon has the feel of someone sitting down to bang out a book to meet a deadline/quota. It is not captivating or well-crafted at all. I will be much more cautious next time a new Patterson book comes out. I'm sure I will wait for the paperback (if I buy it at all) rather than shell out hardcover prices for subpar work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honeymoon","review":"This was the first book I read by Patterson and it will be the last. He had me with him until he lost his own train of thought in the middle of the book. Chapter 80 ends with a purse incident and is never metioned again. What happened to the letter from Nora's mom? Hello, the ending in one word a \\"DISAPPOINTMENT\\". oh and what's with two page chapters. I seen children books with more flare,,,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Patterson Book I've Readd","review":"I'm a little shocked at all of the great reviews for this book. I've read all of the Alex Cross and Women's Murder Club novels and found most of them highly enjoyable. This book, however, was very disappointing. It was completely unoriginal and left questions unanswered, such as what was in the letter Nora's mother gave her? It seemed to me it was written at record pace in an effort to capitalize on the Patterson name, but at the expense of the storyline and characters. If you must read it, get it from the library - don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It it really JP??","review":"Mr. Patterson has been putting out 3 or 4 books a year for the past several years. This one, more than any of the other that were co-authored is the most un-Patterson of all the co-authored ones. It just doesn't stand up to any of the Alex Cross books. The writing style is not even the same. I wonder if he is just lending his name to another writer? It is interesting enough to keep you turning the pages, but it is disappointing overall. The only saving grace is that it is a very fast read....doesn't take long to come to the final disappointment. A better idea, re-read \\"Kiss The Girls\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good suspense","review":"I too was let down by the book's hype which claimed it was the international Thriller of the Year. It certainly did not qualify for that but still made for an interesting and suspenseful read.Patterson does a good job of gradually introducing the peripheral characters so that we can see what Nora, the portagonist, is like over time.Nora is a \\"black widow\\" who is motivated by greed and kills her husbands or fiances once she has access to their fortunes. Throughout the book we see how she is able to lead multiple lives and juggle her different men.John O'Hara is a great character who sets out to trap Nora, but who gets more than he anticipated. Patterson does a great job of not revealing until the end why O'Hara is even looking for Nora.I also enjoyed the scenes with Nora and her mother so that you get some sense of why Nora has become so very depraved.This book held my interest and kept me guessing. I would recommend it for a good mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely worthless","review":"I am going to make it easy on myself here and agree wholeheartedly with C. Elgin from Carbondale, IL.

It's my 3rd and so far all of them have been cheesy and predictable. This one was probably the better of the 3, but still I'm left wondering how it is that all of these guys fall for Nora Sinclair and don't figure out she lives 3 different lives. Seems to me they'd eventually get suspicious of her constant travelling and inaccessibiity. As for the FBI's role in all of this drama, I genuinely hope they are not that nieve or dumb. It's hard for me to enjoy and follow a book that seems so unrealistic. And what's with all of the soft-porn scenes? I wasn't aware that I'd picked up a romance novel.Overall I'll give it a 2 because it did keep me entertained, even though in some cases I was laughing at how ridiculous it got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"It was strange being in the head of a black widow, who also happens to be a successful interior decorator in one chapter and then in the head of a government agent in the next.

Yes, the first few pages were tantalizing, but didn't seem to realistically pan out at the end of the book. This book had considerable similarity to the movie, \\"Basic Instinct\\" (smart cop/agent falls for black widow killer) and, just as in that movie, I didn't care for either of the main characters in this book. Also, I was expecting some sort of revelation into Nora's motives (abusive father/husband, etc.), but never got that.

As much as I love his stories, the huge number of books he seems to be churning out every few months indicate that the quality of his plots is declining.Honeymoon is the story of how FBI agent John O'Hara tracks down serial killer Nora Sinclair. Nora is an attractive, seductive but deadly character, who traps wealthy, young men in her web of lethal seduction and then kills them for their money like a \\"black widow\\". Agent O'Hara is faced with job of nabbing her, but finds himself getting lured by her antics.

I doubt I'll be reading any more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Best-Selling Author???","review":"This was the first James Patterson novel I ever read, and it will be the last. The writing is dull, lazy, and clichéd. His portrayal of the main character, Nora Sinclair, is abysmal. She's simply an overaged male fantasy come to life, a paper doll in Patterson's clumsy hands. Between the author's paranoia, fear of women, and troubling lack of imagination, I cannot fathom why anyone would waste time with this book when there are so many well-written ones to enjoy. For a fascinating variation on the \\"black widow\\" theme, I recommend Joyce Carol Oates' \\"Niagara Falls.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Only so so","review":"Normally I love James Patterson. I got hooked on him as a teen with Along Came A Spider.However, this book was very average. The subplot could have been more developed. Its explanation seemed rushed and somewhat of an afterthought.As far as the main female character, I found myself thinking more than once that some of her actions would have led to her demise/ capture less than half way through the book. I just never really felt that she was clever enough to get away with everything she does. I also felt there needed to be more of an explanation as to what drove her to kill. The reader is given clues, but left unsatisfied.The end of the book is rather anti climactic, and predictable. That never used to be the way of Patterson's books. The entire novel felt rushed to me. I'm still willing to give Patterson a chance but I'll be borrwing his next novel from the local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flush it out","review":"This book had the potential of being a good read if it went through a couple more revisions.

This made me wonder what was going to happen to these affluent victumes Nora goes after. Honeymoon gets very suspensful and very intriging throghout the whole story. It also has sexual contents. This story isn't boring nor tedious.It's a very satisfying book. I whouldn't call it sinful or depraved. It's almosy like a real event that happens in New York City. The story is so outstanding.They should make a movie or this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Patterson Gem","review":"Although I prefer the Alex Cross series, James Patterson is a masterful storyteller. He uses a co-author in this fast-paced story of a female killer--a black widow. I prefer that he write alone (and if I had my druthers, he'd stick to Alex Cross and The Women's Murder club series) but I guess he needs a little support in churning out the vast number of books he has sitting on the book store shelves.

Nora, the sexy and smart main character has a thing for good looking guys with money, as well as taking their money after she kills them (I won't tell you how). Once the FBI catches on, the race and the romance begins. Approach this book with the same expectations you would any other fast-paced thriller and you'll enjoy this book without being disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Pure Fluff, but its good fluff","review":"This one's a page turner, I literally picked it up and finished it in two sittings. Typical Patterson when he's on his game. Fast moving chapters given to you in bite-sized pieces of one or two pages at a time, his books are an attention deficit disorder sufferer's dream come true.This time out the anti-Heroine is the black-widow Nora Sinclair. A gorgeous specimen who happens to be brilliant, creative, a great cook, rich and oh by the way she's a murderer. Thing is, she marries, then kills - rich men with huge life insurance policies.Bring in the handsome, smooth talking insurance investigator who's on to her fiendish game and who's wit matches that of our anti-heroine. Put it all together and you have a delicious tale of deceit, murder and intrigue that Patterson is famous for.Great fluff that's tough to put down.

It is boring and trite. And, I am so turned off by authors (or publishers) who waste so much space with starting a new chapter half way done the page. Page 34 is already in chapter 9. Some chapters are only two pages. There are too many good books waiting to be read to waste another minute with Honeymoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the Honeymoon, Ask for a Divorce","review":"Got to hand it to Patterson and his publisher.

Was there a penalty for adding a few more pages and a little bit more story? It seemed the author took the 3 essential subjects in the book; Nora, the boss and the ex-wife and just threw together an ending. I felt like I was just dropped. It was very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read - not greatest ending","review":"This book was a good read. Once you start reading, it's tough to put it down.

Contrary to its romantic title, Honeymoon is NOT a romance! Patterson and Roughan seem to have written this novel like a screenplay and it is a perfect story for voice actors. It is read by Scott Campbell and Hope Davis who have a lot of charisma and chemistry. His voice is smooth and dynamic; hers is clear and sexy. I have only read one other James Patterson book so I found this thriller fresh and spellbinding. The 7 CDs provide about six hours of listening time so it is good for a medium distance car trip.

Don't know why she is a black widow, what was in the letter written by the mother. Why did she chose one man over the other to kill in her choice between husband and lover, what was her decision in making the choice. Very shallow. Have been disappointed in the last few books of James Patterson. Where are you James and what are you doing?

Sorry James."},{"rating":"1","title":"He just keeps getting worse","review":"Another author I used to enjoy. He has gone straight downhill. I got rooked into buying this one, after ignoring his last few books. It sure got the hype, but was really awful. Actually, I thought I had read a book before with nearly the same storyline. Do not wasted your time or your money on this one. Probably won't bother with another of his. I think he is cranking them out too fast and produces too little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"Although I have not read everything James Patterson has written, I hope that his writing doesn't get any worse than this. The banal plot (wisecracking FBI agent gets involved with beautiful \\"black widow\\" woman he is assigned to investigate) is just not that original. Moreover, the short chapters and unimaginative diaglogue read like the script for a bad movie.

The plot is both derivative and unbelievable. The characters barely escaped being stereotypical and were poorly motivated. The suspense is contrived, with the \\"tourist\\" scenes falling to the level of literary cheating. Knowing what Patterson at his best can do, I was very disappointed. Because of the last 3 or 4 books, I won't spend time with Patterson again unless he manages another cowrite with Peter DeJonge. Fans would be well served if Patterson and his publisher backed off on the publishing schedule and focused more on quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful anime","review":"Goku midnight eye was one of the first anime movies I watched and i simply loved it.

It caught my attention right from the start, just as a action adventure/drama animation - and then the biomechanical stuff kicks in a few minutes later, and it gets stranger from there. The animation is a bit trippy (that's a compliment) at times, and the fighting is way kewl, and it tells a good story. In other words, well worth the watch, even staying up until two in the morning to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Idea Wasted!","review":"The anime Goku is sadly yet another title to add to the ultra violent, guilty pleasure anime bin. I thought the concept of a detective being given an artifical eye that can control every computer in the world to be interesting. Yet my interest faded with the weak plot and paper thin characters.

This footage was not meant to get out to the general public. It also has really good interviews with people who really know Manson. I loved it.

There he learned to be a fisherman, drive a car and work the fish delivery route his grandpa ran every day. After a while the police from Chicago had tracked down Le Roy. After that he was interrogated and called into the courts as a material witness.I would not recommend this book because all it talks about was fishing and the murder. The story had a weak plot.

Look, we're in an another alternate universe! These books have always wandered, but this one seems to have no point whatsoever. The first book was great, an interesting cyberpunk novel by a well-known fantasy novel. Books 2 and 3 are virtually the same novel, an endless journey through Otherland with little plot development.When I saw there is now a IV volume, I decided to stop bothering. Science Fiction greats could tell a tale in a single novel, or even in a short story. No reader should have to put up with this \\"NeverEnding Story\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated","review":"This is not a novel for the casual reader. This book can not stand on it's own. The author has done wonderful job of developing characters with a plausible plot line however too much time is spent in development. The author has spent so much time in character/plot development that the story itself has taken a back seat. Without reading the first part(s) in the series and without the knowledge that another novel will be added to the list this would not be worth buying. It is simply literary filler. If you love detailed characters and an above average plot line this is the book for you. If you want the above and at least part of a natual conclusion to some of participants - forget it.

In Williams' 1999 tome, the \\"Grail Brotherhood\\" is responsible for a sinister malady that causes hundreds of children who go online to fall into a coma. In Besher's Rim, which was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in '94, a mysterious group named the \\"Satori Corporation\\" is responsible for a sinister malady that causes hundreds of children who go online to fall into a coma. Williams' book features Egyptian Book of the Dead-type gods running around, Besher's book wraps its theme around the Tibetan gods from the Tibetan Book of Dead. Other similarities abound, including descriptions of the children in their hospital wards etc. Too close for comfort, as far as I'm concerned. Check it out--and decide for yourselves, readers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn out and boring, boring, boring","review":"The series began well with the first volume, but as it progressed it became obvious that it was simply a cynical moneymaking exercise by Tad Williams -- why settle for one book when you can draw the story out over numerous volumes and really cash in!I was getting tired of the draw-out storyline by the end of the second book and I really expected and hoped that this volume was going to be the last in the series. And I believe it would have been far better if it was the last book.One aspect of the story that really bored me was that most of the story seemed to be people's thoughts or tedious accounts of the group's discussions and relationships -- who cares -- get on with the story for goodness sake.But it's too late for me. This is the last Tad Williams story I intend to read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting continuation","review":"The story continues with the heroes and heroines trapped in the otherland network and the Grail Brotherhood about to launch their long overdue masterpiece...Immortality. But the plot unfolds in a rather unexpected manner, which gives Tad Williams to go on tho a fourth book.

I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fabulous book. More. Please. Soon.","review":"This is a great book!This installment really moves the story and characters forward. As much as I don't want it to end I like having my questions answered, especially if it raises several more in the process. Wicked-good ending. Oh, wait, that's going to be the beginning... good thing!I like the way the story ebbs and flows. The tempo changes within the book and between volumes; each one has. It adds texture to the different flavours within the story. I have a better sense of real-time perspective within this story than any other book I've read. This is so many stories within one book, length is not a problem for Tad but a virtue. Complexity is not a problem, it's the point. I hope he is getting paid by the word because he earns it.

Unfortunately for those who read this book, Mr. Goltz offers an exceedingly unbalanced account. At the expense of truth and accuracy, he has chosen a mode which not only puts the textual material in line with pro-Turkish propaganda, but also scrupulously fabricates the facts.

To put the blame on on of the sides is morally wrong, and the author takes precisely such a wrong position. War crimes have marked the history of the Karabakh conflict, both Azeris and Armenians have commited atrocities. What we desperately need is an objective analysis that would portray Karabakh conflict for what it is.

Fake cheese covered cardboard is the closest I can get to describing it. The aftertaste is especially gross. Doesn't smell so hot either. I'm not a blue box fan, but that's at least edible at times. This one, not so much. I even tasted everything separate and checked my milk since it was a new carton...maybe that was bad? No. Tasted the plain noodle left in the strainer...that was ok.

It doesn't taste like real cheese at all (does powdered anything ever taste like the real thing?), but has that stale/flat out-of-the-box kind of taste.

For this, Blake created his own form of composite art. Conceived dialectically, the verbal and visual components are used complementarily, each separately articulating a facet of intentionality, the two together comprising the totality of the Divine Intention.

I now use AskDrSears.com website. This book is very comprehensive and a good reference book from attachment parenting perspective. I would also recommend to read about other perspectives.If you need to go back to work then you may find that some ideas are not practical, but overall it is a good book. It talks a lot about breastfeeding, carrying your baby in a sling and co-sleeping. Sears don't tell you that you are a bad parent if you are not following all the ideas, they tell you to find what is best for your baby AND you.

Mothers (and fathers) that have to try to manage work and raising children will get frustrated when reading this book. When I read this book, it seemed that I never did anything right and parenting was not for our family (since our income is less them K70,000). The upside is that despite my obviously being terrible mom (according to this book), my sons develop and behave great and I am often asked for parenting advice by friends. After this book, I've read the \\"What to Expect During the First Year\\" and I must say it provides lot more realistic view of raising children. The bottom line is: whatever you do, check more than one source for your information, make sure your source is trustworthy (like it or not, but scientific-research-backed opinions have little more weight), and most imprtantly DO WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS RIGHT (and what you can handle)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY OR READ, TELL OTHER MOMS","review":"This book is absolutely ridiculous from a nutrition stand point. If you don't want your baby to develop obesity and allergies do not follow this book. I received this as a gift and am just appalled at some of the advice. It says to give babies juice, start with fruit rather than just vegetables, and start dairy at 9-12 mo. rather than after 12 months. I'm no doctor but I've worked with children for 10 years, have one of my own, and studied nutrition and childhood development in college. From my experience this advice could lead to serious consequences, that will form your children's taste and tolerance for the rest of their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lord.","review":"I only made it through the first two chapters before I burst into tears - if Dr. Sears' instructions on how to deal with a newborn are to be accepted as the gold standard, then I am clearly never going to be a good mother. I felt overwhelmed with guilt as I was instructed to breastfeed on demand, share our bed with the baby, wear the little critter at all times, etc., or risk having a child who feels no maternal bond or empathy toward other people. His instructions were delivered in a tone that implied, \\"Hey, you can do what you want, but you'll be wrong, never develop any \\"maternal intuition\\" and basically, be a crummy parent.\\" I'm sure there is lots of great advice in the book, otherwise it wouldn't be deemed to be such a \\"classic,\\" but after sensing what I felt to be a rather patronizing tone towards women who don't see matters his way, I'll find my advice elsewhere. I've found a much more moderate position that feels comfortable for me in Tracy Hogg's \\"Baby Whisperer\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I a Bad Mother?","review":"I bought this book on the suggestion of a friend who has two children. I should have read the negative reviews more closely. According to Dr. Sears I would be a bad mother (or at least not as good a parent as he is).Dr. Sears advocates breastfeeding to the EXTREME. I tried desperately to breastfeed. I had an emergency C-section, my baby had jaundice (which required him to have formula in the hospital), and my milk never came in. I tried everything--went to the lactation consultants, took pills, etc. but my body just wasn't made for breastfeeding. Reading his book made me feel SO incredibly guilty.Despite the breastfeeding, most of the material I disagreed with. (His attachment parenting was also too extreme for me.) It may be too early to tell, but I think my baby is turning out just fine -- without following Dr. Sears' advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Sears---the moneymaker","review":"While the idea of \\"Attachment Parenting\\" may work for people with adaptable babies, it won't work for everyone. For those of us who put our marriages before our children, cannot carry a baby in a sling 24 hours a day and feel that sleep is a necessity for both parents and baby, this book offers nothing but guilt. Mind you, all of the very strong opinions in this book have no research or citations behind them. I feel that Dr. Sears takes advantage of parents at the most vulnerable time of their lives. It is even more interesting to note that Dr. Sears, a \\"staunch\\" supporter of unrestricted breastfeeding, has a website that is sponsored monetarily by one of the leading formula companies. He claims that he needs funding to keep his site up and running--I find it all very curious. On top of that, most of his books offer the same info.--he just titles them differently and charges another fifteen dollars. You be the judge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the review for the new edition?","review":"I loved one of the previous editions of this book and used it as the main reference for parenting my baby.

Even the editorial review offered by Amazon refers to previous editions, yet they picture and give facts for the newest release. Just an observation I would like to see corrected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy, Worth the read.","review":"This is THE book to have, if you have a baby.

It gave especially good tips on what a baby may look like after birth, and that many of the oddities are because of the birth process and will go away. The only downside that I saw was the authors' fascination with carrying the baby around at all times. Though it is important to have frequent skin to skin contact with your child (future or present), the baby cannot become dependent on constantly being held. At the end of the day, the amount of baby carrying parents do is all based on personal choice and preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"good information for the first time mom","review":"lots of info on babies, my daughter in law loved it and uses it to this day.

It had plenty of detailed information on what to expect in terms of sleeping, eating, etc., at different stages of my baby's first year, and plenty of easy-to-follow advice on helping my child to be a good eater and sleeper, and what toys go great at what developmental stage. I liked that he gave alternative ways to get things done, since not all things work for all people. It also brought in ideas on \\"wearing\\" your baby in a sling (versus the baby bjorn or just using a stroller all the time) which turned out to be great for my baby, because he could be close and I could have my hands free to do other things!

Sears & Sears make you feel guilty for trying any approach other than the \\"Attachment Parenting\\" style they espouse.I found Sears & Sears to be particularly unhelpful when it came to infant sleep. Their suggestions for how to get a baby to sleep longer at night, such as using all-cotton sleepwear and co-sleeping, are probably great for easy babies with extremely mellow temperaments. But what happens if your baby does not respond to quick fixes? Sears & Sears only suggest an increased level of responsiveness, and insinuate that resorting to any \\"sleep training\\" method risk doing permanent psychological damage to their child, something which is not true, and quite unfair to a desperately sleep-deprived parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"*The* book I recommend to new parents.","review":"I am a childbirth educator and post-partum doula, and _The Baby Book_ is the book I recommend to all new parents.

I refer to this book all the time to look up information on what my baby should be doing at certain ages, breastfeeding advice, as well as recommended dosages for infant Tylenol.

I bought this book more for the technique advice and less for the philosophy, but the philosophy aspect leaks into everything so it hasn't been much use for us. The Sears believe that in order to really love your baby, you must constantly cater to their every desire (regardless of needs). I think if most parents followed this philosophy they would go insane after a couple of months. A baby should be a wonderful ADDITION to a family and not take over as the center of the world. Too many kids are growing up self-centered as it is and this book definitely encourages you to head your baby in that direction. My advice, go to the bookstore and really preview books before buying them. It's pointless to buy a book like this unless you are totally committed to this philosophy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for those with lactation issues","review":"This book will basically make you feel like the worst person on the planet if you are not breastfeeding your child for any reason. I wonder if Dr Sears has any idea how awful he makes moms with lactation issues feel? This book made me cry way too many times.

Take it for what it is worth and consider the fact that this is not the end-all, be-all of information. Some of the things stated may seem a bit extreme (my advice: then skip it), but there seems to be that type of thing in almost all baby books that lean in one direction or the other.If you buy this book, I would strongly suggest using it as a reference source and taking only the things that seem significant to you that are presented here and using them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me or my kids","review":"I rarely give anything one star, but I threw this book away. Short story, a friend gave me this book before my first baby was born. My friend was an attachment parent, and that just isn't my style. I'm glad Dr. Sears and his wife found a style that worked for them, and that other parents find that useful, but I would literally lose my mind parenting that way. My kids would only see me through the small glass window of my inpatient psychiatric room.What I particularly resent about this book is how Dr. Sears traces so many childhood maladies back to lack of breastfeeding, co-sleeping, nighttime parenting, skin-to-skin contact, etc. Again, this works for some people, but not me. Besides, inpatient psych units are expensive.My bible for taking care of my kids is the American Academy of Pediatrics: Caring For Your Young Baby and Child. Solid, middle of the road medical advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empowering Book","review":"I did not get this book until pregnanat with my third child... and was so relieved when I read it!

Thankfully, I had enough sense to toss that advice and do what I wanted to do, book or no book.When I got this book and saw it backed up what I felt in my heart, I was so relieved!

This is simply not true. Most babies fall into a schedule naturally. If that schedule doesn't work for you (mine thought 1 am was a fine bedtime!), it can be lovingly adjusted.As with any book, take it with a grain of salt. One thing I realized early on was that the book was for a Sears baby, not mine. However, overall, the advice is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifestyle Preference not Medical Reference","review":"This book is heavy on lifestyle suggestions and weak on medical facts. It instructs the new partent to disregard the advice of your pediatrician on the issues of \\"crying\\" and \\"where your baby sleeps\\". On the latter issue the book recomends allowing your baby to sleep in your bed for up to two years and reaches the obsurd conclusion that placing a baby in a crib is like putting the child in a \\"wooden cage\\". The authors go so far as to suggest that intimacy with your partner in the early months is permissible in this bed sharing environment. Common sense and our trusted pediatrician says this information is bogus. It seems that the book's authors have disdane for the \\"Western\\" method of child rearing and do not hesitate to lash out against it. I was looking for medical facts, not lifestyle recomendations. This book has been a waste of money, time and fustrating when you have a sick baby and need cold hard facts to make the baby feel better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answers the Questions I have","review":"I usually use this book as a reference when something comes up and I am curious. Each time it has provided me answers I have needed. Better than looking online and finding all kinds of things that contradict one another. I have other baby books as well, but this is my go to for general information. Great Book!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of all baby books","review":"I purchased a number of baby books before this one and was never completely satisfied with the content. Most baby books are very clinical and quite dull to read. I wanted something that would describe medical issues and growth milestones and also provide advice on suggested activities during different phases of development and proactive ways to keep your baby healthy and happy. This book has it all. From common ailments to vaccinations; baby wearing to massage, it really is an excellent book. I also appreciate the advice provided by the authors who are not only medical professionals but parents to eight children as well.I will definitely be giving this book to friends when they become new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent and Comprehensive Guide by a Seasoned Pro.","review":"This is an excellent and very thorough guide. Dr. Sears, a pediatrician with eight children of his own, shares his wealth of knowledge with the reader in a guiding rather than dictacting manner. He presents different parenting styles encourages parents to follow their instincts and choose the parenting style that suits their child and them the best. I highly recommend this book (it makes a great baby shower gift)!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for any new parent even if you don't breastfeed!","review":"Dr. Sears and his wife Martha write wonderful books! I previously bought their Pregnancy book and just loved the content and the ease of reading so I purchased this one on a recommendation. The information is priceless - particularly the idea of learning to understand what your baby is trying to tell you. Also wonderful is the chapter on sleeping - I immediately used this chapter with much success. Full of relevant personal experience and suggestions. Keep in mind that Dr. and Martha Sears are VERY into breastfeeding and since I am not, I just skip through these chapters even though they very subtly try to convince you that you are a bad parent if you don't breastfeed....Regardless, a must have for new parents library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some helpful information, but too preachy.","review":"This book has some good information, but gets to involved in preaching about baby wearing and breastfeeding along with other subjects. I do nurse my baby and believe it should be continued as long as mutually desired, but the authors make me feel like I am doing something wrong if I do not totally agree with them. They make me feel like I am being a bad mother if I do not follow their suggestions. The authors keep repeating themselves and do not give you the feeling that it is okay if you do not agree with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven, some very odd and autocratic thinking","review":"While some of the suggestions in this book are helpful, the Sears philosophy seems to be one autocracy, \\"Do it THIS way and no other is valid.\\" This is despite the claim that parenting each child is a unique and individual experience. Strange, then, that Sears believes that his steps are the only that can fully meet the needs of a child.Here's a radical idea for parents, don't be an \\"Attached Parent\\" (AP), or an (insert descriptor here) parent, simply be a parent who parents your child in a way that allows your family to function happily, healthfully and in the best way possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too opinionated","review":"I am a new expectant mom and I bought this book, as well as the Sears' Breastfeeding book, after several friends recommended them. The more I read both of them the more frustrated I have become at what seems like the authors' lack of tolerance for various approaches to parenting. They seem to promote one \\"right way\\" of doing things, and that's \\"their\\" way. I'm surprised and disappointed that such an experienced and well respected pediatrician would not provide more than one approach or opinion on the various aspects of parenting and childrearing. I would not recommend this book, especially for a new parent, if you want to keep an open mind about newborn topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for All Parents","review":"Whether this is your first, second, third . . . the Baby Book is an excellent resource for all parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful resource!","review":"This is a wonderful book that encourages parents to listen to their babies and follow their instincts. What better advice is there? Full of helpful tips and common sense information, I highly recommend this book to everyone. In fact, this book is now part of my standard baby shower gift for friends and family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best one -stop reference guide for all things baby.","review":"My copy of this book is well worn and has pages that are falling out. Granted I have three kids, but I have used this book for every one of them and often find myself re-reading parts that I had forgotten about. A great reference manual for all the problems, illnesses, and joy that you will experience with your child. I love to send this book as a baby gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic complete resource for parenting","review":"I recommend this book for all parents in my midwifery practice. Comprehensive information and advice, yet allows and encourages parents to make their own parenting decisions. Good breastfeeding support. Vital information on how to choose and relate to a pediatrician or other baby doctor. Good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best baby book out there","review":"This book was great- it was full of helpful information that especially helped me thru the first few months tremendously. It also gave me the confidence to trust my instincts and not let others sway me on such things as my baby sleeping in our bed and our nurturing of her. I have read other books but I feel that this book had the most information that I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.... just awful","review":"This book is a joke.It's basically one guys view on how you should raise your child that is written as if there's a ton of \\"evidence\\" and \\"studies\\" to show how right he is. The problem is, he never says what those studies are, or where the opinions come from so you can only conclude that they're his personal opinions. This is fine except he never says it's just his opinion!My favorite part is the section where he tells the story of a couple who don't practice his methods but instead have the child sleep in their own bed and don't respond to their every cry within 10 seconds. He goes on to say how the parents didn't have a tight relationship with the child as he grew and later the kid got into trouble.He tells it as if the whole issue started because they didn't respond as he thought they should when the kid was a baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Easy Read","review":"This was my favorite of all the baby care books I bought. It's thick and comprehensive, but very easy to read. I thought I'd just use it as a reference, but I found it so enjoyable that I read the whole thing from cover to cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best baby book!!","review":"I am a huge believer in Dr sears and have raised my family this way. I buy this book for all my friends for their baby shower. It's such a great resource for parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MUST HAVE book for new or expectant parents","review":"Forget What to Expect, THIS is the book to get you through planning for and taking care of your baby. It has information for pregnancy, delivery, nursing, babywearing, and your baby month-by-month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed-down, Insulting Book filled with Scare Tactics","review":"If you enjoy being talked to like you're a brainless, intuitionless human being and you respond well to scare tactics then this book is for you. It's dumbed down so much that I'm quite sure even a baby would find it insulting.This book is all about doing it one way and criticizing all other methods. According to Sears, their way is the ONLY way to raise a healthy, happy, adjusted child. I know two couples who followed this book religiously and their children are the antithesis to independent, adjusted, happy children (refusing to eat, refusing to sleep, crying incessantly when mom is busy, developmenally delayed, etc etc). We, on the other hand, stopped following this book and our 5 month old is smart (says Mama already), physically advanced (sits unassisted, rolls over, and stands up), goes to bed without fussing, sleeps all night, laughs and smiles constantly and eats like a champ. Don't buy this book new, buy my hardly-used copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thank goodness I found this book!","review":"Luckily I started reading this book when my baby was only a few weeks old. As a new parent it covers all the basics I needed for reference. Also, I never would have thought of baby wearing, but now that she is two months old I have a sling and a wrap which give me a lot of freedom of movement both in the house and out, as well as the closeness with the baby. This book is obviously very comprehensive and I feel good that I have the developmental information for each month to refer to as well as what to do when she inevitably gets a cold --for example the section on when to call the doctor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for first time parents!!!","review":"I love this book. I spent a great deal of time in book stores looking at all the different baby books. The Baby Book just makes sense. I am a big fan of baby slings, breastfeeding, co-sleeping and this book offers suggestions, advice and research about all these topics. It is also wonderfully supportive of bottle feeding - formula or breastmilk, cribs, and working moms. Right now I have the privledge of staying home with my little guy but I am going back to school in the spring and I was grateful to find a book that approaches parenting from more than one point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fear-mongering","review":"I'm about to give birth and have been looking for a helpful, unbiased resource that presents several different approaches to the first few months with a newborn. The Sears book does have some useful factual information, but the sections on attachment parenting are so sanctimonious and self-righteous. I can't stand the way they insert anectdotes about people who didn't practice attachment parenting and ended up with broken family bonds, angry children, etc. I think I am open to the ideas behind attachment parenting, but this book turned me off so much that I am already exploring alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what am I then? Unattached? Please.","review":"I bought this book when I was pregnant and thought it was fabulous. Now that I'm a mom (she's a thriving seven-month-old) I laugh when I read it because it's so ridiculous. And patronizing. (Example: \\"How sick are you? Be honest.\\") Get Dr. Spock instead. It's only a few bucks and it's a perfect non-judgemental reference. And realize that helping your child learn to sleep, trust other care givers, see her mom as a fulfilled professional, etc. are loving and not self-indulgent as many attachment-parenting advocates claim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attachment Parenting","review":"This book has a great deal of sound information about health and sickness, developmental timelines, and feeding and caring for your baby. It also gets unnecessarily judgmental about some \\"attachment parenting\\" staples such as baby wearing. Anybody who has had an actual baby can tell you that what works in theory and what works in practice do not necessarily line up. I recommend buying the book for the health and development information and simply ignoring the parts that don't fit your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby book","review":"baby's mother liked the book - why do you want so many words - if you made this shorder you might get more response"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Helped Me A Lot","review":"I was so happy to get this book as a gift from my husband's work. It really does have everything you need to know about a baby from before birth to age two. I read it before my daughter was born, and I still grab it to look things up like what foods are ok for my daughter to eat now and gentle ways to get her to sleep in her crib. I loved it so much that I bought one for my birthing class teacher as a baby gift. I would have to say that I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book would be wonderful....","review":"but I ended up throwing it away in frustration. Nothing in this book seemed to work and my baby constantly seemed out of sorts and fussy. Finally, at the advice of my pediatrician, I put him on a flexible schedule of eating and sleeping and playtime and he is thriving. He sleeps through the night, eats well and is a happy, easy-going child. My little one is so interested in everything around him that he would never sleep unless I had trained him to (as outlined in tne American Academy of Pediatric Caring for your Child from Birth to Five years.) I'm not sure how you can raise a child without ever letting him cry a little or ever putting him down. Yes, at certain times of the day, I did carry him (I used a Baby Bjorn rather than a sling)and that really soothed him, but I don't think it is necessary to always carry him. Maybe this works for some families, but our family needed a little structure for the good of the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preaching to the choir or the choir leading the preacher","review":"I like this book because it affirmed my beliefs about raising a baby. It appears that people react strongly one way or the other when it comes to the various popular baby books. I would suggest that the books are just information, and that the strong emontional reactions come from the fact that a new baby completely alters your life forever. I think people blame baby books for their own permanent loss of personal freedom. No book will ever truly prepare you for a baby. I guess you really don't grow all the way up until you have to care for a child 24 hours a day. So buy this book and than buy the other baby books and use them for ideas when you are losing it but it isn't the authors fault you brought a kid into the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A common-sense guide for natural parenting","review":"Dr. and Mrs. Sears are pros- their advice doesn't ring hollow because it comes from people who KNOW. Their philosophy of attachment parenting is a natural, respecful way to raise children. The anecdotes from years of their own parenting experience are enjoyable and insightful to read. All in all, a great reference and a great work of advocacy on the part of infants"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for everyone","review":"After reading several books on parenting, I feel that this book isn't for everyone. I think there should be some middle ground between schedule feedings and attachment. The information in here seems a little outdated as well. If you are a working mom, this may not be the book for you. My recommendation is to read a few books on different approaches and find what works for you and your baby. My baby started sleeping through the night at 12 weeks and has slept in her crib from day one. She is a happy little girl and is more of a schedule baby. Does this work for every baby? Maybe not, but it worked for her:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Advice from All-Around Parenting Pros","review":"I will be giving this book as a gift for every baby shower I go to from now on. The first month of my baby's life I spent constantly referring to the couple of books I had, and was frequently disappointed by the vague coverage of such basic topics as crying. My baby was fussy for hours at a time and it wasn't until I stumbled upon the AskDrSears.com website that I felt like I was getting very practical advice. I bought the book soon thereafter and it has been my primary resource ever since. I trust the experience, both as parents and children's health professionals, that the Sears family brings to the book, and I have had great success with attachment parenting.Like everything else to do with parenting, your mileage may vary depending on your personality, and that of your child. But any parenting philosophy that emphasizes physical and emotional closeness with your baby can be generally relied upon to deliver happy results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book But Use Your Own Judgement","review":"I first ran across this book with my 1st son, who just turned 10, and bought it again when I found I was pregnant with the 2nd, he's 4 1/2 months old now. Quite simply this book works for me but it may not be for everyone.On Parenting Styles - Attachment ParentingLike any book you have to take what is presented and make it work for you... you don't have to follow this book to the letter to be a \\"good\\" parent. Attachment parenting to me is being sensitive to your baby and their needs... aka cries in the early days. You don't have to breastfeed, wear your baby, co-sleep, etc. in order to do this, you do get additional bonding time if you do, but by just paying attention to your baby you'll bond just fine. Do what works for you, that's the message I got from this book.On Everything ElseThis book is packed with helpful information from diaper rashes to teething to solids and development."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only One You Need...","review":"Since it was our first child, I purchased a lot (and I do mean a LOT) of parenting/baby books. This is the only one that you need. It answers just about everything any new parent could ask and offers solid advice. A friend loaned me her copy and after having it for two days was convinced that I needed my own! She referred to it as her \\"baby bible\\" and I can understand why--it has helped us answer many questions about being a new parent and having a baby with colic.With every parenting book, it is nearly impossible to buy into everything the author is saying. Everyones parenting style is unique and a blend of beliefs. This book is firmly rooted in attachment parenting which may turn some off, but offers great guidance and the flexibility to do what feels right to you as a parent. I plan to buy it for every friend who is a mom to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on your point of view...","review":"I am a first-time mother and have found this book helpful. I especially like the parts that focus on general health-- the first time I felt a little cyst on the back of my baby's head, I flipped out until I read it was normal in this book (didn't find this info in my other baby books!). However, one thing I don't like about this book is that it seems to bring up questions parents ask without fully answering them except for telling you to practice attachment parenting. That's fine, but I'd like some other realistic options to supplement that. All in all, a valuable book that makes you really feel good about being a parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes Mother, he's a doctor","review":"The Baby Book is a God-send. When mothers and mothers in law express shock that your baby sleeps with you, and that you don't let that baby cry herself to sleep, you can simply refer them to Dr. Sears. The philosophy behind the advice stresses attachment and gives the reader permission to respond to their babies without feeling as though it's \\"spoiling\\" them. Sometimes it goes a bit too far in my opinion (something about a crib being like a prison cell), but I have appreciated having Dr. Sears' point of view. I use this book alongside Caring for Your Baby and Young Child : Birth to Age 5 by The American Academy of Pediatrics. The two together make up a balanced and comprehensive guide to parenting babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best reference I have","review":"Of course no one can possibly agree 100% with 100% of what thisbook or any book has to say, you must choose what you agree with and what you don't , but I find Dr. Sears to be very sensible on his advice and I use this as my number one reference when it comes to my children's sicknesses and so forth. I've found allinformation in this book to be true when it comes what happens to children when they are sick and his suggestions are helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for adoptive parents","review":"As parents of an internationally adopted child, we were particularly concerned about bonding with our son since we wouldn't be there during the first months of his life. We followed Sears' attachment parenting theory with the necessary modifications (for example, I did not breastfeed) and we experienced outstanding results. My child bonded with us in a very short amount of time, and I credit co-sleeping and baby wearing with much of this. People constantly comment on how attached he is, yet how independent. Additionally, after reading this book, I felt extremely prepared to parent my child when he arrived. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a kinder, gentler approach to parenting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know About Your Baby f","review":"I use this book all the time. I know some of the advice is different than my own philosophies, but it gives me a place to start from. My daughter is now 7 1/2 mths. old and most of his advice is accurate and right on the money. We have been plagued with ear infections and he has some great information. There have been times I have been sleepless and irritated and some of the stories in the book make my husband and I laugh and feel less alone. I still cannot believe his wife, Martha, and some of the things she was able to do with all of those children. I don't think I could ever pump my milk the ways she does ...however, making your own babyfood I can do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mother of 2","review":"I understand the opinion of some of the reviewers which feel the fathers role has be short changed, but Dr. Sears is a medical doctor, not a therapist. His goal is to teach parents what he has learned through his many years in practice and as a father. I understand there are many different types of \\"families\\" in which roles are fulfilled by different people, but you cannot argue with laws of nature. Women bear children and the majority opinion would conclude that they better prepared and have better intincts at nuturing and careing for them. Sorry Dad."},{"rating":"1","title":"book sucks","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever bought. When it comes to parenting, I would like to see some studies about a certain matter. However, this book only talks about the doctor and his nurse wife's opinions on parenting through their practice. Some of the methods they are supporting are really discouraged by psychologists and considered dangerous sometimes. So if you are looking for a good way to parent your baby do NOT buy this book, as the dangerous after math to their methods do NOT appear until your children are in their teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book for career women and contemporary fathers","review":"Society has changed so much in the past 2 decades in regard to women and careers and the role of fathers in childcare. Dr. Sears' book has many excellent areas but it is not up to date in regard to these societal issues which are so important to the contemporary family and up-to-date parenting. I found a book called \\"Our Baby:The First Year\\" which acknowledges these important issues and goes well beyond it. I would highly recommend this new (1997) book for any new family."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Parents Loved It!","review":"I got this book as a gift for two good friends. As first time parents, they were eager to receive any expert and practical advice. This book offered both and has earned a semi-permanent place on their nightstand (at least until their baby reaches puberty!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book you need!","review":"No need to buy the pregnancy book or the others in the Sears collection. This book has enough information on most of the topics you need to be knowledgable of. Easy reading and a great consultation book after your baby is born."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informational.","review":"This book has been very helpful. It is all inclusive and has a lot of great information on all topics from laboring, to baby sleeping, to eating habits. Since the book has been around awhile some of the ideas can be a little dated (older theories), but overall a GOOD investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL PARENTS SHOULD HAVE THIS BOOK!","review":"Hooray for Dr. Sears! This EXCELLENT book will help you take care of your baby in the best possible way, the way nature intended. I have been using all of the techniques he discusses in his book with my now two-year-old son (learned from this and other Sears' books and by following my instincts) and we have the most wonderful relationship. He trusts me, he's healthy and strong, and he's happy. He's enjoys bedtime (as he sleeps w/Mom & Dad) and knows that his needs will always be met. He rarely has tantrums because he understands his boundaries are for his own benefit and respects that we want what's best for him. Our world would be so much more harmonious if all parents practiced this style of parenting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Dr. Sears!","review":"The best baby book available. A big book packed with important and caring information. Comforting advice and answers to common questions. Especially good for parents who believe in Attachment Parenting - but if you're not, it may make a believer out of you. Another book I'd highly recommend (with a foreword by Dr. Sears) is Perfect Parenting, The Dictionary of 1000 Parenting Tips - for specific solutions on potty training, sharing, whining, clinging, etc...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attachment Parenting","review":"This book focuses on Attachment Parenting and I was looking for a more factual book on the development of a baby. I felt this book was too focused on what the authors felt was their opinon on good parenting rather than medical facts and a guide to things like how much too feed your baby at certain weights, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for a guilt trip read this book...","review":"As a first time mom I was anxious to have a guide to new babies that would help me do the right thing. This book however made me feel that nursing continually, sleeping with your baby (thus sacrificing your own sleep) and wearing your child 24 hours a day is essential to having a well adjusted happy child. His advice to parents with fussy children is to spend even more time with them. As a parent of a \\"high need\\" baby that cried continuously for his first six weeks, Dr. Sears made me feel guilty if I put the baby down long enough to eat or sleep myself during the first 6 weeks of my baby's life. His suggestions that the mother sacrifice her entire sense of self (without a similar emphasis on the father) is too demanding for most women and unfairly burdens the mother. I would never recommend this book to a new or nervous mother unless I wanted to assure that she ended up sleep deprived, guilty and unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some useful information - technique not for me","review":"There was some useful information in the book, but it was too buried in the attachment parenting lectures. And they aren't statements, they're lectures. The book also does a good job of making you feel like if you don't practice the attachment parenting style they preach, you are a bad parent and condemning your kid to a horrible life. Great message to send to first time parents - make them completely doubt themselves. Yeah.There is so much more useful information in What to Expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't do without it!","review":"This book is amazing! I received it as a gift and have used it endlessly! It addresses everything from birth and breastfeeding to common baby stuff and illnesses and even discipline! It has been so helpful and saved me many calls to Mom and the Doctor! Dr. Sears is such a well rounded, not extreme pediatrician. He provides the information you need and encourages you make your own conclusions. I LOVE all of the books his family has put out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A parent must have!","review":"This book is stocked to the max with everything a parent needs to know when they have a baby. All your questions are answered and it's not biased towards one side of parenting over the other. This makes a GREAT baby shower gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative!","review":"I got this book for a baby shower gift. At first I was over-whelmed by it because there is so much info. Then I started using it as a resource after the baby was born. Now I feel like I use it all the time, instead of constantly calling the doctor about little things. I am now buying it for a friend who just had a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book opened my eyes","review":"I am sadened by the defensiveness I see in the negative reviews. One person actually got offended that he is an advocate of breast feeding. NEWS FLASH: It is better! (Unless there is a medical reason not too.)This book introduced concepts that were foreign to me and we are using what works for our family. For example co-sleeping works for us. But I can see it not working for all. Bottom line: cut the defensiveness and negativity and do what is best for your child and family and there will be no regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource","review":"I have this new revised edition and am impressed with the amount of information covered - physical, medical and emotional issues are included. There are very nice pictures and charts also. The book is strongly for natural birth, co-sleeping, using a sling, and breastfeeding and these find their way into many entries, so it's best if these work for you, otherwise you may feel left out or made to feel guilty. I would also recommend: Gentle Baby Care and The No-Cry Sleep Solution with a foreword by Dr. Sears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Resource Around","review":"This is hands down the best book to guide parents. I can't tell you how many times it has helped us as we learn how to care for a newborn/baby. Organization is intuitive and advice is clear and concise. Everything you need to know is in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My parenting \\"bible\\"!","review":"This book is brilliantly written by the parents of 8 lucky children! Dr. Sears shares his years of wisdom as a father and a pediatrition, and helps us to learn how to nurture our children and give them the love that they want and need. This book is filled with excellent advice, and I have been refering back to it constantly for about two years now. My 18-month-old son is happy, healthy and smart, and I owe at least some of the credit to the Sears family! Let this be your parenting instruction book - forget the rest!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Bible\\" for first time parents.","review":"This book was one of the biggest influnces on how I cared for my babies. Prior to the birth of my first daughter I had read alot on pregnancy and birth. But after she was born I felt clueless. This book gave me the information I needed on baby care and health, but also helped me to trust my own instincts as a mother.Dr. Bill and Martha have had eight children of their own, so they really speak from experience on parenting issues. I feel that this is the \\"Bible\\" for new mothers and I buy it regularly as a shower gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone, but works great for us!","review":"Being a first time parent is very overwhelming. Before our son was born I somewhat questioned their philosophy but now I really believe in the Sear's philosophy of attachment parenting, being the parent of a very special high needs guy! When others try to tell us that we are \\"spoiling\\" our baby by doing what is working for us, it is great to be able to reread their philosophy and know that we are doing what works best for us. Maybe if I had a very easy/calm baby to care for I wouldn't agree with their philosophy. Instead of feeling guilty for practicing attachment style parenting, I know that what I am doing is right for my baby and me. When the frustration levels rise and I begin to question my parenting capabilities, I open up the book and feel reassured. It is a great reference guide. Breaks up developmental milestones, easy text to read and understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version is broken - get the paper book","review":"The Sears' writing style depends heavily on bullet points, lists, and sidebars, but the formatting does not properly come through in the Kindle edition. For example, a bulleted list in the book comes across as a run-on unpunctuated sentence on Kindle. Also, since the 300+ book only has a table of contents and not an index, it is difficult to navigate on Kindle. Searching is completely useless, as common terms are used hundreds of times throughout the book -- it's sad to say, but flipping through physical pages is more efficient.If you want to buy this book, read it cover-to-cover, and put it away, then the Kindle edition may be OK for you. But, if you want to use it as a reference, buy the book, not the Kindle edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have book for new parents","review":"It has answers for any question that you may have regarding your baby ..a must have guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be Titled \\"Attachment Parenting, Birth to 2 Yrs\\"","review":"I bought this book online before the birth of our first daughter based on the fact that it is the bestselling book on the subject. I did not read the reviews other than the average of four stars. The Baby Book has good information on health issues, as you would expect from any baby book. What I did not know is the the Sears family are huge proponents of attachment parenting. Attachment parenting probably works and produces well-adjusted kids but is very impractical unless you don't have to work or have maids, gardeners and nannies, etc. to keep your house from falling down around you. Nobody can carry a baby around 24 hours a day while maintaining a healthy marriage and getting the day-to-day things done that need to get done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some useful clinical information..","review":"This book is a good reference guide as far as health issues go (ex: congestion, diaper rash, etc.) - The authors of this book are extremely biased when it comes to feeding, I agree, breastfeeding is the best way to go, providing you are able, however, they make formula feeding sound like a horrid thing, and that if you do go that route, you are an uncaring parent. Also - the book supports co-sleeping which has been proven to be potentially dangerous to babies... 50% of the book is useful - take the other 50% with a grain of salt..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave this as a gift","review":"I bought this for my neice and her fiance this past Christmas since they are new parents. She called to tell me 2 days after Christmas that the book is awesome! She said there is so much good information and a really good reference book to have. She consults it on many things that she feels she has questions about such as burping, hiccups, and poop in babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I hope the popularity of this book reflects changing trends in baby care in the western world. It has been a life saver for me to find professional endorsement for the way I always thought and felt I should care for my baby. There is also creative advice on practicalities such as feeding and playing, and the age-specific developmental guidelines are always a useful and encouraging reference. It is in no way \\"American\\", which was a huge relief. But wouldn't it be a bigger relief if America and all the western world would get BACK to reality and we could say that Dr Sears reflects American/Australian/British/etc culture!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilt Complex","review":"Although this book has some good facts, it is really not worth the money. If you are not already Catholic, you will feel just as guilty by the time you finish this book. The Sears' are self-righteous, ultra-traditional and inflexible in their judgment. They criticize other books for their inflexible methods, but are equally so themselves. They rely heavily on their own parenting experiences and communicate that their parenting methods are the only way. They suggest that anyone not following their methods are insensitive, unloving people.If a parent were to follow their guidelines, they would not have time to even do their laundry, let alone go to work! Also, your baby would never: 1) sleep in his/her own room; 2) sleep throught the night; 3) be put down; 4) behave independently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circumcision stance: genital integrity is not about \\"sameness\\"","review":"Snippet: \\"Since little boys do sometimes compare the styles of their penis, many parents feel that sameness is important among brothers.\\"The Baby Book teaches that if siblings have different colors of skin, we should paint them the same color so they don't have questions. In fact, if we have sons and daughters, we should just amputate all external genitalia so that they don't ever ask why they look different, since \\"sameness is important\\". 5 stars to Sears and Sears. And let's hope one of the siblings doesn't loose a hand, or all the others will get it clipped as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing...","review":"I received this book as a gift while I was pregnant, and put it away until the baby was born. Towards the end of my pregnancy I attended a newborn-care class at my hospital, where the teacher highly recommended this book. Once the baby and I came home from the hospital, I pulled The Baby Book out and gave it a try.As a new mother, I found the chapters fairly long and involved. I just didn't have that much time to sift through the information to find what I needed.There seemed to be a real tilt towards stay-at-home mothers. I would love to be able to afford to stay home with my child, but unfortunately it's just not possible.I'm sure many people will love this book. I just preferred What to Expect the First Year. It gives a month-by-month breakdown of just what to expect with your newborn. I'm looking forward to reading What to Expect the Toddler Years after I finish this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have","review":"Great book- I go to this book every time I have a question about anything!

I used this on at least a weekly basis when my baby was first born (sometimes at 3am!). It totally saved my life that year and answered SO many questions. I don't totally agree with every single thing that Sears says, but like with anything you take what you need. This has a lot of good information and comforted me when I wanted to just freak out about something (like green poo - totally normal)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful but repetitive","review":"I enjoyed this book and found it more thorough than a lot of other baby books. It also makes a great reference guide. I keep it and refer back to it often. I like the sections detailing baby's development by month.I only have one criticism. I understood the Sears' theories on breastfeeding, wearing your child in a sling and also co-sleeping. With that said, I found those 3 points of the book to be a little overdone and also very repetitive. I felt like they were being reiterated constantly through out the book and since I really got it the first time, I felt this repetition to be a little annoying and maybe the space used to cover those topics ad nauseum could have been used more productively."},{"rating":"2","title":"They mean it when they say \\"everything you need to know!\\"","review":"This book really covers everything about babies. It's been an excellent resource for me. It covers everything from the first day you bring baby home, to teething and feeding, etc. The only thing to be aware of is that Dr. Sears has a lot of strong views on parenting that might not appeal to everyone. Things like having your baby sleep in bed with you aren't always accepted with open arms in today's society. But I have to say that his methods really worked for me and my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially DEADLY advice","review":"I used Dr.Sears book as my baby bible with my son and was happy and perhaps even smug about adhering to the attachment parenting principles. However the concept was a fatal mistake for my second child. Our daughter Corynn died in our bed, suffocated next to me. Bedsharing is dangerous. I am not overweight and I was not under the influence of drugs. I followed all their \\"safe\\" guidelines.I even wrote to the author over 6 months ago to let them know and have yet to hear a reply.Please look at all \\"popular\\" advise with a jaundiced eye.The information in this book is potentially negligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Waiting","review":"More than two months ago, on April 7th, I bought this book and I'm still waiting.Also, I didn't received any news about that at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Baby Book EVER - Dont waste $ on it if adopting....","review":"I bought this book a year ago in preparation for the adoption of our daughter from China. This is the absolute worst baby book I have ever seen. At least 1/2 of it focuses on breast feeding and makes you feel like an absolute criminal if you don't breast feed. I am surprised the authors aren't advocating a constitutional amendment requiring all mothers to breast feed! Complete waste of money. No practical advice in this book at all. I highly recommend Dr. Spock's book or Baby 411 instead!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"british version not american","review":"i was confused by the british terminology.nappies are diapers. dummies are pacifiers. i would not recommend this book to americans. amazon should have specified that the book was a british version. im not sure if there is an american version. if so make sure that is what you get.overall pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know What You Are Getting","review":"I did NOT like this book. This book is a guide to attachment parenting, not a guide to \\"everything you need to know about your baby from birth to age two.\\" DO buy this book if you want a guide to attachment parenting (cosleeping, unlimited feeding, babywearing), DON'T buy this book if you want a guide to all your frequently asked questions about having a baby. I'm sure attachment parenting is wonderful for many families, but this book presents this parenting style as the only way to raise you child, and doesn't present other options. I just bought \\"What to Expect During the First Year\\" and it seems to be much more unbiased."},{"rating":"1","title":"pro-baby yes, but anti-mom","review":"Clearly the authors love babies. They'll reassure you that co-sleeping is great, and that you shouldn't feel guilty about picking up your baby every time she cries. But their advice is unrealistic and guilt producing. First, how many people can take baby to work? Then, they give an example of how Mom Sears delays a feeding for a few minutes and guiltily endures baby's anger which lasts throughout the feeding, and learns her lesson--never make baby wait again! Bad, bad Mommy! The reality is, not all of us can immediately cater to every need of an infant at all times. If you conceive of an identity outside of being a mom, or if you ever have to balance baby's long-term needs (like having a roof over his head) against the short term ones (he doesn't want you to leave him and go to work) you will probably find Sears extremely guilt-inducing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"Everything you need to know is in this book.

I am a new mom, and for a small price you get great peace of mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Book You'll Ever Need!","review":"This is the only baby book you'll ever need. It covers everything from birth to 2 years. I love all the Sears' books and highly recommend them to all.

But so am I- so I think it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"quite simply the best book out there on babies","review":"We were given this book while still pregnant, and not a day has gone by that we don't refer to it- our baby is now 9 months old. It's been the most helpful, thoughtful, and detailed book we've ever had on raising our baby, and we've read them all.The book is inclusive of the father in the process, but realistic about some facts- my husband can't breastfeed, so yes- he's relegated to helping until the bottle becomes a possibility. I found none of it offensive, neither did he- and he's a pediatrician as well- all of the advice here is modern and helpful.Do yourself a favor and get this book BEFORE you have your baby, it's gentle and true and absolutely worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"good all around reference book","review":"This book covers most all of your questions.

Who has the TIME to raise their child like this. I'd love to devote myself to baby 24/7, but what about making a living (or for SAHMs, just making dinner or washing the laundry). Responding to your baby's emotional and physical needs is important, but sometimes baby has to sqwack for a few minutes or the stew is going to burn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it!","review":"I've heard a lot about this book and bought it eagerly. While the medical advice may be sound (I don't know enough to tell), the parenting advice and tone was so judgemental and annoying that I sent it right back. They advocate that parents should sleep with the baby (and consider not buying a crib), insist on going through labor in a warm tub and demand that the baby stay in-room at the hospital--all to develop an attachment with the child. These techniques may have worked well for them, and other parents, but the tone of \\"do this or fail at parenting\\" I found preachy and none too useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good points, real breast feeding nazi","review":"I thought this book was informative but the breast feeding emphasis was way over the top. Not everyone is meant to breastfeed their kid and he is super super into it. He even has an illustration of a breastfeeding contraption for an adopted child. To me, he implies if you don't BF you'll never bond w/ your kid. He is also a little over the top with other ideas (family bed, love nest)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attachment parenting didn't work for me","review":"I followed the advise in this book for my first baby and I was completely exhausted and depressed. I'm using the Baby Whisperer's book with my second baby and it's so much easier getting this baby to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info if you are able ot Breastfeed","review":"I thougth I would enjoy this book, (i am a new mother of twin boys) however if you don't or are unable to breastfeed this books makes you feel like you are doing some major harm to your child. For medical reasons I was unable to breastfeed and this book just made me feel worse. I believe that we could do a lot worse things to our children then to not breastfeed them.It made it worse for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very heavy book.","review":"It is a very good book, but it is too heavy. I can't hold it while nursing my baby. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"This book is great. Everything you need with a positive family-oriented writing style. The only challenge is that it promotes not introducing solids until past 1 year of age. I would recommend this book to every new mom but also something else to help them get their child started on solids (I got all of my solid-food information online and from my pediatrician). We use this book for everything else - formula, sickness, and etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW TO RAISE A SPOILED BRAT","review":"This is a great book if you want to sleep with your child until it's 12, if you want to remain barefoot and pregnant until they are 18 and if you want to deal with their therapy payments until they are 21. The Sears' advocate \\"attachment parenting\\" which isn't practical (or sane) for most contemporary families. One of the chapters is about how to avoid an epidural. Need I say more to any of those of you out there who have had a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic","review":"Dr. Sears stresses throughout the book that the crib is so unimportant, and the baby should sleep in the parents' bed. Also, Dr. Sears stresses to carry the baby all day long in a sling. These are two ridiculous ways to raise your baby and no one should practice this advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOST JUDGMENTAL, FANATICAL BOOK EVER WRITTEN","review":"I wish I could give NEGATIVE 5 stars. He actually writes that if you have post partum depression and need medication, you probably shouldn't take it because then you can't breastfeed and that would make you more depressed because breastfed babies are \\"better citizens.\\" What a load of crap! First, telling someone with PPD to hesitate to get treatment - is outrageous. Second, saying that breastfeeding is the only way to go (he basically says that) is narrowminded and judgmental. This man should be arrested."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have book for new parents!","review":"I think this is a wonderful, commonsense book. I am now a fan of Dr. Sears! This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could buy them buy the case","review":"I give this book at every baby shower I attend, along with a Maya Wrap sling! I think that this book is great for two main reasons. Number one, Dr. Sears' descriptions of infant development and his suggestions for how to interact with babies at each stage are wonderful! Second, he speaks about caring for children with such simplicity. In a society where we encourage independence for infants that can barely communicate their needs, he encourages parents to follow their instincts and immerse themselves in parenting this baby that will be a baby for such a short time. We can attest that breastfeeding whenever possible, babywearing and generally adoring your baby makes really wonderful, independent children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful reference guide for new parents","review":"I frequently referred to this book during the first year of my baby's life, and continue to find myself turning to it occasionally as she approaches two. The information on breastfeeding was invaluable to me, as well as information on \\"wearing\\" your baby. Using a baby sling was something I was not familiar with but it truly was a lifesaver for my husband and I as it soothed our fussy baby when nothing else seemed to work. I reccomend this book, especially to first time parents, as it covers information on everything from giving your newborn a bath to teething, playing with your baby as she or he reaches new developmental stages to illnesses. Keep this one within arms reach those first few months to give you support and ideas as you develop your own style of parenting your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Attitude","review":"I read the other reviews that said this book was geared to attachment parenting. I thought, no big deal, I'd skip those parts and focus on the other advice. Well, it seems like every single section basically says do it this attachment parenting way if you want your child to be happy and healthy. It really pervades all parts of the book. I expected some of it, but not this much. My estimate is that 50% of the book's comments arise out of that approach. I found it difficult to get a lot out of the advice offered because I do not intend to co-sleep and wear my kid in a sling all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open yourself to some different ideas","review":"I think it's important to get a different spin on parenting than the mainstream pediatrician view provides. To that end, this is a must-have book for your personal library.I really like Sears' approach and do a lot of attachment parenting. Unlike some of the commentators you may read, I don't find the book condescending or shaming of parents who don't follow an attachment parenting lifestyle. For example, I weaned my son at 8 months and don't feel less of a parent after reading The Baby Book.Excellent chapter on illness -- one of the best treatments of this topic I have seen -- and another good one on starting solids.Another strength is how Sears' approaches parenting the high-needs baby. I had one and found his suggestions to be highly effective.The weakness of the book, I think, is Sears' reliance on anecdotal evidence to support his views. I'd like to have seen more solid data on some of the claims regarding family bed, extended breastfeeding, and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased towards Moms at the expense of Dads","review":"While this book can serve as a helpful reference, as a new father, I've found myself repeatedly insulted by the authors' assumption that (1) the reader is the mother, and (2) that fathers only interact with their babies as \\"backup\\" providers when mothers are too weary. Phrases like \\"when baby was in your womb,\\" \\"now you're a mother,\\" etc. get tiring to a Dad who is putting forth a lot of effort to connect with his new child.This is all to say that it seems this book is a product of an earlier era that has not been sufficiently updated to reflect the desires of many new Dads to fully participate in the raising of their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"This book really grows with you through the stages, it has fun informative side notes. Many times while reading the book I would smile because my child would be doing that exact thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overall reference","review":"After three kids and probably 20 books I can honestly say this is the best single, overall parenting book on the market. It IS attachment parenting (of course, since it's written by the Sears Family - and if you don't know what that is BUY this book!!!) but it truly does go even further than that into all things from preparing for birth to Smoothie recipes for finicky toddler eaters. I have purchased this book many times over as gifts for friends because I'm still unwilling to let mine out of my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the 4th time I bought this","review":"I give it to everyone. I bought this when I was pregnant. I was given it as a gift from my neighbor too. I have bought 3 more times as gifts for mothers to be. I will buy more. It is a wonderful resource on literally everything. I found that it is not too opinionated. They do state their preference and their the other choices. It is not set up strictly according to age either. I highly recommend for any new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Awesome","review":"I think this is the BEST book for any new or existing parent. I had the opportunity to use it as a reference at a friends house and LOVED it. Anything that I've ever needed an answer about has been covered so far in this book. I now purchase it for every expecting mom I know. I just think it's that important for everyone to have this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I changed my parenting style!","review":"What a relief, when I read this book and found that being attached to my infant was acceptable. Dr. Sears prescribes a parenting style that has been used for eons and only changed recently in the Western world. According to Sears, sleeping in the same bed with your baby is...He offers other solutions to common day problems that may be frowned upon by other experts but can only benefit your child. My baby is now almost two and she is a happy, confidant and very strong-willed child. I have a feeling that the loving atmosphere prescribed by Dr. Sears and followed by me had something to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bible for parents!","review":"Dr. and Mrs. Sears seem to be the only people in the pediatric world who know anything about babies, and who actually care about what is best for them, rather than ways for selfish parents to make excuses for doing what they prefer to do. This book contains information in every category and is sooooo helpful. ... I cannot stress enough that Dr. Sears has true, proven research as well as experience and good instincts to back up all of his information. The Sears have 6 healthy, well balanced children to show as examples. Until I had a baby I basically trusted doctors, but I have learned that pediatrics is another world altogether. The patients can't speak for themselves, or defend themselves from doctors, who only a short time ago, didn't even use anesthesia for surgery on babies. God bless Dr. and Mrs. Sears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They must be God","review":"Between this book and the website, www.askdrsears.com , I think they answered almost every question that I ever had!

Valuable info on topics such as Baby Wearing, medication dosages (even more detailed than the info on the label), and co-sleeping. Authors practiced the techniques they teach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for new moms!","review":"I received this book as a gift. Many other books I've read seem to not give guidance, but tell you what to do instead. The Sears' definitely give their opinion on what they think is best(when it comes to where your baby sleeps, for example, or breastfeeding), but point out that whatever is right for one family may not work out at all for another. They do not promote one idea by putting another one down. I'm sure I could go on and on why I think this book is great, but I'll spare you. It is the only baby-book I have that I still browse through every now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"understood!","review":"As my wife and I read this book, we just feel like someone else out there finally gets it. This book perfect for us, not just because we agree with most of it, but because it helps us understand our little one better. It is very child-focused and parent-friendly. I knew before I read it that it has a reputation for being highly biased towards certain parenting situations and behaviours, but we didn't find any evidence of a condescending or \\"this-is-the-only-way\\" tone.If anything, the Sears' attitude is much more friendly and concerned with the actual welfare of child and parents than the \\"advice\\" we received from friends and relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"Of course, the best source for information on your baby is YOUR BABY, but that said, this is a great book for when you want a \\"professional\\" opinion. The best part of this book is that the writers encourage you to respond and care for your baby in the most loving way, meeting the baby's needs and yours. That is worth its weight in gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a new Mom...or any Mom!","review":"This book has been a staple for my three daughters as they had their babies.

I give this to every new Mom and Dad I know and always have a very positive response from them later."},{"rating":"2","title":"parents are a childs best teachers and protectors","review":"if you believe that money can buy happiness and security for your family you may not like this book. it is about truly bonding with your child from the start and recognizing and accepting the responsibility parents have to their children. a lot of Americans work hard to earn money to provide STUFF for their children. this book is about providing the things that money can not buy. the stuff that matters. love,affection, security, nutrition, knowledge, confidence and more... this is a great reference book and a great philosophy for parents and anyone who cares for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I a bad parent?","review":"While this book provides great medical advice and some basic newborn care, in other regards it makes me feel like a bad parent. I am not a believer in attachment parenting so this book was not for me. Good for those people who can carry their baby everywhere in a sling (including formal affairs), can nurse on demand without being extremely washed out physically and emotionally, and who can co-sleep with their baby (mine kicks and moves all night long!). You can't help but think what the long term effects of not doing these things will have on your child. Unless you believe in never leaving your child's side, nursing until he's 3, and sleeping with him until he's ready to leave your bed (Dr. Sears says this occurs around 2-3 years of age) don't read this book. It will make you a more neurotic and paranoid parent than when before you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Sears has written a classic","review":"I love this book. It reinforces all of the parenting skills that my husband and I have used since our son's birth. Dr. Sears gives information and support in an understanding and comforting manner.Being \\"Attached Parents\\" in a world of mainstreamers - who believe it's alright to let a newborn cry alone in a crib or to give him artificial milk without even considering breastfeeding - is a challenge. Thankfully, Dr. Sears reminds us that we aren't freaks and we aren't alone in our parenting style of sharing sleep, using a sling, and breastfeeding with child-led weaning.This book ought to be read by all expectant parents. Society has taught us that we need to be detached from our babies and look where it's gotten us: kids shooting each other, parents not knowing how to relate to their kids, etc. Let's all remember that we need each other, especially the tiniest members of society!Thanks, Dr. Sears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sears Insightful and Wise","review":"Short review... I think Dr. Sears is perceived a lot to be biased and sometimes insulting, but I think he hits the nail on the head with a lot of issues. If you've read The Baby Book, you've gotten an overview of what all his and Martha's other books are about, so I wouldn't invest in reading the others unless you already advocate his views addressed in The Baby Book. Frankly, I like Dr. Sears and I think he is very insightful and wise. If people can get past feeling insulted and guilty (because he really does not take such a tone in this book, it is perception), they could really hear the importance of what he is saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy this Book!","review":"Ugh! This book is only useful for those parents who want to buy into the \\"attachment parenting\\" theory hook, line and sinker. There is no objective advice to be had here-- everything is another example of the \\"dont let bad advice stand in the way of a good theory.\\" There are many theories of parenting, and this book has picked a particularly cultish one. You will be a slave to your infant if you subscribe to these views.

This book is aligned with my way of thinking (pro-breastfeeding, pro-homeopathic solutions, etc.). It has come in handy when my son had green stools, when he was fussy, when I was questioning if I was breastfeeding properly, when we gave him his first bath, and MANY other times!

This book is very helpful for learning more about babies and their needs. I enjoyed reading it and feel more prepared to becoming a parent. Yet it felt alienating to have too many 'he' for baby in the book and there are very few references for single parents.

But it's really about attachment parenting. The book advocates breastfeeding, cloth diapers, baby slings and co-sleeping. The advice about putting babies to sleep is opposite all the advice I've seen in other books.Every parent must make their own decision of course. If you want a book about attachment parenting, this is probably a good one. If you want a mainstream baby book, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this book was the worst mistake I made as a new mom","review":"If you have a colicky baby than this book will make you feel like it is your fault and that your baby \\"shouldn't\\" be crying this much. HA! I borrowed and read this book from a friend in an attempt to help soothe myself and my son. I tried wearing my son in a front carrier for a few days all day long. He hated it and cried all the time. I tried the family bed for a few nights and almost suffocated my 4 week old son (thank Goodness I woke up to his squirming), not to mention that I was now getting almost NO sleep instead of a little sleep. My pediatrician's advice was contrary to Dr. Sears and now I know why. This book is based on Dr. Sear's opinion on what babies need and not any scientific data. With a colicky baby, nothing presented in this book will help soothe your baby, even though he says it will. All that reading this book did was make a bad situation worse for my husband, my son and myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Guilt Book","review":"In brief, this book will make you feel guilty about some important things: e.g., if you choose not to or cannot breastfeed, these authors will make you feel guilty about your choice/imperative. They may try to avoid doing so overtly, but in the very diction they use (for this subject as well as others), they subtly (and sometimes not so subtly) imply that your baby will suffer if not breastfed, which as all of us should know, is not the kind of thing a new mother needs to add to her already very full plate. This is just one example of the guilt this book dishes out. I heartily recommend the American Association of Pediatrics's Guide for Infants through Age 5--an informative and matter-of-fact resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"This book should have been called \\"How to Raise a Spoiled, Overly Dependent Child\\".

Cloth Diapers? Wearing your baby? Family bed? What does that do to the marriage? This book's suggestions are nothing more than laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting , informative and BIASED!!","review":"This is a book that is filled with information on everything from feeding to diapering to getting the baby to sleep. My baby nurse suggested it to me. It is totally biased against anyone who does not breast feed! If you don't plan to breast feed this is not the book for you. It has tons of information on breast feeding followed by a chapter on bottle feeding. The first 4 pages on bottle feeding talk about how formula cannot compare in any way to breast milk. Hopefully everyone out there realizes feeding your baby is a very personal choice and informational books should not be filled with opinions!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of lots of info, but perhaps unrealistic","review":"I flipped this book open, and found myself in the section about working mothers. Dr Sears advocates mothers staying home with their babies- he suggests \\"taking out a loan\\" or \\"starting a home business\\" if you are missing that second income by staying at home. That was all I needed to see. If that sounds like practical advice, perhaps this book is for you. I'm returning this book for one written by someone in the real world who has bills to pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Preachy","review":"This book contains some useful information like development milestones, feeding tips, health and safety info, etc. However, much of the book is used to provote a breastfeeding/ baby wearing/ attachment parenting philosophy/ lifestyle which at times seems extreme and makes the reader feel guilty if you can't do these things (e.g. you have a preemie)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Baby Friendly Approach / Gentle Parenting Style","review":"I loved this book! After reading many baby, breastfeeding and parenting books, this is by far my favorite. The gentle approach to parenting affirmed what I already felt in my heart was the correct way to respond to my baby. A great find after feeling guilty that my child did not fit the mold given in other baby books (he nursed more often & sometimes slept with me). I also loved the detailed descriptions of developmental milestones and play suggestions. I felt that many of the suggestions honored my baby as a person and allowed me to see him as a unique person who didn't need to fit some pre-prescribed format.

While the story moved quickly and the writing flowed well, I never really got into it.I enjoyed that the book was set in Boston and I enjoyed Dante and Arnold but I never liked Maria that well. I never felt like I was rooting for her and Dante to be together and I hate books where the main character is always fretting about her diet.I also never felt the chemistry between Maria and Dante.I did, however, enjoy the Chubby Chums support group greatly and was glad that they were incorporated into the end.

This one, however,fell flat. It is more like a checklist of what the advanced Witch should know and what to consider exploring next. She was very thorough in relating what she considered necessary knowledge for beginning, intermediary, and advanced Witches. One must remember,however, that this is her opinion. Some people consider astral travel intermediate and advanced level practice while others agree with Ms. McCoy and teach it at the beginning.There were a couple of parts worthy of her name on the cover and those were the questions she asked of advanced Witches and the Dark Night of the Soul material.The bibliography would have been more helpful if it had been divided or labeled by subject matter.She mentions a few times in the book that she has been ill.

I bellieve that Edain McCoy took a big undertaking, finding out the experiences that others have had, and combining them with her own, to form a well written, and free flowing book. I would reccommend this to any student who is looking for new ideas, or who just wants to \\"go deeper\\" into the spiritual, and unseen worlds around us."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but need to know astral projection","review":"This book is fair. It assumes you can astral project. Most of the advanced subjects are for use when you astral project. The author is vague about many subjects and doesn't go into a lot of detail. She tells you that you should read this book and that, if you want to know more about what she's talking about. I don't recommend this book because it doesn't seem advanced. It just gives general information and doesn't get into more detail. I was disappointed. However, it does have some info that is interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth publishing","review":"Llewylln should never have even published this book.

I must tell you, though, that it's not as if she letting any cats out of the bag, as it were. She says in the beginning that she's not going to explain basic techniques or go into the things that an experienced Wiccan should already know, but she DOES, a lot. I found a few times she'll tell you about different advanced techniques, but doesn't actually tell you how to do them or give you any instruction.

Alas no. There's nothing advanced here. The book is basically a list of requirements the author believes necessary to define oneself as an \\"advanced witch\\". As very few of these requirements have much to do with witchcraft, and as few of them are particularly advanced, one can only imagine that McCoy wrote this book so that she could refer to herself as an advanced witch.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what I expected","review":"When I saw the title to this book I was exciting.

I wear a size 31x34 which is extremely difficult to find in stores and a specific reviewer mentioned ordering a pair of this size that actually fit as a 34x34. Owning several pairs of Levi's jeans (at 31x34) that fit well, I thought I would trust Levi's over the majority of the reviewers and decided not to purchase something smaller or shorter.

The ending where Gary chases Wolfe on foot through warehouse catwalks while Wolfe is on a motorcycle and Gary somehow manages to tackel him mid-air, um...yeah right.

Daniels tries hard, but with his cockney accent and poor scripts hampering him, he's yet to really become a true \\"star\\". In this attempt to project Daniels into a kind of James Bond role, the movie falls flat due to its slow pacing in the beginning and an unimpressive supporting cast. Nick Boraine as the cunning villain does well, but he isn't on screen a lot until the last fourth of the movie. While the movie does have a high-tension climactic battle, getting there requires a lot of patience on the viewer's part. Darrell Roodt's direction shows some promise in an unusual scene in which we get a slow motion view of a gun flying through the air and the actor's reactions to it; it's a neat visual effect--too bad there weren't more in the entire film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Escape, travesty and a waste of money!","review":"This novel is a travesty and should never have been published.

The Salivas live in the mouth and, when food enters, they help break it down to small manageable pieces. These pieces are then mailed by pneumatic tube (the esophagus) to Phil Hydrochloric Acid who lives in Stomachville. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) activates enzymes that break the food down even further so it can pass into the small intestine. Another town, Liver, sends Bobby Bile to help break down the fatty shipments. Once these shipments (food) are made small they can be placed in local post offices for delivery to various other cities (body parts).

I highly recommend it as it brought back memories of my childhood and connections with my siblings, especially my older brother who happened to pass away suddenly and unexpectedly while I was still reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"three weeks with my brother","review":"i haven'nt been reading nicholas sparks books very long, but i am already a great fan. trying to read his past books. not reading them in the order they came out, this book was especially good!!!!!!!!! i can't wait to read the next one. you find out he has endured a rough life in his early adulthood but has had god as his support."},{"rating":"2","title":"three weeks with my brother","review":"loved this book, at times laugh out loud funny, at times heartbreaking, always a riviting story of real family life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mix","review":"Nice blend of travel journal and family history. Laughed and cried. It was my book club selection, so not a title I would have selected, but I'm glad I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas Sparks fans must read!","review":"I myself have loved every book that Nicholas Sparks has written thus far, and this book being the only one left that I hadn't read yet didn't disappoint. If you like his other books you will like this one as well. This book though is unlike his others in that this one is about his own life from the time he was a child all the way up until the present time of writing the book. The majority is about his family consisting of his parents, sister, and brother who he goes on a three week trip with. You learn a lot about his wife and children and also how he became an author. These family memories are written in between the events he and his brother encountered on their trip together.It is a very well written account of his life experiences and the things he's learned along the way. There are some extremely sad moments, heartwarming insights, and laughable stories throughout. Keeps you interested all the way through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I was a big fan of Nicholas Sparks. Until this. The better title would have been \\"Three Weeks Where My Brother and I Act Like Spoiled American Frat Boys\\". It's no wonder American's get such a bad wrap while travelling abroad. Not only did these two knuckleheads have the nerve to act the part of obnoxious tourists, they then had the nerve to write about it. Go home Sparks brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless","review":"This is a well-written, deeply moving memoir....I could not put it down, which is unusual for me reading non-fiction.If you are a fan of Nicholas Sparks, you will appreciate him even more.

The book had a lot of potential, but he bores his reader with history that most people know but he claims to have learned it when he was 3 reading entire volumes of encylcopedias. I was hoping for more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Reading","review":"I agree with other readers who thought he was conceited. Very rude as they travel to other countries and disrespected their culture. All he could talk about was how poor they were growing up. His father was pursuing a PhD in their \\"poor\\" stages. The author mentions the stupid stuff they did when they were younger but they behave today the same way as they did when they were kids. As for Micah, it's amazing that he met someone who could stand him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 300 page lame Christmas letter","review":"This thing was so breezy and boring, so filled with self-absorption. At least when we get someone's annual family update in the mail it's someone we know and care about. The author's endless whining was just over-sharing as far as I'm concerned. I suffered through this selection for book club and kept waiting for someone to get to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only half way through, I decided not to finish it","review":"Sometime in the past, I remember a speaker or someone saying that Spark's best book was Three Weeks With My Brother. At every flea market, used book venue, Goodwill (but I repeat myself), I looked for it--to no avail. So I ordered it from Amazon. It sat awhile on my shelf as have a couple of his novels.But I pulled it off and began. I didn't know anything about Nicholas Sparks except his popularity as a novelist. I appreciated the way he told a double story: the sights of his and Micah's trip; the way he segued into the memoir's past, but about half way through, I decided I knew more than enough about the Sparks family. It was sappy, almost maudlin in places. I have too many other books to read to spend time on one not so well-written as I hope his novels are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, thoroughly enjoyable read","review":"Not only is this story a memoir of the three-week trip around the world, it is an autobiography of their childhood. So many great humorous scenes - several I just had to read to my husband! I did not feel the detatchment to the parents as some readers described, but I got a clear picture of parent/child relations in the generation before me. And although I do not having siblings I grew up with, I did not feel alienated and was genuinely drawn into the friendship between them. Several parts had me in tears - and not just from laughing.I want my husband and his older brother (who are close) to read this - I think it will spark their memories of childhood.All in all, a fantastic book! For anyone - men and women alike, with or with out siblings, younger or older.... something for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those with siblings...a must read.

I love how he just grabs you and pulls you into his life and his family with this wonderful book. It has alot of drama and tragedy but it is a great book and I highly recommend it and I am now buying more of his books just because I loved this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"take a trip around the world","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago having never read his works of fiction (still haven't) and prefering memoirs. This piece takes you to thirteen awesome places around the globe in a three week time period. We hear about him and his brother getting to spend some well deserved and long awaited time together. He shares some of his good childhood memories as well as family tragedies scattered throughout. Well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triter than Fiction","review":"Famed maudlin romance author Nicholas Sparks leaves his wife and half dozen kids behind to travel the world with his brother. Interspersed with descriptions of world famous cultural sites (which, by the way, appear entirely wasted on the Mssrs. Sparks) is the story of Nicholas Sparks' rather unexpectedly difficult childhood. Unfortunately, despite having a story that almost writes itself, Mr. Sparks drowns this book in overwrought, artificial-feeling emotional display. God knows, Mr. Sparks is not particularly gifted in understatement or novelty of expression - and, even with a strong plot, this book is nearly unreadable because of these shortcomings.If, however, you are a big Nicholas Sparks fan, you will be happy to find out that his life reads like a Sparks' novel. This book has everything, except fiction, that makes a Sparks' novel a Sparks' novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful story","review":"I loved this memoir! I think it was a great thing to write this book - now you know why you are reading all the wonderful books he published. The book itself was great - the writing and the stories about the Sparks family, the journey the two brothers took. It makes you cry and it makes you laugh. I would recommend that book to everyone who knows the work of Nicholas Sparks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Weeks With My Brother","review":"I have never written a review on Amazon but I feel compelled to prevent you from wasting your money on this drivel. I have to wonder whether all the other reviews here were written by Sparks' or the publishers' relatives. This was the most boring, insipid and lame book I've ever attempted to read. It reads like a 7th-graders diary. And any man that would leave his wife on her own with five (yes, five!!) children to go on a 3-week pleasure trip is incredibly selfish, regardless of what she tells him. And Nicholas, I might consider firing your editor - your grammar needs a bit of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!!","review":"Well if you're a Nicholas Sparks fan reading all his books and picturing him sitting comfortably in a cushy office writing novels all day without a care in the world, this will open your eyes.What a candid, moving story of his life, his brother, their relationship and more endearing is his home life, his wife and kids and how they all make it work.Great read, would recommend without hesitation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Sparks Fans!","review":"I absolutely loved how wonderful this read was. It really makes you understand where Spark's gets his stories from, the life he lived and why he is an amazing writer.

Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a memoir or a history textbook?","review":"I'm not sure what kind of audience Sparks was attempting to capture with this memoir. It seemed about half a history textbook and half an actual memoir.

After all, this is what creatures from other species who were built to swim were given as part of their DNA code. Webbed paws, what more could I wish for in the water? These are perfect for every swimming stroke: side stroke, crawl, breast stroke, all back strokes, underwater swimming. I don't even bother taking them off for surface diving. My hands and arms are so much stronger after swimming with these daily. It is the easiest thing to add into any water workout and feels part of your body from day one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improves Workout","review":"I purchased these Speedo Aqua Fit Training Swim Gloves to use in my water aerobics classes. They add to the water resistance when doing arm exercises.

I can't imagine a woman using the large.I looked at different brands and the SPEEDO seem to be made the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Adjunct in Swimming Resistance","review":"Swim gloves provide additional resistance to put more strain on the shoulders, arms, and lats. This builds muscle.The gloves are sized rather inaccurately. I have a \\"large\\" hand, but the large size is almost too large for my hand. I recommend purchasing a size smaller than what one usually uses in gloves.My only beef is that the velcro closure pieces are incorrectly placed on the wrist cuff. The velcro should extend farther than it is placed on the wrist cuff. The way it is now, very little velcro on the strap engages the velcro on the glove.kone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me.","review":"This gloves were not comfortable on my hands.They felt too tight and not natural.I decided to train with bear hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent quality, HEAVY when wet.","review":"I bought these to firm up my upper arms. They do work you out, however, I felt that the fit wasn't very nice. My hands are outstretched kinda uncomfortably and feel strange. I like that they float in the water so you can easily locate them. I don't like that they WEIGH a bit more when they are wet. I feel that they give you the extra kick in your swim and speed, however, its weight and lack of fit gets hefty after a half hour of swim. A lighter and thinner fabric would be better and yet more of a harder/stiff frame would give it more distance after a push with these gloves on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to Improve your Resistance","review":"Since I got this product I could feel the fast improvement of my fiscal resistance, and for the great price I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"I swim in the ocean and rinse my gear with fresh water afterwards.

The second pair was great ... so great a friend of mine ended up with them because she too loved them. So these, the third ones are very nice as well, however I traded with my friend because these fit her even better even though they're the same size. I only gave them a 4 because I have 2 pairs of the same size, but they fit very differently because of the way they're sewn.

I never dreamed a pool workout could make me as sore as a weight training session!! Leaving out one star as they would be a bit more comfortable if they fit a bit further down on the wrist and could be tightened a little more. This is mostly due to my VERY small hands and Speedo does not offer extra small...My daughter (11 yrs) even loves them!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great feature","review":"The palms of these swim gloves are rubber, making it is easy to hold onto the edge of pool deck.

They can turn an aerobic exercise session in the pool into an excellent resistance session. This is my second pair and I purchased them as a backup to my originals because it is difficult for me to shop from my location.This pair has velcro closures (old pair do not) and the sizing is accurate.My only complaint is the stitching between the fingers which makes the glove into a \\"web\\". The stitch goes up too far and the point of the Vee that it forms digs into the webbing between some of my fingers (see product pix).I'm hoping that this softens up with wear, but I still love these things!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good gloves","review":"I bought these gloves because my last pair fell apart due to lots of use. The color is great and they work well. However, the fit is slightly off so my fingers are in slightly odd position while wearing them. I also think they should be longer so the velcro is further up on my wrist (more like where my watch sits rather than the base of my hand). But I like them, need them and will keep them."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are great!!","review":"Buy these, I love them. But, do size down as they run bigger than normal.

I wore the gloves today for my workout and really like the resistance it adds. Better arm workout is a great deal for me! Plus I can relax my hands when using these gloves rather than having to cup them or trying to hold my fingers taut in the strokes.For background, I am swimming for fitness and to rehab from a knee injury. I thought the gloves would be great when I am sculling (and they are!). I can see that when I am able to swim crawl stroke, these gloves will facilitate my forward momentum."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as shown","review":"This shows gloves with a velcro wrist.

I have always used the brand Water Gear and thought I would try Speedo but after several weeks using them I will go back to Water Gear for my next purchase.

These are a great price and well constructed but this is just my personal preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gloves","review":"I've used the Speedo gloves for about a year now and I love them. They provide a great upper body workout, especially if you spread your fingers out.I swim six days a week, so the gloves start to wear out after about three or four months. I usually purchase the blue gloves, but Amazon was running a sale on the yellow, so I grabbed those instead.I don't know if there's a difference between them, but the yellow have lasted longer then the blue ones have. They seem better made and in the future I will strictly purchase the yellows.As noted in previous reviews, the sizes run large. In regular gloves I purchase either a large or X-large - for the Speedo swim gloves a medium is a perfect fit.For anyone who wants a better upper body workout while swimming, these will certainly help. But you probably will be purchasing 2-3 pairs a year due to wear and tear on the gloves - especially if you're swimming in chlorine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for training","review":"This is my second pair of these gloves, so obviously I am satified with the quality. The gloves are great for training and for helping to perfect your stroke (they make it very obvious when you are not doing things correctly). The only reason they don't get five stars is because, as other reviewers have mentioned, the wrist is a little loose. The velcro does not quite go over far enough to tighten them up to where I would need for them to be snug.

The Minutemen's \\"jamming econo\\" ethos sets the foundation, but fails to incorporate much more beyond a background on the (now-obsolete) art of writing zines and nurturing mail-order punk labels, despite the culture's rich history and significant modern-day presence. (Azzerand's book thoroughly discusses legendary punk label distributors, while Oake's traces independent publishing back to the beat poets).With that said, I would recommend this book only to younger readers (let's say mid to late teens) who are already engaged and inspired by DIY, but not all that familiar with (some of) its roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item 64086 is NOT nickel with white","review":"This item is not as advertised.

I was left feeling that I had read something that has already been documented in hundreds of television shows that dealt with the war in the eastern front - ie: Stalins repressive regime, the cold Russian winters, the day to day hardships of the average Russian citizen.

I have ordered a street sign \\"Pork Belly Lane\\" , bought her an antigue print at an auction and am adding as I go to make one great focus wall in her home.

It arrived promptly and was in perfect condition.

This tape is a joke. It is recorded in extended play which makes the quality of the video very poor, you can't even tell what your looking at. Way more money was spent on the cover of the tape than in the tape itself. Plus the instructor is blue screened in front of different pictures of the landscape, very tacky.

When used after bathing or showering it keeps your skin very soft and moisturized. The only drawback about using it is I think it isn't good to use on your face, as it will clog facial pores. Otherwise, on the rest of your skin it lasts for about 12 hours. It works great on skin in the summertime after swimming or sun exposure or in the wintertime from indoor dryness. It is unscented, so it won't clash with another fragrance of the wearer. It's worth the price. A little goes a long way."},{"rating":"2","title":"superior product","review":"My husband is disabled and we have a caregiver for him several days a week.

Coxeter was known as an apostle of visualization in geometry; many other books that cover this material just give you page after page of symbols with no diagrams. He motivates all the topics well, and lays out the big picture for the reader rather than just presenting a compendium of facts. This is a survey of a huge field, but he does a great job of focusing on the most important results. As other reviewers have noted, this book is not \\"introductory\\" in the sense of high school geometry; it's introductory in the sense of being the kind of book a college math major would use in his/her first upper-division geometry course. It doesn't presuppose a great deal of mathematical knowledge, but it probably isn't a book that one could appreciate without having already developed quite a high level of mathematical maturity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful book, outrageous price","review":"I have the first edition of this book and learned much of what I know of Geometry from it. As a book, I highly recommend it.But the price is absurdly high!!! It it a reprint, in paperback, and less than 500 pages.

He speaks of Hellenistic Judaism and Rabbinic Judaism rather than of the individual authors and editors of texts who lived distinct lives and thought distinct thoughts.

Now, when I have trouble opening a jar, I switch to the smaller setting. I haven't had a problem since.Update 12/31/12: As I have used this over time, I am less happy with it.

For me it has become music to celebrate to, whether it be someone's life, or some joyful event.

Any fears you may have had will dissolve quickly when you apply the knowledge and insight given in Mr. Holton's book.

Anything can happen, up to and including murder.

From the perspective of both a lifelong Christian and 15 year soldier, this book is outstanding. I am going on my 5th deployment; none of my deployments have been short or easy.

I experienced snipe only on my first board... adjusted my feed technique and it was perfect on the next. Some tear out when i tried to take too much material off but adjusted and it was fine.

Out of the box, I tried to plane twelve-inch maple wide for shelving. The first few passes using small incremental cuts resulted in the wood jamming, getting marred with paint and grease, and a few tear-outs. Not a good start.The jamming was caused by poor manufacturing. In the outfeed of the unit, there are two metal studs that seem to hold the board down as it exits. On my planer, one of these studs was 1/16\\" longer than the other, causing the jams and cutting into the wood. Had to file the stud down just to get the wood to pass through. I still have problems with the wood getting stained with green paint and gouges.Not sure what to think of Grizzly power tools.

An improvement I found though not very good is that, yes, you can input codes you have found off the net and such, but too many will automatically freeze the game, whether in 2 minutes or maybe up to an hour, I managed to only get 4 codes I desired onto one game, dont limit yourself, This Gameshark is not the best out there, keep looking is my suggestion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't live without my GameShark","review":"This is definitely one of the best accessaries for the Playstation especially if you ever rent games.

Still i haven't had any major problems. The only bad thing is that it takes a long time to enter in each and every line of code. Codes for games like Gran Turismo 2 are made up of a LOT of lines. I gave up trying to enter codes for Final Fantasy 9, which were made up of about 100 lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"gameshark","review":"I was very pleased with the gameshark that I ordered.

They said that it wont work on the 500001 playstation 2 game systems but they do. also I like this one due to it having Final Fantasy VII cheats on it. The newer ones dont and I cant find codes for this game. Over all I like this better then the new/older ones. Take a chance and pick one up. its a lot better and as I have stated before it will work on the 500001 systems and I think that it also works on the slims too but I aint for shore if it will for all of them. I let a friend borrow it and he had no problumes on his slim."},{"rating":"2","title":"They work as advertised.","review":"I'm always apprehensive about buying these battery lights because they never live up to my expectations. I have to say that these little lights work really well and I love the spots. The biggest challenge is getting the magnet lined up with the light. If they aren't lined up correctly, the light won't go off. Having to move the lights or magnets around more than a couple of times really takes a toll on the double-stick tape.They aren't as bright as they look in the advertisements but they do the job. Overall a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great item for about 4 months","review":"These were great for about 4 months. Then the adhesive fails and you find them fallen off with the batteries depleted. I had mine mounted upside down. Probably would work better on vertical sufaces. I plan to use a better adhesive. Magnets have to align and come fairly close to light. Otherwise great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Where You Need It","review":"I bought these in a fit of pique because I had a fuse box that is in one of the most inconvenient places imaginable and even in daylight is impossible to see. I've placed one of these in the box for future use. I've also put them in dark drawers and under shelves.While the light is not very strong it is a good light source for general purposes. Also it makes an excellent light for a jack-o-lantern without fear of setting the house on fire. I'm going to try placing some around house plants for atmospheric lighting as well. One package may not be enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not totally worthless","review":"While these lights were a miserable failure in their stated purpose (lighting up drawers) as they didn't stick properly and were difficult to place, they're not totally of no value. They each contain several lithium button batteries which are of a very common size and can be used in other battery-operated devices. I threw the lights away and kept the batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"really neat","review":"These lights make it so much easier to get in and out of drawers and find things when I get up in the dark and my husband is still sleeping"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect doll","review":"I bought this doll for my daughter for her first birthday.

Asian baby dolls are almost impossible to buy in stores in my area. At this price, I bought one for my 3 y/o (who LOVES it!) and 3 more for holiday gifts! Also, I love that it is a plain, soft baby doll, no bells and whistles and no batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy for any baby.","review":"I bought this doll for my 17 month old daughter and she loves her. My daughter is half Asian half Caucasian and I wanted a baby doll that looked somewhat like her. The doll is very cute and has a colorful summer type outfit.

They are such fun! And they're reusable! We use them to practice spelling words, make fun designs, write messages, etc. This big box is the most cost-effective way I've found of purchasing them.I've packaged up sets of about 50 into ziploc bags to take with us when we go on a long trip. They'll be great for projects on the airplane tray tables! And car windows when we drive long distances... They do leave some residue sometimes, but I've found it easy to clean up. They're small and yet provide many ways to play, which is a must for travel toys in my book... My only question... Do they handle hot temperatures?? We'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"No difference..","review":"I read so many reviews on Benderoos and Wikki Stix. I didn't know which ones to buy. One got more bad reviews than the other. I was not so concerned with the cost. I wanted the things to work! So I bought both. THEY ARE THE SAME. Both sticky, both bend, both don't dry out. I think I read that one has wire (like pipe cleaner) and one is yarn; NO. They are both the exact same product. Yarn covered in wax of some kind.. The kids love to create with it. It hasn't stained anything in my house so far. My advice is to go for the best price; not brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"good price and better than bendaroos","review":"We went to a local craft store to do a kids project and Wikki Stix were used. My son liked them so much that when done the project, I agreed to buy what they had on the store display ((thankful that I printed out 40% off coupon)) to help defray the store price.I priced this item elsewhere and even on the items website and Amazon has the best price for the big count box. My son was happy with the variety of colors that came in this box. Not limiting and he likes being creative.They actually are stickier and he likes them better than the bendaroos he got as a gift. so this is definitely a good find."},{"rating":"1","title":"This review is just FYI","review":"I bought this for my 10 year old girl who had smaller pack of stix. The sticks that she had were 10 inches long and 1/8 inch thick. The sticks in the box are 6 inches long and little thicker than 1/16 inches. The size of the box is misleading and the included sticks are disappointment if you wanted the bigger sticks.I gave this item low 2 stars because of the misleading packaging. I know, I should have read the item description. The thing is, I did read it twice, and both times I missed where it says sticks are 6 inches long. I am hoping that someone in my situation read the low ratings to get the full information. Otherwise, this is fun toy for hands-on, creative kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for tots","review":"We got this at a restaurant with the kids meals one night when my family was eating.They have been a life saver with my two year old!

This is not really for the beginner as much of it is IMO appreciated only after you've played the bass for a while. I'd say, if you've been playing for at least a year or so, go ahead and get it.

The front straps tend to want to fall off the smaller noodles but it did make a very comfortable chair for floating around in the pool. However by about day six seams were stretching open and one strap on one side broke off. The chair was still usable but it's life expectancy is now very limited.I don't expect much from a $15 item but I did expect more than a few hours use before it started to fall apart.

Even though she likes her job and Everett's ward, she makes hardly any argument when Everett talks about her giving all that up once they're married. I don't understand it.

Sometimes I even like the retelling better (Susan Kay's \\"Phantom\\" springs to mind). Not this time. All this book accomplished was to make me want to read \\"Jane Eyre\\" again. Basically, it's too close to the original; She has nothing new to say about it. Even the language is the same, which is a bad thing because it sounds stilted. Still, it wasn't too bad. I did read the whole thing. I just don't know why she bothered writing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak retelling","review":"I was intrigued when I first saw this book, but after reading it, I am only disappointed. The book was shallow and unengaging throughout. Shinn focuses on trite details, such as ensuring that all parallel characters have similar names, without bringing anything new or meaningful to the storyline. Oddly enough, she brings in \\"Janet Ayerson\\" as a foil for her heroine, Jenna Starborn. Janet Ayerson is kind, but weak and uninteresting. I can only interpret this as a criticism of the original Jane Eyre. What would cause Shinn to cast Charlotte Bronte's heroine in this light? Charlotte Bronte was a feminist before her time, and Bronte's heroine displays more strength and integrity than her hero. If you want to read Shinn, I would recommend \\"Heart of Gold\\" or \\"Summers at Castle Auburn.\\" Or better yet, read the original \\"Jane Eyre.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a sci-fi!","review":"This book is a romance with slight sci-fi overtones.

Eliza, the youngest of the two was born into slavery. As she gets older she earns the jealousness of Miss Abigail {Masters daughter}. Eliza has cream-colored skin and bright blue eyes.The setting of Send One Angel Down takes place on a cotton Plantation, in North Carolina. If you want other books like this book Schwartz has written are If I Just Had Two Wings, Drowning Ruth, Messenger, and Initiation.

The fact that they chose rabbits to represent Native American children, is racist in itself, Native Americans are people not animals. The book lumps ten different tribes into one. If a child picked up the book \\"Ten Little Rabbits\\" they would never know that there were different tribes portrayed. This book could be used as a learning experience for children teaching them about how they can be critical readers. In order to do this it would be necessary to point out and discuss possible misconceptions and stereotypes that one could develop through reading this book.

I wish the video was longer; his shows are, I seem to recall, usually longer than this, so I'd guess they left some songs out for some reason. I also wish the set list was a trifle different - this appears to be from the tour for The Road To Ensenada, so a few more songs from that excellent record would have been good. (Those are probably the songs that were lopped off the shorten the video.) Also, there are some odd errors on the packaging - some of the song titles are wrong, and Rickie Lee Jones' name is misspelled - but that doesn't detract from the video, of course. All in all, though, this is as good a representation of Lyle in concert as you'll find on DVD. Very cool stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyle's My Guy","review":"I adore him.

It is about an hour and 15 minutes long, so the pilot must have been a TV movie back in the day. I enjoyed my nostalgic trip enough to go back and buy the whole season, so now I'm working my way through the other episodes. The show was cheesy at times, but it's fun to remember what sci-fi television was like back in the day.

It is written by an experienced teacher, for teachers, and includes not only the relevant research but many suggestions and examples for implementing the results of the educational and cognitive research.I am a long-time college teacher of engineering technology and now researching in engineering education. I was \\"turned-on\\" to this book by a doctoral student in physics education and am very, very grateful to him for that.

It was strange to hear all those start stops and drum machine beats but then something happened....that drum machine is actually the very human Matt Datesman and it may sound like he has 8 arms but he just has the standard two. Those bass lines begin to sound like everyday things ( the purr of an engine in first gear) and Mark's string by string chiming is magical.

But Nick and Octavia never came alive like the Madison men and Harte women of the previous books. JAK continues her wonderful cast of secondary characters, human and non (especially Winston who she portrays so strikingly in just a few sentences that he becomes a major figure). However, even the two family patriarchs lost some of the punch of the earlier books. Did JAK lose interest in this group? After foreshadowing the main characters in the earlier stories, did she find they didn't work out as planned?

It's a comprehensive and reasonably interesting look at his life, broken into short thematic segments.Hard core fans looking for something beyond \\"I. Asimov\\" may want to try Asimov's first two volumes of autobiography -- \\"In Memory Yet Green\\" covers the years 1920-1954, and \\"In Joy Still Felt\\" covers 1954-1978.

Followed instructions on loading exactly. You have to move all of the film from the canister to the camera and as you shoot, it draws it back into canister. Loaded film, closed back. Started to crank the film into the camera, and the crank BROKE OFF! Tried to roll the film into the camera with a pen point used as a crank. Didn't work. Threw the entire camera away!

We could get it set up and started, but then after taking the first picture and winding to the next one, the camera would roll the film back into itself like when done with the roll and rewinding it.

First of all, everything about the camera is manual. Loading the film, remembering to rewind before opening the rear of the camera etc. It took me a while to figure it out. And by the way, I did expose one roll that had my diving pictures. Since it happened in dimly lit room, I still got some pictures.2. Having a flash was a plus but isnt a huge improvement.

It didnt capture the colors or the detail.Overall it wasnt much of an improvement over a disposable camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed.","review":"We used this camera on our honeymoon in St. Thomas. We shot two rolls of film and don't have a single photo to show for it. We picked the (expected) photos up at Rite Aid today and received only blank negatives. Very disappointed. Also, we found it difficult to find a place that still develops film; we went to four places and then still had to mail it out, with a two week return time.

The long trips to prison, the attempt to maintain a long distance relationship, the prison's unannounced, arbitrary transfers of her husband thousands of miles away. Through it all, both Lourdes and her husband determined not to give in to the madness, but to work to reform this arbitrary prison system--he from the inside, her by organizing other family members.This choice caused both some pain.

Jooshud never buy.Fo'shizzle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"The maps were all very helpful, and the detail on doing the puzzles in the more complicated extra areas was great. The best part of the guide was in the list of Pokemon in the back that was extensive, with what moves were learned at what levels, evolutions, egg-evolutions, etc, including Pokemon from all the other games.The major drawback to the guide though was that only the major trainers--like the rival and the gym-leaders--had Pokemon lists. Even the big battles--like with the boss of Team Rocket--just had a sentence to help you along. There were also no lists of Pokemon for an area, so I had to find those myself to make sure I picked up the rare ones you don't immediately find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but $15?","review":"There's a great deal of useful information in this book. I wound up feeling ripped off in the end though because there are MANY very important secrets that are not revealed in here. You can find more from online walkthrus than you can from buying this book at times, and for the money, well that's just not right. My combined cost for both items is such that I ended up feeling like I have to live in New York to get the complete game with yet another pokemon I can't get unless team Nintendo graces my city with its presence. I also have to be available that one day, if it ever comes again. Much about being a Pokemon fan is fun, but there is alot of tedium as well. Buy it if you like the visual aids as the maps are pretty good. The Pokedex has nice detail as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad, not very good either","review":"Yes, this guide is good and is absolutely necessary if you don't wanna have to use an Internet walkthrough. The reason i bought this is because the offical Pokemon Emerald Walkthrough didnt have coverage on the f/r and l/g pokemon and because I had recently bought Pokemon Fire Red. The cons of this book are:The pages started falling out after a few weeks of carefull and responsible use of it, spelling mistakes are present but not as common as in the Pokemon Emerald book plus the Emerald books smaller! It doesn't say how to get: Celebi, Lugia, Mew, or Deoxys, what a rip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I do not have it , friend has it .

Amazon's description is misleading about some of the titles only being available on CD through this box set. Aside from the few bonus tracks, the only thing noteworthy in this collection is that \\"When Lights Are Low\\" is finally available on CD. Maybe we'll have to wait for Tony's 90th before some of his other albums from that period see the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This is a disappointing release and offers little that is new to the dedicated collector, even \\"When Lights Are Low\\" has had a previous CD release in Japan on Sony CSCS 5242 - we really need a release of the albums not on CD !"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love it!!","review":"I love to play this game with my mom and 4-year-old brother.

The Matrix Tuner SR 1050 has been a great help in my quest to a personal best.Unlike previous tuners that have a needle waving back and forth, this unit will listen to a tone and tell you with red and green leds, what key, and if sharp or flat and dead on the note.

Very much an essential accessory for musicians or musical instrument hobby builders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trudy, madly dreadful","review":"A very disappointing film and, having watched it, find the praise of the other reviewers unbelievable. Campbell is attractive enough to watch but that is about it. The acting is wooden across the board, the character development is woeful and none of the individuals seems more than one dimensional. Finally who wrote the script? So full of holes in terms of logic and believability that you could drive a coach and horses through it.

This movie shows how much Behr has blossomed as an actor (since smaller rolls in 7th Heaven).Victor Salva is to be highly praised for directing this masterpiece. He carved his nitch when he directed the controversial film Powder (people even boycotted the movie!). Rites of Passage shows just how much he's grown.I only wonder why when it was on the big screen it wasn't given more publicity. It's disappointing to me that people are so petrified of controversial issues. Jason Behr and the entire cast deserve much more recognition for Rites of Passage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Lessons","review":"This is a film driven by characters. These are characters we like, hate, identify with; at at times wish we didn't. The action or suspense of the film don't drive the story, but the relationship between father and son does. Dean Stockwell and Jason Behr play their roles to perfection, and what this movie does is make neither one of them the bad guy. Both have said and done things that they wish to take back. But the point of the movie is that you don't take those things back. What you do is accept them, deal with them, and move on; that is how the healing process begins.I think this is a great film and one that should be watched by both fathers and sons. I highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good---just kind of there","review":"I dunno - call me a cynic, but does every film about gay people just automatically get considered \\"a great film\\"?? In the case of Rite of Passage, I tend to wonder if viewers are just soooo starved for gay subject matter that anything will pass.The movies isn't horrible - it's just not great. It moves rather slow, the product value is fair at best, and the plot is rather uninteresting. There is the requisit gay son/hard nosed father theme, the hopeless romantic theme, the accepting brother, etc. They all are there---but the problem is, most viewers will just say \\"who cares\\".I found that no matter how much I wanted to love htis movie, it was just something to watch on a Saturday night. Don't get your hopes up. If you are looking for your next meaning of life gay film--this one probably isn't it. If you collect every video or DVD where there is a gay plot--well, I guess here's another one for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good independent film","review":"thoughtful and provocative. More than I expected and some good performances and plot. I bought it on the strength of wanting to see something more recent by Jason Behr than Roswell. He does a great job. I also like Dean Stockwell's performance and the \\"villan\\" (forgot name, sorry), who do excellent jobs. It is great to see a good film that is not a big hollywood budget type, but not plodding like some trying to send a big message about something. I liked the commentary that highlighted some good points about the performances and issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, more of the best.","review":"Though my literary skills are not that great, I know what I like and 'Becoming a Cliche' is awesome.

Both books go hand in hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot recommend","review":"Perhaps this workbook is somewhat effective when used in a class, less so on one's own. Pattison's writing here is weak and frequently unclear, as if he did tossed this one off too quickly. Worse, the song examples he uses are far too often poor quality lyric writing themselves. Count the imperfect rhymes alone!Too poorly written for the novice to follow, too frustrating for the experienced lyricist, and way too encouraging of mediocrity by example.

I remember getting this game for christmas after playing the demo on a pizza hut demo disc. My two brothers and I have spent so many hours of our lives playing it together, as three player PSX games could be hard to come by. This game is 5 players. Is that even possible? The multiplayer aspect of this game is just so addicting. Coming back to it years later now makes it even better. My brothers and I invite people over to play this and our friends cannot believe how unbelievably fun this is. The japanese voices and animations in this are also very entertaining. A truly great game for all ages, races, and species.

It was released as a budget title ($20 new on first day of release), and was delayed a few times right before its release, probably over a few quality issues. The AI was just plain terrible from what I remember. I spent too much time watching the computer AI hide from each other while I sat and waited time to run out if I had already died. For the same price or cheaper, just get Bomberman Generations for the Game Cube (get a Game Cube since they are so cheap now) which has very good multi-player, good AI, lots of differnet levels, more fun items (dangerout bomb -- like a little atomic bomb)."},{"rating":"2","title":"cucumber melon","review":"Me and my girls really enjoy the product the smell is very fresh smelling!

Too many artists and albums in this book were given poor ratings- the critics saying that so is so is worthless even though another album guide would rate them as being fairly decent. If other album guides gave an album a poor rating at least they tried to be more objective about it and give a good reason why.

At least the Taliesan Orchestra's Enya tribute tried to do something different and interesting with her music.

Fun and adventure happens when they use the charm and when they forget its secret. Their lives and the lives of those they love are made much better. When the book is finished, the reader smiles and wishes there were more. There are more books in the series, but this one is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to get ONE more thing straight...","review":"Sorry.

I tend to agree - Chaka comes across like a less than smooth, poor man's version of Natalie Cole on this DVD. Her voice is OK in the lower register but it turns into a flat screechy monotone when she aims a bit higher. Her band is excellent and without them it would all be a total loss.

My wife gave me a crazed look when she discovered I paid over $200 for an item you can get at discount stores for under $50 or pick up at most garage sales for under $10. After a dozen or so bounces on the Needak model, however, she noticed a big difference in the quality and feel over less sturdy models. She quickly announced that this was something that she was going to enjoy and use regularly. The folding feature is handy for transport or storage and I have no concerns about stability. There is a tradeoff for the convenience, however. The legs on the folding model do \\"wobble\\" up to 1/4 of an inch in all directions.

If you're looking for strictly \\"indigenous sound,\\" search elsewhere. However, if you're keen on instruments and songs of the South Pacific augmented by washes of guitar and treated with studio effects, this is the album for you. George Telek effectively marries the traditional music of his native Papua New Guinea with Western pop influences. The result is surprisingly warm and earthy, and the rock trappings don't detract from the beautiful harmonies and interesting acoustic percussion that make Telek unique. This album is smartly-orchestrated global pop, in the proud tradition of albums like Geoffrey Oryema's \\"Beat the Border.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Product leaks","review":"Took two pump bottles on a camping trip in the Sierras and they leaked terrible!

I was able to make the battery switch quick and did not lose what was stored on the machine. Two things I wish it had are 1) a pause button so you could stop in the middle of a long message.

Some of the prayers are still nice, but very personal. However, it is not the right thing to just read as a personal devotional either. The prayers are sorted by topics, though. Another thing I did not like is that the print almost appears to be scanned images rather than set print. It appears unclear, like photocopies in the old days. It is not pleasant for the eye to read.

The ones I recall being my favorite were the ones with Porky Pig that had spooky themes. Where am I going with this? Just to say these wonderful episodes are NOT on this video. They simply take excerpts from some of those cartoon, link them together with some newer, poorer animation, and give you a very unsatisfactory sampling of what is out there.

Not only did they chop up the old ones and add crummy new animation (Bugs Bunny looks like a saber-toothed rabbit in most of them), they changed the great vampire voice to the witch's, in order to connect it with a weak storyline.In short, don't waste your time or money - even as a rental!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Dissapointment","review":"I have long looked for a collection of Loony Tunes that have a Halloween theme.

Keep your pegs from turning too easily. My violin travels with me and is exposed to a lot of vibration, so it always needs tuning, but with these peg drops the pegs do not slip like before. I know it would be better to have the pegs turned and the peg holes re-reamed for a better fit. But that takes time and you need to get to a good violin shop to have it done right. These peg drops will help with slipping pegs untill the proper fit can be acheived. Infact they work so well I may never get my pegs re-fitted. A must for every vioin, viola or cello case. One bottle should be a lifetime suppply. I've used these drops on my Celo too. The only improvement that could be made is to sell it in smaller bottles.

As soon as I place the drops as recommended and placed the pegs as before; I notice an immediate response.The pegs were somewhat difficult to move, and it was just what I needed. I tuned my violin and semi violently tapped the pegs several times and tested how much were they off tune. Not one bit! Love it.

I haven't had a chance to use it just in its capacity as a torch, but I have used the heat-gun attachment on some shrinkwrap and it worked just as expected. So far I've only found one drawback of the device when it's being used as a soldering iron: there's a small port on the side that shoots out hot air (for exhaust, I believe).

First of all, filling the torch with butane is problematic and messy; about half the fuel makes it into the unit and the other half everywhere else. Then when it does stay lit for any appreciable length of time (which isn't regularly), it self-extinguishes when held at certain angles. I worked and worked with it and tried every conceivable thing to make it operate better, short of taking it apart, but to no avail.

I subsequently purchased the Blazer torch for silver soldering, which uses the much better triple-filtered butane fuel.

Cohen really mis leads people in a big way. This year he says this, last year he said the opposite. It depends on his mood I suppose. sometimes he is into the non duality stuff. Other times he is into re-incarnation /soul theory. It also depends on who he is with. He changes faster than the wind. This guy really is the worst of the worst. If you follow his teachings then you will find as others have found, you really are wasting your time and money.

So we opened the other one and got a good reading -- for a few minutes before it started showing HH and hasnt worked since. Maybe they changed it or something but both of these were total junk. I will definitely avoid these and search for a more robust brand.In case any manufacturers actually read these -- how about making at least one quality model?

It really takes the guess work out of cooking meats and allows me to socialize when I have guests instead of constantly checking the oven. I've found it to be extremely accurate and it has held up well even in high temperatures. My is with using the factory installed settings. They are way too high. For example, on the beef setting, it says rare is 140 degrees, when it should be 120-125 degrees. I think there's a way to set your own temperature, but it's not intuitive and so I just keep an eye on the internal readings. For those who have problems with incorrect readings, make sure that the probe is inserted in the middle of the meat and not against any bones.

Ultra-Fail.This thing makes a horrible, long beeping noise when it turns on.It's also not an option to not 'choose' a meat to cook.

The buttons don't respond, they stay stuck on one reading and only turn off or on. It's not the batteries.

If you want to also be alerted when your milk cools to the right temp, this model won't do it. That said, still find it handy and much better and easier to use than a non-digital thermometer.I've also used it once in the oven for roasting a chicken. I thought the recommended temp of 180 cooked the bird a little too long (I put the probe horizontally through the breast), so next time I will manually set the temp to 160 and see how that turns out.I've only used it 3 times total over a course of a few weeks, so no comment yet on its durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Accurate.

The forced presets are all overcooked. For example \\"rare\\" beef is 145F. This is at least 10F too high and after a 30 minute rest before carving the meat will be well done plus.

I returned it to Amazon (gotta love their return policy!) and ordered another unit, assuming the first one was a fluke. Wrong. The second one also failed to work properly from day one.

Imagining everything in flames I opened the oven to find nothing wrong and the standard thermometer I've had forever reading 155*.After reading some other reviews this just seems like it's a faulty device.

And this unit accomplished that just fine, chirping when the desired temperature is reached.The reason I bought this was to monitor temperatures without opening the oven door, pure and simple. And that's what it does -- but only for about 12 roastings, in my case, before it stopped giving an accurate reading. And not just slightly off, but wildly wrong. Busted.

It takes all the guess work out of cooking roasts. It's also replaced my egg-timer as my primary kitchen timer. The alarm is loud and constant; I have no problem hearing it from anywhere in my (admittedly not very big) home. I also love the fact that it has both a flip-out stand for putting it on the counter, and a magnet for sticking it to the fridge (or anything else suitably stickable).My one complaint is that learning to use the thing took a little while. The buttons and controls are less than intuitive. Switching between modes, making sure the alarm is set, and getting it to let you set specific temperatures (rather than sticking to the FDA-approved meat doneness settings), all take a little finagling. If you're relatively gadget-savvy it probably won't be an issue.

For the most part, the writing is fairly well done for such a film, though some elements feel a bit contrived.The acting is surprisingly well done. Sean Astin pulls off the role as a socially awkward time travel researcher. Vinnie Jones works well as the sometimes menacing and sometimes lighthearted bank robber.This movie keeps pace nicely and has some nice action sequences thrown in. The two bank shootouts are done interestingly, and the plane crash at the end was pretty cool.I also really liked the soundtrack by Rob Lord. The music is matched with the scenes very well.This is a good movie. It gives a perspective on time travel different from so many time travel movies out there, with entertaining characters and an easy to understand (if open ended) plot.

Wow, did the filmmakers ever bother to take any courses in physics while they were in High School? I guess not!Nor was there a single character I could empathize with!

They named her \\"Sally\\" & she had no problems physically, she could pull a plow just as well as her parents.

I was expecting a good murder mystery wrapped in tightly written, funny sci-fi insider jokes. I got a grammatically correct novel with weak, unengaging characterizations, unworkable murder plot & plot resolution, and only a very, very thin scattering of humor aimed at things only sci-fi insiders would understand.This book was written for the sci-fi OUTSIDER, laughing WITH the outsider, not embracing the insider fans & trade.So, if you're a sci-fi fan, or looking for an engaging murder mystery, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Read this book in public :-) I have had so many friends try and steal this book from me to find out why I'm giggling.

The characters are one dimensional and not quite believable, especially the con goers.It is interesting that the book is so dated. For example, one of the characters talks about how he leaves messages in a file on a server at the University where the person he is sending the message to can log on and read it. In the 11 years since the book was written email has become so much a part of life that the whole talk sounds like Mr. Burns on the Simpsons raving about \\"this so-called iced cream\\".I was also unimpressed with the author's humorous timing. There were a couple of genuine chuckles in the book but there were several places where a funny gag is ruined because the author grinds it into the ground by spelling out the humor for us in detail.All in all a pretty disappointing and forgettable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jacquiline Kirby, You Have Nothing To Worry About!","review":"I bought this book ( on Kindle ) because a reviewer or two had compared it as a spoof to Elizabeth Peters' book DIE FOR LOVE, which I found hilarious.

Not only didn't I laugh out loud, there was not even a gigglee. The Star Trek wedding was mildly amusing, as was some of the fan geekdom, but the mystery was so transparent that I was able to pick out the murderer before the murder was committed, despite the fact that my Kindle version lacked the back flap or blurb or whatever it was that other readers said gave them their clue to the murderer's identity! Jacquiline Kirby, you have nothing to worry about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't laugh until I hurt.","review":"I hated this book. SM has some serious hang-ups to overcome, because everything she said about fandom, while true, was in the worst possible light at the most extreme. Her consistent haranguing about obesity, her complete disrespect for both fans and authors, her extremely negative mentions of homosexuality and, moreover, the plot that I solved BEFORE the murder was committed (and I am singularly awful at solving plots) made this the worst book I have read in ages.Watch you some Galaxy Quest, Sharyn McCrumb, and get over your bitterness. Whatever fandom did to you, move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny!","review":"If you've never been to a science fiction convention that's all right, you'll still laugh your way through this fun murder mystery. If you have been to a sci fi con, you're going to die laughing. Sharyn McCrumb did a wonderful job capturing the flavor of the sci fi crowd with the gamers and the Star Trek weddings and the costumes and the filking (folk songs with sci-fi lyrics).

I agree with the reviewer who found the characters to be one-dimensional. While, perhaps, the plot itself was not entirely devoid of creative thought, the most disappointing aspect to this book lies in the manner in which the author weaved the influence of God/Christ in the main character's evolution. It seemed that he wrote the book in its entirety then later added a paragraph or sentence here and there to make it a Christian work. Not only are the references to Christianity/faith/God minimal, they are far too simplistic as well. In summary, I read the book but won't be reading its sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!!","review":"This tape does NOT contain the famous, Academy Award nominee \\"Nelly's Folly\\" as Amazon claims in its editorial.

The protagonist seemed to be floating along a scenic river that was going at a comfortable pace toward a destination of his own choosing. Everything fell into place to provide him with the exact experience he sought from the beginning. To me, the protagonist should have some surprises & difficulties along the way, challenges to overcome, life changing decisions to make. The (protagonist) character should undergo some metamorphisis based upon discoveries and the effect of new experiences and reactions to previously unknown sensations. The crossdressing came entirely too easy for him. It should have been devistating to go out in public like that at least for the first time, whether or not he came to like it later. Maybe if I'd finished it, these things would have come about. I may yet pick it up again and give it another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto","review":"The September 19, 2001 reviewer has it exactly right. There is not enough dramatic tension in this book, which I also found to be the case with Scott's Travels with a Whip.

The characters were well cast, superbly acted and the plot cleverly formed, as if it were the documentary of a real guitarist.One of the biggest stars of the movie is the music! If you like guitar music \\"Sweet and Lowdown\\" is a must! We bought the soundtrack CD right after seeing the DVD. No mention is made, in any review I've seen, of Henry Aldren ... the guitarist who did the actual guitar solos supposedly done by Sean Penn as Emmett Ray. His technique is awesome. The styles are fashioned after that of Django Rheinhart but Aldren's talent is still there and the music is wonderful.I intend seeing this movie several times before I tire of it. And the music I'll probably never get tired of hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular...","review":"My favorite movie. In my opinion, Woody Allen's best. Highly entertaining for jazz lovers, Sean Penn fans, guitarists, musicians of all sorts, Woody Allen fans, non-Woody Allen fans, film buffs, and pretty much anyone who likes to have a good laugh. Sean Penn plays the typical jerk musician- and if you know any musicians yourself, you may recognize some of the eccentricites. Samantha Morton plays a not-too-bright mute, brilliantly.

They should have removed the strings and have him lipsynching the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot concentrate","review":"In the original Sweet and Lowdown web site, it was mentioned that Sean Penn learn thirty-some songs for this movie. Prior to making this movie, he never played guitar.I actually looked forward to seeing amazing guitar-playing, and wanted to see the results of hard work and practices. Alas, that's not to be. The playing was lousy at best, and, of course, most of the scenes of playing were spent on an enlarged view of Penn's visage.It saddens me much because, since movies like \\"Amadeus\\" and \\"Shine\\", I expect impeccable playing. Even in \\"Red Violin\\" most playing were done very well except for Sylvia Chang's part (sign). And this bad playing bit (really that bad) just ruins my appetite, however good the story is.I guess this only applies to fuzzy musicians like myself. But it also baffles me since Allen is also a musician. Even Johnny Depp could have been better-suited for this role since he plays decent guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good film, bad dvd","review":"This is a crippled dvd edition of a great movie.

I can take some of his movies, but only the ones that aren't so obviously and directly vehicles for him to exorcise his neuroses and insecurities. That said, I LOVED this movie, and recommend it highly. The music, along with the sets and the cinematography were beautiful and idyllic depression-era Americana. Every shot was obviously well thought out, and perfect. On top of this, the story was simple, progressed at a nice pace, and had a nice bittersweet (but not quite tragic) ending.

I recently started a diet where I can only eat egg whites. It seems such a waste to throw out the yolks, not to mention the mess of separating the eggs. I use these mostly for baking and to add protein when cooking other foods. Adding the powder has saved me a lot of time preparing the diet foods. The powdered egg whites do have an \\"eggy\\" odor and have a slight aftertaste which is easily overcome by adding vanilla or other extracts when making protein shakes or other sweets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sodium Laurel Sulfate -- WHY!?","review":"They put in Sodium Laurel Sulfate -- WHY!?.

He also explains various sailing techniques, such as docking, anchoring, tacking and gybing. Various knots are demonstrated as well. There are very attractive and useful illustrations throughout, which make the book very entertaining and accessable. My favorite part of the book is the 2 page spread showing various rigs.

Since it's McCrumb, there is the obligatory murder, and stuff happens. It's pretty amusing. While it's not quite the hysterical level of Bimbos of the Death Sun, it's both silly and ironic. Again, it gives a good skewering of SF mores, something that never gets as much as it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much TVA Info","review":"I have a different viewpoint than the other 2-star reviewer. I feel that \\"Bimbos\\" is a better read. \\"Gene Pool\\" had too much information on the TVA flooding of the area. If I wanted that type of information, I would read a nonfiction book. When I read \\"Bimbos\\" I actually laughed out loud at some points. This book is tedious because of the all the unnecessary back story and history. Once again, as in \\"Bimbos\\", there are a great many characters to keep track of. I listened to these books on DVD rather than read them and trying to keep track of all characters is difficult at first. It may be easier when reading these stories.Once again, the actual \\"mystery\\" is secondary to the story, but that's okay; there's enough to keep the reader busy."},{"rating":"1","title":"None Too Thrilling But Still Better Than \\"Bimbos...\\"","review":"I bought these books because of their amusing titles, but the storylines just don't deliver.

I was told it was suppossed to be new start for, a chance to get into something a little more serious. I wouldn't agree with that though. The film still contained characters like Jay and Silent Bob and had his usual cast of actors, Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, too. The movie was a rather refreshing look at religion though. It even made me, an atheist, a little curious, for about 5 minutes. Overal, I would recommend this to anyone who likes Kevin's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I thought that the entire DVD package was great, but there was one small problem. In the director's commentary about the movie, and the deleted scenes, Kevin Smith kept talking about a commercial that was supposed to be produced and inserted into the movie, but it was cut for time.

Well i was wrong, let me tell you. This movie was a boring and vapid \\"exploration\\" of religion. It's crude humor was annoying, and the acting was not as good as Smith's previous films. This films takes shots at organized religion, and that's okay, but , Smith could have done a better job with the quality of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever?","review":"I think what bothered me most about this movie was that it thought it had something intelligent to say. Unfortunately a more cogent argument against religious dogma could be formulated by a 4 year old. And then there's the script. Was this a first draft? The acting was also horrendous, with incredibly annoying performances by Rock, Damon, and Affleck, but with a script like this that was inevitable. In short, do not pay money to see this garbage! Kevin Smith is a one trick pony and needs to stick to stories involving New Jersey and convenience stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't anybody get an attack on religious doctrine right?","review":"While Kevin Smith does an adequite job in steeping the movie with religious dogma (and for the most part keeping it legitimate) he loses himself somewhere along the plot line and turns what would be a thought provoking look at church doctrine and turns the movie into something reminiscent of a Zucker brothers movie (complete with uninspired fart jokes.) Keep it mindless or keep it serious but the schitzophrenic nature of this film does not do justice to the brilliant ideas Smith introduces to us in the beginning of the film. I give this film one star because as a huge fan of Kevin Smith, I really hoped he could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't decide what it wants to be","review":"This movie is all over the place. It can't decide whether it wants to be Time Bandits or The Prophecy. Silly humor is mixed with horrible violence and serious themes in a way that can only be described as........puzzling? There are two possible movies here, and they just couldn't decide which one to make. I was not offended at all, but merely bemused at the complete incompetence of the people who made this, when I wasn't bored to tears that is. I have to go back to Dune to find an equally poor offering. My greatest fear was the the movie itself was going to go on for eternity. I found myself rooting for the bad guys to end all existance. Do yourself a favor and avoid it. I'm sure you can all find better things to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most WORDY movie I've ever seen!","review":"I thought 'Clerks' was somewhat a charming, if poorly acted, first film. Realistic setting with OK dialogue.... got a laugh out of Silent Bob, so I figured that 'Dogma' would be a nice leap forward for Smith with its big-name stars and what-not. Turns out that this guy released the single most WORDY film I've ever sat through. It's like listening to anything off of Springsteen's first two albums where he crams in about 200 words per verse (\\"Blinded by the Light\\")Suffering from aural fatigue after viewing this film, I high-tailed it to an abandnoded campground in upstate New York and entered into a vow of silence for one week. No words spoken, none heard. I was tired of the words that every character in 'Dogma' had to constantly utter whenever they were on screen.

It starts out as a light hearted comedy about two angels who were kicked out of Heaven but have now found a loop hole to get back in.

In one scene the characters appear to throw religion out the window in the interest of good-natured, irreverant fun, until all of it comes to a screeching halt, and the viewers find themselves suffering through sudden moments of sobriety in which either Matt Damon or his bland side-kick, Ben deliver their own silly attempts at homiletics.Don't waste your money. Pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time... BORING and ANNOYING","review":"This has to be the worst DVD I ever bought! Not only was the movie boring, but it was also quite annoying due to the extremely terrible acting -- Ben Affleck and Matt Damen needed to be smacked for their horrid performances in this film. The only characters that manage to draw any giggles or smiles at all were Jay and Silent Bob, but well... that's been done before already, and it's just not enought to carry the whole movie.

I don't mean that in an illiterate sense, I mean it drags on longer than a crucifixion! Kevin Smith must've took the good reviews of CHASING AMY (A really GOOD film) and put his word processor on overdrive typing the script!

Now, they release another version a year later with extra features hanging out of the package?

Check it out,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!","review":"I can certainly understand why some people wouldn't like this film. Taken at face value, it is a rude and crude comedy. Going one layer deeper, it is an unsubtle attack on organized religion. However, if you were lucky (or unlucky) enough to have been raised as a Catholic, this movie is an absolute must-see. The film runs like a continual inside joke. It cranks out constant humor at the expense of the church, but at the same time validates the church's teachings. It is the mad-magazine version of the 6th-grade catechism; the national lampoon version of the stations of the cross. Yes, there is a lot of profanity and some of it comes across as gratuitous. But if you can put that aside, this movie provides a very moral tale not so different than the ones that Sister Barnabus used to tell in grade school - but a lot more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOGM,A","review":"If there is any \\"film\\" I would recommend this year I would have to definatley recommend 'DOGMA'. I have been a long time fan of Kevin Smiths' work and this is one of his finest. (Kudos to him and everyone accoiated with this fine piece of work.) 'DOGMA' is not a blasphest film, it is a fanasty and a film on questioning faith itself. I still have no idea how people could protest to this film. DOGMA opens up aspects to religion and really makes a fanasty that revolves around faith, and if people still see it and find it offensive (which I don't how) remember: It is only a movie! After the controversey of DOGMA Kevin Smith stated: 'I respect your ways; why can't you do the same for me?' I close on BUY THIS FILM!

Were those hopes met? NO WAY. I really can't imagine anyone enjoying this movie. It's a \\"dark comedy\\" as the two creators would like to think. But Dark Comedies usually are intelligent and thought provoking, if not always entertaining. This movie is simplistic and wraught with poor performances. From the creators of the MALLRATS and CLERKS, I expected better. All they could get out of great talents such as Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock, and to a lesser degree Ben Affleck and Matt Damon is a monotonal emotionless walk-through of the script.This movie is the BOMB...er I mean A BOMB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"It's truly a terrible movie. All it is is an excuse to bash organized religion. There is a reason that it bombed at the box office. The movie flat out stinks. Avoid it like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk!","review":"I guess maybe, with only a PhD, I'm not sophisticated enough. Reading the other reviews, I get the impression that I should have been paying attention to the hidden, deeper message of this movie. All that apparently went right over my head. I couldn't get past the incessant use of the F-word, and the concept of prophets of God whose main goal is to get a blow job. I found myself amazed that actors with the credentials of Damon and Affleck would allow themselves to be associated with such junk. I don't know the other actors (who seemed to be familiar to other reviewers), nor do I know the director. What I know now is whose works to avoid in the future.Jack"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not groundbreaking, just kind of stupid","review":"I read a bunch of reviews on this site claiming this movie showed a comical look at \\"organized religion.\\" As a catholic, I thought I'd see the movie and , hey guess what? The only things they really made fun of were sterotypes of catholicism. Apparently, the other religions are perfect in every single way, and catholicism has no real place in today's culture, as the movie suggests.The movie, despite it's arrogant views, does offer its moments where it is pretty funny (The scenes with the voice of god come to mind).Overall, I feel this movie would have been a lot better if it simply didn't pick on stereotypes of catholicism, and actually addressed the issues that the movie tries to put forth."},{"rating":"1","title":"thats for jay and silent bob","review":"ok so i have only seen this and jay and silent bob strike back. i liked jay and silent bob always will since i own jay and silent bob strike back. i would never buy this unless it was for pure idiocity. the story took me nowhere. this disses god. im a very religious person. i did not get this movie. its that hard to understand. i had to watch it twice to give it 2 stars. ok im a huge fan of kevin smith though. hey why else would i rent mallrats and clerks."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I Do Believe In This\\"","review":"Even though there is a disclaimer at the beginning of this film, I didn't find the film as offensive as I thought I would. As a matter of fact, I didn't find it offensive at all. This is entire film is in good humor and there are many laughs to be had in this movie! Jay and Silent Bob make the film when they are on, but there are many other characters just as funny.Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Alank Rickman, Chris Rock, Jason Lee and all of the others come through and make the characters they play really come to life and be believable. Ben and Matt are great as the two angels killing those they say are sinners to bring the fear of God back into peoples lives. Alan is great as the angel who isn't allowed to drink, even though he isn't on that much, he's really cool. Everyone is great! Overall, this movie is really worth seeing if you are a fan of Kevin Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogma Rules","review":"This film is a sick but strangely amusing combination of religon, black humour and the f*&kin strangest cast ever to work together.The film is very funny and will definitely irritate all those religous freaks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie of 1999 (after Being John Malkovich)","review":"Dogma seems to evoke either love or hate from those who saw it. I for one LOVED it -- thought it was not only a brilliant satire on organized religion but a well-cast, well-acted, hilarious romp that never failed to please. Most of my friends also thought it was fabulous, though a couple of them hated it. I cannot see why. Like so many movies in the second half of 1999 (BJM, Election, Blair Witch, American Beauty, Magnolia, Three Kings), this film was overflowing with originality. We need more films like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"George Carlin and many other famous faces in rare form!","review":"In this review, I just want to briefly point out what appears to be a very amusing anomaly in the repertoire of George Carlin... HE ISN'T SWEARING/CURSING!!! in every stand-up routine of his that I've seen, he spouts foul language in every other sentence. his performance here is extra good just because of his eerie lack of profanity alone, let alone all of the other marvelous gems, especially when you take into consideration that most of the other characters are swearing like proverbial sailors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Supernatural Hit!","review":"This is one original script! It makes you think while it makes you laugh. The director is a genius and the cast is one of a kind.Even though the film criticized the catholic relgion, a lot of the stuff they said was true. And what I like about the film is that they did not question the existence of God; it talked about faith and how we lose it. The movie is extremely funny; I was laughing out loud throughout the whole thing. I'm sure that God has a sense of humor, and I'm sure he'd laugh if he saw this.Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Linda Fiorentino, and Chris Rock were all great. But the real treat in this film was the beautiful Salma Hayek; she practically stole the spotlight.Indeed, a controversial film, but the important thing to remember is this: it is just a film. A must-see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"God idea poorly executed","review":"I liked the idea of Angels falling out with each other etc, but I found the film to be extremely patronising as it wore on. I think the film needed more mystery - instead we had Chris Rock and Salma Hayek explaining a muddled version of what we should be believing in. It did make me laugh (Rock espec), but Matt Damon seems to be empty, and unlikeable. It got very cheesy in the closing seqence too. Worth seeing for the Hayek stripping scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Catholic's Worst Nightmare!","review":"I will admit that I am a Catholic. A devoted one. But I must confess: I thought \\"Dogma\\" was hilarious! It goes against any beliefs Christians have, but you can't help but laugh! The story gets a bit confusing, but easy to follow: two fallen angels decide to end the world...Then an abortionist, who happens to be a relative of Christ, is called upon (along with a fowl-mouthed prophet and his silent partner)to stop them. Along the way, they run into angels making their living as strippers, a deadly monster made out of poo, and the two merciless fallen angels who are executing any sinners they come upon. Sounds interesting? It gets better. But, you'll have to rent the film to find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but the DVD lacks.","review":"This is another great film for Kevin Smith: funny, powerful and thought-provoking. I just think they should have gotten another company to make the DVD. All the other films on DVD are loaded with special features like commentary, behind-the-scenes films, and so on. All Dogma had was a trailer and a cast list. Big whoop. I suggest you save your money until they release some kind of Director's Cut edition or something like that. This movie was highly controversial; that fact that they don't treat it that way is an insult to the creators."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, an Intelligent Religious Joke","review":"I am a reasonably knowledgeable person when it comes to not only Christianity, but also Catholic doctrine. I myself am not Catholic, but I understand the meaning and idea behind the Dogmatic structure. This movie is incredibly funny, but it is also smart. Every joke and situation is, while no always plausible, but at least correct. Using Biblical references and actual Church policy, the movie uses what is real, and makes that the source of humor. If you like your comedy intelligent, this one is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Up In Public","review":"1. Dogma has a great script and an exceptionally talented cast including Alan Rickman, Linda Fiorentino, and Chris Rock.2. Dogma was directed by a devout Catholic named Kevin Smith who endured the trials of Job when it was found that this little fantasy was critical of THE CHURCH.3. Dogma is Smith's 4th movie. He had only a brief stint at a film school. Each movie's direction/production values have improved by leaps and bounds. He is lucky enough to be able to finance his projects while still learning his craft.4. Dogma, unlike most comedies, will actually make you think, even while you laugh.5. Smith deserves our support...he continues to improve, and his movies entertain and are full of witty dialogue, so why should we complain?6. Just by doing Clerks, he showed he had more cojones than all the fanboys out there.7. Dogma is occasionally pedantic, but mostly funny as hell.As I'm still growing up myself, I'll leave it there...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jay & Silent Bob to the rescue.","review":"There are a few really great things about Dogma - the dozens of references to other movies, Allen Rickman's role as the voice of God, Selma Hyack (I'd pay to watch her read from the phone book)and Chris Rock as Rufus. There are also a few plot holes and a few scenes (the campfire scene, for example) that should've been cut - Oh, and let's not forget the casting of God. All in all this film is still a great deal of fun(it helps to be a Kevin Smith fan)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long way from Clerks","review":"Jay and Silent Bob may be along for the ride, but this movie moves to new ground for Kevin Smith. Its dark, its thought-provoking and most of all its what we like to see from Smith.. its gutsy.The casting and effects are impressive, especially in contrast with Clerks. However, this is far from a Hollywood sell-out. Smith just takes things to a different level.If you are a Christian (especially Catholic) and easily offended, I honestly would suggest you steer clear of this. However, if you can step back and take a quirky irreverent view of the Christian faith, you may find this enjoyable.Overall, it may not be as strictly humorous as its predecessors (and it is far more violent), but it is definately worth your time. Whether you are a Kevin Smith fan or not, just enter it with a clean slate and an open mind and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I've seen this movie more times than I can count. As a lapsed Catholic, I appreciate the film's serious discussion of religious issues. The fact that Kevin Smith can integrate those discussions with such riotous humor is an admirable feat. The performances, from Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Jay Mewes, Jason Lee, Chris Rock, and others, are fantastic. (My only complaint: Linda Fiorentino is way too deadpan. On the DVD commentary Kevin Smith confesses he wishes he had cast Janeane Garofalo in the lead role; I wish he had, too!) If you are a religious person whose faith is not strong enough to withstand any challenges, by all means, avoid this movie. If, however, you've got an open mind, you'll find a lot to love here."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Clerks was excellent. Mallrats was okay. Chasing Amy was a little better than okay. Dogma Blew. I didn't even so much as crack one bit of laughter while I was watching this godawful piece of tripe. I was extremely let down. Even Chris Rock was dull. Something I once thought was an impossiblity. I recommend this to any insomniac for a sure-fire cure to their affliction. Mere words can't capture the essence of how putrid this movie was. For the love of humanity, please don't be foolish like myself and actually BUY this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ponderous and puerile","review":"this movie is boring, boring, boring. smith's flat satire lacks subtlety and grace and is redeemed (relatively speaking) only by its moments of ridiculous humor - a feces demon, horny jay, screeching chris rock et al.the damn thing isn't even offensive, except in the sense i paid for the rental.cheap shot? worthy target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asinine, Moronic, GenYr's will love it","review":"This should have been called 'DogFlop'. Not even 'cameos' by Carlin and Rock can help this smoldering pile of a movie. It literally accelerates into hyper-stupidity as it unfolds. Imagine a movie that portrays God as a female played by creepy, big-headed Alanis Morisette and maybe you'll waste your money on something else. I would rate it more at around five or six numbskulls if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea - Decent script - Poor execution","review":"I have to credit Kevin Smith with two things: having a keen witand an insightful mind. The idea behind this movie was incredible(like his other films), and really made you think about the thingsthat were force-fed to you as a youngster. Also, the script is better than Smith's previous efforts, but... The directing, once again is just awful... END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor humor, flawed theology, but suspenseful","review":"This movie tried to be three things at the same time:1) A rant against Catholicism. Here the movie failed. The writers obviously know nothing about Catholicism by their grossly inaccurate representation of what the Catholic Church professes.2) A comedy. Here the movie also failed. Despite a few humorous scenes, the movie was loaded with foul language, toilet humor, genital humor, and drug humor (although I know this kind of humor is appealing to so many moviegoers).3) A suspense/thriller. Here the movie succeeded. If one can check reality at the door, one can really enjoy watching Bethany, Rufus, Jay, and Silent Bob try to stop two angels from unmaking the world.The movie would have done better to stay on one or two of the above points. Instead, it bounced back and forth among the three. The fact that it only did well on one of them, and great performances by Linda Fiorentino & Alan Rickman, makes this a two-star movie (barely)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogma DVD","review":"Dogma is probably one of if not Kev's worst films.

The theme was one which could have been developed into a very funny film, but, sadly, relied upon foul language rather than good humor for its shock value.

Until I saw this show I thought nothing could offend me. This group of usually good actors crosses the line.

As I watched the first half-hour, I was waiting for something to be funny, and it just wasn't. I was felt like I was wasting my time, so I finally hit the stop button, as I couldnt bear to watch another minute of this snooze-fest. Believe me when I tell you that I find everything amusing, hell I even bust out laughing when watching Spongebob Squarepants. If you are a fan of Kevin Smiths films, please stay away from this one.

Is it 15-year-old stoners cheering the trashing of the Catholic church? This is the type of movie that a video game juvenile junky can watch and think they're experiencing a deep and weighty comedy. Instead, it's just smug and condescending. And not as funny as it thinks it is.Jay and Silent Bob have overstayed their welcome longer than Anna Nicole Smith. They're not exactly Abbott & Costello.

I laughed throughout the movie while thinking. It's refreshing that someone could write a wonderful movie like this and still make you think about religion. He doesn't really say that any religion is wrong so I don't understand what all that fuss was about. The actors he chose were perfect for their roles.

It isn't his funniest (that's Mallrats), nor does it boast the best dialogue of a Smith movie (that's Clerks, though not by much) but it does have the best plot, the best acting, and the most to say of any Kevin Smith movie. Only American Beauty was better in my book last year. If you like Kevin Smith, you should own this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"in heaven, there is no beer","review":"OK, this has got to be the most irreverent film since 'Life of Brian', and Smith even seems to be paying homage to this work in places. The placement of George Carlin, one of our favorite religious commentary/critic comics as a reformational cardianl was quite apropriate. Smith is taking advantage of the larger budget to pull in some star power, as well as Affleck and Damon's now famous/popular mugs. As such, the film loses the DIY sensibility and roughness of his previous works, and should really be considered a separate piece, not really following the same indie criteria of the 'New Jersey trilogy', although a few references to the previous movies sneak in.While I think that this is probably Smith's funniest film as a satire, I still think 'Chasing Amy' is the best of his 4 works for its combination of humor and tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good ideas that were very badly executed","review":"This movie is sort of a cross of \\"Rambo\\" and \\"Oh God!\\" Or something. The barbed commentary about organized religion was occasionally funny and occasionally thought-provoking. Unfortunately, neither happened with enough regularity to salvage this flick. The macchine-gun-blasting, head-exploding gratitious violence was repulsive, excessive, and largely irrelevant. I suppose teen-age types will find the abundant use of the F-word funny, but anybody over the age of 21 will probably find it stupid. There were scenes that seemed totally irrelevant to the plot, sometimes the dialog could not be understood, and in general the production and direction left a lot to be desired.George Carlin was good, as always, but that was the only true standout in the film.I give it 2 stars, for what it could have been but wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Kevin Smith fan, but I was left out of this one.","review":"I've always been a fan of Smith's movies. I was looking forward to seeing Dogma, especially curious around all the controversy. I wish I could say I was offended, but instead, I just didn't get it nor think it was funny. It was just one run on sentace of a joke that I never got to begin with. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up with the Jesus religion, and instead grew up with the old testament and torah. My catholic friend's who disliked Catholic school liked it, but again, I felt it was their inside joke that I was on the outside of.

I hope all of those who were raised Catholic that were in the audience or in the movie FEEL better and their church-induced inhibitions have been wiped away after seeing or being in this flick. The review of Shashank Tripathi (an Irish contemporary of mine) says it all well too. It's only the second movie I ever walked out of (Drew Barrymore couldn't carry \\"Home Fries\\" all by herself; more wooden acting, not immature plotting, in that case).

This movie didn't strike me as controversial or thought provoking. It also wasn't funny or entertaining. I was bored. Kevin Smith's characters are constantly explaining the plot to you through the whole movie. My english teacher always told me to show, not tell. Apparantly Kevin Smith never learned this rule.

There is no absence of the mainstream media explosion that you find in the other three (okay, maybe two, but we'll forgive Chasing Amy).

However, I think it's equally important to have a few drinks in you too in order to get the right buzz required to enjoy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I've seen","review":"I rented this movie by accident ome night, I'd never even heard of it. The best thing to say about it is that it kicked ass, plain and simple. It is very, very amusing, the acting is great, and the story itself is extremely clever. Jay and Bob are the bomb together. An awesome movie, no doubt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas... but flawed in execution","review":"Dogma has some funny moments and contains the kernel of a good film, but unfortunately these are lost in the loose direction and slack editing. There are quite a few plot problems and they are never really resolved properly. A few more months in the editing suite may have worked wonders for this film, but overall it was very disappointing.Ed Wood would've been proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"All this with Jay and Silent Bob, too.","review":"What if two fallen angels found a loophole that could get them back into heaven? Now what if that same loophole might just cause the destruction of the entire universe?That's the premise of this wonderful movie. (And don't believe the rumors you've heard about blasphemy and damnation for all that see it!)With plenty of theological \\"inside jokes\\" to keep any Catholic school graduate enthralled, the plot, action and dialog all make this a very enjoyable and compelling film. Truly comical. Truly intellectual (Hey! don't let that put you off!). But mostly, truly enjoyable.If you liked Jay and Silent Bob from Mall Rats, you'll love this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits the Nail on the HEAD!!!","review":"I almost didn't watch this movie when it came on TV because of the scenario: 2 angels must be stopped before they destroy the world. I ain't Oprah and I ain't into no angels. But, I DID watch it and it was GREAT! This movie reflects my EXACT view of \\"the religion thing\\". It's a fantastic movie and anyone who's thought about the subject of religion and is honest about it will love it too. Only thing - probably should shoo the kids out of the room.

Religion, like every other aspect of humanity, must evolve with us.This story is very humorous and thought provoking and the cast is superb! If you have any sort of intelligence that allows you to be a free thinker, you will LOVE this show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest I've seen","review":"DOGMA is one of the funniest movies I've seen. It's not to be seen by those who are easily offended ... it's to be appreciated by those with open minds. Although the movie does have a few dragging moments, overall it makes you think and it makes you laugh. And for all of you that are raising a stink about Alanis Morissette appearing as God, set aside your preconceptions of her and her music and realize that not a single one of us is actually *worthy* of being God. (And do stick around for the credits to hear her wonderful song, \\"Still\\", that she wrote about God.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and entertaining...!","review":"Well, this movie was certainly interesting. There were many different points when I thought: \\"Wow, this is really a great movie.\\" And, it was. Very good. Sure, it poked fun at, like, everything in the Catholic religion, but it was still really good.Very, very funny.What happens is: Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartalby (Ben Affleck) play fallen angles trying to get back into heaven. They have to get to a New Jersey church and pass over the threshold to be clensed of their sins. Bethany (Linda Fioentino) is the person \\"chosen\\" to stop them. She meets two guys named Jay and Silent Bob who are unknowingly going to get her there. On the way, she meets Rufus (Chris Rock) and The Muse (played by Salma Hayak) who are also there to guide her. It really quite interesting...."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dissapointed","review":"Kevin Smith was one of my favorite directers before I saw this. This is nothing like any of his other movies. There's barely ANY funny parts, it has a lot of violance and blood, and it is so offensive to Catholics. It is also boring and confusing. I don't know how anyone could like this movie, and I don't know why it was even made. If you want to see a good Kevin Smith movie, get Mall Rats or Clerks, don't even see this... you'll regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT PROVOKING AT ALL, JUST BORING AND BAD TASTE","review":"THis is a horrible motion picture, from scene one till the end.... There's some good acting and the general concept idea is good, but the execution of the idea is horrible. I'm not the least shocked by the cheap language, by the supposed \\"polemic\\" themes shwon in the movie. No. I'm shocked by this being such a bad movie, disconected, unpleasant to watch due to bad direction. And come on, this team of Affleck and Damon never worked, they think they are great but they're not !"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few chuckles but mostly boring","review":"Considering the \\"star power\\" that this movie has in it, I thought perhaps this would be a GREAT movie. All I can say is, I found it to be EXACTLY the opposite. I found it to be most mundane and was rather disappointed. Am I catholic? No! Did I find this movie to be blasphemous? No! Simply put, it was a movie based on angels that were trying to get themselves back into heaven after being put aside. The only humor I found in it were some quips by Chris Rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Enjoyable But Too Much Swearing","review":"A poke at religion is ok. But a poke at religion where there is constant obscenities is unsettling and detracts from the movie.

What I experienced was more like a bad acid trip commandeered by graduate-school PC theological tedium mixed with prepubescent sex and scat jokes. This movie has no reason to exist beyond the smattering of one-liners and a certain stoner hipness, but even these are cliched or pretentious beyond tolerability. Even the considerable talents of its ensemble cast can't save this drivel from the postmodern trash heap. If this is what ex-Catholics are struggling with, god help them! This film is an insult to anyone with an ounce of spirituality left in them. It knows not from whence it came nor what it wants to say. Honestly the worst film I've seen in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORNING","review":"This was a DUMB movie no point ot it at all.

Being Christian myself, (protestant) I was curious.I heard that this film was offensive particularly to Catholics. Not being Catholic, I wasn't sure of everything that would be offensive to them, but I can see why so many Catholics were offended.It does have a few scenes that offended me, but there are plenty of other films which were far more offensive.If you are devout Catholic, this movie will offend you. If you are a Protestant, this movie might offend you. If you are secular and like off-color humor, you will probably like this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogma","review":"Hey, I am a Kevin Smith fan, just like many others, but this film really lacked the acting that it needed to pull of the brilliant story and script. People have lauded Jay and Silent Bob for this film, but they kinda ruined it. In the other 3 Jersey movies, J+SB play support roles. In this go-round, they are given lead parts, but they can't really pull it off. SB way overacted (trying to make up for the lack of speech?) and when the token line finally came...it sank. Maybe he spoke enough in Chasing Amy to quench us all... Chris Rock also needs to understand that with a script as fine as he was given, not every line needs to be a punch line, and a modicum of action may be required to fill the part. Good story...not really well executed though. I buy it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! But the Special Edition trick is sleazy.","review":"Dogma is one of my three favorite movies of all time. I love how smart this movie is and how interesting it is (although I don't much care for Linda Fiorentino's performance, everyone else is more than good enough to make up for it).BUT - this movie is another case of ripping off the people who like a movie by printing a bare bones DVD one year and a Super-fied edition of the same movie on DVD the next year. It's dishonest, insulting to people who buy DVDs, and overall a greedy practice that should be discontinued.Dogma = 5 stars. Sleazy marketing gimmicks = -2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I think people liked this movie because they thought it was rebellious but still somehow true. I tried really hard to like it because I like \\"Clerks\\" and \\"Chasing Amy\\" VERY much. I was disappointed. I just didn't think it was all that funny, and the premise seemed strained. It was hard to suspend disbelief. As a comment on Catholicism, incidentally, it isn't even close. I would describe myself as a Catholic estranged from the Catholic church. I used to be very devout. The movie didn't offend me. It just seemed like it was made by someone who seems to be a Catholic-without-a-clue. Take it from one who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal","review":"I think this movie is mainly a hoot for catholics with a sense of humor. Drop that angle, and there's not much to like. A pretty hokey plotline, too many big names for no reason and no part, not doing any acting, working with a script that tosses out ideas that have a 1-second shelf life. And the down to earth modernization of mythological and religous people is Neil Gaiman stuff, Smith does it completely superficially, although they both kind of flub that awesome idea and fail to get to the emotional side of such an issue. Particularly here though, it does not rise above gimmick at all.This is the first Smith movie I've seen, and so far he comes off as someone the public idolizes for his intelligence, mainly because he has dialogue about topics and his non-conformist appearance. There's so much more that can go into a movie though then posing a sort of intellectual question and then flexing the 'i'm people' roots persona."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the funniest cleverest films ever!","review":"I love this film, it is so increbily funny, and you dont need to know much about the bible or Catholisism to understand this. The plot is incomplicated and easy to follow, yet very clever, the humor comes fast and thick, and has many classic lines( well there classics among me and my friends im not sure about anyone else) for example: \\"do it, do it and i'll...spank you\\" and \\"why the...did you hug my head\\" anyone who's seen the film and is not sure weather or not to buy the video or go all out and get the DVD I say get the DVD. The audio commmentary although it may not be very informative on the making of the film (who wants that anyway??) is abseloutly hillarius and ive listened to it loads of times. So next time you get a spare [$$] buy this, you wont be disapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's yo' buddy? Buddy Christ!","review":"I absolutely love this movie. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were hysterical as fallen angels and Jay and Silent Bob were great, as always. Smith has written a smart, funny movie that points out the faults of organized religion with a giant neon light! Also, the way he was able to also poke fun at other major institutions (Disney, for one) was great. Check out Jay and Silent Bob's secret stash for cool stuff. I have a 6 in. Buddy Christ in my car. Although George Carlin's role was brief, he was great as well. The deleted scenes are fantastic and one of them made me fall off the couch and cry, I was laughing so hard (Jay and Silent Bob's Fat Albert scene). See this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different twist to religion.","review":"This is a very interesting and different movie, the emphasis in \\"different\\".

The cast is superb, bringing in stars for starring roles and cameos alike. When I found out that Dogma was a coming out in a 2-DVD set I nearly lost it, and when I watched it I nearly lost it for the other reason. Most of the features are incredibly boring. The best parts of the movie were seriously in the movie and there is a big reason why those deleted scenes were left out. The commentary by Kevin Smith et.al. is sometimes funny but mostly gets in the way of the movie. If this comes in a single DVD I would get that so you can enjoy Dogma without having to pay, financially and mentally, for all the extra features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal","review":"This film assumes to be satricial and comedic.

The concept has a hole that you could drive a Mac truck thru, and the execution is embarrassing to all concerned. By the time I was half-way through the movie, I really didn't care one way or the other. Even the jokes were on a tenth-grade mind level. Oh well, it gets one star (instead of none) because they were smart enough to keep Morisette from opening her mouth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this due to the cast. I thought, Gee- with a cast like this, how bad can it be. Answer- awfully bad...terrible, in fact. I've heard so many people rave about this flick, I thought I had to check it out...I was wrong. Word to the wise, save your hard earned cash- buy something funny.Linda Fiorentino- whom I adore, was awful. The problem isn't her acting, it's just that the dialogue is so poorly written that it seems to be a struggle for her to pull it off with any creditability or conviction. It's just too over the top.The rest of the cast played their parts as ok as could be expected, especially considering the terrible lines. I just couldn't force myself to find this film funny- no matter how hip indie film lovers found it.In sum, ridiculous story, strained dialogue and performances, and the humor was somewhat predictable- like Beavis and Butthead hijinks. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amos and Andy in Heaven","review":"Wow, another film attacking religious views, written by someone whose narrow-minded viewpoints on the subject probably derived from tabloids and Oprah. The film has well-written/acted funny moments, but then again, so do Amos and Andy videos and the vintage black-face minstrel shows. They all share one thing in common -- they insult a \\"group\\" which is (at the moment) hated by the Hollywood elite.Don't get me wrong, if the movie had any genuine substance to it, I'd probably get concerned. But, as it is, \\"Dogma\\" ultimately ends up a disappointment even as a comedy. In a couple of years it will be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"i love kevin smith movies and this is an example of his hilarious yet contraversial humor % stars well earned by me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"Is this the best quality film I have ever seen? No, it is not. However, it is a creative look at a serious topic and I think it is worth seeing. And the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.

Decent performances from the actors with some notable exceptions. Some amusing dialog. Salma Hayek and Alan Rickman give great performances, especially considering some of the lines they had to read. The scene on the train is, indeed, amusing.Lowlights: Not nearly as offensive as it could've been. Decent performances ruined by poor staging (any seen where Linda Fiorentino is having a conversation). Some really lame gags. Too much Jay and Silent Bob -- small doses.The director seems better at character/dialogue driven movies. Plot-driven stories like Mallrats and Dogma seemed rushed; in this case, too much dialog is given over to explication. I will give him credit though: he managed to get Ben Affleck to wipe that annoying smirk off his face on the train scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard topics in 10 seconds","review":"Anyone having to write about philosophy knows that the hard part is do it with few words.

The Special Edition disks for \\"Clerks\\", \\"Mallrats\\" and \\"Chasing Amy\\" are what all DVDs SHOULD BE - a record of not only the artistry, but of the personalities that created the art. In each we understand how the director thinks, feels and works and has been a chronicle of Smith's growth as a writer and director. However, \\"Dogma\\" looks like it was time to throw the film on a disk for retail sale.The much-anticipated \\"Special Edition\\" is coming soon, and Smith has promised it to be a great companion edition to a sharp, witty and (in some ways) groundbreaking film.

For me, it stopped being funny when the violence became explicit. The monster from the toilet was funny, and that type of violemce (implied but not seen) made for a better film.

It lost points with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"this really is a great movie","review":"I really very much enjoyed this film. As a fan of the work of Kevin Smith I can say this really is one of his best(sure he's only done 4 and i doesn't beat clerks). Ben Affleck(who was in mallrats and chasing amy)and Matt Damon give what I feel are their best performances. and what tops it all of is Jay and Silent Bob(smith) who are regulars in all his films. I really don't see what is offensive. I doesn't make fun of any religon per say. What i feel it does do is open your mind to different aspects of religion and different was of thinking about it. No one will really touch religion it that matter before. If you want to attack it for that reason you really should see the movie and then rethink you taughts on it. I know quite a few who have seen it none where offended or saw anyting offensive in it. Every one has a right to think differently about everyting and religion is one of them.

Then he tried something more serious with the twisted love triangle and came out with Chasing Amy, a film with some great moments, but never a truly satisfiying whole. And now Dogma! Which, let's face it, it a steamy pile of pretentious Dogdo! OK, so, there's a couple of funny lines. Wow! And Silent Bob and Jay are in it. Um, Wow! And, um.... it's just garbage.

I dont know what the quality of the DVD is like but I didnt find the blu ray anything special. But what I did find annoying inspite of the fact its supposed to be a 5.1, I found the sound to be sub-standard. The dialogue was low and not crisp and had to up and down volume with the scene. Any action sound was over the top. I just found the sound annoying and no way to par to what it ought to be. Personally Id say just go with the DVD.PS. I went through the deleted scenes and you wont believe just how bad the quality of them was not even VHS quality.

In-depth storytelling, facinating characters (including Linda Fiorentino as the morally confused descendant of Christ), and a large amount of dialogue. Smith has never been afraid to tell a story through the words of his characters. DOGMA is no different.

The book is written in the same manner throughout, so whether this book will be useful to you or not, will be obvious in the first few pages.For myself, I found his explanatory paragraphs extremely difficult to follow and had to actually study and re-read several times each paragraph to figure out his intention. Then the samples were a second challenge, since they are not \\"clean\\" examples of the points that he was trying to make. For example, in demonstrating the Imaj7-IIm7-V7-I progression in the first sample, he uses notes that are not part of these chords. He does this throughout the book, unnecessarily complicating the point.He warns of this in the 5th paragraph of the Preface, where he states: \\"alterations that appear in the examples are not always indicated in chord symbols\\". This simply complicates the issue and lessons needlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Struggling Wannabe Jazz Pianist","review":"Nothing against the book, but as a keyboardist with a longing to be adept at playing jazz, the \\"Roman Numeral\\" notations are a bit burdensome to someone not yet familiar with music theory.

Took it for two months and no longer use my psoriatic meds. UNREAL. It is the bioperine that dramatically enhances absorption of curcumin. In fact curcumin without bioperine is useless. Psoriasis is autoimmune illness with potential heart and circulatory complications and a cheap, safe supplement that can cure it is beyond belief. Curcumin has other mind blowing benefits (cancer pervention, heart benifits, brain health as well as others). It is the bioperine though that is mandatory for absorption. I take many supplements, do much reading on supplements and I can say that Drs Best C with Bio is the most beneficial supplement for optimal health period.Oh well psoriasis came back, after 6 months. But I do love this product. Great price too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 3 1/2 years","review":"I used this solely as a cd player because it is very thin and takes up little space on top of the receiver. I didn't love it while it worked, it took too long to turn on and to eject a cd, sort of slow moving. But the sound was fine and really for the price it was ok. But after 3 1/2 years it just one day stopped turning on. I had to break the cover to get the cd out because it only ejects when it has electricity. So I will look for something new, not Sony, to see if something else holds up better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but no longer works after 4 years","review":"I have owned this DVD player for 4 years and most of the DVDs I played on this device worked great. No skipping or other annoyance. However, after 4 years, the device is starting to skip a little during movies, and most recently could not play 2 minutes worth of video without stopping the video/audio.

I can play CDs without a problem, but when I put a DVD (I tried every DVD I own) into the player, it attempts to spin the DVD, and then an error message stating \\"Cannot Play Disc\\" scrolls across the Display of the DVD Player. For years I thought that SONY had quality products. It seems that something has changed. I will never buy another SONY. By the way, it would cost roughly half the original purchase price to ship it back to SONY for a replacement. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playback is prohibited by area limitations","review":"This player DOES NOT PLAY everything you throw at it as some have claimed. For example, it's very picky about media files, takes a long time to read or doesn't play them at all. There is no support for firmware updates either and only accepts Region 1. Despite the clean picture, it's going back to the store in trade for the Philips DVP-642 I picked up also. I hate limitations, and I got to say that the Philips DOES PLAY everything you throw at it.Sony is a quality product, but they got to get on the ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony falls short","review":"Got this player almost a month ago. It had been excellent. The Best picture quality I have ever seen with a DVD Player. The buttons are way to small and hard to push especially the power button.

The player about half way through the movie the drive started making a funny noise kind of like the sound it makes when it starts reading the disk before it plays. The picture just stop but recovered quickly. I was shocked! It did this every 5 to 10 minutes for the rest of the movie.What a huge disappointment! I really liked this player. Hands down the Best picture quality but skipping on brand new DVDs, NOT COOL! This player is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony is finished.","review":"This unit worked for about 1 hour.

I have no idea how long the machine would last, but if it is like my other Sony components, it will have a long life, perhaps replaced to allow use of some new modality in the future.I am reviewing this again about 2 years after purchase (2006) and the player is great.

The warning signs are all there to re-evaluate this effort; the clingy, uncomforted pre-schooler, the moody, unfulfilled woman, and the conflicted man that chooses not to see anything that causes him discomfort. The warning signs become symptoms as the young child runs wild with the natives and has been found with suspicious rashes around her genitals while her behavior becomes more and more abnormal. But, the couple plug on, convinced that they are making some enormous contribution to humanity and their efforts will somehow smooth over all the sacrifices they are incurring. The undiscovered country is not the place to try and find yourself and your life's work, as this beautiful tale demonstrates."},{"rating":"2","title":"an engrossing novel","review":"This novel centers around the Campbell family, who travel to the island of Papua New Guinea in the 1970s. Although they seem to be going to for the husband's research it also seems like they're going just as much for the adventure. The novel has a lovely setting, the rain forest feels paplpable as does the odd, alienated feeling the Campbells have. This book brought to my mind At Play In the Fields of the Lord and for some reason, Patricia Cornwell (I guess for the medical details) 's books, too.

This is a serious must-have. If you ever been to a festival in the 70s (wich I haven't) you'll enjoy this DVD much more, it will bring back uncountable memories. It opens with a great footage of the Lilly Brothers & Don Stover with Tex Logan (wich is worth the price alone!) and it keeps going with Mac Wiseman, Earl Scruggs, the Bluegrass Alliance, JD Crowe, Blackwell & Collins and many many many more. It has a great quality, both video and audio, plus there's a great commentary by Fred Bartenstein (who actually was one of the organisers of the festival, when he sold Muleskinner News...).

There is a sense of something wholesome going on there, not like other musical festivals like Woodstock, where there is a sense of something perverse going on. I love it when rockers come to bluegrass, produce one of something worth listening to and then vanish, because they don't understand the culture of the men who make their living palying music they love. This CD does an excellent job of telling a story and showcasing some truly legendary acts."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best bluegrass videos ever, and a rare timepiece","review":"I've viewed this video many times, both for its many great performances as well as the historical significance. Many great stars in their prime, an excited and very interesting audience, and great commentary from the man who started bluegrass festivals, Carlton Haney. The audience shots are especially interesting, as it was a highly polarized time in America, yet the different factions blended together at a bluegrass event, and seemed to have a great time together. The Jimmy Martin and Ralph Stanley clips are alone worth the price, and their side musicians are especially notable. This is a rare gem... some of the earliest full-color bluegrass ever shot, from 1971 when bluegrass festivals were new and filled with soul and excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Capture of a 70's Bluegrass Festival","review":"A great video piece for traditional bluegrass lovers.

In fact, ICP owes its best work to their former producer. I like *some* of Zug-CP's stuff with Mike Puwal, but PDM is not just a return to that great MEC sound, but many steps forward. Every track is distinctive, thanks in part to all the guest vocals, but also in terms of sound. The lyrics are strong and for me, a more powerful and thought-provoking than some reviews imply.Which brings me to the official-looking \\"Album Description\\" you see here.

The rest of them sound like every horrorcore cliche Prozak could think of. Sometimes Prozak's flow is exciting, but he never creates a distinctive persona. MEC goes the rap/rock route on this album. This style is already played, but this CD is even worse because the loud guitar riffs don't have any melody. They're melded together with a bunch of other unidentifiable synthesized sounds to create Phil Spector's Wall of Sound from Hell.

I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who has tried learning kana the hard way (repeating them over and over, ad nauseum) and given up.My only complaint is the size of the book (it's only 3X5 inches), and that he only provides memory aiding drawings for the base kana, but glosses over the voiced sounds, doublers, combined forms, etc. (for example, a drawing/memory aid is provided for ho, but not bo or po!).

You'll find this book incredibly useful whether you want to travel to the land of the rising sun or just amaze your friends - and yourself too - by reading the menu at your local sushi bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kana Pict-o-Graphix Review","review":"If learning Katakana or Hiragana you will not go wrong with this little pocket sized book. I was recognizing Hiragana in a matter of minutes and retaining the information day after day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be better to buy Kanji Pict-o-Graphix instead","review":"This is ok so far as it goes, but there's very little to it. Also, this book is reprinted in the same author's kanji pict-o-graphix book, so there's no point in buying this book if you're going to get the kanji one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the Advertise","review":"I have a new PC and everything required and still have a fuzzy picture and lots of noise. Need a lot of setup time to make it work. Not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is Deceiving","review":"A more appropriate title would be \\"Before You Cast a Spell: Understanding ethics.\\" He doesn't get into writing spells at all. He explains nothing about how power works, and what's worse, it comes across that he doesn't even really believe in magik at all... There's nothing worse than trying to learn something from someone who doesn't believe what they are teaching.He's extremely preachy on ethics, to the point where it gets irritating. And the other reviewers are right in that he is most definately on a high horse.I was mainly disappointed because I thought this book might actually get into how magik works, how to write your own spells, and stuff like that. IT NEVER DOES. EVER.I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone. If you want a book about how to write your own spells try \\"Your Book Of Shadows: How to Write Your Own Magickal Spells\\" by Patricia Telesco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time and money!","review":"Quite simplistic, Carl McColman seems to be suffering from a superiority complex!

It has one citation, and that is to The Encyclopedia of the Occult. And that, even, was just to correct her previous histories where she just spat out commonly repeated claims of the Pagan community. Just think before you read. If you want the commonly repeated misonceptions of the Pagan community repeated to you, this book is a good read then!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this item....I wasted my money....don't waste yours!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS HAMMOCK! I purchased this item in September 2011, by March of this year (2012), it was not usable. The green and white side looks fine, but the solid green side literally disintegrated into a green powder. Keep in mind it was not chewed on by a dog, played on by a child, eaten by insects or mistreated in any way. I can't explain why a fabric would do this and I have never seen it happen before. Spend your $149 on something that you will be able to actually use in 6 months. Very, very, very disappointed as this should have lasted at least a couple years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best purchase I have made in a long time.","review":"Awesome hammock!

I have these in several colors, and will continue to buy them. The only thing that I would change is to make the white on the soles the same color as the rest of the shoe, but the only time that has prevented me from buying the shoe is when looking for black shoes to wear as part of a uniform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Spirit Traveltime Slip-on","review":"Love these shoes.

Just right.Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Excellent!","review":"I have been wearing my \\"Travel Time\\" clogs everyday since I received them.

I would order from the net no problem if I was sure of the size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love These Comfortable Shoes!!!","review":"Have these in several colors and they've become front and center on my shoe rack. They fit like a glove, provide arch support, are so lightweight I forget I have them on, and they stay on my feet without any slipping whatsoever.Do some volunteer work which involves being on my feet for several hours at a time and these are my shoes of choice. Even wear them with socks in winter snow unless it's over 1-1/2\\" or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great during pregnancy","review":"During my pregnancy I've been wearing regular tennis shoes, but when we were going to be flying 12+ hours in my 7th month I knew I needed something easy to slip on and off to give my feet a rest and get through security faster. I bought these on sale and I'm actually considering getting another pair to switch off with (I try to switch off between shoes every other day so they don't get stinky). Most shoes like this bother my heels or give me blisters, but these have not done either. The material is soft enough to not be uncomfortable, but rigid enough to not slip off my feet (unless I want to take them off, which is really easy to do without hands).I have them in the mostly-mesh version (Navy, the third choice), but this mesh material seems to be just part of the fashion of the shoe and not actually functional (the inside is fully lined).I'd highly recommend these during pregnancy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy spirit shoes.","review":"I love love love these shoes.

The shoe is so wide it wants to slip. I am very disappointed and will return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly","review":"Wear these shoes almost every day. My usual brand of choice is Fit Flops, love their winter clogs, but decided they look like bedroom slippers so I wear them around the house. These add a little more style to my life and are almost as comfortable as my worn and broken in Fitflops. I feel like I am safe to go outside of the house and if I meet someone I will definitely look respectable. The little bit of shine makes them even more presentable. Confort level fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoes!","review":"Very comfortable shoes. Great for travel or any situation where shoes must be removed quickly and/or easily.

Thank you Easy Spirit!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So comfy","review":"I loved these so much that after a week I ordered a second pair in another color.

However, if I cannot find them on sale I buy them anyway! My feet have to bear the constant weight of my entire body and nothing is worse than sore feet! I can be walking, working out or wearing dress shoes all day and my feet never hurt....worth every penny!

I chose the blue upper with a gray bottom in a narrow width. I absolutely love them. Comfy from Day 1, and nicely styled. The blue is perfect to wear with jeans (it's not so bright that it stands out, it's more of a grayish blue). I've been wearing Merrell Primo Breeze shoes for years, and never thought I'd find another pair of slip-ons that are as comfortable or that offered as much support. Easy Spirit has won me over, am I'm not an easy customer (I'm sure others with narrow, picky feet will relate). You can probably find similar shoes that are cheaper, but they won't feel as close to heaven as these do... You definitely will not regret this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh so comfortable","review":"I absolutely love these shoes. They are the ultimate walking shoe offering support and comfort while lightweight and fashionable. They are easy to put on and easy to take off.

I live in a northern climate and even wear them during the winter as long as the snow isn't deep. The are amazingly comfortable; I shopped all day in them the first day I owned them.

They work but have much less support and cushioning than Skechers \\"Blissy\\" that I was looking for. If you're looking for that, this is not it. They're comfortable but I found they ran a full size smaller than what I normally order. I find the same issue with Skechers in athletic style shoes.
