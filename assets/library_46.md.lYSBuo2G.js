So, this is an excellent compromise. It's pretty comfortable. As other reviewers have noted your head/neck area may need a small pillow for complete comfort. It's great for reading. You don't get the \\"full\\" swing effect that you would with a ceiling suspended chair, but it's still fine.

Unfortunately, this product didn't work at all for me. I liked the idea of having a roller to do the edges instead of my normal paint brush. The roller always gets the paint on a little more evenly. however, the metal edge on this product left black marks against the ceiling, and the trim. It was like it was scraping off the paint beneath it. Also, the side of the guard with the black plastic also left marks on my ceiling. I would stick to the Shure-line regular trimmer, and use the one with the threaded handle for the ceiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"The Rubbermaid 'Premium' Trimline Edger is a total piece of junk. The long and short of it is that it simply doesn't work. The box says 'patent pending'.....what a waste of Rubbermaids money patenting this thing. Scratched wall, scratched trim, smeared paint........whoever designed this thing needs his brain examined and who ever approved it for marketing should be searched for a possible brain, obviously he didn't try the product before approving it.Wow.......Rubbermaid you can surely do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal guide scrapes the corners","review":"I too had the same problem. I used the Rubbermaid Premium Trimline Edger Kit only to find that the metal blade that is the edge guide scrapes my corners. As a result, the edger creates black lines on my walls. The black plastic edge also scrapes my walls around corners. I had to go over the corners again with a paint brush to cover the black lines. What a disappointment and a waste of money. The ceiling and trim edger is cheaper and more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap Crap Crap","review":"Terrible terrible product.

Don't waste your money - just use some Frog tape and a brush to paint along your trim."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG WASTE OF TIME","review":"I found this believe it or not for 2.99, now I know why. It leaves black scratches from the edger metal blade which you have to paint over. The paint oozes out from the edger and gets all over the trim. I could do better with a brush and taking my time. I didn't dare use it on the ceiling considering what it did to the baseboards. I only used it for a few minutes before I realized I was better off without it. Glad I only wasted a small amount of money on this. If I could give it a zero I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the BLUEBERRIES?","review":"These are fine, if they weren't supposed to have blueberries. There are essentially none.

The book is just as relevant to proteomics as it is to more restrictive definitions of genomics. In fact Transducing the Genome starts out with the scientists' attempts 20 years ago to simultaneously characterize all proteins. Attention turned to DNA in the late '80's, but the early protein work is very relevant to today's efforts to conqueor the \\"proteome\\", which are also covered, although to a lesser extent. The book is an excellent read. It is reletively easy to follow and contains some very interesting and informative musings on science fiction, politics, law, business, and other matters. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books on this very interesting subject","review":"This books has some interesting material but lacks clarity, depth and focus. Basic explanations about a given subjects come often in the wrong order. Whenever the books attempt to explain anything, very little can actually be understood, as the author tries to keep the level of explanations too low, and therefore ultimately hopelessly useless. Written with the businessman mind, and not with a scientific one.Much better book are from Watson and Berry or from Ridley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than others","review":"This one does block the light out that usually sneaks in from the bottom of my nose. It's black in there. I've got to get used to the tension of the elastic head band that tracks over my ears. To achieve the light seal I have to snug the head band to my head and that puts more pressure on my ears than I care to deal with.I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It did the job...","review":"I had an overnight flight so I ordered this sleep mask so I could sleep on the flight. I go to bed early (9ish) so I didn't want to be disturbed by my rowmates' reading.This sleep mask was comfortable and it blocked out the light. I loved the little pocket for the ear plugs (which I needed on the return trip to drown out a loud talker)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty color","review":"Pretty color - just don't like how they fit too well and that when I wake in the morning my eye hurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge mistake","review":"I have recently bought two of these masks, one for me and the second for my wife. The main problem we have with them are the thick straps that cut through the ears. The mask is also so thick that it makes you so hot during the night, and you have no choice but to take it off. I will try to refund them and find something else here from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straps too Sharp","review":"The body of the mask is okay, kind of heavy and hot, but the straps are very heavy fabric, stiff, and the edges are sharp. I had the black Bucky and its straps were much softer and more flexible. I won't use this blue one anymore with the sharp straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate eye shades","review":"These are THE best eyeshades, bar none. No light penetrates, but blinking is no problem. Very comfortable and lightweight. Buy these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for people who need darkness","review":"I need a dark room to sleep well. The bucky is perfect for camping, visiting family out of town & sleeping in on Saturday. Because of the pad which sits below the eyes it keeps extra light from coming in. The straps are adjustable velcro closures. I set mine up and keep them closed when I remove the bucky. I like mine loose and it stays on my face just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super light blocker","review":"This is my second pair of Bucky Shades, they are far superior to other shades at blocking light. The nose pad is a little obtrusive and can push down on your nose causing you to have slight issues breathing through your nose at night. Also, the velcro is a little thick in the back... But, their ability to block 99% of light is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whose heads are these made for?!","review":"You have to have a head the size of a tennis racket for the velcro to meet in the right place and create a light-tight seal. I end up using safety pins to fasten the straps. But they are very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best eye mask for airplane flights ever!","review":"For years I relied on free eye masks handed out by airlines, then I bought various fancy ones from spas and health food stores. None of them worked as well as this Bucky. I resisted the price ($25) at first, but now find that it is worth every penny. Buy the Bucky that has a tiny pocket for earplugs - it comes with earplugs that are strung together so you won't lose them. As a frequent flyer who takes red eye flights, this is utterly indispensable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts My Eyes","review":"The sleep mask has a thick ridge on the inside bottom designed to help block the light. The only problem is that the mask tends to adjust itself upward on my face so that the ridge is either right underneath my eyes or actually on my eyes, creating very uncomfortable pressure. I sleep better with light than with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE size","review":"I ordered these as a Christmas present for my husband who travels but ended up returning them due to their enormous size. They probably work really well to block out any and all light (they are so big and thick I can't imagine them not) but I would hardly call them travel size. If you're looking for something small and low profile these are definitely not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bucky Make The Best","review":"Try them all then return to Bucky everytime. :-) Been using these suckers for years.

I'm sensitive! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good night's sleep","review":"I have used Bucky eyeshades for over 20 years and love it. But, I needed to purchase another since it was lost. It is the same comfortable fit with adjustable velcro closure on strong elastic. BUT, I took off a star because the completely soft blackout fill of the past models has been replaced with less fill and a cardboard type shape in the shape of the mask.(that is the way it feels, anyway). What used to be an outstanding product is still very good, but I will consider looking into other manufacturers in the future. Because of it's cheaper construction, I no longer give rave reviews- a bad move on the part of Bucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel book with a twist","review":"Great book, a little quirky with some of it's ideas but that's it's appeal.

I purchased it for my then computer-illiterate wife who was reluctant to use such a device, registering it on my Amazon account. After much use, she became to like the device and has become an avid user. Instead of continuing to use my Amazon account to order books, she wanted to be able to do so on her Amazon account. I sent an email to Amazon asking to how to transfer the kindle account to her, and instructions were received to deregister it from my account and register it on hers. We did so, and then found out that none of the many books we purchased were accessible! After then calling Amazon, we found out that you cannot transfer purchased content from on account to another!

If someone recommends a book, I can purchase it immediately. The Kindle is light weight so I don't have to struggle to hold it. Turning pages don't require struggling to get just one page to turn.

But having it with me for two months I find the scale of change is more than I have expected. The two most valuable features of Kindle is to me mobility and easy access to a new, albeit somewhat restricted, selection of books. It used to be that I have to wait for weeks before my ordered books arrived Taiwan, which isn't very encouraging for exploring new subjects.Now it has completely eliminated all others books, and often the netbook, from my bag. It is much lighter and almost as easy to flip through as those paperbacks in my office. I can often finish a sample when commuting. And it has greatly eased the pain of having to wait for the new books to come. This combination works really great that I can feel my subjects of reading has broadened in the last two months.I think it is a very nice device dedicated to reading, which is exactly what I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource, great formatting","review":"This Bible already has plenty of reviews establishing its quality.

Unfortunately the coercive avaricious, Steve Jobs style, ram it down your throat business model makes it a non starter. My hope is that some of the electronics manufacturers will work with the publishers to adopt a universal E read format Ala Blueray or MP3 so that we can get these devices at a more competitive price point and keep the content market separate.

Had I known of the DX Kindle, 2.5 times bigger yet only about $135 more than the regular Kindle, that is exactly what I'd given my father. Solution: Amazon needs to let people like me return the little Kindle, pay the extra $135 or so, and receive the DX early this summer. Apple learned quick how fast rabid supporters would turn when it dramatically dropped the iPhone's price, leaving thousands of customers feeling like rubes and chumps. ARE YOU LISTENING, AMAZON? You can take the high road and solidify customer loyalty.

This is akin to having a family member or friend reading aloud to you.The Authors Guild felt that this threatened the sales of audiobooks and pressured Amazon into removing the feature. Amazon capitulated and crippled the Kindle by allowing authors to disable text-to-speech.The willingness of Amazon to appease the Authors Guild at the detriment of their customers makes this a risky purchase.I advise that until this product is no longer defective by Amazon's own design, you do not purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle sale hoax","review":"I wasted my time for the sale to begin and hit the buy button as soon as it came on.No kindle for me.Tried to get on waiting list. not possible.Called customer service and was told item was sold out.Must have only been one kindle on sale.Customer service operator said she had tried to make same purchase too to no avail.Disgusted and fed up with Amazon.Don't waste any time with these shysters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Zoom function ASAP!","review":"Amazon Kindle developers, this review is for you!For reading and carrying print, the Kindle can't be beat; everyone knows that.However, lack of a zoom function is holding back an *enormous* and profitable segment of the potential Kindle-buying public--the manga/graphic novel fans.Everywhere I go, I read laments about the unreadability of print in the tiny graphic images, even on the DX or Kindle for PC. It mirrors my own experience.The moment a zoom function is available, watch the word shoot out at the speed of light, and a whole new market open up! Really, I'd rather buy and store my manga digitally, but for now I'm holding off. I'm far from alone.

When it became available in Europe, I bought the Kindle with hopes of abundant and good priced books. However, the reality hit me only after I ordered.1- You can only order this from Amazon.com. Not from Amazon.de, not from Amazon.co.uk. So you have to pay heaps of money for \\"import tax\\". Why can't a company like Amazon solve this? It is almost a hidden cost.2- Books are generally more expensive than their paperback versions. Unless you like reading books written gazillion years ago. Why oh why? Isn't wireless delivery cheaper than printing the book?3- The titles in Europe are restricted \\"due to copyright reasons\\". So if you want to read new bestsellers, even if you are willing to pay more than the paperback, no luck.I hope the introduction of another decent competitor like Apple will shake things up.I do not recommend you to buy this product. Especially of you are living in Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice xmas present","review":"very happy. it does what it says it will do. very easy and simple. only thing i could recommend, would be to include a cover with the kindle. i had to order and wait a week. i couldn't imagine taking it out with you without a cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing so far!!","review":"Finally got my Kindle for Xmas!!

I know that there is an update that will help with the battery life, but, a small solar panel would guarantee that the makers of Kindle would not have to focus on the battery life aspect of the device and can concentrate on the \\"experimental\\" web browser.Besides this I absolutely love the product and would recommend it highly.Jax"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I purchased the Kindle I shortly after it became avaiable.

This makes loaning books to friends extremely unlikely. So while it looks as if you're getting a bargain when you buy a new book, in terms of the cost per reader, it is quite expensive.It would make sense to permit books to be transferred to others without any cost, provided that the book could only be opened by one kindle at one time.I am a voracious reader, but until that happens, I'm not buying one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after warrenty expired","review":"I loved my Kindle while it worked.

Buying new books is quick and easy process.I like the ability to change size of type, but have yet to find a book that will change text to voice. This was one feature that helped me select this e-book over others.Quite pleased over all with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latest Generation Kindle","review":"What a great product. All the advertised features are true. Download speeds are spectacular! Page text image is very clear. Unlike a paper document where I need a strong reading lamp, the Kindlerequires only indirect room light. I also purchased the black leather cover for the Kindle from Amazon - I think a cover should be a standard accessory for the product. The Kindle slipped out of myhand several times before I got the cover. Fortunately the Kindle is quite rugged and it suffered no ill effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon' Kindle","review":"Too pricy.

It advertised text to speech capability for this product; to me the most attractive feature considering its screen only displays gray-scale (no color). Unfortunately Amazon did not stand-up for its consumers and gave in to publisher's demands by making the text to speech feature optional at the discretion of the publisher. It's as ridiculous calling text to speech a derivative product as saying you can't read a book out loud to someone because it's a copyright violation. This decision lacks foresight, responsibility, and that most important value, trustworthiness. I guess I just have to stick to adobe which is happy to provide text to speech on a plain hand-held computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendus","review":"The Amazon Kindle, in all revisions and versions, carries a terribly abusive and restrictive use policy, as well as highly intrusive software. According to Amazon policy, the user of the Kindle may have books or other software removed or altered without their approval or ability to intervene. Such a device is an abomination, as it removes fundamental controls from the hands of the owner. I would not consider purchasing the Kindle unless Amazon removes all DRM (digital rights management) measures from the device, as well as every form of invasive software present on the device, in addition to removing the section allowing such actions from its user agreement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This product has too tight a grip on your ebooks through draconian DRM.

It is a truly innovative device with several amazing features, beyond the ability to take your library anywhere you go. However, it is incredibly fragile. My screen cracked after one month of routine use, carrying it in my backpack, and Amazon charges an outrageous price of $200 to get it fixed (I price I refuse to pay). This might be a good device to leave at your bedside, but then, what's the point of being able to take it with you wherever you go?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon can take your stuff anytime they want.","review":"Because of the DRM inherent in the process of purchasing an e-book from Amazon, they have total control over what you can and cannot do with that book.

I read today that the Barnes & Noble has an ebook out with the above options along with wi-fi downloading. I think the Ebooks once bought should be ours to read on whatever we choose.Not sure that I will buy another Kindle now. I gave 4 stars because the complaint is not with Kindle but with purchasing ebooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Use of Technology","review":"I have now had my Kindle for about 4 days. At first I was a little intimidated by it, but that quickly faded as I began reading. The kindle does totally disappear, it seems no different than a book once you get used to it. It is very comfortable to hold. It has nearly cured my insomnia because I can read right up to the point where I am about to fall asleep and just put it down without worrying about losing my place or even turning it off. I love my kindle, and I couldn't be happier with it. I have no complaints at all. I must also add that just because it seems thin and sleek, it is not delicate...Don't be afraid to just go at it...This thing is solid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great device---very poor corporate decision-making process","review":"The Kindle (I hesitate to call it mine since it obviously belongs to Amazon along with all the content on it) is a great device. However, I'm disappointed that Amazon handled the George Orwell book episode quite poorly. Had they explained the situation before taking action, perhaps everyone would have been more understanding. I do think it was a good lesson---while I knew I was only licensing books, I hadn't fully realized what that meant. As of today, I have canceled all my subscriptions, turned off the wireless, and when the Kindle battery dies or the device breaks, I'll not be buying another. I'll still use Amazon for my book and DVD purchases, but no more digital books, at least not until they work out a better solution than deleting material without some kind of notice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I used to love my Kindle...when I could actually get the books I wanted on it.

I will not recommend the Kindle to anyone again unless Amazon solves their dispute with the publishers.I don't care what the price of a new release on the Kindle is. If it is too expensive, I won't purchase the book. But, I want to have that option. I don't want Amazon deciding that for me. I pre-ordered 5 books that came out in May.

A few titles were listed as unavailable at first, but have since become available.Not only have I saved tons of space on my bookshelf, but I have already saved half the initial price of the Kindle on purchasing books. In South Africa most books (especially new bestsellers) retail at between R150 and R250. With the Kindle, I've paid at most R94 for a book. As an avid reader, those savings really add up. Not only is the Kindle a well-designed and functional device, but it's also a great way to save money.

But when I dropped it a few inches onto the floor, the screen stopped working in one quadrant. It looked like an Etchasketch gone bad. And, I was shocked to learn that it would cost me to replace it. The customer service person was very nice, and indicated that they are delicate devices (it was in a neoprene sheath at the time) but that I was out of luck. She said that if it had damaged itself I could get a replacement at zero cost. I can get a replacement for $200, but I wonder how long that one will last....I've only had this for 3 months!

So, remember that the device costs $359, the cover $29 and the replacement $200. Make sure you are ready to read a book at the cost of close to $600. It doesn't seem worth it does it.

Apparently Amazon has built a hidden backdoor within the Kindle itself that allows them complete and total access to your books without you even being aware, as was demonstrated when Amazon deleted George Orwell's 1984 and Animal Farm from hundreds of Kindle's overnight--just like a thief sneaking into your house and taking your books. Granted, Amazon did refund the purchase price, but does that make it any better considering the Kindle and your e-books are your property and that Amazon basically broke into your house overnight, took your books away and left some cash on your table?

I think it is easier on the eyes and the perfect size and weight for my hands and wrists to effortlessly hold it while reading it anywhere, indoors or even outdoors in the breeze, a few minutes on the bus or on long plane trips and very comfortable when reading in bed, no need to hold the pages back all the time. You can adjust the font size and electronically mark places you may want to go back to later. Very cool features that traditional books don't have.

Even though each device has a unique serial #, and Amazon, from a technological standpoint, COULD easily mark a stolen device as dead, they simply won't do that. Why? Presumably because they're more interested in selling new content to whoever has the stolen device than they are in helping its legitimate purchaser. Perhaps they believe the victim will simply buy another one. It's a deplorable policy that encourages potential Kindle thieves. So consider that before you spend $400."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible- READ!","review":"My wife has a Kindle 1 and liked it so I made the purchase.

It lasted all of two days.My flight was canceled, so now I at least have a chance to return this junk since I had an unexpected additional overnight here.Originally I had bought a Sony Reader in London Duty Fee, a great quality unit. I got home to Moscow and discovered there's no reading material available for it. 100 classics - thanks, I did that in College.Bought the Kindle - great reading selection but the unit is poor quality.Looks like an opening here for Panasonic.

This seems to be the trend, making new releases available later on Kindle or other electronic devices. I hope Amazon and publishers can meet in the middle where pricing is concerned.

That is the phone and email people who told me where to send the defective cord in order to get the correct one. I am so frustated. The warning is that if you get a defective cord, forget being able to use the Kindle. The battery goes dead and so are you!

It's really addictive, even though the books written in Japanese have not been available.One thing I would like to mention about the cons of having the Kindle in Japan is that delivery charge of books and periodicals; amazon says the Kindle comes with FREE wireless delivery, but it might not be true outside of the US.For example, the subscription rate of the New York Times in Japan is $27.99, but that of the New York Times in the US is $13.99.I do understand that Amazon charges us international wireless delivery cost via Amazon Whispernet, but I hope someday in the future that Amazon somehow provides us FREE wireless delivery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM and NSLs","review":"Kindle is a great device, but its implementation in terms of respect for the end user is deeply flawed.Not only does Amazon reserve the right to rescind your purchases, but they can clearly manage and track the contents of your device.One has to wonder what the threshold is on sharing information about customers and Kindles with authorities. You must demand your right to privacy, however narrowly ascribed in the U.S. Constitution.DRM, or digital rights management, means that you do not control your digital content. If you don't control it, then you don't own it.I am a Kindle owner from the earliest iteration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing some things","review":"I thought that the new one had some good stuff, but they took out one of the most important parts and a bunch of small ones that made the difference to me. The Kindle 2 does not have a slot for an SD card and only has 2 GB of memory. I listen to books as well as read them with my Kindle. I want to be able to carry all of my audio books and not have to swap them out. That was the big deal breaker for me. The small things that may be silly but make a difference are that the back on the new one is smooth metal instead of rubber. It slides all over the place. It takes way to long to turn it off (I don't care what they say, that is not 4 seconds.) The first one is way more comfortable in the hand. I returned my Kindle 2 and went back to the Kindle 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"engineering crap with no customer support","review":"Avoid the Kindle. Amazon doesn't properly support it [...].

Don't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still figuring it out","review":"Am very pleased with my Kindle. Actually had some question in my mind about whether I would enjoy it or not, but thus far have been very pleased. Being able to download a book virtually instantaneously is very convenient.

I really liked it, but was even happier once customer customer service credited me the $70 dollar difference from the price drop!The Kindle is good product which does what it is designed to do. I like the built in dictionary and the quick and easy book downloads. The battery life is great. I'm on my second book so far and have only recharged the battery once. It is a pleasure to read, and so far problem free. The basic web functionality is a little tedious, but it's free. I have not yet downloaded any newspapers or magazines but I am happy to have the option available. I have been recommending this product to my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"greener today than yesterday","review":"I was a skeptic, however, I nowhave three newspapers, the bible, six books and two magazines on my kindle.

I really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"20th century subway reading","review":"Being a \\"real\\" book sensation lover (that is, enjoying texture and smell of books) I was very skeptical about being able to have a positive experience with the Kindle. It took me no time to adjust to the comfort, the portability and the ease of use, not to mention the instantaneous access to thousands of titles and other pubs. I still miss the smell and texture of book pages, but I love being able to read using one hand on a crowded subway holding 3 bags... Battery life is excellent as long as one keeps the wireless off when not needed. One opportunity for improvement would be to add a screen lighting mechanism so that one could read in darker areas...All in all, a great investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gadget......... but","review":"Bought this for my wife and mum as they share books on my account.Its a great gadget but.... they are struggling to find the authors they like in the Kindle shop in the UK, hopefully things will improve as people take the plunge,so go ahead and order it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Hesitate....Buy It Now......Great Product","review":"I couldn't be happier. It is so much easier to read than books and you can automatically look up words you don't truly understand. I love the font selection------a larger font allows me to read much faster and with greater ease than the standard small print in books. I have a hunch this may be of assistance to people who suffer with dyslexia. You can highlight, underline, write notes.....what's not to love? And it feels good to be saving our trees from destruction. The purchase of books is seamless and on one occasion I called the amazon kindle helpline and it was very good. This is the future so get on board. If you like to read foreign language books you can also switch the default dictionary-----should be of great help to students in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle, best friend of the international traveler :)","review":"I am an international teacher, who for the last 5 years has taken up huge amounts of shipping/baggage space to cart paper books around the world. Finally, I have purchased a Kindle and I LOVE it! I already have 30 books on the Kindle and it ended up taking up less space than one paper book. It is fantastic and there is a great selection of eBooks to buy. I highly recommend the Kindle to anyone who travels frequently or moves a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied New Kindle User!","review":"Although I am a new user to the Kindle family,(just a month) I have to say that I thoroughly enjoy reading books this new way. No longer having to cart pounds of books with me on vacation or even one book in my handbag is one big avantage. I visited my library regularly every week or two but now find downloading books from the Kindle selection is just great.....no getting into the car.....no longer checking due dates etc. I simply go to my computer and download books. So far I ordered only the Kindle Free books. I was so surprised to see so many of the bestsellers on the Free books list. I'm sure in the future I'll order from their discounted cost list, but now I am enjoying the variety and number of free books.The Kindle is easy to use, and only after using it for a short time, I found myself very comfortable moving from each area, menu to home etc. I hightly recommend this product. Also, Amazon's website is certainly very user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you can get AT&T wirelesss before you buy","review":"I had planned and anticipated FINALLY getting my Kindle. I was disappointed beyond words when I could never get any connection on it. The answer was that AT&T wireless does not work in the area where I live. The customer service rep wasn't thinking clearly when she suggested I not send it back, but rather connect it to my computer with the USB cable...I have a beautiful 17\\" flatscreen moniter and have Kindle installed on my computer. Whatever reason would I choose to use an expensive 6\\" device other than the free larger display when I would be anchored to my computer anyway? The end is that Verison is right about limited AT&T coverage. I'm sure this is a wonderful product, but don't make my mistake--check to make certain you can get service before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfair price change","review":"About one week after I bought the Kindle, they dropped the price $50. I understand Amazon's policy of not changing prices in most cases, but I do not think it applies here. Since the Kindle is their toy, the price was not based upon the supply. It is arbitrary.So I am angry about this and it has reflected how I feel about the device. Otherwise, I am pleased with it, except for the incidents with the cover. When I went to purchase a cover, I read that the covers can actually break the Kindle if opened from the back. How can such a poorly designed product be sold?

However 15 months after I got it it inexplicably stopped working. I contacted a Kindle customer service representative who told me to restart it. When that failed, she said she could send me a new one for a $135 service fee. I got this as a gift, but my dad spent $350 on my Kindle (bought it when they first came out). I've probably spent $500 for books in the past 15 months. And the only solution they have to offer is for me to pay $135 for a new one, when their machine only lasts 15 months???? I am telling you, as I tell all my friends, go to B&N or buy an iPad. Unless you're into throwing away money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I really love the Kindle 2. It's lightweight and easy to take anywhere. And when you do take it anywhere, it's easy to get almost any book you need instantly.I really love that I can email Word documents to myself. This is easier than reading them on my computer. PDFs have worked pretty well for me also.Screen is good and the battery life works well, since it is based on the number of pages you display rather than time. You can go on vacation and, unless you read a ton, probably do it on a single charge.Worth the money to me. Makes it easy to read and, as I mentioned, much better than using the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE...DO NOT BUY A KINDLE!!!","review":"I just got the Kindle. I'ts basically a simple computer with a black and white screen and bad keyboard. But aside from the crappy feel of the thing, here is the important stuff you need to know:Soon there will be COMMERCIALS and ADVERTISING between the pages of your books if you buy a Kindle. If you are ok with that, buy a Kindle. But soon there will be POP-UP ADS just like the internet.

I was excited when I opened it, but I couldn't anticipate just how much I would like using it. It's thinner than a paperback, so I can carry it in my purse, ready for unexpected down time, like waiting in a doctor's office. The screen reads like print on paper, not a computer screen so it's easy on the eyes and can be read outdoors with no problem. It's very easy to use and books download in a matter of seconds. It will be perfect for travel. After having it for a month, I wouldn't give it up for anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much over hyped","review":"It is just another ereader. I have four because of the DRM imposed by most sellers.The lack of external storage is a minus.

Is it seriously to make us buy extra leads??Why on earth doesn't it have wi-fi??The GUI simply isn't there yet, but perhaps we've been spoilt because Amazon doesn't have a visionary fanatic like Steve Jobs at it's helm.The ability to see the wish list would be nice and not-so-difficult for Amazon to achieve.The way newspapers are currently laid out, I really don't think newspaper-reading is going to take-off yet.I'm a UK buyer and I'm also upset that I can't use the browser!Overall disappointed at Amazon's 2nd effort, I'm glad competittors are arriving because hopefully that will spur Amazon to produce a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen Died","review":"The screen died after 15 months. One year warranty--so pretty convenient for Amazon. Amazon will not fix but requires me to either buy a new Kindle or a refurbished one that only comes with a 90-day warranty.

I love it!! I am an avid book reader, so the thought of always having books with me and being able to download more wirelessly thrilled me. The kindle is easy to use and has good battery life. I do think that it is a bit awkward to hold and that it SHOULD have been back lit. You have to position it just right to get enough light on it to read without hurting your eyes. I'll have to get a book light for it, but that's not a big deal. Overall, great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall, Sony eReader is a better product","review":"I recently wanted to replace my old Sony eReader so read all kinds of specs and reviews on both the Kindle and the newest eReader. I decided to go with the newest eReader and have not been at all disappointed. While the eReader does not offer wireless download of books as of yet, it does offer other features that I value more. One is the addition of the embedded reading light. I LOVE this feature! No more monkeying around trying to attach a regular book light to my reader. I also really like the touch screen. It comes with a stylus or you may simply use your fingers. I also like that I can download from Google books (I don't believe this is an option with the Kindle).Do your homework and decide which attributes you value most before you make a purchase. Many features are the same on both devices- a crisp clear screen with changeable fonts, etc.I would highly recommend the Sony eReader, especially the newer version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opps","review":"I purchased a Gen 1 Kindle and liked it so much I decided to purchase the next generation for my wife and Opppps, a big mistake. For one we found the battery is NOT user replacable, the screen is not back lit making it difficult to read outdoors and the media is not compatible with gen 1, requiring an \\"conversion\\" making the media incompatible with Gen 1.. There is no provision for a memory card as there is on Gen 1, making media storage problematic when we travel. And lastly we couldn't Jump ahead without scrolling page by page. My wife complained about the placement of side buttons. She said it wasn't as balanced as the generation 1 Kindle. I returned it for a refund and will look at the other e-book products for my wife. Lastly, at the price of this Kindle I expected at least a cover to be included with the unit. I just spent close to 400.00, to ask me to spend and extra 50.00 on a cover just rubs me the wrong way."},{"rating":"1","title":"inadequate library","review":"I have yet to find a book that is available on kinkdle.

I would like to, but it lacks one feature which I find necessary before I own one.The suggestion is to include a stylus in the kindle, so that one can take notes, highlight, and otherwise annotate pdf's as one would a book. Being able to \\"write in the margins\\" so to speak, with one's own handwriting, would make the kindle a must have device.Also, this feature would allow me to take notes in class or keep a kind of on-the-go journal, and would get rid of carrying all the bulky paper that I do now.This technology cannot be THAT difficult to implement (it has been around for over 10 years), and I do not understand why it is not an integral component of the kindle, as it would bring its relationship to normal paper even closer.Does anyone else have the same opinion?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Prized Possession","review":"With so many reviews I wasn't even going to bother writing one myself but I want to say that this is my prized possession.

I am in awe of the ease of use with only the use of one hand. Press a button to page fwd or backward; always return to where I left off and never have to worry about pages closing on me. And to shop in the Kindle store by author or book title and download my purchase in less than 60 seconds, is unbelievable. Font sizes are selectable and enhance the joy of reading in total comfort. And I always have my books with me as I carry my Kindle in my purse, to read whenever I desire, to read a little or read a lot.

It is light weight, easy to use, and convenient to bring along anywhere. I originally purchased the larger model, but returned it because it was a little too large for me to bring along everywhere with me. My first thought when using the Kindle, was that it would be great for students(i.e. college or upper level high school). The ability of note taking and footnoting right in the text of the book would be great for writing research papers. Another plus is that my house is no longer filling with used books!

Since the iPad came out, I can only hope that (a) Amazon has sold -0- Kindles and (b) Bezos will drop the price when he has something else at an equal or higher price point that he thinks will dazzle us. By this shameless $259 attempt to gouge, which I hope is going nowhere, he is also showing contempt for his loyal customers.

Amazon's hype made me think the time had come. The one unambiguously positive thing I have to say about the Kindle is the 90-second download. The theoretical benefit of having a paperless library has not materialized for me because I can't read anything on the Kindle. The reading experience is drab and the text-to-voice option is ghastly. The text from the Canterbury Tales I recently purchased comes as one long uninterupted flow : there are no page breaks between the Middle English pages and the Modern English ones and the text therefore toggles without warning between the two every few stanzas. Similarly unpleasant experience reading Shakespeare. Big fan of and spender on Amazon, but can't provide a positive review : I have yet to finish one single book on the Kindle & would gladly sell it. If you like to read, get a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty (and Kindle) Worthless","review":"Wow - I went from being a big fan to very unhappy in the space of a morning.

An e-book just isn't as valuable as a hardback, at least I can sell the hardback later and get some of my money back. If the price raises on e-books I won't but them anymore.

The screen is so very easy on the eyes and I can set the font size so I don't need my reading glasses. I have really come to enjoy the 'Read it to me' feature as I just read along with it and I find that it maintains the pace at which I read as before I might drift away from the story for a short time and need to re-read that section. It is easy to hold and I find it much easy when reading in bed since the thick paperbacks are hard to comfortably read when propped up on one arm.The reason I say Love Hurts is that I purchased these Kindles for USD$259 and soon after the price dropped markedly to USD$189. It would have been nice for Amazon to say - as a thank you for being an early adopter in this growing market, we'll offer you an extra 20% off your next 10 e-books. I would love it more in that case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fragile","review":"I have owned 7 kindles, only one was an upgrade, the rest were replacements (some purchased, some provided by Amaszon). I use a cover and am not particularly hard on them. They are just too fragile. After the last incidents (the screen froze on mine and my son broke his screen by putting very little pressure on it while it was in its case) I will not be using the Kindle again. I have been a loyal user since August 2008 and appreciate all of the features and the ease of reading, but will not continue to negotiate with Amazon on whether the latest problem warrents a replacement or whether I have to buy a new one. I have spent over $1,000 on Kindles and currently don't have one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great customer service","review":"As many people have already said, the kindle is awesome, but i wanted to give this five stars for the customer service. My kindle screen broke this morning when my kindle slipped and hit my desk. Obviously a bad way to start a day. I called amazon right away, and after a couple minutes trying to troubleshoot over the phone, they realized it was broken and are sending a new one next day air, and sending me a prepaid return shipping label.

If Amazon will cave on this decision, what other feature will they disable in the future?Is this the kind of support I can expect from the company the next time they are faced with a tough choice?I strongly urge you to reconsider buying this device having heard this news.

She gets tapes from the State Library but the selection is very slim and boring. Shame on Amazon (where I spend a sizable amount of money) for not having the bases covered on such an important issue.

Scary, scary big brother society."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle---an object lesson in DRM (Digital Restrictions Management)","review":"Unfortunately, books you \`\`buy'' for the Kindle are not yours. They can be taken away from you at any time. Witness Amazon's \`\`disappearing'' of (ahem!) _1984_ and _Animal Farm_ last week. (Just Google for \`\`amazon 1984''.)It turns out those books were removed because they are still copyrighted in the U.S. (Though not in Canada, among other countries.)This changes the situation not in the least. It matters not _why_ the books were removed. All that counts is that they _were_ removed. Amazon can do this with any book, at any time, for any reason. Ask Amazon for a refund. (For an example of a true horror story, look at the first one-star review.)Don't kid yourself---you don't buy books for Kindle, you rent them for an indeterminate length of time.

Conveniently, outside of the 1 year warranty period and POOF! No more screen. Despite being careful and keeping in its protective leather carryall, my Kindle bit the dust. Now my options from Amazon are buy a new Kindle 2 or buy a refurbished Kindle for $180.All of a sudden the shine and sheen of the new ebook isn't so glamorous. I love the convenience but if they can't make a product that can last for little more than a year, another failed attempt to replace the tried and true -- at least my book won't fail after a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Planned obsolescence","review":"My kindle is in immaculate condition--screen protectors, never out of the case, never off of my night-stand. One day, a massive screen glitch appears in the top left-hand corner of the screen that prevents reading. Now I have a over a year's worth of digital content rendered useless unless I purchase a new device. Naturally, it's out of warranty by 2 months, so Amazon will not replace the kindle, but assures me that the information I have given them will help them improve kindles in the future. This is little consolation considering all my digital purchases are illegible. I will not be purchasing a replacement, and I will never buy \\"digital\\" books again. The DRMs prevent you from owning the material and every book you buy is dependent on a machine that will probably break down a few short months after the warranty expire, coercing you to buy another over-priced reading device. My advice after 14 months of use--buy books and avoid the e-book scam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Kindle!!","review":"The Kindle is the best purchase I have made all year!!So easy to use.

My main purpose in purchasing the Kindle was because we travel a lot and with the restriction of bags by airlines we no longer have to carry ten to fifteen books or purchase them wherever we are and then leave them behind.

The case was not dropped nor was anything stacked on it.The dramatic video of the Kindle being dropped 30 inches is now somewhat suspicious.Amazon will replace for $200 and return of the failed unit, but I am now very concerned about its apparent fragility and Amazon's failure of responsibility for an expensive device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Kindle Household","review":"I received a Kindle when they first hit the market, and I loved mine so much that I bought my husband and son their own Kindle 2s.

The only thing that I don't like about it is that there is no light on it so if you want to read and not disturb your spouse you have to buy a book light. And the one other thing is that its hard for a physically challenged person to navigate the device without assistance,because so many people have come up to me and stated how they would love to get it for a mother,sister,father ,but they are afraid that they wouldn't be able to turn the pages because sometimes you do have to hit it a little hard.

I am moving to Germany soon, so want to limit items to move and store. Being an avid reader, I was running out of space at home anyway, so Kindle was a perfect solution for me. I am saving up books to read there, the books are generally less expensive than buying new, and I don't have to find a place to keep them. My only complaint is there is no good place for me to hold it for reading, I've had to adjust. I'm always bumping the next page button by accident, but it appears they have changed that for the new version. I have recommended the Kindle to many friends and family already, and it is definitely a must-have item for me from now on.Update: I just got the new Global version, and I love, love, love it! Even my gadget-loving husband is a big fan already. I find it more comfortable to hold now, and I love the thinner, cleaner look.

Unacceptable!","review":"I just received my Kindle 2 and while I think there is much to like about it, the fact that it does not allow the user to create folders and manage their own content is a HUGE, HUGE drawback in my opinion. You can't separate your fiction from your non-fiction. You can't separate your history from your philosophy. What good is having 1500 MB of space when you can't organize your content the way you want to? Leaving out such an obvious feature is so STUPID it is mind-boggling. Get a bunch of books and you just end up with clutter, since you can't organize except according to Author, Title, or Recently Read. Who wants to thumb through page after page to find the book they want?The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability."},{"rating":"2","title":"best present ever","review":"I bought this for my wife as a mother's day gift & she has not been able to put it down !! she loves it !!so many books & so easy to use , it seems that every day she is finding something else to love about it , I think the dictionary is one of the most surprisingly useful features .

Only a couple of niggles - the inability to give another Kindle owner a book is frustrating and frankly a bizarre omission as it would dramatically increase the already huge number of ebooks Amazon sell especially over the festive season.

I downloaded a bold font hack that makes it a little better, and I'm going order a dark skin to see if that helps. Also a negative: the screen DOES reflects sunlight and lamplight; need to get an antiglare screen. From what I've read, the screen isn't an uncommon problem.So lots of pros to having a Kindle.

The font size of the PDF files that you down load into Kindle 2 is about 2. You need 20x magnification to read them.The statement that Kindle 2 can read PDF file reminds me of the ad where a little girl is sitting on a bicycle inside a small marked area. When she complains that you can't ride a bike in this little area, the man who offered her the ride tells her you can't ride well in this area.

Maybe this is due to copyright laws over here, I don't know,but the limited range of downloadable books made the KIndle of limited use to me, so I returned it.The price of downloadable books was too high as well - I'd check out the prices before you buy a Kindle.

The reason? The publisher changed its mind about offering an electronic version. Does the doctrine of first sale apply here? Apparently not, according to Amazon. It seems that rather than buying a copy of the book, this megacorp interprets the sale as one of license, which they can remove at any time, willy-nilly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as promoted!!!!!!","review":"On March 20th I received my Kindle 2. On Saturday evening, March 21st, I dropped it from the wash basin in the bathroom to the ceramic tile floor. That destroyed it!! It will not work and Amazon will do nothing to replace it. In their promotion on their web page, they demonstrate a 30\\" fall and it supposedly still works. Mine fell about the same height and it doesn't.I can have it replaced for an additional $200.00 resulting in an inflated final cost of $559.00. I guess I will just use it for a conversation piece...a very expensive paperweight. Apparently Amazon is not the user friendly organization they would like us to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out Non-US Customers","review":"I ordered a Kindle from Germany, worked well in principle. The Kindle is very slow from the reaction time to key presses, typing on the keyboard is almost impossible.But what is teh worst thing I have had with Amazon was the return process of the device: I had to send it back, because the battery didn't charge properly after 3 days of operation. Usually a normal process: you send it back, get a new one - period. I went to the website, printed a return label, thought I would order a replacement - but that didn't work out! 5 (!) differnt people were telling me, that I didn't order a replacement Kindle, since this is impossible, I should call them (welcome to the 21st century!). I insisted, that I a) printed a return label and sent it back (btw: it's 15 EUR from Europe!) b) ordered a replacement, which they denied.So, we agreed upon a full refund, which I hope is going to take place.So Non-US Customers beware: in case you have a warranty issue, you will be lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I love this thing!

Why on earth would anyone want a laptop without a keyboard?I find myself reading a lot more with the Kindle and there's not fatigue or eye-strain. I love this machine and thank Amazon for creating it.My only hopes are that Amazon introduce a slightly faster processor so there isn't that one second delay when turning pages and that the lose the physical keyboard for an on-screen keyboard - that would also give Amazon a chance to increase the screen real estate.But other than that - the perfect toy !!!

And I'm finishing books too--always a problem. It's so easy to read on the go. I download books when I find something that strikes my fancy and the diversity of subject matters increased too. Biggest complaint is that more books aren't available. I'm not a big fan of bestsellers like Stephen King or James Patterson--rather more obscure histories and social commentary.

I have looked through the lists of available books, and while there is a large selection, I thought it a bit limited in my areas of interest. I live in Canada. Most of the sleeves or protective coverings available for the Kindle listed on Amazon.com aren't shipped to Canada . I have to order for Amazon.ca and they have a really lousy selection of covers.

Now that I have a toddler and a baby on the way, I find it difficult to cart books around all the time! The Kindle has simplified my life. I now have all of my books on one, slim device that I can easily carry around with me everywhere. It works as advertised -- crisp, e-paper display, easy to use buttons, wireless, instant delivery, and just an all around pleasant reading experience.I have taken note of some of the downfalls people have mentioned, but they aren't a big deal to me. The lack of expandable storage isn't a problem because who actively reads 1500+ books at once? And the inability to change the batteries is a great convenience feature, in my opinion!My advice to anyone considering this purchase is to go for it. It doesn't feel like you're reading from a screen, the book selection is awesome, there are free books offered all the time, and the price has dropped dramatically lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Device!","review":"I got a Kindle for Christmas, and I don't think I've read as much in three days in a long time. It works as advertised and virtually disappears during reading. No, the contrast doesn't rival good books (more akin to old paperbacks or newsprint), but the ability to size and space text to fit a reading style/speed is great.I do wish there were some first-party book organization/sync software (similar to itunes) available and bundled with it, but there are some decent third-party solutions for that. I also wish there were more customizable settings for font/spacing/alignment. Battery life seems to be shorter than advertised, given that I'm down 25% after the last recharge (a half day of reading).Page turns are much quicker than other e-readers and become completely unobtrusive, and the ergonomics are miles ahead of the competitors, even the recently-released ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"My third Kindle","review":"My family is sold on the Kindle.

I just read 3 books over my week-long vacation, something I would have never have done with paper books. The convenience of being able to pull down a new book wherever you are makes it amazing. Additionally, the fact that most books for the Kindle are priced at 1/2 of what you'd pay for the paperback / hardback, means that after reading about 35 books, you'll have it paid off.The only thing that keeps it from being a 5-Star, Perfect Product, is that the interface is still a little sluggish, but most importantly, the contrast ratio just isn't up to snuff. I'm not sure why they can't get black text on a white background, because then it'd be a whole lot easier to read.

Turning pages is quick and I never lose my place or book mark when I turn it off. It is a four star all the way! The only negative is the \\"back\\" button which does not work.

However, after reading that Amazon has (at their discretion) remotely deleted purchased books (that's right, you buy the book, and then at some point later Amazon decides you can't have it anymore), not only will I not be picking one up, or recommending this device to anyone, but quite to the contrary, I will be advising people NOT to purchase the Kindle until Amazon drops all DRM on the device and releases the Kindle's software as free software.This a truly sad state for what could have been such a wonderful device"},{"rating":"1","title":"problematic platform design.","review":"The kindle has the potential to be a great platform, but is unfortunately defective by design, and uses DRM.

Mind you, I have never dropped the thing, the screen and everywhere else has not even a scratch, only the plastic contact point where it's held together. Somehow, according to Amazon.com, this is MY fault and in no way a defect of design or manufacturing.Seriously? Three months old and this $360[!] Chinese made flimsy piece of plastic starts to hairline fracture and the only responsibility Amazon will take is a \`discounted' repairing of it to the tune of $200."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheated","review":"On June 17 I ordered a Kindle with all the pre-Father's Day hype for free shipping.

In Kindle, you can just move the cursor to the word and the definition will appear at the bottom of the screen. That is a very important feature to me. I can read more in much less time.

Its easy to use, easy to take with you just about anywhere. The kindle 2 has just 2 flaws with it that I found. 1. It needs some way of lighting the screen for reading in areas with bad lighting, perhaps some type of back lighting for the screen. 2. The Text to Speech feature needs some fine tuning, It doesn't recognize some words and miss pronounces other words. It also doesn't recognize Roman Numerals. When starting a new chapter it doesn't notify you that it is starting a new chapter. It just continues reading like one big run on sentence. Over all I like the Kindle 2. I am a truck driver and I take my kindle on the road with me. I use a device that plugs into the headphone jack and it play on the stereo in my truck when I use the Text to Speech feature.This way when I can't read cause I am driving I let the Kindle 2 read to me.

James, T. Hardy, Thackeray, Trollope, Wilde, etc., etc., etc.), which was the main reason why I bought my Kindle.

The kindle is stable but where the plastic meets the brushed steel can feel a bit weak at times.My one regret is not waiting for the new kindle generation to come out. Not because of anything I'm missing with mine, but because they have a Wifi only edition. I am going to Korea and the wireless fees to use Whispernet there aren't necessarily cheap. So, while in Korea, I will not be using the 3g anymore, I will be using the USB cable to download my books from the site.

I purchased the Kindle and have to admit that I love it! This is a device that I use everyday, whether I'm at home or in a hotel. It is so convenient to take with me anywhere.

I do recommend this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, completely unimpressed ...","review":"First, I'm a huge Amazon fan, an Amazon Prime customer for several years. So, it pains me to put this in writing.I was totally unimpressed with the Kindle 2 and returned it to Amazon with a two page letter explaining my disappointment - which I won't repeat here.Besides the fact that it didn't work (my NY Times - Daily News not only didn't update \\"several times a day\\" the way it was advertised to, it didn't even update once a day). Tech support (speaking Irish) was helpful - sort of.The user interface was totally unimpressive, the controls flimsy, the display only so-so.Sorry Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle 2","review":"Am I going to recieve a $ 60.00 credit for the new pricing you sent out right after my purchase???

I guess there is something to be said for \\"holding a real book in your hands\\", but I would much rather have the convenience of having my library at my fingertips wherever I go.

When traveling by plane it is so easy to just pull it out of my purse. I also like to take it when I dine alone. It is so easy to eat a meal and just have to push one button to turn a page.

While there is a legitimate rationale for what Amazon did--the book in question was out of copyright in the nation in which it was issued, but not so under American copyright law--it does not change the fact that Amazon has shown that, when it feels there is suitable cause, it can and will alter the contents of your kindle and so whatever you buy for your kindle will remain yours only at the sufferance of Amazon.I sympathize with Amazon's position, however the action they took has invalidated them as a trustworthy purveyor of digital goods."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's DRM infected","review":"1.

Amazon's software allows them not only to delete books at any time, but also to cripple them -- as they did recently when they disabled the \\"read aloud\\" Text to Speech feature on already purchased titles.4.

It's funny; I picked up a paperback I had on my desk - black lettering on WHITE paper. I picked up a USA Today, black lettering, WHITE paper.

If Amazon ever get their act together maybe one day I'll actually own one and then I will happily review it!Oh and by the way, I did send emails to the customer service dept where I got equally ridiculous replies from, oh and was the customer service up to scratch reviews...."},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle- download a book from home- NOT","review":"before purchasing a kindle please,please,please check the area coverage map and then please dont beleive it. i do not live in a cave nor do i live deep in the woods nor do i live in a valley i CAN NOT down load a book in my home the customer service agents i have called told me to go to town to down load a book. the next level of support the whispernet experts have taken much information but still NO COVERAGE TO MY HOME. so check the competition first. not a happy customer...yvonne"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prices of books up 50%??!!","review":"I am very concerned after reading that major publishers are pulling the plug on electronic book versions at amazon, and will no longer honor the $9.99 price for bestsellers. Apparently, the prices will increase to somewhere around $15.99 from what I have read. Thus, purchasing a book at that price dramatically reduces the savings (or may even result in paying more than you can purchase a current title at Costco and elsewhere) from hardcover prices. It would take a great many purchases at $15.99 to realize the payback on the inital cost of buying a new kindle (I have a secondhand one). Too, bad if you purchased without knowing of the book price increases."},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE","review":"IT WAS OK BUT NOT EASY TO READ IN SUN LIGHT AND IT DOE,S NOT GIVE ALL THE NEWS PAPER IT IS NOT LIKE READING A PAPER IN YOUR HANDS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fills A Gap","review":"I like the Kindle 2 because it enables me to easily bring a variety of reading material with me in a compact form factor and fill in gaps of time productively.

It would re-write the textbooks and destroy the old ones with the forbidden information. Now it's that much easier. Amazon can remove the books you buy, without explanation.Imagine how easy it would have been for Hitler had he been able to simply press \\"delete\\" and whole sections of literature had disappeared?

If you buy this, just be aware that you are paying for content you will never own, cannot control, and which Amazon can take back from you at ANY time without asking your permission. With this device and DRM they do not have to burn books anymore - why waste matches and paper when they can just erase it in a flash? Better still, change the content so that you only get to read what they want you to read. Like the idea? Then you will make a good Little Brother or Sister to Big Brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"FREE the Kindle","review":"I love my Kindle but with what has happend with the 1984 incident I don't trust Amazon to not do this in the future.

I havent' stopped using it since it arrived. What a wonderful invention. Its easy to use and so light (when out of its cover). I thought it would take me awhile to get use to it, but after checking out some book extracts or two I didnt realise it wasnt a paper book. I find it so much easier than a clunky thick book, especially reading the first couple of chapters, as my hand would always get sore trying to hold the conventional book open at a page. My husband use to complain to me when I read in bed at night that the noise of turning pages often woke him up. With the Kindle its just a quick press of a button. I just love it and cant wait for more book titles to be added, especially in the science-fiction/fantasy categories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Impressions","review":"The Kindle's technology is fine, although a larger screen and higher contrast would be nice. But the book offer - in Europe - is really disappointing.The large majority of the books that interest me are available in the US only. I understand it's a copyright issue, but if Amazon can sell me a printed copy from the US, why not a digital one?I cannot even use it as a web reader, as all sites except Wikipedia are blocked.Unless these issues are solved, the Kindle remains a nice gadget, not really value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain text and lack of choice","review":"I bought the Kindle for use in Ireland. I have been very disappointed with the selection of books, magazines and newspapers. Most content is not available in Europe or at least in Ireland.

I'd even considered having a family member bring back one from the US.Unfortunately Amazons decision to use DRM technology and the recent news that they had deleted legitimately purchased copies of the works of George Orwell (1984 & Animal Farm - how ironic!) from owners devices, has put paid to that idea. Until Amazon renounces DRM technology, I will actively dissuade any friends, family or work colleagues from purchasing this device.

When you are finished with a hardback book, you can pass it on to a friend. Not so with the Kindle editions. The line of distribution has so many economies with the Kindle (no printing a big inventory, no paper to stock, no gluing, no levels of distribution) but the price savings is too small to justify especially since you give up the right to resell or to give the book away. Someone is being too greedy. Why should we cooperate?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"Funny that I receive this automated request for a review the day after our Kindle acts up.

I find the Wireless Reading Device a wonderful tool and library for anyone interested in reading and buying books. The process is very simple and one can purchase a book within 60 seconds by a click of a button, it's delivered to your Kindle. What a small gadget to carry with and read anywhere. The best out of it is that you can access the Amazon stores from Africa wirelessly.I am rating it with four stars only because I cannot use the internet facility for my private use. The internet can only be used to purchase books at Amazon stores, and by that denying users access to the worldwide web. I am looking forward to opening up the internet facility for private use, and then my rating will go up. However, it is something every reader who has the means ought to buy. I am enjoying mine, and recommending others to go for it. No regrets, it's lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE my kindle!","review":"I don't have time for a lengthy review (lucky for you), but suffice it to say that this is the best thing since sliced bread!

It is very easy to search for and download purchases using Whispernet. I was surprised by this, since I thought I would have to connect it to my computer to download books (like an iPod). It is GREAT for traveling! No need to stock my carry-on with heavy books, and when I finish one book, I don't need to find a book store or a computer, I just download the next one. The screen is easy to read and comfortable on the eyes, which I was originally worried about. The only downside I see is that I sometimes miss the feel of flipping pages of a paper book, or the smell of the pages of a new book. I guess my bookshelves at home will not look as impressive, but the ease of use far outweighs these small personal preferences."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new Kindle 2","review":"I'm not much of a reader and I fought against buying one of these devices but along comes the Kindle 2 and after reading many reviews I finally broke down and bought one.

Well it did just that. I have had it now a month and I've found so many gems in the book world. I love that I can take it anywhere with me and it always knows where I left off. I also have the iphone app so I can juggle between the two depending on where I am and what I'm doing. I can read the same book on both devices and they both know where I left off with the other.

The new version promises to be lighter, faster, 50% better contrast and holds more than twice as many books as my version.

Therefore, since the launch of the Kindle in the US I had been waiting enviously for it to be available in Europe as well.And I was not disappointed when the device finally was delivered to my house - in an incredibly speedy manner, I have to add.It's everything I expected and more: easy-to-read display, the perfect weight (not too light, not to heavy), optimal size (fits in a normal handbag), easy to use and to handle. My only complaint would be about the boring colour but I guess you can't have everything.Downloading books and newspapers is easy and quick and you can also very easily transfer text files from your computer to the device.

It's morally indefensible unless Amazon's capability and general intent to do so on near-whimsical grounds was painted in glowing neon letters on page 1 of any purchaser agreement.When you sell something Amazon...SELL IT. Or refer to it honestly as, say, an extended rental.It's this Orwellian capability, (an irony no one has overlooked), open to MANY forms of abuse, which is a primary cause for concern.

This is just unacceptable.

The reading is very pleasant and user friendly and the device is lightweight and compact. The only thing lacking is good viewing of illustrations.Reading a newspaper is very convenient and Kindle along with my notebook have allowed us to eliminate home delivery of our daily newspaper.

They even deleted the personal notes of a high school student, taken while reading 1984.This power to control the exchange of ideas is unacceptable in a free society.Amazon's assurances that it will refrain from the worst abuses of this power do not address the problem. Amazon should not have this power in the first place. Until they give it up they will be tempted to use it, or they could be forced to by governments or narrow private interests.

After receiving the Kindle I immediately downloaded the saga. It was inexpensive, fast and I was able to start reading right away.I LOVE MY KINDLE.

The books really do download in less than a minute and are reasonably priced at around $9.99 for new releases and much less for older editions.

It was easy enough to use, easy to purchase books but just didn't like reading on it. I found the delay in turning pages to be distracting at first and then just plain annoying. I purchased a cover for it when I first bought the Kindle and tried using it both ways. I found it very uncomfortable to hold for any length of time without the cover on. The charge on the battery ended up not being as long as I had hoped for. Also, a lit screen would have been much better to read with.Overall, if the Kindle had been less expensive, I might have held on to it but there were just too many negatives to justify the $359 price tag.

I hope future devices will also be able to render book illustrations, magazine charts, etc.Some suggestions for future kindle devices: (1) bring back the SD Card slot, (2) re-design the joystick button, (3) consider using a cell phone keyboard, and (4) for research purposes it would be helpful to tell what the actual page number is not just a digital location, so one can acurately footnote sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Reading","review":"What a wonderful way to read! Much more intimate than a traditional book, the Kindle 2 disappears in your hands and what is left is a pure reading experience.

I sure hope the kindle is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon's Pricing Structure is Not Customer Friendly.","review":"The device is well built and the selection of books is quite abundant. You need to buy all of your publications from the same vendor Amazon, or you have to use third party software like Calibre to convert the formats.

I originally purchased it for an overseas trip. It was great at first, but it wasn't long before the screen fritzed out on me. Now I have an expensive piece of junk. That, combined with the fact that you have to pay to convert any free content you download from a non-Amazon site to the acceptable Kindle readable format, makes this product a very bad investment in my opinion. If you really want an e-reader, I suggest checking out Barnes & Noble's Nook. That's what I'll be getting as soon as I can afford to purchase another e-reader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waitng for the Mac version eBook","review":"Having read the negative reviews about Amazon's Kindle 1 and 2, I choose to wait to see what the folks at Apple will roll out on this front.

Until then, paper and ink works fine for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY OVERPRICED","review":"This is WAY OVERPRICED at $359. I wouldn't bat an eye at paying $159 for it but they'll never sell me one for $359. Great product that they're trying to gouge the consumer for. Amazon will sell many hundreds, or thousands, of dollars on the content downloaded to it. That is where the money is and you can't get that money if you price them out of getting the hardware itself. This is the convenience stores loss leader setting outside where you got your gas. The books you'll buy are the pure profit coffee you bought inside when you stopped there to save a penny a gallon on the gas.

Cons - having to fight my husband for it, not having a \\"sense\\" of where I am in the book (I want to know I'm on page 135 of 200 or 1500!, putting printers out of work).I'm concerned the page forward/back buttons will be a weak link, but only time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied with my reading device","review":"I am very confortable with my reading device.

If true, I would expect this to be a concern for any potential customers - Regardless of any promises or TOS fine print.

Similarly, it's difficult to move the 5-way button left, right, up, or down without pushing it in, the fifth switch of the button. I think all of the buttons should be smaller, to leave the rest of the area for easy holding of the unit. These are serious flaws in a second version.

I love that the Kindle is lightweight and easy to read whether indoors or outside. I also love the convenience of buying and downloading a book immediately. I used to panic when I was coming to the end of one book and didn't have a back up book. Now I can shop on Amazon and purchase a book anytime. The prices of the books are also very reasonable.I thought I would miss turning the pages and holding a book in my hand but I don't. Just make sure you purchase a waterproof cover if you plan on reading in the bathtub. You may not think you will drop the kindle but you never know.

It is also very difficult to set up for someone else (I bought this as a gift).The Kindle2 does show the text well. Not sure why there is no backlighting capability (you need to turn on a light when it's dark). Also because of the key pad on the device, the screen itself is small.It is fun to use. It is fun to use in public places so people ask you \\"what's that?\\" However, you lose the ability to share books with your friends. A book on your Kindle stays on your Kindle, never to be shared.

You must go page by page through the first volume to get to the second volume and I presume on and on. Can you imagine that?! I give that crippled book a zero. Back to my hard copy of Poe's works.

What will the rest of the world do to access knowledge and information when their rudimentary village generators won't even stay on for more than 4 hours at a time? E-books and computers won't do it!

Every time I go to the bookstore to find my book of choice I see that it's not available and I can let the publisher know that I'd really love to read it on my kindle but what do I do in the meantime? An example: The Brothers Karamazov-Dostoevsky-translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. It's not available. Now with this book you don't want to read just any old translation. So I wonder when it's going to be available and in the meantime I guess I'll just thumb through some inferior translation and hope for the best? Nope, I'm not going to do that. UGH!!!!

Before the Kindle I used my iphone for reading with the eReader program. The pages turn smoothly and very fast.

In deciding to purchase an electronic reader I looked at several criteria to arrive at the Kindle2. I wanted a unit that stored many books, audiobooks, mp3's, and documents. Also of importance is the ease of use. In addition, the construction and design of the unit is important. Is it rugged? Is it attractive? Do the accessories meet my needs? In short, the Kindle2 met all of those requirements and more. Further, I read much more, much faster, and with less eye strain. I attend Master's International School of Divinity which requires a great deal of reading and the K2 makes it very easy to do so. My only complaint would be the absence of an integrated light to read at night. I am sure the K3 will address that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon Kindle Australian Model and leather case","review":"I find it excellent but would like to have the model with bigger screen.Also when having finished reading a book and wish to delete it there seems to be no mechanism for doing it.Leather case is excellent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Will be quickly replaced by a better technology","review":"Seen the device.

This is the exact reason people download music illegally! How about giving customers what they want for a change?

I am delicate person and the screen is broken and the case has a crack after just a few months.4. Contrast is low. The background is too gray and is not white like paper.5.

So getting a huge discount on another one which might last a year seems like I would be throwing good money after bad. And it's a shame because I love the idea behind it, but I am now disillusioned with the whole package and I don't know that I would recommend it to others simply because the kindle is not inexpensive and if the technology isn't improved in succeeding generations then I would suspect that they will continue to be a fifty-fifty proposition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover, where's the cover?","review":"When I ordered a second Kindle 1, I was informed that I would be \\"upgraded\\" to a Kindle 2 without additional charges.

I contacted Amazon/Kindle, spoke with supervisor \\"Tyler\\" and was informed that the cover was not included in the purchase of the Kindle 2. I would have to spend additional money to get what was before part of the original purchase price. I would think that they would include the basic cover or a coupon to apply to the purchase of a cover of choice. I was only offered the option to return the Kindle 2 as the Kindle 1 is no longer in production. I was also informed I could buy a used Kindle 1 from various sources (rediculous suggestion).

I really don't want a big monster screen to read everything on because that really takes away from the fact that you can take thousands of books with you in one very compact device. Some may not agree, but I don't see any use for more than the 6\\" screen when you can zoom and have many different font sizes.

No need to go to the book store, library or news stand. Huddle in yet another cubicle of self induced isolation, paranoia and human disconnection.

The prices (Kindle AND Books) are in no way reasonable-Thanks for letting me know what a piece of crap this really is. Instead of trying to make a product with 'everything' and 'experimental' why not make a good product that does one thing well? And why does Amazon not tell the whole truth about backups not being available, etc? I won't be buying one anytime soon, if ever.

However, I cannot tell you the many books I have bought on amazon with the intent to read and enjoy and never did for various reasons.I have had the Kindle for less than a week and I have done more reading in this time then in the past 6 months. It truly has Re-Kindled my enjoyment of reading and learning.

I have always loved to read. And a few years back my eyes became weak. I had to start listening to books on tape. This was OK but not as good as reading where you can easly go back to a part you have read for review and many other advantages a real book gives you. Plus other features Kindle has that I really like. The dictionary, access to encylapedia, order a book that the one you are reading has reveranced and continue reading.Only one negative comment. Because of the weakness of my eyes I have the type enlargement at Kindles maximum. I hope Kindle upgrades type enlargement before my eyes get worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!","review":"I was hesitant with this, because I love the feel of books and the pages, but got this for a trip in which I will be gone for a long time and packing that many books just wouldn't work. I received my Kindle and found it very easy to navigate and download books. The screen is amazing. It does not bother me that I am reading on a screen. You can adjust the size of the text which I am loving and I no longer have to try to find a bookmark or flip back and forth until I find the spot where I left off before. Kindle just takes you there!It fits comfortably in my hands and in my purse. The ease of use has me reading even more than I ever had! I still will buy the books that I really love for my liabrary, but this sure does cut back on the book clutter on all the other books I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out - this is very fragile!","review":"Be careful if you want to buy this.

The poor durability and outlandish repair cost drop this to a 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"Amazon can take back the books you buy. As wonderful as it is to have access to books like this the fact that at any moment you can loose a book you're in the middle of enjoying is horrible.

With the DRM that Amazon has infected this device with, Amazon has the power to delete any books that you thought you purchased. This is what they did with George Orwell's Animal Farm and 1984. They didn't notify customers, there was no warning, no way to opt out, and no way to reverse the decision.

There seriously is nothing like this thing. I did ALOT of product research before choosing the Kindle. I looked at the iPad, the Knook and the Kindle, and the Kindle by far was the best choice. That is, if you're looking for something lightweight, portable, with ease of functionality (i.e., button placement and menu use) and GREAT for reading (if you're looking for functionality other than reading, then the iPad may be a better choice). The Nook was heavy and even though it has \\"touchscreen\\" controls, which I thought I would like, I found those to be inefficient. I admit, I didn't look at the Sony Reader in my comparisons, but have no regrets with my purchase. Also, for your warranty, if you want one, don't get the one sold on Amazon, go to [...] and get the one for the Kindle there, it's less expensive and covers 3 years instead of two.

I can have it with me when I'm waiting in the doctor's office, standing on a long line at the grocery store, being a passenger in a car for a long trip, and all sorts of other places where it would be difficult to carry books. My husband loves that he can read the NY Times and other periodicals while he waits for me somewhere. I'm still learning how to use it quickly, but it is very intuitive and more easily learned than many other gadgets I've been exposed to (by my kids).

So, this is what I am using my Kindle for.I would like a bigger screen, like the DX, however, my research indicates there is no left hand controls and the print is in one column, which can get very hard on the eyes. For the price difference of $189, I decided the Kindle was the better of the two.I do wish they would do something about the search mechanisms.

It also doesn't support any other characters besides the alphabet (something else they need to improve on). The MP3 player plays music at random and you can't see the list of songs you imported.

When I asked the phone rep about removing the credit card info so that it would have to be entered every time, they said that it wasnt possible. When I asked about having it ask for a password, like here on Amazon, I was told that was also not possible. When I asked about password protecting the Kindle, like our laptop, again, not possible. Does anyone else see this as a problem? She hasnt really tried to actually read a book on it yet, so we cant comment on how it works.

I like it better than the first model because I was always hitting the page advance inadvertently.I hunted around forever to find out how to increase the text size...that was readily apparent on the earlier model.My son, who never read for pleasure, absconded with the first Kindle (with my blessings!)...he really has used it.

Ease of operation and fairly intuitive use. Amazingly fast downloads. The screen is easy to read in most lighting conditions and does not cause eye strain.

I don't know if there is a mechanism to request additions to the Kindle library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"One of the best electronics I've owned in life, kindle is beautiful, easy to use, fully functional and modern. I live in Brazil and received it very protected and perfect. Already ordered and received my first books through a good and fast wireless connection. I'm totally satisfied with my Kindle! Thank you, Amazon!PS: I have to tell you this: my house was robbed last year and they took away all our electronics, but left my Kindle. Because its leather cover, the criminals thought it would be a conventional book and left it behind. Luck me and thanks to Amazon for the idea of designing the cover! I highly recommend that everybody gets the leather cover when order your Kindles :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kindle","review":"My husband and I--both avid readers- had agreed NOT to purchase this device because we like \\"real books\\".

I am really enjoying the convenience of keeping books altogether in one place."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reader","review":"I brought my kindle about amonth age.

I'm so happy I bought this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous little Machine","review":"Yesterday was my kindle's first month anniversary. We are getting along very well. I've finished two books and my husband has finished one. He is a shut-in, and I wanted him to be able to use Kindle, but he (who can't use a computer) took to it so quickly, that I fear future conflict over the machine. It will probably be a long time, if ever, that I learn to use all of Kindle's many features, but it really is an intuitive, learn-as-you-go machine. I absolutely adore being able to lay in my warm bed, think of a book I'd like to read, and download it then and there. For a reader, its really manna from heaven. I am also reading faster, I think, because the Kindle is actually easier to physicaly handle than a book, especially a thick one. Amazon has produced a fabulous product, but then, I'd expect no less of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING LITTLE TOOL","review":"I received the Amazon Kindle just before Christmas and I LOVE IT! Books are easy to find and browse, and I love the opportunity to get samples of the books I am interested in buying. I also love that once I am done a book, all I need is to go to menu and select a new one, I don't have to worry about going to a store, even in the middle of the night or in the middle of a trip I can get a new book. I love books, especially the feeling of holding one in my hands, the Kindle cannot replace the feeling of holding a great book, but it can certainly allow you to bring the emotions of books around with you in a much easier format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Kindle!","review":"My husband bought my Kindle as a gift. I read approximately 2 books a week, and normally have about 3 going at once. We travel a lot, and have an extended trip coming up, so this is perfect!!Size is great, it is a bit heavier than I thought it would be, but that isn't a problem at all.I do wish there was a built in light so that at night you wouldn't need a little clippy light. However, I suspect that would drain the battery too fast. If I leave the whispernet on, my batter will last a week. With it off, I'm going on week two and the batter bar has barely removed.Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"duncanrn77","review":"I love my kindle!!

Great contrast, might need color as I have one of the older models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful","review":"I find the AmazonKindle the best buy of all the other e-readers I researched. It is affordable, very easy to use. It comes with wireless connection so right from the e-book amazon.com can be accessed to purchase ebooks that are delivered within minutes to the kindle. The feature I find most useful is the link to the Dictionary the kindle comes with; english being my second language, I no longer have to guess the meaning of words. All in all I just love my kindle and would recommend it to anyone. So I give it a five star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for heavy reading","review":"I like to read a lot of history books - the 700-1000 page type.

But I won't be spending money on a Kindle until Amazon removes DRM or any type of intrusive control over content from the device. Their capability and demonstrated behavior is EXACTLY the same as if Barnes & Noble sold you a book, then broke into your house and took it back, albeit leaving you a check on the bookshelf. You bought the book, it's yours. It's no one's right to take it back from you without asking you first, and then they should have no right to even install the capability of taking it back if you refuse. It's just one step from that to the government banning a book, then forcing Amazon to delete it from all Kindles. In our current political progression towards socialism in the U.S., this is a highly likely scenario.This behavior needs to stop entirely, and many organizations are working very hard to do just that. That's where my money for the Kindle is going."},{"rating":"1","title":"awesome device, minus the DRM and proprietary format","review":"I love my Kindle, but Amazon is making it a less ideal device. Between remotely deleting books, retroactively removing text to speach, and using a proprietary format, the Kindle's awesomeness is being severely diminished.The kindle and the platform are awesome, but Amazon is letting the reactionary publishing industry govern the device, when they should be leading the industry into the future, much like Apple has finally started to do. I hope Amazon can pull off the same thing Apple has, I really really hope they don't take as long as Apple has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed","review":"I bought a Kindle for my son's birthday and as a father's day present.

Wanted it for my travels, and for my folks. 10 minutes into starting it up and turning it on - I had decided to return it. I was so impressed by the sell job and all the great reviews, but as a long time Mac and iPhone user, this device simply feels clunky and slow, and frankly, somewhat awkward. Getting around the settings was slow and a pain in the tushy, the screen flashes too much when you change pages - very distracting. True, it is better once you have a book or newspaper you can read through, but this is so far off of where it could be if they just made a much larger iPod Touch-type of reader. Really, what a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRAGILE","review":"My Kindle2 broke the first week I had it. It is very, very fragile. Customer service is rigid and unresponsive.

Thanks for nothing Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Daddy at work","review":"I'll accept that I don't know all the facts, however, based on what's been announced already, isn't it strange that exactly those two books (\\"1984\\" and \\"Animal Farm\\") were removed? The irony is that the Amazon/Kindle T&C may even allow it. Maybe the Kindle users wise up and stop using proprietary hardware and software. Hopefully the outcry will force Amazon to act like a humble player that respects its customers instead of like Big Daddy. That's a low moment for you Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"But can I keep my books? My notes!?","review":"Looks great, but as long as Amazon locks down and controls the device and can delete my books and personal notes, I think not. I simply don't buy DRM. I can already hear someone saying I shouldn't care about DRM unless I am doing something illegal, but you can quickly see this is absurd. DRM is an assault on freedom, with a great potential for abuse, misuse, and malfunction. Just say no to DRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"The price of a Kindle?","review":"While ebook readers are a very attractive concept, the Kindle in itself is deeply flawed by the facts that you can only purchase the books from the Amazon bookstore, that the books you are purchasing there are not your property but considered parts of a service, and that the service agreement is - you guessed it - totally biased to Amazon and alienating your liberties as a customers.When purchasing a Kindle book, you cannot read it on another device, nor can you share it with friends, donate it or sell it. If Amazon stops the Kindle service for any reason, the Kindle device and all purchased books will become totally useless and Amazon will have no liability whatsoever as clearly stated in the Kindle terms of service. And finally, Amazon reserves the right to remotely delete without your consent any books you have legally purchased on the device - and did so in the past on more than one occasion.Is freedom the price you want to pay for a Kindle?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightning fast up and running","review":"I purchased the Kindle for a nephew heading to Afganistan with the Army.

The Kindle is so thin and lightweight that you can take it anywhere. I won't have to rely on the 6 month old \\"Field and Stream\\" magazines next time I have to wait at the doctor's office.

It holds all of my books (read a new book every 2-3 days) and it's quite simple. When I'm up reading late at night,my eyes no longer want to go cross-eyed so much with the kindle rather a paper book. I like how you honestly get a new book in 40 seconds. When you get the book, make sure you read the electronic book it came with, it will help you better understand the kindle.

It literally only takes seconds to have the books that you want to read downloaded as if by magic. I especially like that I can \\"try a book out\\" without purchasing it.

Every time I go to Home page, books appear in different random order.Thirdly, Global Wireless in currently not available in my country - Latvia - and Amazon can not even give a hint on when it will.Fourth, magazines specially formatted for Kindle are stripped of pictures. Pretty dull reading, huh?Fifth, I could not exactly understand why a list of supported formats is so short. Why isn't one of the most widely used formats - EPUB - supported?So, Kindle is on it's way to become a great e-content reader but it has a very long way to go.

Whose to say Amazon won't do it again? They can apparently pull tons of books from the device at a whim, and it won't read books bought from any other e-book store (which wasn't an issue until Amazon's books disappeared).

It gave me pause that the Kindle could only read Amazon books but software updates were promised for the future and I had been buying all of my books from Amazon anyway. Then a year down the road, Amazon came out with their generation 2 Kindle. Now they do not offer any updates for my Kindle. They also offered no incentives for upgrading. When I emailed customer support, I was told, in essence that they were sorry I'm not happy and that is the way it is.

Have read over 10 books in the past two weeks since I purchased it. Smaller than a book, and easy to carry around with me. I am now able to read any time I have a free minute. Waiting for food in a restaurant, waiting in the doctor's office. It's easier than with a real book, I just pull it out, a flip the switch. It automatically goes to the last page I was reading, and no fumbling with a bookmark or worrying that I'll lose my page in my purse. Order with confidence.

I checked out their features. I went to a store where I could see both the Nook and Sony readers in person. I read other reviews and critiques by people. Bottom line, I knew from my research that the Kindle had the features I wanted in an e-reader. I purchased it and am happy to say I am not disappointed one bit. It's all I hoped it would be and more. I enjoyed it right out of the box - read the manual to learn how it worked and what features it had. Since I had already purchased an e-book to be downloaded even before my Kindle arrived - I was happy to find that book waiting for me once my new Kindle was fully charged and ready to go.

I've had it for several hours now (a day early THANK YOU Amazon) and I absolutely love it. It was worth the wait! You truly forget you are reading on an e-device. The gray background takes a little getting used to but it doesn't take that long. Turning the pages is easy and fast. I love the fact you can browse and buy from Kindle store right from the device. The dictionary is so simple to use while you are reading, it's ingenious. Why four stars? I wish the display was a little bigger i.e., not so much white border.

I will not buy a Kindle,and will greatly limit my purchases on Amazon. This action by Amazon is outrageous, what is to stop them from deleting other material?You spend $300 for a Kindle, you presume it's yours, but is it yours if the seller has the ability to alter it's contents at will? Sorry Amazon, you just showed your true nature... you have this power that most Kindle owners never imagined you have, and you used the power to steal. A decision was made, and yes, to take a legally owned possession away from someone is stealing. It would appear that Amazon is just another corporate thief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!

I love how the kindle can read the book to you. The only thing is that some books dont come with the text- to - speak thing. I also wish that the Kindle has the time on the top of the page becuase sometimes you sit down to read just one chapter and you end up reading the whole book. I think the kindle is a great product. Well worth the money for the kindle. The books are alot cheaper then if you go to the book store and buy the same book. I also like it if you go away it is very easy to bring in your suitcase and the batter last a long time.

Now here's the problem: 1) Not all books are available in Europe. Most books I searched for (i.e. books by Terry Pratchett, Bernard Cornwell to name but a few) cannot be downloaded from Europe. 2) Books are more expensive (i.e. search for Sookie Stackhouse 8-copy Boxed Set; US customers pay $29.58, European customers pay $36.32). Why is that? Because S&H to Europe is more expensive? 3) What am I supposed to do with a device that only allows me to download 2nd rate books while US customers get the full spectrum of what Amazon has to offer?

Amazon sold this product by saying that ALL text could be converted to speech.3) The battery is not replaceable with K2, unlike K1.4) No SD in the K2.If I had a K1, I'd keep using it!(And that, my friends, is what Amazon gets for sending me a product that does NOT perform as advertised!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"It was my understanding when paying $400 for my Kindle a year ago that new releases and best sellers would all be $9.99, thus offsetting the high price of the Kindle. Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the new releases. I've already paid handsomely for the technology of the Kindle, and the only cost to Amazon for the electronic version is royalties. I am MOST disappointed, and instead of singing praises of Kindle I'm now warning my friends off. If Amazon reduces their prices back to the $9.99 price and credits those who've paid more, I'll once again recommend Kindle.

It provides good reviews and allows me to select books quickly and I have ended up with a better selection than going to the book store and wasting time trying to find books. I am disappointed that the travel guides I would like are not available.

I was interested to know that there are free books, along with new releases for under $10.00. I am so happy that I bought one and love, love, love it.

I love the privacy that Kindle allows, no one around me can see what I'm reading and want to interrupt my reading to strike up a conversation about it and I don't have to admit that I'm reading LOTR AGAIN! I have close to 30 books and most were free.

What it does is cut the PDF file at random into chunks of page (according to the zoom setting used). Thus, zoom too small and you cannot read, too big and the text gets chopped in the middle of a line. My reading interest is Gutenberg / Googlebooks / National Library scans of out of copyright old books, not buying new books from Amazon. The text ones work OK, but there is not enough memory available to store a \\"library\\" like advertised. Mine is the \\"Pocket\\" version.

Rather than the Kindle showing up on my computer, I got a Windows message saying my computer could not recognize the USB device. After several more attempts at connecting, I called the Kindle Support phone number. After a short menu for directing my call, a lady answered, got my ID information, and promptly directed me to a Technician. The Technician pleasantly and efficiently walked me through the solution to my problem in less than a minute. The problem was with my computer, not the Kindle, but he solved the problem anyway.

Perhaps there will come a day when an electronic device (like the Kindle) will have the look and feel of a real book displaying two pages, impervious to coffee mug rings on the screen and never needing to be plugged in. All that said, I've seen the future, and the future is the Kindle - or something similar. I accept that. The printed book has had a good 500+ year run, and it had time to get a lot of things right.

I've been a huge fan and out in the community touting its awesomeness, but now I'm just disenchanted. There are obviously some manufacturing issues this time around.

From what I've read and experienced the Kindle is the best reader out there... for now.

I've now purchased a 3rd unit and have learned that Amazon, somewhere along the line, decided to eliminate the case to increase their profits. Much like the airline industry that now charges to check your first bag when traveling, Amazon had decided to charge separately for a necessary component of a product that everyone expects to be part of the purchase price when ordering. It will be the last Kindle I purchase, and depending on whether I get over the anger of being cheated by a company I trusted, may be my last purchase of anything from Amazon.

It isn't quite as easy and quick, but it still does work. It is an amazing piece of technology for an avid reader.

When Amazon ballyhooed the international features of the new Kindle, we immediately purchased one as a gift for her. Instead of a great gift, we unintentionally saddled her with download fees every time she buys a book or wants to read a newspaper. In the fine print, Amazon tells you about all these extra charges, which can amount to hundreds of extra dollars a year for someone living abroad who is an avid reader. So, we wasted our money buying the new global Kindle because she has had to revert to using the cumbersome USB method of downloading. Amazon should make the extra fees crystal clear to potential buyers. Instead, the marketing for this product says no fees for downloading, and then they hide the fees for international users in the fine print.

Having steady access to electronic books was a lifesaver, and I never went anywhere without it. However it has a fatal flaw: a complete lack of durability. in one year in Thailand and traveling, I broke three kindles; each time, Amazon sent a replacement, and a family member who happened to be visiting brought it along. I finally just broke my fourth kindle, and am out of warranty.I may be especially hard on my kindle- travel tends to be difficult- but travel is precisely when I need it. My macbook has lasted 6 years, my iphone has lasted roughly 4 times my average kindle's lifespan,and now, I am going to have to purchase something more durable. this product was a huge disappointment because its promise was so great, because it's so laughably fragile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Repair Depot?","review":"I cannot find a repair depot(for an out of warranty first generation Kindle)repair anywhere on the Amazon site.

I have 802.11 wireless connectivity available but the Kindle uses a private network for its wireless communication. In this modern age, to not include standard WiFi access is a total deal-breaker.

The corner that shows battery level and signal strength is black. The lines are gradually getting thicker and blocking more and more of my page.

I'm very much disappointed about Amazon's arrogance. I read a lot about battery problems on different forums, but Amazon's just passing over it, thinking that we'll all buy new Kindle.

Prior to owning this device I used to haul magazines, books, and newspapers to read on the various cardiovascular work out machines. It got real tiring trying to stabilize such reading material. Those days are long gone now and it's thanks to the Kindle. My Kindle stays stable at all times and enjoying my favorite literature is much easier on the treadmill because I can increase the font size. Due to this product, my work out time has become more efficient; I stay at the gym longer and I utilize my time better.The only disadvantage with the Kindle is the short battery life. If I use this book reader while I'm away for an extended period of time, I have to bring other literature to read because inevitably the battery dies out before I can recharge it.If you're looking though for a way to be more productive with your workouts, buy this product.

It is disconcerting to think that so much money was spent on this item ($300) only to have the books downloaded in an un-edited fashion. Certainly one would expect better editing and proof reading before touting this electronic device. I still like my Kindle for the simplicity and ease of USE.

So I called customer service and they offered to replace it for a discount. I accepted and had it shipped rush as I was going on vacation. That day I posted on Facebook how good your customer service was and recommend the kindle to several friends when asked. Fast forward.. the kindle arrives but to my surprise it is the older version (gen 1) that is no longer available to purchase at amazon.com. Obviously the first generation has problems with the screen freezing .. so why would I want to purchase a new one? I was very disappointed that when I called customer service to complain they could do very little to help me besides return the Kindle.I loved your product and told anyone who would listen how great it was.. not any more .... Dont buy a KIndle"},{"rating":"1","title":"display not as good as K1","review":"I really like the Kindle 1, and was excited to get the K2, but it's going back. Side by side, the K1's print is blacker; the K2 is more of a gray. Customer support said that it depends on the book (?), and has to do with the 16 levels of gray scale. And there is no adjustment. Pretty dumb, since 99.9% of the time you want black-on-white.I suppose it would have looked okay if I didnt have a K1 to compare it to, but contrast is more important than the other new features considering the price. Oh well, maybe when the 3 comes out...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with book selection and periodical prices","review":"I have had a DX for 2 months. I have quickly learned the downside of doing Kindle business with Amazon. No matter what book I see in any newspaper's book review, I can be assured it isn't available on Kindle. Examples include Michael Lewis's very popular new book, \\"Panic\\", and a book reviewed today in the Wash Post, \\"Germania\\" by Simon Winder. You can have any book you want as long as it's been out for a year, I guess. Also, the price of newspapers on this thing are very high. I can understand paying a fee for a periodical, even though it may be free on the web, to cover the cost of whispernet. But, $10.99 a month for the NYT? Are they out of their mind? I also was not aware that all material in periodicals not included in articles is removed. Want to see that full page ad from some PAC everyone is talking about? By a dead tree copy of the Times. I am beginning to hate this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"3G Coverage :(","review":"I do own a K2 and a DX. Both were purchased before the international version. Be warned, the international version uses ATT and not Sprint. ATT coverage is spotty focusing mostly around interstates and cities. Living in rural areas usually means no coverage. ATT also has a history of poor call quality. If the Kindle had always used ATT, I would have never purchased them. Now I wonder if Amazon is going to leave me unable to use 3G"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need lending library","review":"I love my kindle!

This was how I treated my previous e-reader (Sony PR-500), and because I rarely used that, I was hesitant to buy the kindle.I was pleasantly surprised to find, however, that I've been reading from my kindle everywhere, and I haven't bought a paper book since I got it. While that's kind of sad... I love paper books, but the kindle+amazon makes it so easy and convenient to read, as well as find something new to read, that I haven't even thought about the bookstore. Amazon's huge selection, and a somewhat discounted price, that you don't have to wait to ship. The iPhone kindle app with it's page sync feature means that I can always stop to read a few pages of my current book.I love the kindle, and I'd recommend it to anyone who is a moderate to heavy reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilled with Kindle 2","review":"I have purchased two of the Kindle 2's over the past month for family members. We absolutely love the convenience provided by the Kindle 2. Books are available 24 hours a day regardless of our location. We are never bored or running out of books. Also, with the discounts available for e-books, the Kindle 2 will pay for itself over time. The ease of use and access to books has been great. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for readers!","review":"I wasn't sure that I wanted to spend so much money for a new way to read books. I read 1-2 books per week and was saving money by going to a book exchange. The Kindle 2 offered me convenience and a never-ending supply of books since they are only a download away! I love its super thin, lightweight convenience. HOWEVER, if your book has some graphics or pictures, you may not be able to see them clearly and you can't zoom in on them. That's a big downer. Also, you can't share your book with another Kindle 2 user easily. Another downer. BUT - it's so \\"real\\", that I actually tried to manually turn the page on it because I had forgotten it was not a \\"real\\" book! If you read lots, then get the Kindle 2. I can't wait for school textbooks to be available for the Kindle 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought I would hate it but...","review":"...I've grown accustomed to the convenience of the Kindle and some of its extraordinary features. I especially like the built-in dictionary, the adjustable font size, the underlining feature, and the surprisingly good selection of books in areas that interest me. You can't beat a real book for leafing through, for colorful covers, and for clarity of photographic images, but the Kindle is a winner nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love","review":"I love my Kindle. I've always enjoyed reading and never seem to find enough time to read as much as I like. Now I do. See, I'm fickle... I want to read what I'm in the mood to read. I usually have 3-5 books going at once. Before the Kindle, I'd either haul books with me, take something I ended up not being in the mood for, or buy books on the go. Now, with my Kindle, I read more than ever because I have access to what I want when I want it. I actually feel sorry for people who like to read and don't have a Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCREDIBLY FRAGILE","review":"I loved my Kindle 2 for the first two months I had it. But one night it slipped from my hands and fell about 2 feet. (about the height shown in the very misleading drop test video). It did not survive. I had received the Kindle as a gift and hadn't realized that the extended warranty was an option. Without it, I was told I could pay $200 to replace my Kindle with a refurbished Kindle that could not be covered by the warranty. I just can't afford to pay that much for an ebook. Amazon really needs to work on the durability of the Kindle. It's really a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ready for Prime Time","review":"The new Kindle is regarded as an improvement over the first version. In my opinion it is still a long way from being a desirable product.The screen is small - smaller than a paperback - and lacks contrast, which makes it harder to read than a book. The one book I downloaded, a Robert B. Parker novel, had wide spaces between paragraph and thus required about twice as many pages. Which means you have to push the button to flip pages every 10 seconds or so. And the pages flip with an odd, jerky movement.The Kindle now lets you display Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Word files. You have to e-mail them first to a web-site, which converts them to the Kindle format and sends them back to you. The result is less than impressive. The two files I tried were badly mangled, with illustrations in the wrong places or blacked out and text with special characters unreadable.I am returning my Kindle and I'm going to stick to reading books for a while longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Great device - Terrible construction - Horrible customer service!","review":"I received the Kindle 2 as a birthday gift and had it for less than a week.It was dropped from a height of about 12-14 inches.And now the display is completely unreadable.I called customer service and they want $200 to replace (they can't fix).Now I'm not sure I even want one if they break like glass.Unless you live in a hermetically sealed house filled with down pillows and bubble wrap, I cannot recommend the device to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM encumbered","review":"The theory of EBooks is great, but the Kindle is DRM encumbered, like the Ipod and the Windows 7 why bother with the intrusion on \\"Fair Use\\" that was established by the lawsuits over the VCR. I prefer a cheaper Palm or Linux-based small netbook by which I can load PDF's or better OpenDoc format books onto to read from the likes of Project Gutenberg and other legal sources. If the Kindle (like the iPod) entertains removal of this fundamental mistrust of the user, I'll entertain buying one, until then I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two weeks with Kindle 2","review":"I've had my Kindle 2 for two weeks now, having never had any other electronic reader. First the pluses: has worked flawlessly, both the unit itself and the wireless downloading; love the convenience and capacity of the unit, and there's no doubt my reading has increased; the minuses: I wish the screen were larger (many more page turnings are required even when using smallest font than when reading a paper book), I wish the screen could be lighter in color (thus giving better contrast between text and page), and finally, I wish the buttons could be silent (the clicking can disturb others nearby in a very quiet environment). On balance, the pluses outweigh the minuses; I'm sold and will keep my Kindle and will always be an electronic reader. If Amazon listens to its customers, Kindle 3 in a year or two will approach perfection. But its not worth waiting for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"It is very easy to use and lite to carry around. I gave it 4 stars, because I dropped it once and the screen cracked.

The availability of these textbooks was the reason I chose to try the Kindle, and I know I won't miss having to carry those books around all semester. However, when I ordered the Kindle I had no idea how valuable the opportunity to sample other books would be. It's wonderful to be able to read the first chapter of a book before deciding whether to order it, either on Kindle or in print. I've always appreciated being able to page through a printed book before buying it; now I can truly sample books electronically."},{"rating":"2","title":"6\\" Kindle review","review":"The Kindle is excellent for travelling.

Rosenfield"},{"rating":"2","title":"Limited selection","review":"I travel a great deal and often I would leave a book at home rather than add the weight to my already overstuffed briefcase. So I'd be reduced to reading the airline magazines over and over. Kindle seemed to be an ideal solution -- lightweight, small, and LOTS of books.I've been using it for a couple of months now. It delivers pretty much as promised, except for my purposes I find the selection of books very limited. The last five I tried to purchase were not available. (These were titles in theology and spirituality, not exactly best sellers, but not arcane, either). Otherwise, the display the responsiveness, the quick downloads are all real advantages.I'm sure what's happening is that publishers don't want to get stuck with their hardcover stock so they won't offer books on Kindle.When I bought this I thought for sure it would be the future of books -- but since I've read all the negative feedback from publishers, I'm not so sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to have but don't buy one","review":"It's a nice gadget and I'd like to have one but... It's not the list full of features that breaks this deal. It's what Amazon can do with your files if he decides you should not have them.

For me this is enough to never consider spending money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Love!!!!","review":"I absolutely love my Kindle. I have had it two weeks and I have found nothing wrong with it. I carry it in my purse and ever time I have to wait anywhere, I pull it out and start to read.

With what I use to spend on hardbacks, I'll have this paid for in no time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor frustration","review":"A smashing piece of technology. The sample tasting is particularly useful.However, my first download gave me the wrong text. It was a book by the right author, but not the one I wanted and not the one the title of which appeared in the home screen. It might well be a publisher problem and not Amazon.This is not the end of the world, but it is irritating trying to tell anybody about it. This is because the feedback is managed into many options, and none of them covers downloading a book that is not what it appears.

I'd done some basic research and even looked at some of the other options. The technology has tremendous potential, but after it became clear that Amazon has the ability to delete books I've purchased, I decided I'd wait or go with a competitor. To Amazon: The mere power to do this, even if you promise you won't ever do it, is enough to make me steer clear of the Kindle. I've had too many problems over the years with digital rights making DVD's non-functional in different countries. You must remove the ability for you or anyone else EVER to take away a book I've bought. So long as that power exists, either you or some judge or some bureaucrat will eventually use/misuse the power.

She has the first Kindle and used it daily at work during breaks. I am enjoying the Kindle very much. I am so glad that it is light weight and that the books can be sampled first before purchasing. My Kindle seems to be a little tempermental with the \\"wake\\" switch, but that problem seems to be working itself out. I told my husband that it is almost too easy to purchase new books on it.

The best the service people could do is suggest that I try gluing it back together. Or they offered to sell me another Kindle at a reduced price. I chose not to do that (\\"Once burned, twice shy!\\"). I have enjoyed the Kindle for fifteen months and bought about one hundred books in that time, but even if I can use the glue method for a while, in the future I plan to buy an I-Pad where I can get books from many sources and cease buying books from Amazon. And even now, I'll probably cut way back on buying books (and other items) from Amazon. The machine should have functioned without falling apart longer than fifteen months. They have no service policy on the Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This thing is a joke. It will not connect via the wireless option so I was not able to download the books I purchased. I then connected it to my pc and attempted to download my books via that connection.

The sony reader, for instance, is an open platform, enabling booksellers anywhere to sell books for it. Amazon is trying to corner the market for ebooks early in the game using the apple business model, and YOU, THE USER, SHOULD NOT LET IT HAPPEN.The future is ebooks, like it or not, and if amazon is the only one that can sell them, that means that every small bookseller is out of business.

For example the Lost Symbol is $16.00 for the book and $10.00 for the Kindle book. You only save $6 and that is for a book no one else can read and no one else can borrow. And the Kindle costs $250. If you save $6 per book then you could buy 41 books before you pay for the Kindle.

I like the fact that it is almost like a book, but of course I also love how easy it is to go online and purchase new titles.It is light-wheight, and holds lot of titles - which mean it is fantastic to bring on a holiday. Also it is much easier to read on your Kindle on a bus, than for example a big book. I also like that I can adjust the size of the letters, a good thing for us above 50! And last but not least: it feels very pleasant for my eyes.

It is easy to use straight out of the box. I take a commuter train to and from work and don't like to carry a lot of stuff. Sometimes I would have to carry two books because I would be about ready to finish one book and then start another book. We recently came back from a 2 week cruise. I took 5 books and should have taken 6 or 7. With the Kindle, I wouldn't have had to take any. When I got the Kindle, I started downloading books on the way home on the train. The receipt was immediately delivered to my e-mail account as I could hear my Blackberry buzzing as soon as the book was downloaded. Downloading took less than 30 seconds. I finished my first book recently and was pleased with how easy it was to read. Also, no ink on my fingers.

This is the fourth book that I would had liked to buy in the Kindle edition, and cannot, for the above reason. Before The Tourist it was War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning by Chris Hedges, Empire of Illusion, also by Chris Hedges, and A Dead Hand by Paul Theroux. \\"You can read the book you want in 60 seconds\\" - are you kidding me?

It constantly freezes up. When I called Amazon to report this problem, I was told to restart it. Once I did, it worked for another couple of days and now I can't go one day without having to restart it, which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. When it does restart, it loses my page.

I also purchased several e-books from Kindle which were downloaded to my device very quickly. I love the fact that the Kindle is very light, easy to use and does not require a lot of extra steps before using. I purchased a cover and ear phones after receiving my Kindle.

These are on top of a few Amazon created downsides i.e. lack of openness (to protect its revenue stream from ebooks), no folders.However, most of the downsides don't impact the reading experience.

Their suggested workaround is to tell anyone who wants to buy you a gift, to look through your list of physical books on the wishlist, note the price, buy a gift certificate for that price, and then send it to you with a note on which book you are supposed to buy. For some reason they can't 1-click that process. As you can guess, despite telling everyone this grand scheme of Mr Bezos', people bought me physical books for Christmas this year, instead of jumping through the silly hoops. Amazon should offer a trade-in program for physical books incorrectly purchased because of their deliberate crippling of the kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you buy one of these","review":"you're a complete tool. you should just use your money to hire somebody to feed you"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful learning tool","review":"I have had the Kindle 2 for about 2 weeks and I have really enjoyed it.

I sold my Kindle 1 to a friend, and bought the Kindle 2, and I am pleased to say that I have rediscovered my love of reading all over again. Since buying the Kindle (both Kindle 1 and now Kindle 2), I read constantly. I love the broad change of reading material, the ability to purchase material at a whim with Whispernet, and the broad change of services at my fingertips.

No more searching, hoping, and begging for the base exchange to bring in certain books. I just search, click and buy! How much easier could it be! There is so much to love about this e-reader. The weight, battery life, and size of the Kindle is just icing on the cake. I can toss it into my beach bag, purse, or even a carry-on with no worries of extra pounds being added.

My biggest surprise was my use of the on-board dictionary by placing the cursor next to a word....My only suggestion for improvement is to add MORE kids books....my 7 year old son is already an avid reader, and it would be a great way to keep him occupied (during travel, for instance) if there were more kids books to put onto the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the Future","review":"Wow. I was so excited to get my Kindle and it has not let me down. It is amazing! I have not had to buy a book yet because many of my favorites come free!

I download the poet or author, take notes, highlight, and my favorite feature, look up words I'm not familiar with on the spot! It's ideal for seminar and the perfect size to be taking from class to class: nearly weightless!Advice to the new user, make sure you give it a FULL CHARGE before you start playing with it. I was so excited to finally have it that I tried doing so many things at first (with almost no battery) that I got very frustrated.

I used to love my kindle, instant books at a much cheaper price than getting them at the bookstore. Used it all the time, one book after another. No more. When I bought my (very expensive) kindle, books were 9.99. Kindle was big time advertising that new, just released books, would be 9.99. And they were until recently. The last book I purchased, just a few weeks ago, was only 1.50 less than it would have been at the bookstore. New releases are no longer 9.99, they are barely better than going to the bookstore. So why bother. Kindle says its out of their hands, its the publishers. But it was kindle who advertised \\"new releases for 9.99\\" when I purchased mine. Since the publishers don't have to print, store, ship, etc etc,....why should their books cost so much now on the kindle.

I did find that you have to E-mail the PDF to Amazon and they cover it for the Kindle2.No place in the Kindle2 sale literature does it say that PDF have to be sent for converting.

I thought that meant that sometimes the reception would not be the best or perhaps I would have to drive a few miles to obtain workable wireless reception. There is no reception at all where I live and if I wanted such I would have to drive an hour which of course is pretty unworkable for daily use. What that means is that I can access all the Amazon books I want via my computer and that is not a difficult procedure, but it also means I can't use the daily newspaper or blog features.

I would save them until the end of the day since I couldn't do anything else with my eyes after that. Now, I can read all day if I choose. My eyes do not tire. It's been more than 10 years since I have had the pleasure of reading as long as I please. The cost of the books downloaded are equal to the cost I would have paid on line for used books, except there is no shipping added in. So, it is easier to use than a book, books are cheaper, and books are available anytime.

The thought of improving the environment is a positive (not having to get rid of all the paper) but joining a book club with the specials still beats the Amazon price - Jeff, you need to work on this.

I found the contrast MUCH too dark and the fonts FUZZY and MUCH too light! This display is not even remotely close to reading an actual book page! I am EXTREMELY unhappy with this device. I will buy a 6 inch Kindle after the following criteria are met. I simply want a WHITE background and CRISP, BLACK text. It is just that simple! WHITE BACKGROUND AND CRISP, BLACK TEXT!

I have to say as an Apple fan that I love my Kindle and the 6\\" form factor is a wonderful size. I prefer the e-ink type screen to the back-lit screens as I do a lot of reading outside and this is where the Kindle wins hands down.I'm unsure of the future of the DX version as it's larger form-factor and cost places it in direct competition with the iPad, but the 6\\" international version which I have is cost-effective (half the cost of an iPad) and is much more readable under direct sunlight (an assumption as I haven't seen an iPad yet of course).I may still get an iPad, but for reading I will generally stick with my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool tool but still has glitches","review":"I love the Kindle except for the glitches.

I often find myself falling asleep with books, but with the kindle I enjoy reading alot more. I also wear glasses and find the kindle easier on the eyes. Another nice feature is the way you can enlarge the font size. It's small enough to easily fit in ones hand. The battery life will last at least a week or more. Books download very easy and within minutes.Overall I rate this a great gift for the avid reader. It's very user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment, battery won't charge!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I purchased the Kindle for my mom for Christmas. She was so excited to receive it, she takes it home to play with it, plugs it in to charge, and......NOTHING! She tries different plugs around the house, she calls Amazon, they tell her to plug it directly into the back of her computer, NOTHING! Finally after 3 phone calls to Amazon they tell her that sometimes the batteries just go so dead, that they can't be charged. What? I purchased the Kindle in October. Seriously, in 3 months it is so dead it's useless? So what happens when my mom gets her new one, cause now they have to ship her a new one, if she doesn't charge it frequently the same issue? What a major disappointment at Christmas. My first impression is not good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love my Kindle!","review":"Having been intrigued by the Kindle since I first heard about it coming out on the market, I finally bought the newest generation version last month. All I can say is that I absolutely love it!It's very easy to use. Very easy to read. And I love the fact that I can carry around my own private library of books in such a small package and when the urge to read strikes...well, I can read it anywhere! (And unlike some books, it doesn't weight much, isn't bulky, and fits in my purse.)My daughter also likes it...so I have a feeling I'll be buying another one in the future so she can read at the same time I am! (After all, when you get engrossed in a great book, it's hard to put down so someone else can use the Kindle!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Medical purpose","review":"The Kindle should also be marketed for its benefits for people with disabilities. I'm an avid reader who has MS. I have purchased ebooks from the gemstar to the first sony , the kindle is by far superior. My disability has increased since the my first gemstar purchase. Nobody thinks about how difficult it is to hold a hardcover book or to read a paperback and turn the pages when you can't crack the sine of a book because your fingers don't have the strength. Not to mention failing vision and being able to enlarge the print. That's one reason it doesn't get 5 stars the type should be able to go a little larger. I think the publisher's arguing with you over the 9.99 price should know they are also hindering people with disabilities many of whom are on fixed incomes and cannot afford to pay the increased prices. I for one will wait until prices come down on new releases priced above 9.99.I love my new kindle and would be truly miserable if i wasn't able to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle 2","review":"So light weight and easy to read, the battery has a really long life and the internet is accessed easily"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy birthday to me!!","review":"For my 59th Birthday - I ordered my first Kindle. I love it, love it, love it. I've downloaded many free books and bought a couple so far. I can see that this baby could be addictive. One feature that is very helpful is increasing the size of the text - the Kindle is lightweight and if you have to lay it down for a few minutes, it will go in a sleep mode that helps save on the battery life.

After using the K2 I am so ready to go back to the K1.All of my books need to be redownloaded which costs $0.15 to $0.30 per book. The books I bought from other ebooks sites, if I do not have them backed up on my computer are gone forever unless I want to rebuy them.THERE IS NO SD CARD. 1.5 GB is great, but it is nothing. I had a 4 GB SD Card in my K1.The USB Cord is not a normal USB. You need to buy a special size from Kindle in order to connect your K2 to the computer.If the battery dies you need to send your K2 back to Amazon to be fixed. How stupid is that. If you are like me you have withdrawls when you have nothing to read.I am not happy with the K2.

He spent a whole day trying to get it to connect and after speaking with tech support for many hours discovered that the 3G is Sprint which does not work in the area we live in. I don't why Amazon didn't make an agreement with ATT or Verizon for this e-book reader - most likely could have sold many more units. So beware - check the coverage map for Sprint before you buy. I was fortunate in that I was able to regift this item to someone who does have coverage where they live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Pricing Scam","review":"I'm sure I am not the only customer who feels duped by the pricing shell game Amazon has played with us. Those of us who were the first to buy the Kindle, based in part on the claim that new books would never be more than $9.99 have had the wool pulled over our eyes very quickly (less than one year). Clearly, the plan will be to gradually increase the book pricing for new releases until there is no difference at all, giving Amazon a greedy boost to its profitability margins. Shame on Amazon for misleading loyal customers. New Kindle buyers beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it Immediately","review":"If you are used to refined design and a great user experience, don't buy this product.

I put off buying the new generation Kindle (not DX) for a long time, but finally succumbed, since I had so many books stored already in my archive and didn't want to lose them.I got the new Kindle today and its navigation feature -- one button -- sucks. You have to press in just the right zone, with the tip of your fingernail, on a tiny square button to get it to go in the direction you want.

And if you have other books you'd like to keep there, you have to take them to the publisher's store to pay to have them stamped with the publisher's logo. That's what a Kindle is without native support for PDF, DOC, and HTML. I have hundreds of e-books on my 3 pound laptop, use and read them all the time. I'd be glad to have a Kindle, but it's not an e-book reader yet: it's a Shick injectable razor, designed to get you to buy their brand of razor blades.

Sadly, it spazzed out yesterday -- the battery was dead, so I recharged. Instead of coming back-- as it had always done in the past -- only about half the screen was visible (or, more accurately, semi-visible); the other half was a mess of horizontal and vertical lines (what others with the same problem have called a plaid-like pattern). Re-setting, re-charging, r-buttoning doesn't do a thing. It's essentially dead. And I don't recall dropping it any time recently. It was in my car for a while, so maybe it got jostled to death.

Maybe there is something that i need to investigate about, but if there is, it is not easy to find.- It doesn't read PDF nativelly, you should send your documents to Amazon and then transfer it to the kindle.

As an avid reader it has always been a burden for me to carry enough books to last the length my trips, which are often up to one month. The weight saving on my flight baggage allowance alone, speaks for itself.For the past year I had been thinking about buying a electronic reader and had reviewed several others on the market. However when I read about the Kindle and the very fact that it can download hundreds of books, papers and magazines wirelessly, I knew there was no comparison and that this was the one for me.What I like about the Kindle is it's easy to use, fairly light, thin and can store hundreds of books at normally half the price you would pay in the book stores..I am curently working in Ghana and can still download from the thousands of Amazon books on offer.Thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbara","review":"It would be nice if the kindle had back lighting for reading at night or airplane.

Last month the screen became disfigured. I have no idea how or why so I call Amazon, tell them about the problem and they REFUSE to even look at my device. According to them, based on my description it is \\"broken not defective\\" WHAT??? They offer to send me a refurbished devise for $99. No way..I asked Amazon to at least LOOK at my device, no they said \\"we do this for a living and it is not covered under warranty.\\" Mechanics fix cars for a living but they still look at the engine to diagnose the problem.I was such a supporter of the Kindle - have told everyone they should buy one, now I will discourage anyone from this purchase.

I use it on the bus on the way to work, and am able to see it with a variety of lighting conditions from direct light through the window to bus light in the evening.On the critical side, the buttons are too stiff for my liking. The \\"5 way\\" selector is a bit annoying - not real easy to manipulate and the back/next take a stronger push than I'd like.Have a newspaper subscription (LA Times)..its ok..not great. There's no size difference in headlines - all articles have the same weight, so you don't have any way to visually assess the relative weight of each article.

So there should be a lot less \\"accidental\\" page turns.3) There's an option on the reading menu to sync to the furthest point read in the book. Excellent!4) Wireless is turned on and off from the menu, there's no physical switch.5) The Kindle 2 can be recharged with a USB cable. No more extra cable power.Those are all good things. BUT... there is one really annoying design feature. The USB cable is not a standard mini-USB (Mini-A) plug. I think it's a \\"Micro-B\\" plug, but I'm still trying to confirm that.That means I'll have to get some more cables, because I connect my Kindle to more than one machine.

Not a good option. Also, the digital books seem way too pricey, costing as much as a printed version (for no reason I can see. There are no printing costs involved, so it should be about a tenth of what a book should cost.) and i haven't even seen any that I might want to read.

I read a lot at night and was having a problem with tired eyes, even with good light. This has disappeared with the Kindle, and I find myself reading for longer strentches at a time. The ease of downloading materials is amazing. The first weekend I had the device we went out of town. Sunday morning I was able to download my local newspaper and read away. Reading is one of my favorite pastimes, and the Kindle just makes that pleasure even more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am enjoying the Kindle 2.","review":"This is my first electronic reading device and I really love it. I love its size and comfort and its large capacity. The wireless connection with the Amazon store is very convenient but you need to expand the scope of your digital bookstore and offer more literature beyond the classics and recently published books. I do not like the automatic reading function as the voices are too mechanical. I haven't tried the periodicals as I am not a periodical reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Device!","review":"At first I balked at the price of a Kindle. I debated for 4 months on a Kindle 1. When I talked myself into the purchase, the advertisements for Kindle 2 were out so I decided to wait. Although very expensive, I bought the Kindle 2 and have not regretted it. I love this device. The availability to receive newspapers and magazines is awesome, not to mention the ability to purchase books on the spot. The only two drawbacks or shortcomings I've discovered are the lack of backlighting for reading in the dark and the absence of color. Aside from that, this device is absolutely wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So Good","review":"Really enjoying my Kindle 2. It's lightweight, easy to use, convenient to store many books, 6 different font sizes, etc. A few quibbles: cover is extra; sometimes the font looks lighter than it could be (hit Alt G to make it darker, but it doesn't carry over to next page). Some say it costs too much, but download wirelessly 30 books for free from feedbook.com (as well as many others from Amazon)and it pays for itself (these are all classics and in public domain, but a great list including Jane Austen, Arthur Conan Doyle,James Joyce,Herman Melville,etc etc.). Lots of other good features (plays music, text-to-speech, connect to Internet albeit slowly). So far, so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle 2 Owner","review":"Was not planning on doing a review but tired of seeing reviews from people who DO NOT EVEN OWN THE PRODUCT.

(If you're overseas, you must use USB to download new books to the Kindle; you can't use wireless.) Last night we were trying to hook it up to a brand-new, high-powered laptop and were unable to get the laptop to recognize it. Lots of other users are reporting the same problem on a variety of operating systems, so it's clearly a Kindle 2 problem.

I expect to have some modicum of control over the product. I do not expect the seller to surreptitiously creep into my electronic devices and delete things. If you can delete your products, what is to stop a command from deletingall products, including those I did NOT secure from Amazon.What happens if the device goes belly up?

I bought one thinking it would be great. Well, I was so wrong. I'll tell you about some things that was wrong with mine. It would not turn off, it kept flipping from the page with the amazonkindle on it and flip back to the home page. This was continous. They said they had never heard of this before. Well, if you want my opinion, they knew all along. If I tried to turn it off, it came right back on.There is more I could say about it, but won't bore you any longer. Just don't buy it. They also will not give me a refund because it was exchanged. I will soon get my refund back even if I have to hire a lawyer to do so. I just think it would be cheaper to refund my money and make me a happy customer, but I don't think they want to make me a happy customer.I don't think they would waste their time trying to make me a happy customer.

My husband was excited because he was under the impression it had a light, so no more sleeping wih a book light or end table lamp. The Kandle light was $20.00 , the covers are outrageous-$34.00 and up.When I showed my middel and high school students, they were like,\\" Well, what does it do?\\" I couldn't find a book at their reading level with the audio feature. So basically, nothing! Half of the books published do not come in Kindle version. So, I bought books to read for next years curriculm. Tons of the books do not have the audio feature.If you upgrade your not far from the I-pad price. I found it to be a disappointment- it definitely is not for reading teachers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi-cool, but definitely not worth the price","review":"the fact that it has NO blacklight is reason enough NOT to get the kindle, especially when others have it. The other major draw back (at least if you want to use it for citing purposes), it has no page numbers so it makes it impossible to cite any references through the kindle. The only notable feature is that you can perform a word search on an entire text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing discovery when it comes to its only purpose: Content","review":"I was in awe when I held it in my hands for the first time. I got it on the Hallowing day and showed to/told everyone I knew how incredible it is. Nevertheless once I starting loading it, the disappointments started. To begin with, I live in Brazil. And that's a big deal for Amazon. Some of the titles that I was looking for has a 'kind' note that reads: \\"Due to copyright restrictions, certain Kindle Titles are not available to Latin America\\". Does it mean that it maybe cracked or the device is not that secure to hold a book, let say, Brazil? I pass the question to AMAZON, because to me it does not make sense that only some titles are available (electronically) to certain countries. If some authors can make such restrictions, so they shouldn't be available in any other format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle power","review":"Everyone keeps asking if I miss the feel of an actual book with pages in my hands, but I don't. I relish the ease with which I can carry a library of books with me. I bought the Kindle originally anticipating some traveling and realizing it would be easier and lighter to carry a Kindle rather than a pile of paperbacks. I now use the Kindle even when I am at home.While I was traveling, someone mentioned a book that sounded fascinating. I pulled out my Kindle, found the book and immediately had the book on my wishlist and later decided to buy it. In the past, I would have written the name on a scrap of paper, lost the paper and would be frantically trying to remember the name of the \\"good\\" book.I also found that the experimental capabilities made my traveling much easier in the middle of winter. I could check on airport weather to predict any problems with connections or delays. I am off traveling again in two months. My Kindle will be the first on what to take list after my passport!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading convenience","review":"I truly deliberated carefully for 18 months about purchasing any type of e-reader.

I also have an I-phone and love the way it sincs with the Kindle. Now while waiting for a doctor appointment, I can just whip out my I-phone and read while I wait. The main reason I bought the Kindle is because I'm taking a trip overseas in September and didn't want to bring a lot of book along to read. Now I will be able to bring just the Kindle and as many books as I want. Great invention and a great way to go green - as it's paperless and no trees have to give their life to publish a book.

But now that my battery is worn down, and Amazon does not seem to want to share any product information on how I might get a new one, the Kindle loses a lot in the purpose category, - for the most part I have to read everything while plugged in.

Once I had downloaded my first book I realised that there were practically no occasions where I would rather be reading my Kindle than my iPhone! The iPhone is far more portable for everyday use, but most importantly has a backlight so I can read wherever I am regardless of the lighting around me. Vital when my other half is asleep and I can't have the light on without waking him up! If the Kindle had cost much less, then it may have stayed with me as an alternative to the iPhone when in ideal conditions, but unfortunately it was way too expensive for that so it was sent back.

An avid reader, I was skeptical, but soon converted and loved, loved, loved my kindle. I waxed romantically whenever I spoke of it. I know at least five people who purchased a kindle after talking with me about how much I loved it. Well, almost two years later, it started to get scratchy lines and now I cannot read the text. Amazon will sell me a refurbished original for $99, but no discount on Kindle 2 or the DX. . . . I think hardware should last longer than just about two years, especially given the cost. Since it is a fault of their design and product, I think they should reward customers who willingly tried the first edition (especially when it cost so much) and at least provide a discount on the new technology.

The typist forgot to turn on spell-check but it goes way beyond that. I found one section that, in mid-sentence, started repeating the content again. That went on for several pages then went forward.

The cover is a bit expensive, but for me it is neccessary. It protects my Kindle and give me a feel of reading a \\"normal\\" book. The Kindle came with all my data in it, and I could order books immediately. In a few second an entire book appeared. The only drawback is that it is easy to order a book while looking ..... I have done it twice, but immediately pushed yes for \\"did you order this book by accident?\\" The books were charged, but cancelled 4 -5 hours afterwards. Now I can download a sample, read it, and order the entire book.

Get your e-book in less than 1 minute.Play with letter sizes, if you are like me and have a failing vision, this is a BIG plus.Get dictionary, use text to speech when you are driving (if enabled, create wish list, make notes, mark sections).Cons:It is still black and white!

Another Chinese manufactured \\"quality\\" product.Bottom line is her's is now unregistered, but we're stuck with a $9.99 charge apparently. Want inexpensive reading? Then don't pay $259 plus $9.99 per book for aggrevation, lousy support and a fragile product. Go visit your local library. A part of your property taxes support it.

It's easy to get used to the format and it's great to have books \\"bookmarked\\" across multiple devices including iphone and ipod touch. The selection is good, but could be better.The big problem is the inability to share a book you have finished. The price of the book is significantly discounted for new books, but not for books out in paperback.

The display is just great for reading. Even reading constantly for hours does not strain your eyes. The buttons are nice and easy to navigate. In short Kindle is a truly great product and I don't think I would be reading much of paper books now. Coming to what could have been improved? A wi-fi connectivity would have been great as it would allow Kindle to surf Internet without depending on mobile networks and at no cost to Amazon or users. Secondly an expansion card like SD Card would be been great considering they are cheap and would expand the storage significantly.

The books are much less expensive, don't take up space, are not difficult to locate, or lug home from The Strand. No more wasted time locating just the right book, no more tidying up the books, putting them back. The print is always right, glasses or no. Never loose my place. There are loads of books available at a touch of a button, at very nominal prices, or free. I can get many out of print books without going into a used bookstore, and they don't smell musty. I am not an electronic person, I love to read, I never thought an electronic book would replace paper and ink for me, boy was I wrong.

I went in on it, onto 2+ years we have not had a problem with this e-reader at all. Its picture quality for a reader is second to none.

I bought a Kindle because I have low vision, and want to be able to put a moderately-priced recorded book on a portable device without having to load a bunch of CDs on my computer first. The Read-to-Me feature is pretty disappointing: Both the male and female voices drone monotonously, with poorly inflected syntax. Example: The text says \\"If you speak to me so, I will leave.\\" The Kindle voice says, \\"If you speak to me (pause) so I will leave.\\" This causes double-takes while I sort out what the text actually says and I miss the next bit.I hope amazon doesn't give up, as we Baby Boomers are aging fast, and there is a growing market for things that meet our needs going forward, such as loss of vision and loss of hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damaged Kindle, fabulous support, Amazon!","review":"Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6\\" Display, U.S. Wireless)Gotta say that I am very pleasantly surprised by the support I have just received from Amazon for my Kindle 2.I've had my Kindle since last February, and love it.

So, he offered to send me a new one, without charge, and even to provide a postage-paid label for return of the damaged unit.I am very relieved that my accident didn't cost me the price of a new Kindle.As a result of this better-than-expected customer service, I will go out of my way to patronize Amazon.

Battery life is somewhat less than the Reader due to the WiFi, which can be turned off, but still more than adequate for several days use without recharging.

I have to pay in US dollars and effectively purchasse items from the US yet I have to pay more than US residents. The library of books is miniscule compared with the likes of Waterstone's in the UK. Books available to US residents are not available to me allegedly because of copyright reasons. Yet I can buy the same ebooks from other retailers in the UK. The Kindle app for the iPod is not available on the UK Apple Store.

I know that other devices are coming/have been released that are dual screen with one e-ink screen and the other a touch screen that is color.The frustrating thing that I've found with the Kindle is that the navigation is sometime hard if you're jumping chapters a lot. Turning pages back and forth are great, but if you're using it for reference between sections/topics, it can get a little hard.I found it great that I could read and import documents that were built for other readers and PDA's, but again, the navigation is a little awkward.Other than that, the Kindle is a great device over all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle International version","review":"Received my international KindleKindle Wireless Reading Device (6\\" Display, U.S. Wireless)this morning very well packed.

First, you will read more. You will find yourself taking it with you so that any waiting or down time is used to pop open the Kindle2 and start reading. You will find that when you list with Amazon your Wish List that it takes on added meaning; almost anyone can afford to give you a book as they are typically less than $10. I suggest you also obtain the Leather Cover as you will find lots of opportunities to drop, spill, or place something on your Kindle2 that risk damaging it. I never believed that anything could impact my reading the way this product does. It just opens you to making your time more productive. The size of the Kindle2 also makes it convenient.

It's also very nice that you don't have to hold the book open, so you can be hands-free. I travel a lot for work, and being able to take as many books with me as I care to, rather than as many as I can comfortably pack, is a wonderful benefit. I like the ease of buying books on-line, too, but I would caution that you might not have the wireless connection everywhere you are.

It is light, easy to hold and the ability to change font size is especially helpful for those of us with less than perfect vision. The screen is easy to see in most lighting conditions and is easy on the eyes. Shopping for new books on the Kindle store is also convenient and delivery onto the device is very fast. One suggestion for Amazon is that they consider allowing the ability to share books/libraries with a limited number of family members or friends. Loaning your favorite read to someone, and maybe introducing them to a new author, is an integral part of enjoying literature- it would be nice to be able to do this through Kindle without giving up your own device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle device is great","review":"Have not had this long but am enjoying.

We have four bars on our older Kindle's and zero bars, no connection at all, on the new Kindle's. I have talked to support and it is no longer possible to order the U.S. only version. The only presents my kids received for Christmas were their kindles and kindle accessories. What a terrible disappointment. Amazon....you are the grinch who stole Christmas. Shame on you for not making the difference in coverage evident in the product description. Bottom line -- DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THE NEW KINDLE IF YOU LIVE OUTSIDE A MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but very easily damaged. HANDLE WITH CARE!","review":"I love the concept and love the functionality. Unfortunately, it is very easily damaged. Unlike the \\"drop test\\" video shown, it can drop 30 to 36 inches and be unrepairable. My 45-day old Kindle just dropped out of its protective pouch while I was carrying it and the screen is ruined. I called customer service and they are sending me a replacement device for around $150 with taxes. Dropping is not covered with the regulard warranty and is only covered once with the extended warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER!","review":"I feel very betrayed. I have waited to buy a kindle 2 for some time now. I purchased one and in less than 2wks. it slid off the 1 1/2ft. tall stool. I can no longer see the top part of my screen. I watched the \\"drop test\\" before purchasing, which leads you to believe that it's durable enough to withstand a 30\\" fall and still work. Not the case.I called customer support and was shocked to find out that you can't have it repaired. You send your broken one in and they sell you a refurbished one for $200! To top it off the team leader was not very friendly. We ended the conversation with him telling me he would call me back to tell me when I would be hearing from someone in a different department. That was 3 days ago.I had no idea customer support would be so bad with a company that I thought was so good. Still waiting to hear from someone to get the problem resolved. Wish me luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay with ur Kindle 1","review":"Kindle 1 has many features that are not included in Kindle 2; off-line storage, included cover, replaceable battery .....

The cost of new hard covers was advertised as being $9.99. I am seeing more new books with a kindle price of over $15. If this is due to the text-to-speech feature, then people with kindle 1 are really getting a raw deal.2/13/10. OK big publishers, you win. You have forced me to wait 3 months to receive a kindle version or buy a cheaper yet hard cover copy. Now really, what do you think I will do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned due to high book prices","review":"Amazon has started pricing new books close to hardcover price levels, but one cannot pass the Kindle version on to others or resell it.

I will most likely buy it if the price comes down by Christmas. I realize some people are upset because Amazon deleted their purchased copy of 1984. It was Amazon's mistake to have sold the book in Kindle format in the first place. But Amazon returned their money, didn't it? So go and get a hardcover copy with the refunded money and STOP whining. Kindle is a great product if one can afford it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price cut, trust gone!","review":"I've just bought what I thought would be my first kindle. Less than 60 days, Amazon took US$ 70 off because of iPad. By doing this and not returning the difference, Amazon is sayng that Apple value proposition was right and Amazon's was not.

My wife has wanted one for many years. When I gave it to her she was ecstatic. Everything she had dreamed about it was coming true.

You can order a small sample of a book you might be interested in.. this is the BEST feature about Kindle editions, I think. Why?

As such, Amazon is free to come through any time they like and remove books from your device without warning you, which they have ALREADY DONE. The license-agreement that you're forced to sign off on before using this device explicitly states that Amazon can do whatever they want to with it. Would you be okay with letting Barnes and Noble come into your house in the middle of the night and take books off of your shelves that they decided they didn't want you to have anymore? Well, Amazon has already done that, and they're going to continue doing it. If you respect property ownership and the knowledge that nobody is surreptitiously tampering with or legally stealing your books, avoid this piece of trash at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paying to own nothing","review":"You're paying to own nothing, not even a quality of experience...

I've lost all interest in buying a device which lets a company invade the user's privacy to the extent of literally stealing purchased products off the reader.Sorry, Amazon. It's your fault for not doing due diligence on the books you sell, not the buyers. Stealing books people are in the middle of reading is not only wrong, it's frightening.I usually like you guys, but I'm going with a competitor when I get an e-book for my vacation this fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't purchased and definitely won't now with recent developments","review":"I am not currently a Kindle owner, but with the recent events of Amazon revoking purchased e-books (George Orwell's 1984 & Animal Farm) this is the reason I won't be a Kindle owner anytime soon. DRM allowed Amazon to remove these purchased books from owner's that purchased them instead of doing their research and making sure that the publisher had the rights to sell these titles through Amazon's online marketplace. I've already gotten stiffed with DRM'ed music tracks on iTunes, I won't be giving into the possibility of loosing anything I've purchased because of another party's inability to do their part. Thanks, but no thanks, Amazon. Maybe when you make changes that I actually OWN the digital content that I've purchased then I'll become a \\"Kindler\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!! You don't own books you purchase","review":"I was thinking about getting a kindle until Amazon decided to delete purchased books from Kindle devices that users had purchased without warning. That the book was 1984 is beyond ironic. Now Amazon says that they cross their heart and hope to die and stick a needle in their eye won't ever do this again. I also promise that I will never ever buy a kindle from Amazon. Who knew that whispernet was just another way to monitor users and subject you to the arbitrary whim on whether you really own what you buy. I want to spend $300 on that. Oh wait, can they take the device back too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disillusioned.","review":"I understand the concept of only owning a license to material purchased through the Kindle service, but the idea that Amazon may at any time remotely delete information that I paid for from the device leaves me rather disinclined to purchase one of these. What's next? Will amazon also be deleting my own PDFs that I upload to the device? I think I'll be sticking with my trusty paperbacks for the time being. Perhaps one day Amazon will get a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if they don't change their mind!","review":"Amazon removed all the George Orwell books from customers' Kindles who'd ALREADY PURCHASED AND DOWNLOADED the book(s)!If you want to buy the Kindle for ease of use, etc, perhaps you don't mind. But the idea that AMAZON gets to decide if you can keep it....well, that's a deal breaker for me. I'd like to know after I purchase a book that I get to keep it as long as I want....refund or no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle 2 Screen went blank","review":"I recently bought the Kindle 2 for my grandmother who loves to read but can no longer get out of the house to pick up books. I thought this would be an awesome gift for her since I have the Kindle 1 and LOVE it. Well I gave it to her this past Sat. We registered it and she was looking at it and it fell off her lap onto the carpet and the screen went blank and now it won't start up. Now Amazon is stating that the warranty does not cover damages. HOWEVER it was only dropped at most 2 feet from the couch to the carpet. I was given the option to pay another $200.00 to buy a refurbished Kindle 2... Which means that I now will be paying $570.00 for a used Kindle 2.I am VERY disappointed in Amazon. My grandmother didn't even purchase 1 book on this device and now we are out $270.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM abuse","review":"Amazon uses the DRM on the kindle to delete books that its users have paid for and remove features which they once had. This is a perfect example of how the users are tricked into thinking that they own the products and the software but really they don't. They are simply borrowing these things from Amazon and can have them taken away at any time. Its unfortunate that users don't understand what rights they have. But this is the nature of DRM and proprietary software. You are essentially signing an agreement that you don't actually own any of it. But you are led to believe that you do own it.If you do decide to buy a kindle understand that you may have your books deleted with no warning and there is nothing you can do about it. I encourage people to google words like DRM and open source software if they want to learn more. Learn about what free software really means, the freedom to have control over your own devices rather than signing that freedom away in an end user agreement."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM - Had a Kindle in my cart - Thank goodness I didn't purchase yet.","review":"I've been drooling over a Kindle for nearly a year. With the recent price drop, I had budgeted to purchase in August. Thank goodness that the 1984 fiasco happened now. If I had known a year ago that Amazon would resort to deleting content remotely, no way would I have wasted any time dreaming of a Kindle.

The wireless whisper net gives you access to download your books you buy without charging a monthly service. That practically sold me there. The books do come in seconds and the price break on them will more than pay for the unit. My wife has already paid for hers twice with all the book ordering she does. Very clean graphics for being black and white. The size is almost as thin as a credit card and light as your cell phone so you can take it anywhere and not have it take up much space or weigh you down. It is missing a backlight and if you leave whisper net on your battery life drastically drops but turning off the net and getting a light for it by passes those issues. I rate this as a must if you have a heavy reader in the family and books are eating into your budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I haven't yet taken a long trip but even on short trips it is great. The ability to have multiple books on one device without having to pack extras is wonderful.

I highly recommend it to avid readers, especially those who also travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply great","review":"I love this Kindle, my reading time has grown thanks to this easy to read eBook, I'm using this in Mexico with excelent conectivity and for a low price books can be aquired, my only concern is about the limited titles in spanish"},{"rating":"2","title":"the Kindle","review":"I really enjoy the kindle. One recommendation- you need to figure out how to backlight the kindle for night reading. I know you can attach a light, but I would like something incorporated into product.Also, disappointed with the increase in McMilliam prices. I have read more books than ever with the kindle. Now that prices are higher I will not- what they receive in higher prices will be offset by a drop in volume. I will look for other books. Please try to be competitive. Remember with hard books you can circulate to multiple people, with kindle it is much more restrictive. That should in itself provide a lower cost. An hell look at the reduction in paper. Good for the environment.Otherwise a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle is Happiness","review":"I have the 2nd version of the kindle but purchased the latest version because I liked the options a little better.

Even before then she was using it and I purchased a large number of books she would enjoy. Now I find out that I cannot pass the books to her account along with re-registering the Kindle to her. If I had invested in the paperbacks, I could pass them on to anyone I pleased. I think anyone considering a Kindle purchase should be aware of this.

I also love how easy it is to read in any lighting, because there is no back light theres no glare. It is the perfect size to just throw in my purse, and I can have a new book at the touch of a button. I love how when I turn it on it goes to the last page I read, I never lose my page.

When your Kindle breaks (mine lasted nine months), Amazon will only send you a refurbished device. Amazon will not repair your Kindle or replace it with a new device. So you will be getting a Kindle that was defective for some other reason as your replacement.That's not the \\"customer centric\\" approach I expected. So, you get one defective Kindle replaced with another provided you are in the one-year warranty period. If your Kindle breaks on the 13th month, I guess you will have not recourse whatsoever.And think about it...if Amazon has an inventory of refurbished devices, what does that tell us? It tells us that there are quality problems with the device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor contrast is a dealbreaker","review":"It's with a very heavy heart that I'm returning my Kindle.

Of course it's going to be a different experience for different people but for me the dark grey text on a light grey background was really hard to read & after 15 mins I would have eye strain and the beginnings of a headache. Surprisingly a bigger front made little difference. A crying shame as it would have been a fabulous product otherwise.

As the day goes on, sometimes my eyes get tired and I need to put on a pair of reading glasses. Not with the Kindle, I just increase the font.Oh, and it is so much easier to travel with a Kindle instead of books.

I had to get it after falling in love with Kindle 1. I use this daily and don't think I could be without it at this point. Not only does it make reading even more enjoyable it makes working out on the treadmill a pleasure. No more pages to contend with and I don't have to feel guilty about taking the time out of my day just to read. I highly recommend it to anyone who is an avid reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !","review":"Really enjoy the Kindle II. My daughter saw it and really likes it also. It may be a good gift for Christmas for her. It took me a month to decide to get it, but NO regrets. The future of reading books is here now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressive","review":"Wow! Very bright, easy to read and downloads in seconds. With the addition of the leather cover it feels like a comfortably sized book in your hands. It would be nice to have a color screen, but hey 90% of what most of us read is probably black & white ink anyway. All in all, a very good purchase. I'll be using the \\"read to me\\" feature during my drive time into work too. Very nicely done!*UPDATE - Having had my Kindle for a while now, I wanted to add that since the e-ink doesn't require much power (if any) to maintain the screen image the battery life seems to lasts forever between charges. If I turn off the wireless I could probably go over a week between charges, and that's reading a couple of hours each day. Sweet..."},{"rating":"1","title":"1984 is the object of itself","review":"So, I buy a book about how the powers running the world can change history by simply re-writing it. And it turns out that the powers running amazon.com can do just that. By deleting the book.It is not scandalous that amazon.com did delete books that people had bought and paid for. (Although it is incredible irony that they picked 1984 and Animal House.)What is frightening is that they can.I'm going to stick to hard copies. Nobody has yet come knocking at my door to claim any bootleg copies I might have.Dave Hay"},{"rating":"2","title":"Congressional Medal for Amazon's service","review":"My husband is recovering from a brain injury that caused him not to be able to read at first. With the Kindle, he can now see to read, go back to re-read, use a dictionary, etc. all on the Kindle. It has become his constant companion. Any book he desires can almost instantly be purchased and ready for his perusal. I, too, am reading with his Kindle. He reads up until seven o'clock in the evening, his bedtime, and I take over and read until I go to sleep. I am currently reading all of Jane Austen's six books and some of Mary Higgins Clark. My husband is 82 years old and has brain problems, but with the Kindle, he has something to do even in the wintertime. All I can say is----whoever invented it should have a Congressional Medal of Honor and Amazon should have one too for making so many good books available for prices much less than you would pay for a real book. God bless you all from a VERY happy purchaser."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Test Driven Them Both, Kindle By a Landslide","review":"I've had my Kindle for 3 months, and I couldn't be happier. A relative got me a Nook for Christmas not knowing that I had a Kindle. I decided to try out the Nook for the heck of it and to say the least I was stunned. It kept locking up and was dreadfully slow. You almost need a club for the touchscreen. Every time I tried to search the B&N store, the screen would flash and take me back to the start-up page. The button for turning the page was stiff, turning pages on the Nook was much slower,there was no web browser on the Nook, and the keyboard was so small that I couldn't touch just one letter at a time, they really need to include a stylus if they're going to continue selling these. I've never written a review before, but after my experience with the Nook, it is a long way off to even coming close to my Kindle. If you are considering an e-reader, save your time researching the Nook, it is just not nearly as good and friendly as the Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who would have thought it possible","review":"I have to say that before I received my Kindle I was an avid reader of anything I could lay my hands on.Since starting to use the Kindle I have found myself reading more and at a greater pace! Is this down to the novelty factor or is it the ease with which you can obtain material, the speed you can download it and the simplicity of the Kindle in presenting it? Somehow I think it is the later.Nothing can take away the joy of actually handling a book, but the Kindles ability to store so much reading material and the ease with which you can jump from one publication to another also makes it a joy.I have only been a 'Kindler' for a month, but I am hooked and would recommend the experience to anyone that reads for the simple joy of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife Loves Kindle","review":"I bought the Kindle for my wife's birthday.

We travel a lot and I can never leave home without at least three books, so this saves a lot of space and weight in my suitcase. It's comfortable to use and to hold. I like the fact that the manual is built right in so I can look up another feature as I get to it. The best feature of all is the built in dictionary! I can look up any word in less than a second and go right on reading!!! I also like to highlight passages and make notes, especially for my book club selections. This toy was made for me! My only complaint is that the 5 way button does so much and I seem to touch it the wrong way and lose my place. For some reason it doesn't always go back to where I was reading and I have to stop and search a little. I'm sure this is my fault and not my Kindle's but I can't seem to find a solution - yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"Like I said in my review of the black leather cover, this was a birthday gift. I have talked to many people about the KINDLE and everyone has praised it highly. I wasn't sure that I would like reading a book like this, but I will probably never buy another book. The real truth is I am reading faster than ever before because I was able to increase the size of the font. The battery really last a long time and it has been perfect for all the traveling I do. People on the planes are always asking me about it. I plan on getting one for each of my daughters and husband for their birthdays this year.Amazon, you really have a hit. Please see if you can do something like the NOOK is doing as far as getting to share books with others who have the KINDLE. This would be another great marketing tool.LOVE, LOVE MY KINDLE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle","review":"What can I say, I LOVE THE KINDLE. It is the best $259.00 I have spent in my entire life. I am an American living in Alexandria, Egypt for a few years and I love to read. The problem in Egypt is a paperback cost anywhere between $13.00 and $20.00. With the kindle I can buy a book for less than half the price. My husband brought me the Kindle on October 19 from America, and it is now December 6 and I have read 18 books in about 6 weeks. I have not read that many books since elementary school.

I almost upgraded to a Kindle2 recently and am I glad that I did not waste my money. All of a sudden new books are not available in ebook format- they say the publishers are squabbling with Amazon over how much of a profit they can squeeze out of the customer. Penquin books are not available- as are several other publishers. They were offered for pre sale but as soon as the book is published the ebook is pulled. Do not buy a kindle or nook or any other ebook reader unless you are willing to wait until they decide how much to take you for. I will not be buying these books in print either. Boycot these publishers- don't buy there products- sorry authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"kindle book","review":"I have enjoyed reading on my kindle.

I was recently talking with a colleague of my husband's about my kindle. He is an avid reader, and I noticed he was slugging a huge book to the beach. He told me he had a difficult time reading screens, but he loved the concept of e-reader. I let him try it...2 weeks ago..and I have yet to see it come back!! He loves it too. The whole product is very user friendly..even for the not-so-techy-inclined (me). Right out of the box, it was easy to get reading fast. Having trialled a few other models, it is lighter, the positioning of the page turner is better ergonomically, and having the ability to get a new book anywhere is far better. I am hoping to see my knidle back soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Blessing!","review":"The Kindle has become a blessing to me. I am a retired schoolteacher and, like most teachers, I love to read. Recently I was diagnosed with an eye condition in my right eye that cannot be repaired at this time - and may never be. My right eye is totally blurred. The Kindle has enabled me to read again because I can adjust the size of the font! I have found all of my favorite authors and can preview a book before I buy it. Plus I can have over 1,000 books at my disposal at any time - no need to make a trip to the book store - and at a reduced price!! I can find NO disadvantage to having a Kindle. For anyone having difficulty reading, I recommend the Kindle oh, and I forgot, that the Kindle also has text to speech so you can listen to your book! If you have an elderly parent, this is the perfect gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best e-book reader by far!","review":"I own a kindle 1 and kindle 2. I love them both. My husband got me the kindle 2 for my birthday. I wasn't sure that I wanted one, but when it got here it was the best present I have ever received. I love the text to talk, it works alout better than I thought it would. I also love the fact they made the next and previous page buttons a little bit harder to push so I am not constantly pressing buttons I don't mean to. I think it is funny that people on here that don't even own a kindle at all are rating the kindle with 1 star. You don't know how great something is unless you have used one or own one. They are great, I love my kindle 1 and 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a book - Save your money","review":"I owned my Kindle for about a year when it died completely. We found out from Amazon that you must send the unit back to have it checked, and/or have the battery replaced. You cannot buy a battery and insert it. You MUST send the unit back.I don't know about you, but I find that ridiculous. Bottom line? None of my books have ever 'broken' and/or required a new battery. I don't mind hefting a good book, nor do I mind packing 3 or 4 to take on a trip.Nothing reads like a book, nothing feels like a book, nothing smells like a book.Forget buying the Kindle - save your money and frustration and buy a book instead.

At first, I was completely amazed and thrilled with my Kindle. It seemed perfect, with its amazing screen and the fact that one can take notes while reading and even look up words in the dictionary without leaving the page one is at. However, after only a week it stopped working and after resetting it and turning it on and off a million times, I gave up.This product, at least for me, was a total disappointment and a complete waste of my money.

So much for customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't right.","review":"It isn't right that amazon controls the content of your Kindle. That they can delete items when they see fit. Amazon has stated that their aim is to make the device disapear and the content stand out. That using a kindle should be just like using a real book.

However, any book you buy on amazon's Kindle store could be encumbered with DRM -- and the terms of it can change AFTER you buy it. So Amazon gives no guarantee that you'll be able to restore the book afters it's archived, or that the eBook won't be surreptitiously deleted off of your device while you sleep. It's happened before, and it could happen again.As long as you stick to eBooks which are in open formats and avoid the amazon store, you'll be safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective By Design","review":"Let's see here:1.

I need a technical barrier to prevent this without my approval."},{"rating":"1","title":"TTS removed as a feature","review":"The product itself it great. But then there's this... betrayal! Amazon gave in to the Authors Guild without any kind of fight over the text to speech feature. Now you'll have to also buy \\"rights\\" to have your book read aloud, when in reality there have been devices with exactly this function for many years designed for the blind. What's going on here? Is this a way to squeeze out a few more dollars from your early adopters? I've got one of these, and while the TTS feature isn't something I've been using much it's a feature that should remain intact or at least be fought for. Come on Amazon, stand up for your product and our rights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kindle","review":"I am enjoying my kindle and find that I am reading faster.

The product itself is pretty good, no complaints here, but then I think there are too many restrictions for non-US buyers to make the choice worthwhile.- Kindle books are generally more expensive than printed books, I did not expect that at all.- Magazines are very expensive too, and no pictures. What is a magazine without pictures?- I really wanted to read some new books, from Dan Brown or Zafon for example. But these are unavailable here. I still have to buy a paper edition if I want to stay up-to-date. But the whole point of buying the Kindle is to travel lighter and to save a tree or two.- I wanted to easily read a load of technical e-books I have, in PDF format. The Kindle is not good at displaying them, and you have to go through an awkward conversion process.- Books in Dutch? Magazines in Dutch?Maybe I should have bought a Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Kindle 2 but wish it was quiet","review":"Have had the Kindle 2 for about 3 months and am enjoying having access to all the lastest books.

Basically, I am having so much enjoyment with all the features I'm using.It has a 4 rating because I would like color to read magazines and illustrated books. Barnes and Noble is releasing their Nook next month, and it does have color. If I were to buy one now I would be coosing between the 2 for that reason. I am not unhappy with my choice though. It would be a fun extra perhaps but not a reason to choose one over the other.I have friends who feel that one who loves to read needs to turn real pages. I find this is more enjoyable and I am an avid reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have","review":"I was skeptical about giving up buying books and getting a Kindle. Would I like not actually having the book? Would it be as easy to read? Would I have to wait for the page to Turn? Can I go back and reread easily? What about a bookmark? What happens when I turn it off? Well the Kindle eased all my concerns. When I turn it off, it turns on right to the page I left off on. You can place bookmarks if you stop in the middle of a page. There is no glare. I can read it as clear in the bright sun on the beach as I can at home in my den. The page turn easier and faster than I was able to turn a real page and the print size is adjustable. Best of all, I don't have all these books to store around the house.

I buy lots of books and simply do not have the space for all the printed books. My only disappointment is that there are many reference books that you still can't get in Kindle format. I recently gave all of my printed books away, except for the atlas' as I've bought a new condo and don't want all the printed books taking up space. Additionally, I've recently been confined to a wheelchair and the Kindle lets me take all my books along with ease.

If I could return mine I certainly would as my entire reason for purchasing it (ease of download, ready availability of books at reasonable price) has vanished now that Amazon has seen fit to make the Kindle redundant by offering Kindle Books to anything with an internet connection.

I did worry whether he would make the transition from books as he is an active reader. However, since receiving the Kindle, he has increased his reading activity and he has had many friends and strangers ask him about the device. He has very positive things to say about the device, tells people that the Kindle has given him more freedom in choosing books, it allows him to carry and read more than one book at a time, he does not have to worry about storing books as at anytime that he finishes a book, the wireless access lets him chose and download a best seller from the Kindle store. One of his work associates, who also is an active reader, was in the process of adding two bookshelf units in his family room. With the Kindle, my husband has told his associate that he can forego the expense of bookshelves and enjoy the flexibility provided by the Kindle.

They refund your money - but that's not the point. If you bought a paper book, this would be a non-starter.Item #2 - I'd mostly use this as an aggregated collection of my reference works - but I already own 95% of the reference books I'd want on the kindle (HTML lookup, JavaScript references, web language references, CSS references, etc.) If I could send in my books and pay a nominal ($2? $5?) fee to get the electronic equivalents, that'd be great. However, that option doesn't exist, and who is to say O'Reilly won't yank all my licensed reference books on a whim?

Imagine a world in which all copies of once-censored books like Candide, The Call of the Wild, and Ulysses had been permanently destroyed at the time of the censoring and could not be studied or enjoyed after subsequent decision-makers lifted the ban.\\"I'm hoping that future versions of the Kindle (and the iPhone!) don't have this feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your books are only rentals.","review":"Don't believe the hype.

When l purchased the book, the receipt said l would get the book May 2, 2010. Is there some kind law that says one must wait and extra three months for electronic books or is this a scam.

In fact, the quick change text sizing feature means I can even keep going when my eyes get tired (as they do these days) by just making the text a bit bigger. Now I don't have to remember my latest book - I always have my Kindle and as soon as I find myself with even just a few minutes of time I can pull it out and read a few pages.

To have a device that you can carry around 200 books, be reading a new book in a few seconds, and change the type size to what is comfortable for you. You cannot do that with regular books. Reading the device is very pleasurable and very close to the experience of reading a book. Moreover, most books are only $10. In many ways i consider it a better experience than reading a book.

Books are cheaper and download fast. Also, it's easy to read. I got her a Kindle cover,too. Good investment and cheap.

However, my daughter dropped it from a height of about 12 inches and now the display is ruined. It was in the leather kindle cover. The customer service rep said they are drop-tested, but c'mon, it should be able to take a little more wear and tear than this. He offered to replace it for $200, but for me that puts the expense ratio over the limit. For something that is meant to be portable and carried around, I am very disappointed that it broke so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Future is Here","review":"I've owned my new Kindle2 for about one month now and I can honestly say its fantastic. Being able to shop and download (at a discount) your favorite authors, or the latest best sellers on such a slim effecient device, then have Amazon archive them for you for free.....,what more can someone ask for? The best thing is I don't have to build book shelves or store boxes of books. I don't utilize the text to speach or MP3 features, but I can see how these would appeal to some. I look forward to seeing the rest of some of my favorite past authors publications being converted to kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it but......","review":"My teenage son was bugging me to give him my Kindle 1 and was very thrilled when the Kindle 2 came out so I would buy it. I really like the Kindle 2, but for $359, why on earth does it not come with a cover? C'mon Amazon, this is a hefty investment in your product and you should have sent a cover with it. I am not impressed with the Amazon cover (which costs another $30) so plan to buy the M-Edge cover, which takes 2-3 weeks to ship. Now I am hesitant to take my new Kindle on vacation - I don't want to risk getting it damaged on the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best purchase I've made!","review":"I have loved my Kindle 2 since the moment I opened the box and purchased my first book! I highly recommend getting a Kindle if you don't already have one. I'm actually selling my Kindle 2 to buy the latest model. I take it with me everywhere. I love it because it takes up such little space and I don't have to carry my library around with me, like I used to. I won't go into describing the features, since all of that is above, but I will tell you that you won't regret spending the money to buy one. I do recommend buying a jacket or sleeve for it to keep it in good condition. Now, hurry and get one already!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Kindle","review":"After looking at other ereaders I chose the Kindle 2.

Why the background is gray and not white is puzzling to me. The text is also not black, but light black. To me it looks like gray on gray and is completely not acceptable. I was further shocked to find that there is no way to adjust the contrast. That is really messed up. BTW, those nice photos on the right side of the product description page is NOT what it looks like. Those are not honest photos. When I read a piece of paper, I'm reading black on white, and that is easy for my 40+ year old eyes. I could never use a K2, as this issue is to bothersome. The low contrast is shockingly bad.

Two days ago Amazon removed them from my Kindle and gave me a refund. I did not want a refund, I wanted the content I had already purchased. I called and talked with Amazon customer support and was told, in a nutshell, \\"tough\\". Amazon says it is out of their hands because of a dispute with the publisher. If I had purchased the book as a normal book, and there had been a dispute with the publisher...would they have come to my house, taken the book and left a few bucks on the shelf? Of course not! Amazon, you have been a great company for a long time, but this is unforgivable. Make it right. Give the content back to the people who already purchased it.

I like to read and with Kindle in hand I am going to do that more often. There are two types of gadgets, one which just tries to create a need when there is none, and another which identifies the existing need and serves it so well that it becomes a delightful experience. Amazon's Kindle lies in the later category. Some amazing features include:- Text to speech.- No glare.- The e-ink or whatever they call it makes you forget you are not reading an actual paper book.- The capability to store hundreds of book in this little gadget without worrying about storage or wasting paper.- Books delivered in seconds.- Newspapers, periodicals.- A vast selection of free books.- Availability of samples for almost every book.- Portability.- Amazing customer support.Its a must have item for someone who likes to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"all it's cracked up to be","review":"I was intrigued but skeptical - too skeptical to lay out the scratch for one of these \\"things\\".

I can read the International Herald Tribune whenever I want, and I downloaded ALL OF Jules Verne (39 volumes) for less than a buck.It's easy to use and navigate. It's as much fun to read as my books (minus their wonderful smell), and it's more portable than most hardcover books.

With a capability to store around 1,500 books on one device is certainly a space saver, and is a blessing if you move often :-).I still cannot get my head around the price of the device though. They started at $399, and you can find them now advertised for $359. I still think this is a bit steep for a device that merely downloads and digitally displays textual material for reading. Mini computers sell for this much too.

The only issues I have are minor in comparison:- It's a little slow turning the page. Paging through a chapter (sometimes search isn't what I want) is a bit of a chore.- It only seems to have 1 font (normal, bold & italic). For technical magazines & books that I read a lot, code samples look awful because of the wrapping. A smaller, mono-spaced font would be great.- Some pictures appear very washed out, especially screen shots from computers. Apparently, there are no options when converting the pictures so that the publisher can choose hi-contrast.- Magazine-type publications should start at the table of contents instead of page 1. I rarely read a magazine starting at page 1 and read all the way through. I go to the articles I'm interested in.For all these minor issues, I wouldn't dream of giving up my Kindle2.

Unfortunately, she can't put it down; which has several side effects, good and bad. I've lost about twenty pounds since she now refuses to cook and yet I get to watch all the sports I want as she is mesmorized by her Kindle. I have saved a ton of money as she won't even go shopping anymore.

It really is something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Invention, Could Not Live Without","review":"This is an amazing invention which was recommended by my mother's low vision doctor to aid with her reading. I, in turn, was infatuated with it and ordered it for myself. I had thought it worked only in a wireless home/building but discovered it works off cell phone tower power. There is no monthly fee only the price of down loading some of the books. Most of the classics are free with a nominal fee for all others. Most books are in \\"Kindle form\\". It takes less than a minute to down load a book. You can take it internationally with you. Your entire library is in one thin Kindle. Your Kindle keeps track of the page you are on and is immediately on that page when turned on. The text size can be set two sizes larger or smaller than the original. I could go on and on with it's many other attributes but will let you discover those for yourself when you have purchased your own Kindle.Author: An Avid Reading Grannie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle 6\\" Latest Generation","review":"I have really enjoyed my Kindle and have just read my first book on it .

I would caution anyone who is interested in buying one to do your research so you aren't disappointed. I think the technology of the kindle is great but I'm disappointed that the battery can't be changed on your own. You have to send it to the Amazon factory and pay 59.00 plus shipping to have them replace it. This means that you will be without your kindle for 1 - 2 months.

It works and it works well.However, we all need to be aware that the DRM added to these \\"books\\" makes them unusable except by the buyer and except on a Kindle. We can't sell them or lend them unless we lend the hardware as well as the file. This new world that Bezos and Amazon are building is going to trample on the end-users' rights like nothing has before.The decision to cave to the Writer's Guild on the text-to-speech is both a form of \\"bait-and-switch\\" selling and an indication that end-users are secondary to Bezos' plans.Furthermore, the lack of a user changeable battery is bad engineering.Think carefully before buying into this concept of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon Kindle","review":"We love it.

Customer service either doesn't listen or doesn't understand English. I feel like I have been scammed and will NEVER buy from Amazon again.Just weird to me that Kindles cannot be fixed; they can only be replaced. Why does it have to be all or nothing?

I will not pay more than $9.99 for an e-book. I have traditionally refused to purchase hard cover books, prefering to wait for the paperback version. The only reason I did not return my Kindle when I received it as a gift is the fact that I could purchase recent releases for $9.99. This seemed like a good compromise to the cost of a hard cover. I have now read one e-book with the Kindle and it may be my last due to the price increase. The reader works just fine, but there is no point now that the e-book price is going up. The only feature that appeals to me over a real book is the cheaper new release titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best eBook on the Market!","review":"I recently purchased a Kindle. I have to say the device exceeded my expectations. There isn't a huge number of devices on the market in Australia and the Kindle is by far the most superior available.The Kindle is easy to use, has text to speech functionality (making learning a new language that much easier) and the wireless access to amazon.com is surprisingly fast. You are also able to load any ebooks that you may have already stored on your computer onto your Kindle.In addition, the buttons/keys for the Kindle are sterdy (unlike other devices on the market where the buttons need to be pushed hard and the device feels like it will fall apart when this is done).I would highly recommend purchasing the Kindle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoying my Kindle","review":"I received my kindle as a gift and I find it very easy to take a long where ever I go.

I left mine in sleep mode but kept it tucked away. The downside of the Kindle is that if you're stuck on the tarmac for a long taxi and take-off, you can't read your book, which I found very frustrating, so a magazine is useful to tote along as well.Also, I prefer to carry it with me rather than leave it in a car on a hot day, which could damage the battery, so sometimes I have to tote it along even though I won't be using it.Other than those two issues, I love traveling with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Invention Ever!","review":"I am so happy with this purchase I barely know what to say!

What's the point of a GLOBAL wireless device if not all titles are available to all countries?

If one sells a product that reportedly is compatible to a certain file format it should at the very least give you the ability to read the text should it not? Is there a software fix in the works?

I think anyone who thinks the IPad is going to replace the Kindle is simply wrong. The Ipad is too big and heavy, and you can't see it in all lighting conditions. I could see getting one for reading magazine subscriptions with lots of color graphics, like \\"Scientific American,\\" but for simple text reading the Kindle is still the way to go. In fact, I like my 6 inch Kindle better than ever after having now used an IPad. My girlfriend agrees (and it was her IPad I was using). My dentist just got a Kindle too, after considering the IPad. Many thanks to Jeff and the Amazon crew for creating this device.

However I am puzzled why this will only work with a computer USB rather than the USB power adaptor.The point of purchasing a kindle was to get all those out of print books. I have been very disappointed with the range available in the Kindle editions. My 'hit rate' of books I want to read has been 1 in 20 so far.If you allow children to play with the Kindle then you will find you have subscribed to Fortune magazine.

I am not going to write a lengthy review as many people have already done so. What I would like to say is that the only reason I bought Kindle 2 is because it provides Text-to-Speech function. I work in IT department as a software engineer. I don't want to overuse my eyes at home as I have already spent at least 8 hours in front of the terminal at work. The Text-to-Speech function reads the content of the books and magazines for me, which not only saving my money for not buying expensive audio books but also gives my eyes an opportunity to rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Generation of Readers","review":"Amazing. Already in a week, the Kindle2 is indispensible. The sound bites are true- light weight, easy to use, feels like reading a book. But the K2 is so much more. So portable! I can read anywhere. In just a week I have read books for business and pleasure. For business, the highlighting and notes are a true bonus. The search engine allows me to find my notes without carrying a separate notebook or remembering the page I highlighted. For travel it solves taking 5 or more books in a briefcase and lugging them around. I love the auditory version too! What a wonderful surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but can we brighten the screen?","review":"I just got my Kindle, not having used the previous version. It's very cool.

Was one of the very first editions of the Kindle and so not worth the $68 I paid for it. Amazon was selling those for $25 when the Fire first came out.

I bought a Kindle on the premise that books will cost $10 or less, and now I find that books are costing $15 or more.

To make it even more complicated, the kindle can't download updates through the 3g network, but instead requires a computer and an internet connection. I asked the sales support what would happen if I didn't own a computer and she said I would be out of luck.So I ask, what is the point of having a 3g kindle when the company expects you to own a computer that necessitates an internet connection in order to update the kindle in order to use the 3g feature to download books.

You do not own your library. You own nothing but a few ounces of plastic and circuitry.

To have to pack, wrap and find a way to mail the unit back to Amazon is impossible for me and probably nany other readers.

Luckily, I have a friend who was willing to lend me their credit card. So that my friend is never charged, I purchase gift certificates and apply them to my Amazon account. It works but it leaves me reliant on my friend's generosity, which is inconvenient. While I love my Kindle2, my friend bought a Sony E-reader and he seems just as happy with it.

It was like it was possessed. Research online shows that this is not an uncommon problem and is caused by a hardware issue. Unfortunately my device is out of warranty. I was surprised to find out that Amazon has not invested in a service center for Kindle so instead of being able to send for repair the only options are to shell out $90 for a refurbished kindle (with only a 90 day warranty) or replace it completely for $190 and add an extra $65 for the 2 year warranty.

There have been occasions when the hardcover book is only a few cents more. But I just decided that I will not buy any books more than $9.99. My other main complaint is the absence of folders to place the books in. I would love to see a folder for books I have already read etc. Hopefully Amazon will send out a software patch for this?We have had a few occasions where the wireless would not connect, but eventually it does.

I especially like the look up a word feature that gives the definition at the bottom of the screen without interrupting your reading. The Nook takes you to another screen for definitions. As far a reading, they are both the same. My one frustration is that the ebooks never go on sale. There are times that buying a bound book is cheaper than the ebook.

I took it to the beach without incident. Battery life is amazing! I do recommend buying a skin of some sort and a case. I have the Belkin neoprene case and a silicone skin and I love both. Yes the neoprene smell is strong at first, but tough it out...it goes away. Mine smells like leather now because I keep it in my purse a lot. Buy the Kindle 2!! It's amazing!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new friend","review":"My wife is not so happy with this purchase, as I spend so much time with it.I like everything about this new companion, except that it is difficult to cancel subscriptions to magazines.

One of the reasons I purchased it was that books are so expensive here. Now that I am back in New Zealand my kindle can not down load books :( I have wireless in my home but get no signal for the kindle. What is the solution?? I want to purchase some of the wonderful new books you are advertising but have now way of doing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"addicted to my kindle","review":"I love this device and use it all of the time. The ability to change the font size makes for easy reading in all kinds of situations.My only complaint is that I wish it were backlit, but maybe a later generation. You need a light (e.g., book light) to read the Kindle in a dark place."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Toy","review":"I wanted to let you know that I am really enjoying my Kindle 2 - wasn't sure how it would be to read a book electronically rather than holding the book itself in my hands. Must admit it is still a bit strange but it is truly an amazing little gadget. I will enjoy having it for a long time to come; truly a wonderful gift for any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading is fun again!","review":"Reading has become fun again! A few years ago I had a stroke and left me unable to hold a book with only the use of one hand. Since Igot my Kindel reading has become enjoyble again. It is so easy to use with one hand, no more pages to turn while trying to hold on to the book at the same time. Also buying new books is so easy. I take it everywhere with me. I only wish it had a built in light, and for the price you pay for it, it should come with a case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Review","review":"I bought this Kindle as a gift for someone entering college this fall, hoping that textbooks might become available soon. It looks like that is a definite possibility. Regarding the Kindle itself, after one week, the screen froze up and would display only the screensaver. I called Amazon to report this and they offered to replace it, no questions asked. They sent out a new Kindle and I returned the old one. The new one is three weeks old now and is working great so far! The wireless download of books is amazingly quick. The daily periodicals are also great. I selected this particular unit over the newer model Kindle due to it's smaller size. At this size, the screen is just fine. Also, I love the text-to-speech function. You can sit back, close your eyes and let the Kindle read to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes book reading even more fun.","review":"This is a great tool.

A disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billing Department","review":"I have a Kindle and am very satisfied with it. I have a gift card with a balance and a valid credit card on file. I just received an email telling me that my \\"credit option\\" is about to expire. I replied to the email only to find that Amazon does not respond to an email. They give you a list of probable answers. There is no \\"one size fits all.\\" So, I have no answer and I have a Kindle and I cannot buy more books until I add money to a pot that has plenty of money in it. If you are going to buy, keep in mind that you are at the mercy of Amazon if you want something to read. This is an example of how to destroy an excellent customer relationship.Joseph Graham"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Amazon,","review":"Dear Amazon Kindle,Its pity that kindle is available even for Tanzania, Tonga, iceland,...but not for Turkiye and we are in the middle of Europe, anyway thanks to apple tablet for coming soon.Regards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle Wireless","review":"I love my Kindle.

Amazing","review":"I read the reviews before I bought my Kindle but I didn't believe everything I was reading. I got my Kindle and ordered my first book sat down to read and before I knew it I had finished the book. It is somehow easier to read a book on the Kindle than on paper. And yes I had read others saying the same thing. But that was one of the things I didn't believe. I don't know why it is easier on the Kindle but it is.Features I like about the Kindle are, How light weight it is, easy to take wherever I go. The ease of downloading a book anywhere... in seconds it is downloaded and I can start reading. I love the fact that I can download a free sample of the book to make sure I have not already read it or that it looks like something I would want to read.. You truly have a book store at your fingertips.Peggy"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],x={key:0},W={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(g,null,b(r.visiblePoems,(l,y)=>(a(),f(c,{key:y,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...l)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...l))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,D)):p("",!0)])}const B=d(O,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-dd229a19"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/46.md","filePath":"library/46.md"}'),M={name:"library/46.md"},C=Object.assign(M,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{j as __pageData,C as default};
