I bought this phone, the one I received would not hang up and did not work for a minute. I called Panasonic and had to hassel them for a pre-paid return label. I sent the phone back and expected to get another new phone. Instead I got an old, \\"refurbished\\" phone with previous owner's sticker still on it, and worse still, the phone would not hang up either! When I called the customer service, again, they said the best they could do was to send me another shipping label and send me another \\"refurbished\\" phone.

However the unit I purchased won't keep working for over 2 hours of actual use (even w/o using the speakerphone) on 3 AA cells. It appears to drain the cells after 2 hours of actual use. Using new cells works but the same problem appears. After reading horror stories about refurbished units being sent back as \\"repaired units\\" by Panasonic I'm reluctant to go through the hassle of shipping it to them for warranty repairs. I'd write this off as a loss due to bad design."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good speakerphone","review":"We chose this product arbitrarily for price and features, needing nothing more than an inexpensive but effective speakerphone.

I have three problems with this book:1. Her arguments don't follow her line of reasoning. I will give her credit for laying out a framework to guide her arguments, though she fails to back them in my view.2. She uses newspaper articles as primary sources. I learned in junior high school that this is a no no. I'm a little frightened that this \\"academic\\" teaches young and old people at a major university, probably \\"requiring\\" them to read this book.3. She claims to speak from an American point of view, which seems to me that of a white, well to do perspective.

Surely this well educated woman is aware of our transgressions, and we are left wondering what her true intentions are.If you enjoy being brainwashed, by all means, buy this book.

Instead of making an honest attempt to understand the subject thorougly (which, in the case of astrology, involves hard work), they resort to purely rhetorical arguments, ridicule, logical trickery, misrepresentation of the subject, \\"debunkery by association\\", sometimes even make up scientific evidence to the contrary and invent whole studies that were never performed.This scholarly work does not need any of this.

The base unit audio quality is good, but battery life is about 20 minutes...even when replacement battary is installed. Use of speakerphone in base unit cuts off the phone. The second cordless unit works flawlessly; has a good range...but your callers have trouble hearing you...and many times you can't hear the caller. I continue to use the Panasonic because the AT&T system I had purchased before from Staples crapped out within two weeks...and the attitude of the customer service folks was disgusting...and the cost of repair or replacement was more expensive than the purchase price. At least the Panasonic keeps working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I have two cordless handsets and replaced the batteries.

This particular model makes me want to give up on buying telephones altogether, and revert back to my rotary phone, or two Dixie Cups and a string.Not only is the sound quality poor, but the batteries are horrible. I have two phones, and the battery life of each one is about 15-20 minutes, tops. I work from home, and by 11 a.m., both phones are usually shot -- forcing me to use my cell phone or, yes, hook up my old rotary phone. I just begrudgingly bought two new batteries: we'll see how they work. I assume they'll be horrible, as is everything else associated with this product.PS: I know two other people with the same phone system, and they have similar complaints.

We have also experienced the people we are talking can hardly hear us. They always must ask us to speak up.We called Panasonic support about the battery life issue and they told us it was not Panasonic's problem. It was the battery and they were not under warranty. After replacing the battery three times, we were fed up and called Panasonic support back to complain (after a half day of trying to get through) they offered to replace it with a refurbished unit. The only problem was they wanted us to ship the whole phone back before they would send us a replacement!! It would take 1 to 2 weeks! How can they expect us to do without a phone for that long?? I was waiting for them to offer to call us when it was ready.Anyway, because of the poor product quality and terrible service and support, I will not purchase another Panasonic product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst experience with this crap","review":"Bought the phone and 2 handsets.

I operated my WLAN access point 6 feet away from the base station of this phone for 6 months and did not experience any noticable problems or performance issues. However, I do have interferences with my X10 wireless camera that make my surveillance system practically unusable. Nobody tells you about that. There are just too many devices on the market that operate in the 2.4 GHz band.Therefore, this phone has to go in exchange for a 5.8 GHz model (unfortunately, there are no 2-line phones on the market yet in the 5.8 GHz segment).I was reasonably satisfied with the features, although I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the directory is too complicated to search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This is the second Panasonic cordless phone we've purchased in the last two years and they've both been terrible. The battery life is very poor. The phone goes dead and has to be completely recharged if you try to use the speaker phone feature.

It is not fluffy but it is not serious either. The story centers around the female lead, Elena, and her quest to figure out who she wants to be - human, wolf or some mix of both. Her hero, Clay, is already completely in love with her. I think what makes this story just almost great, but not great, is that it lacks that tension or angst or suspense either in the romance or the plot that makes a great book hard to put down. However, I liked it enough to continue with the series because I do think that the characters have a lot of promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weegee's World coffee table paperback","review":"Interesting book.

She doesn't worship the Bible (written by man) or the religion, but sees the slices of truth that story can hold. She loves God with all her heart, but she's not super-dogmatic and doesn't use overly complicated religious language. She is a breath of fresh air while remaining steadfast in her faith. Anyone interesting in writing or finding sources of inspiration will enjoy this book or especially \\"Walking on Water\\".

Personally, I couldn't even finish it, and I hate to leave books unfinished. Instead I gave it to my mom.I especially agree with one of the reviews on the cover.

This time out he takes the turn of a political thriller. Snow White and Company visit the Fables farm, upstate, where the non-human refugees from fairy tales and folklore live. She finds herself caught in an uprising, fomented by enraged pigs (shades of George Orwell here) and backed by a surprising ally.While \\"Legends in Exile\\" was a wonderful inaugural story for \\"Fables,\\" it is here that the series really begins to hit its stride.

Agrees to meet an ex-Nazi scientist to query him about Russian jets. Goes on some routine spying field trips, finds it dull - until suddenly agents are getting killed right and left. Then he's grabbed, thrown in an East German prison, and tortured, except he doesn't know anything!

The purchase was from a major retailer. It was easy to set up and the prints were good, but the machine was not properly calibrated from the factory, so that 6x4 in. borderless prints would not print on the 6x4 paper without leaving a border on one side or the other. After two hours problem solving with customer service, they suggested I return it. I returned it for another HP 7550 (factory unopened box). This time it was calibrated properly. Some pictures looked great, but on pictures with a lot of black or red, there was a noticable red marbeling in the pictures, and black never looked to be solid balck. Once again, after two hours on the phone problem solving, HP customer service suggested I return it either to HP or the dealer. I wonder how many others are havong quality problems.

Today one of the color cartridges stopped working. I found a tiny black piece of plastic at the site, so I checked all three.

I had an hp see-through flatbed 4600 scanner that just wasn't working with my ASUS motherboard so I decided to opt for a photo quality all-in-one (Print, Scan & Copy) that I bought today. I'll be reviewing that HP model after I've tried it too. The print quality on the 7550 is every bit as clear as laser. The blacks are nice and solid. the 7 ink technology brings brilliant color results. There are 3 separate ink cartridges, but the yield is greater for this reason. Keep in mind that even though the machine tells you the ink is running low, wait until the print/copy quality is actually fading before you change the cartridges. Just keep an extra handy for when it's needed. I loved this printer and will miss it! The only con is that it's a bit noisy, but oh well, color quality and ease of use is way more important, don't you think?"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for working for 1 month out of the past 6 years i've owned it","review":"1. Whenever printing Photo paper every picture comes out green, but when printing standard copy type paper it prints fine.

I've tried deleting and reinstalling the driver many times and it does not help. Actually it did once fix it for one print job and that was it. I even got a whole new computer and it's still the same.Also, no matter what computer it's hooked up to the computer does not recognize that it's connected but it does print.. Strange!! I've been battling this since 2003 and i'm so tired of it. I'd get rid of it but i still have spare ink cartridges from almost never using it (i have a B&W; lazer i use all the time) so i stay with the miserable thing.

HP wants $30 to talk to you on the phone to suggest a fix with no guarantee it will work. I bought it new for $300, and now it will probably cost as much to fix it as to buy one new on Amazon.com. Very disappointing end to a promising beginning. HP customer support stinks as they are unfriendly, unwilling to help, and has communication issues as their customer support lines are staffed in a foreign country that can barely speak English.

However, Microsoft will force me to buy another printer. As I upgraded my PC, to a Quad Core, I also upgraded the OS to Windows Vista 64 Bit. Although Vista thought it had a driver for my printer built in, such was not the case. If you go to the HP support site, they guide you to download the Deskjet 5550 printer driver for limited functionality. No longer does one have the nice HP toolbox to check printer ink levels, or order more ink.So I upgraded to Windows 7 thinking that would fix it-- wrong! You get the green checkmark that Windows 7 supports the printer, but there is still no driver for the \\"old\\" PhotoSmart 7550 printer on the HP software driver download website.

Being in the tech support field, I can usually figure things out fairly quickly. I busted my head open for HOURS to print 4x6's only to find out it needs \\"special\\" tabbed paper to print out. Although I haven't gone out to buy this paper, I can only imagine the price since this requirement only seems to be coming from this particular HP printer. And since this printer is already discontinued I can only imagine what a hard time I will have trying to buy this paper as more time goes by.If there was an option for no stars, that is what I would give it. I like simplicity and this printer does not offer that, the print quality may be really good, but that doesn't do me any good if it only decides to print a portion of the picture and not the rest.

I could hardly believe it, but ordered one, just to be safe. And good thing, because there was none. Even the instructions say to purchase a cable, but it's a little late. Be warned!!The print quality is stunning, but the mechanics of this printer are frightening. It has ruined almost every other sheet of photo paper I've used, with the ink carriage getting stuck on the crumpled paper and tearing it. Irritating and expensive. Is this a new HP money-making strategy?? I've learned to NEVER let it grab the last sheet of paper. That never, ever prints correctly.The print cartridges are scary to put in. I don't like this machine, and I forsee a lot of mechanical difficulty and repairs ahead. And the ink is used up so fast, it's like pouring it out of the cartridges.

This would not normally be a problem since most all PCs these days come with a USB port, BUT if you wish to have the printer connected via a wireless printserver -- which come only with parallel port connections as far as I know -- you're out of luck.

Please read the warnings of the other reviews that said it broke on them too. It seems a little piece inside of the printer wears and breaks off in no time. These printers are said to have a \\"light weight technology\\", but more like cheap plastic technology to me. I went through 2 of these printers and similar in one year, first the 3420 and then the 3320 which did the same thing in less than 6 months.

However, it gulped up (expensive) ink at a very rapid rate, so it turned out to be a very expensive printer to maintain. Worst of all, just like a previous reviewer's experience, my printer spat out a little plastic part after six months of use. HP's warranty on this is only 90 days, so in the trash it went (it would have cost more to fix than to replace)Two take-home lessons: (1) Cheap isn't always cheap. This might be one of the cheapest HP printers to buy, but they'll make it back from you the first time you have to replace the cartriges.

The did touch base on this a bit, but not the way they would have if this were a real project. I don't consider collections and dictionaries to be outside the scope of a \\"beginner\\" book. Also, they could have at least touched base on some intermediate topics such as the use of some basic patterns. It's very difficult to perform object modeling today without the basic use of factory patterns and singleton patterns, etc. A small section or chapter on these topics would have really put the icing on the cake with this one.

However, being young and female, and not knowing anyone who was involved in the war, I never had access to the details. They certainly weren't being taught in History class, or surprisingly, even in Current Events. It became very easy to scorn anything or anyone related to the war. Reading of Alan Cornett's experiences with hostile civilians in airports and bars was painful, because although I was never outwardly disdainful, I remember regarding soldiers I encountered as being somehow alien.

Karl mentioned that the author had trouble with authority. I saw it as the author having trouble with lazy, dangerous (but not to our enemies), clueless, and power-hungry idiots. Two men fit that bill perfectly. His senior officers have just called his Vietnamese wife a whore... and he frags one of them. I noticed that the Courts Marshall didn't dispute that at all. In fact he got one year for attempted murder, and was allowed to remain in the army where he retired.

I'd stick with the original ten in the Bible. True, there have been recidivists in opposite direction, but no defense of the tenth commandment will prevail against the lack of inhibition of our elected leaders.

The disc seems to be currupt, because it was impossible to load Photo Suite that came with the unit. Not to mention the unit is slow. I invested a great deal of time between e-mailing and reading at their tech support site, No Help. I waited on the phone 35 minutes to talk to a tech, who told me to try fixes I was aready aware of, or already tried. Oh, here's the best part, guess who gets to pay the shipping for the return?

It may be a corrupted Paperport disk causing the problem, but the real problem is this: Visioneer has terrible, terrible tech support.

They sent me a REFURBISHED unit (the warranty indicates that any replacement units will be refurbished units). They sent the base unit only, so I had to remove the drum unit, paper tray, and handset from the original fax machine to use with the replacement unit. So, after only a couple of hours of using the replacement unit, I was back on hold to report another machine error. 12 minutes and I finally get a rep. Apparently, the drum unit (which is less than one month old) is bad. So now I'm waiting for the replacement drum unit. DON'T EVER BUY A BROTHER MACHINE.

His writing style is very detailed. The plot involving the CIA is full of exciting twists, turns, and wild goose chases that build excelent tension, however if you do not follow it closely you will be easily confused. I, being an aviation enthusiast myself, found the aeronautical aspects of the book to be very thrilling, although somtimes a bit unbelievable. Over all it is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A BOOK!","review":"Pandora's Clock is the best book ever written. It is so well written. Nance uses a very descriptive style of writing. You can not compare to his style. He writes so clear and well. I saw the movie on TV to it was great. Nance deserves a newberry award for this book. It is so good. I just cant stop raving about it. I am reading it for the second time. The setting for the story is so good. All these people trapped up in an airplane carrying the doomsday virus. What else could you ask for. I mean there is even a little rommance. Pandora's CLock is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pandora's Clock- by John J. Nance","review":"This was the first book I ever read by John J. Nance, and it is my favorite by far. From page one, you are drawn in to the plot, and can easily get a certain feel for each character. Soon, you are turning the pages nonstop, with one new event overlapping the next. If you haven't read it yet, I highly suggest you don't read another book until you read this one. The aviation scenes are extremely exciting, and the end is very thrilling and realistic, providing Nance's best book yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nance Takes You On A Suspenseful Flight of Fright!","review":"This was my very first book by John J. Nance that I have read. I ended up liking Pandora's Clock a whole bunch. It was about an airplane that was thought to have a contagious pathogen disease on it and no airport would let the plane land. It was quite frightening considering the fact that I was reading it on a plane to Las Vegas and later on a trip to the Grand Canyon. The time passed quickly though, because this book was very hard to put down. I think I will read some other books by Mr. Nance now."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK book until the disappointing ending","review":"At the end of this novel, we find that all the passengers have been infected with the virus. Luckily for them, the virus has mutated into a nonfatal strain. Mr. Nance doesn't seem to have realized that an entire population does not mutate spontaneously to produce a new, avirulent population. Mutations are random events that happen to individual organisms. This was an incredible letdown.Also, at the end of the novel, Captain Holland asks Rachel, one of the passengers, to marry him. Excuse me, he's known her for what, a few days, and he's decided he wants to spend the rest of his life with her? What is this, a Harlequin romance?I'd say the only good part of the novel was the start, where the plane is constantly being turned away from airports. That was well-plotted and written. Unfortunately Mr. Nance needs to do some homework on genetics, and get the rose-colored stars out of his eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes! Not as good as the movie.","review":"There is a shallowness in Nance's books that's difficult to fathom for a so-called best-selling author. I saw the movie version first, thought the book would have more depth and interest. Well, just the opposite to extent that's possible. More caricatures than characters, weird social bias, etc. His books leave me feeling like I need a shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Techno-Thriller","review":"This was my first book by Nance. I really enjoy reading airplane thrillers and Nance writes them expertly. This one has a really great premise, a virus loose on an airplane. This would be a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have read.","review":"This book is full of suspence and agony.

I reccommend this book to anyone who just loves adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"It could really happen","review":"I had read the book several years ago but hearing the book read was especially powerful. The message from John Nance should be heeded as the situation in the book could occur today. Highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrill Ride To The End","review":"Mr. Nance knows his stuff about commercial airlines and this story is no exception. The story takes place on an international flight from Frankfurt to New York. However, complications arise when there is word of a dangerous form of influenza on the aircraft and nobody will allow the aircraft to land. Stuck in the air, mayhem ensues.Knowing the ins and outs of the airline industry, Mr. Nance weaves a very thrilling story and takes it to the limit. His solid third person style and easy narrative kept me glued to my seat until the satisfying conclusion.It was a great ride and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weightless, simply ridiculous and flimsy plot","review":"It is with great pleasure that I review Pandora's Clock. It was not with great pleasure that I read Pandora's Clock.After a few pages, the reader is bombarded by Nance's inescapably terrible prose and plot development. Our protagonists run a gerbil wheel of airplanes, killer viruses, and missiles. Our plot degenerates from a possibly readable virus tale into Middle East terrorism. Our sideshow's tale, which takes up more than a quarter of the book, quickly ends with nothing to add to the eventual conclusion.The reader is subjected to a flimsy plot, terrible characters, and an all-too-unappealing overall feel. A disgrace and a waste of trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandora's Clock","review":"I'm not a fan of thrillers, and found this one to be typical of the genre. I have to admit, I was worried that I wouldn't even be able to finish the book when I ran across this unintentionally hilarious sentence in chapter four, when the diplomat's assistant sees the tall, broad-shouldered pilot for the second time: \\"The same vibrations that had shuddered through her back in Frankfort erupted again now with seismic force...\\" Fortunately, I didn't notice any other writing along those lines, although the author did seem to be obsessed with beautiful, busty women. It's funny the way that male authors so often write about some average-looking, over-the-hill guy who ends up with a drop-dead gorgeous sweet young thing. Personally I would have found this book a lot more fun if the pilot had been a middle aged woman and the diplomat's assistant had been an Orlando Bloom clone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Must Read Guide for the Dark Ages!!!!","review":"If you are looking to protect your children from real-life and make sure that they grow up to be sexually guilt ridden, then it is absolutely imperative that you read and memorize this book. I have not seen a better way to destroy the wonderful gift of human interactions and God's gift of sexuality than this book. With the hard line fundamentalist approach to dating, and the sharing of knowledge on \\"THE ACT OF MARRIAGE\\" and contraception, parents following this book should be sure to note that they will probably be needing to read this book to their grandchildren before too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"Playing guitaor for 40 years.

They describe the most distressing work under difficult circumstances, in a country I knew little about. The book is written in an honest and sincere tone, which effectively expresses the enormous human tragedy. The sterling work done by the authors and other volunteers is presented in an unassuming way, but I am in awe of what they have done.You must read this book.

The movie is pretty slow as there's absolutely no action in it, but I think that's the point. This movie to me is more about the emotional. The relationships between the soldiers and how they react to having a \\"motherly figure\\" around. The relationship between Alexandra and her grandson and even a little insight into her relationship with her late husband. Most especially I found the nature of the relationship between the Chechens and Alexandra to be the most potent. This movie perfectly shows the uneasiness of relations involving the younger generation versus the older people who lived during soviet times and simply think of each other as \\"comrades\\". This film may be slow but it's well worth the time spent watching it especially if you're interested in the Russian-Chechen conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected - Read The Details!","review":"The artist's name confused me -- I was looking for new music from ONE Eskimo when I bought this for my wife...It is a continuous rambling of electronic music, that basically sounds all the same...

The size and shape of the Microsoft mouse are better for me (the Logitech mouse seems to be designed for people with smaller hands) and buttons 4-5 are too small on the MX518. That being said, the adjustable resolution is nice and the application switch is a nice little feature (although I almost never use either). Both mice work very well but I think the MX518 is slightly smoother in movement (completely subjective).

I'm very happy with my decision to buy it.I have no idea why people have described it at \\"slippery\\". \\"Slippery\\" is not a word I would use to describe a mouse. There is some smooth plastic on it, but this isn't a wet bar of soap we are talking about here. I don't know how most people hold on to a mouse, but usually the weight of my hand keeps it in place. I'm not constantly struggling to keep a grip on it.As for the actual performance, the scroll wheel is smooth and the buttons near the thumb are nice. The control with the mouse is nice and precise and the ability to change the sensitivity on the fly with the provided buttons is pretty great as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more do you need?","review":"What can I say? this mouse is great! It works right out of the box, it's very smooth moving, the sensitivity can be adjusted right on the mouse and is fantastic, and the extra buttons make my life that much easier! The only problem I had with it was that I had to use USB Overdrive on my Mac to get the extra buttons to work, but a very minor bump in this mouse's excellent journey. The sensitivity is great. It works awesome for all of my games and makes using them so much fun. It's durable, too. I have had it for about a year now and have had zero problems at all with it. The grip and the way mouse mouse contours to my hand is perfect. Very comfortable! There is plenty of wire to use, too, so I can use this at a very decent distance away from my computer. I really have zero complaints about this mouse. I love it and I highly recommend this mouse to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse ever used","review":"I got a mouse just like this almost 5 years ago and then the scroll wheel started to die out on me. As a gamer I really need a working wheel but everything else still works great so it is now a back up mouse and this is my new one. It's a little different on the bottom and the back side bottom feels a little off but it still works so here is hoping it works for another five years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid all-around mouse","review":"This mouse not only does everything Logitech says it will and does it well, it's a good mouse when you're not gaming as well. The on-the-fly sensitivity switch is handy for applications like Photoshop, and the forward and back side buttons make web surfing a lot easier.I rate 4 stars instead of 5 because of two complaints:1) The recessed chamber where the diode is housed invariably gets dusty even though the mouse is laying flat and is used on a clean surface (don't ask me how), requiring a compressed air blast every couple of days to get it back up to speed. But this takes two seconds.2) The last MX518 I had died when the cord connection at the top of the mouse got a little loose and the mouse would cut out, to the point where it was frustrating. It would have been nice to not replace the product every several years, but the mouse had seen a couple years of extensive gaming, so I'm willing to forgive it for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Diamondback Razer 3G","review":"It's big and uncomfortalbe.

A Mac won't even boot when the mouse is attached. Really, what USB mouse doesn't work on a Mac these days? Plus there are no drivers available for this particular mouse. I should have checked though. Can't use it on the home machine.2. On Windows the left and right main buttons aren't remappable, although there is no good reason for them not to be. This makes ambidextrous mousing impossible. Can't use it on the work machine.3. The installer CD doesn't support Windows 2000 Pro. I had to go to Logitech's site (not really up to Microsoft's standards) and download an installer. It wasn't a Windows 2000 specific installer, so I'm wondering why the installer on the CD is OS specific.I'm going to stick with Microsoft for work and get a Mighty Mouse from Apple for home."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZON SUCKS....Another year of Christmas shopping screwed up","review":"Amazon has screwed up my orders on several occasions. so I'm not sure why I even THOUGHT they could deliver a gaming mouse that my nephew wanted, except that I orderd early - on Dec 8th, and they said it would be delivered Dec 13th. OH BUT WAIT, on Dec 20th when it still hadn't arrived, they said SORRY WE UPDATED THE DELIVERY TIME to Dec 22nd-24th, OH AND HEY, SORRY WE DIDN'T BOTHER TO EMAIL YOU so you might be able to purchase from someone else (because that would cut into our profit and we don't really care about customer service). So, I had to go out and buy a gaming mouse locally, ship it express mail so it would arrive a few days AFTER CHRISTMAS. GOOD JOB AMAZON, can always count on you during the holidays.

If you are a violent gamer who likes to slam the mouse and/or keyboard, this one is definitely for you.

I play FPS games such as CS, Far Cry, Halo, etc. I've also used it to play WOW and other mmorpgs. The mouse has many amazing features, however it doesnt appear to stand up to intense use. For instance, after about two months the mouse stopped working in its full capacity. During gameplay the mouse skips across the screen, or sticks in one place. When I hold down the fire button and attempt to move the cursor, it barely moves, and when it does the control and speed are seriously compromised. At first, the mouse seemed to deserve a five, however after a while it seems to deteriorate very fast. Would not suggest any SERIOUS gamers buy this mouse.

I'm assuming the 518 has better tracking accuracy which is why I decided to replace my worn out MX510. If you compare the two, they are nearly identical. Since I've been using a Logitech mouse and have the latest drivers installed, you would think it would be a plug and play situation, right? Wrong!Logitech Mouseware for Mac OS-X does not even recognize the new device. I've contacted Logitech support and they have suggested that I use third party software such as USB Overdrive ($20 software) or SteerMouse ($20 software). It's the same mouse with updated laser technology. Same housing, same buttons, same everything. Why one works and the other doesn't is a really tragedy.

I am not gentle with my mice by any stretch of the imagination. When you are in the heat of the moment in many games the mouse will take quite a bit of abuse and this one has survived my abuse for quite some time. It has been very comfortable (not too big or too small). The button layout is comfortable and convenient. Most important in my opinion though are the two sensitivity buttons by the scroll wheel. They are very well placed and very useful with many programs/games like Photoshop or Battlefield. I have not had any tracking errors with this mouse until the end but that was caused by too much strain on the cable as I am not in a position to store my mouse properly when it is not in use. In my opinion this mouse is well worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse I've found","review":"I tried one of the newer mice(?) that Logitech makes, but the 20 button mouse is too small for my hand.

This is the 2nd one I've owned, but it shipped being untested and had a bad connection on the board for the right mouse button. I didn't contact the seller, and just fixed it myself.Unless Logitech decides to make a mouse for people with big hands, I'll stay with this one...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse, very few annoyances.","review":"I love this mouse. I use it mostly with my laptop, which runs Windows 7. Vista and 7 seem to handle the drivers a bit better than XP. If I unplug the mouse in XP and then plug it back in, it requires a reboot before reloading the drivers (mouse works without drivers, but special buttons and settings revert to defaults). Although, this is likely more an issue with XP than with the drivers themselves.Anyway, it works great. I love having some frequently used buttons on my mouse. The MX518 has been around for a few years now and it's still being sold and getting great reviews. That in itself should tell you something about it. If you're looking for a mouse in this price range, I really don't think there is a better mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!! Better than its predecessors!","review":"I've been rocking a MX510 for years now. But it finally kicked the bucket and I went searching for a new gaming mouse. I saw this mouse for a good price (amazon had a nice mail rebate bringing it down to $24) and decided to trust that they hadn't tried to fix what wasn't broken. I am very impressed with the few things they did change. There are now 2 buttons that allow you to quickly change your dpi settings (which can all be custom set to the dpi of your choice). This is incredibly helpful for first person shooters where you want a lower dpi when sniping but a higher dpi for run and gunning. It is just as big as the old ones which fit my hands perfectly. It glides effortlessly over most surfaces and weighs enough to not feel like a hollow plastic piece of junk. This is an excellent mouse for the price range. Now if only they would look into incorporating the new blue laser in this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse ever!","review":"This is, hands down, the best mouse I have ever personally used. I'm sure after using it, you will think so too! Footing on the bottom of the mouse provides excellent sliding and accuracy which, if on a solid black surface mind you, eliminates the need for a mouse pad.

Awesome product."},{"rating":"2","title":"its pretty good with minor flaws","review":"as i said, the mouse is actually a very good mouse but having sweaty palms and playing for hours on end the mouse kind gets pretty sticky, maybe thats just my fault but if they took out the plastic and replaced it with rubber or something with a little more \\"grip\\" to it then i'd give this 5 stars. but like i said everything else is perfect, its really a great mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Configurable and multi-function, but wobbles a little...","review":"Glad to have this mouse.

It's super lightweight so it glides easily, especially if you have a quality mousepad. I really like the adjust on-the-fly DPI buttons.

Although it's difficult to see from the photo, the seamless design of this mouse is problematic. The left mouse button is poorly constructed and the electrical contact failed in less than one year.

I could easily replace the feet for 10$ or so...but with the vast improvments in sensor tech in the last year I will have a very hard time picking up anything to augment this POS mouse...RIP MX518...estimated hours of use 2,000 vs 20,000 on the original V1 MX518..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is so beast","review":"This Mouse has made it into my all time best things I have ever bought. I love this mouse from the second I got it. It is incredibly durable and shows no wear or tear at all. The response time is unbelievable.

I have also bought a Logitech X-540 5.1 Speaker System(http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-X-540-Speaker-System-Black/dp/B000JJM8XE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=aht&qid;=1265669754&sr;=1-2) and that has almost as good quality as Bose. This company leaves nothing to missed in its ability to handle anything. There is a supreme quality in everything they build and at not an unreasonable price. As a whole I have to give Logitech a thumbs up and keep on bringing the quality craftsmanship I have come to love and adore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon not up to the hype but is ok","review":"Had a previous version MX500 and was very happy for years. This is pretty much just the same mouse. Interface used to update the speed is straight forward until you get to the advanced settings, just have to figure it out. The lemon comes because of the scroll, mine skips. 1 out of 3 scrolls gets picked up and feels more rough than my previous mouse. I am sure others might be ok but now I have to just live with it or go through the hassle of returning it. No real impressive gaming differences at all from my MX500. Playing Medal of Honor made no difference with this new mouse really, for me it was just time for a new one so I purchased this. If on the fence because you think this will improve gaming don't buy, if you need a new mouse because your old one is shot this is still a great mouse. I just hope your scroll works better than mine.

The mouse is an integral part of making a shot and my old mouse (standard wired mouse received with computer) just wasn't working correctly. To start and stop a shot, the mouse is clicked. If the mouse doesn't start and stop exactly when clicked, the shot goes awry.

I wouldn't recommend it to even a novice gamer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse for gaming","review":"This is a great mouse for gaming, especially because it has two buttons that control the sensitivity on-demand.

When it works, it's a great mouse but suffers from the same problem as every other logitech mouse, weak mouse contacts. This has been marketed as a pro gaming mouse and yet the durability is shockingly poor. For 40.00 I expect more and the whole problem can be cured by upgrading the contact which is manufactured by Micron Industries. Logitech obviously don't see this as a problem despite the fact that this issue looms large in gaming forums.

Did awsome, pwned some noobs in cs:s and what not. Great for photoshop and other programs. Couldn't get over the fact that it had adjustable sensitivity on the fly. However, about 3.5 months after i had the mouse, the left mouse button began failing. Opened the mouse up and there is of course a sensor there. Looked online to see if i could find a replacement and had no luck. I went and purchased another one of these thinking i would have better luck.

However, I do have a few complaints to share with you. After about 6 months of use, the left button became sticky, and it was had to feel when I was clicking or if I was clicking at all, even though the detection worked fine, this must have been a problem with the plastic. My second complaint is that the dpi could be a little higher, for the price, 1800 dpi is a little low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse","review":"Best mouse I have used so far!

I have large hands and this mouse has the comfort that really suits me. It is a 'right-hander', and not designed for lefties. The best features of this is the on-the-fly DPI adjustments and cursor speed adjustment. Also, the thumb buttons are placed perfectly for my hand. It's an expensive mouse, but well worth the money if you want a good one. Also, it doesn't feel 'flimsy' when handling it it either. I am positive this is the best mouse I've EVER owned!

It does pretty well what it promises to do - print quality 4x6 photos. The printer is easy to set up and easy to use. It accepts different types of digital memory cards and is pretty fast in printing - less than 30 seconds to print one photo. The quality of the prints is as good as regular camera prints - your friends wouldn't tell the difference unless you tell them. The one inconvenience with this printer is the non-availability of print preview facility on the printer - you have to note down the serial number of the image (by viewing on the camera) before inserting the digital memory card into the printer. Overall, this is a good printer for the price you get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy Print Options","review":"This is just an okay photo printer. The colors are not vibrant. The main complaint I have is that this printer does not have a screen that lets you preview and select the photo you want to print. Instead, the printer assigns a number to each photo contained on your memory card that is DIFFERENT from the number the camera assigns to each photo. The inconsistent numbering systems make it difficult to select the photo you want to print. If you use a memory card that can contain 100 or more photos, this becomes a big problem if you don't want to print all of the photos on your card. The only way to deal with this issue is to print index cards to discover the number assigned to your photo by the printer, but that means wasting your expensive printer ink and paper. I'd suggest buying another photoprinter that either uses the same photo numbering system as your camera or has a preview screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driver Conflict Problems","review":"A fine product, as long as you do not try to attach it to your PC, especially (if like mine) you have several other USB driven devices. Apparently HP has had a problem with \\"mass storage driver\\" conflicts with its Photosmart line for at least two years now, and customer support for resolving them is laughable: the problem is always the other item, not their printer. Of particular note is the GoBack program that comes packaged with Norton Systemworks - HP hates it and crashes your system. It also has problems with CDRW devices. After 10 days of frustration, I gave up an returned it to them. I am still looking for a small photo printer I can use as a dedicated device that does NOT conflict with rest of my hardware & software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading..","review":"I received the wrong edition of a book I had bought.

Another plus is she has interacted with the primary sources. Too many evangelicals just read critiques by other evangelicals. Downing has spent some time with postmodern writers. Much of the book was helpful. She shows that postmodernisms exposing of the flaws of modernism has served our faith. This is very true in many ways, but Downing goes too far the other way. She leans toward inclusivism, which is a very tempting thing to do in today's postmodern culture in order to not offend, and remain respectable. The problem is the biblical worldview will not allow it. Christians must build their worldview from Scripture, as unpopluar as this may be. You just can't mix worldviews and remain faithful to both. I would reccomend Veith's 'Postmodern Times' then this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proposes a thesis without logical foundation","review":"After reading this book for a philosophy class, I am strongly of the opinion that Downing has little skill as a writer or logician. Yes, she does establish postmodernism and its roots nicely, but she fails to establish the very thesis of her book--that postmodernism serves faith. While I will admit my bias to disagree with her, she did not successfully make her arguments. I found myself repeatedly wondering how she could fail to see the circular reasoning and illogical leaps. Maybe if she had actually been able to argue her point, I might have thought more highly of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Quality","review":"This is a great product without a doubt.

He is the rare composer and singer who can beautifully relate to and forgive the \\"Boulderite,\\" whatever that is, the \\"folkies\\" at Swallow Hill, National Western Stock Show fans by having a ball on the guitar and east side of the stage at the Grizzly Rose during the stock show with Chris or introducing a PBS feature on Colorado with his vocal composition. His songs are ageless, his lyrics intellectually challenging - you have to really think them through and even after you do, sometimes you're still not sure where you've just been - and his voice subtle.

It's got 3 light settings as well as a compass on the top. The crank really works and you don't have to sit there cranking it for a half hour to get optimum power.

The hand crank obviously provides sufficient power for an acceptable amount of time. The lantern has 3 settings for brightness: 4 leds, 8 leds, and 12 leds. At 12 leds this lantern provided enough light to compare with a propane lantern except you don't have to deal with the gas, heat, or threat of burning yourself.

She discussed \\"dragons\\" in the church, those people who seem bent on causing trouble somewhere, anywhere, over anything.After things blew up here, I lay the book down for a bit.

I appreciated her vulnerability, her insights and her honest evaluations. I think I will share it with other pastor's wives as I am sure they will see themselves in this book as well.

Although the afterword of Farewell to Summer asserts that both novels were born of one draft, the original characters are recognizable only in brief flickers. Douglas Spaulding, in particular, in a matter of supposed mere days or weeks between the end of the first novel and the beginning of the next, has inexplicably morphed from the pensive, sensitive everyboy into the wannabe leader of a small-town terrorist cell. Yes, Bradbury remains ever the wordsmith, but this was just a bummer - too dark and too bizarre in comparison to the original. I almost wish I hadn't read it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a big fan of Dandelion Wine, but found Farewell Summer to be disappointing at best. The Douglas of Farewell Summer bears little resemblance to the boy we knew in the book's prequel; he comes off as little more than a hoodlum in this story. Further, I thought the chapter dealing with his sexual awakening was weird. I think Bradbury has lost it, but then maybe all men lay awake at night talking to that thing down there.Farewell Summer lacks the depth and emotion of Dandelion Wine.

There are no characters, just flimsy constructions thrown together to advance the \\"plot\\" or to make cheap one liners. No beliveable motivation or action from anyone in this morass. Does not address any of the serious issues that could be raised given the subject matter, but goes for cheap (and not very funny)laughs.

I'm not finished yet, but so far, I'm loving every minute of this book. Sometimes I'm laughing so hard that I have to stop to catch my breath. What I'm enjoying the most is the fact that he is using real people in his story. The Trent Lott story line is a killer. Also, I absolutely thought that Lefcourt was ingenious in choosing names for the men of Vermont's organized crime. Hysterical!

I have never seen the thermometer in one piece, rather than three, for example...same for the clamp, which has never been in one piece, even the night after my husband bought it. The stethoscope isn't a working stethoscope. The syringe fell apart within the first five times of playing with it. The bag is cheap plastic. My daughter is starting to play pretend, but it takes amazing pretend powers to make this broken kit work. I started looking for a replacement within a week of getting this kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy","review":"In my attempt to encourage my 4 year old son to become a doctor so that he may take care of me in my old age, I bought him this set for his birthday.

I bought this for her last Chirstmas, and while it had led to many hours of play, it hasn't stood up to the hours of play. Everything about this, from the case to the doctor's tools, is very, very poorly made. The case didn't make it past Christmas morning, and all of the parts inside are held together by duct tape (just because it's poorly made, doesn't mean my daughter will let me part with it).

I want to return it but it'll cost me almost half the price of the stupid kit to send it back, so I guess my son will just get to play with it til it's destroyed and I'll have wasted the money. I didn't have a lot of money to spend on a kit, and was excited I found one that was relatively inexpensive, but I apparently should have checked the previous reviews more closely.

The author's depth and breadth of research is equaled by her ability to sweep us into a very special world, the world of those who are obsessed with butterflies. Butterfly biology and ecology, the focus of this book, are clearly presented in beautiful language. The details of butterfly anatomy and behavior are sometimes bizarre and always interesting.The author adds depth to the book by including the human view of butterflies. Her profiles of contemporary and historical scientists and ordinary people who have been obsessed with butterflies are riveting. (Some of the people are as peculiar as the insects!) She includes the incredible variety of meanings that societies have assigned to butterflies and moths. I had a hard time putting down this unusual blend of science, biography and mythology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a love affair with butterflies","review":"Before reading An Obsession with Butterflies, a butterfly was something that caught my attention as it flitted across a meadow.

In the first episode, \\"Whom Gods Destroy\\", we get a mental asylum story which surpasses the \\"Dagger of the Mind\\" episode from season one by dint of the better acting and storyline as well.In the second episode, \\"The Mark of Gideon\\", we get a story which explores the issue of population control and the Malthusian hypothesis and the part these play in civilisation. Another issue that is explored is that of self-sacrifice for the common good which is represented by Odona.Overall, after a long litany of poor episodes, we get here 2 episodes which remind us briefly of some of the good things that we knew and loved from the prior seasons.

Primarily, however, the book serves as a basic primer for seeking internet information. The first chapter talks about websites and search engines (oddly, it does not include google). Subsequent chapters discuss in more detail some education-specific sites. In reading this book, I was hoping to find some new and \\"secret\\" information imparted; instead, it directs the user to fairly well-known sites.If you haven't used the web much, then this book will probably be somewhat useful (I'd bump it up a star for these users).

I really liked the chemistry between these two actors. I am giving it 5 stars because I really liked the show, but the DVD's I received were poor. 16+ hours of shows smashed onto two DVD's. The chapter breaks didn't match the show beginning and endings. The English subtitles were as poorly translated as I have ever seen. Complete misuse of pronouns. Wrong translations - \\"of course\\", was \\"cos\\". They were constantly mixing the gender references - he instead of she, grandson instead of granddaughter. There were was also 30 minute section which the English subtitles did not work. The subtitles were good enough to follow the story line, but that is it.

You have to learn to set your expectations low and hope to be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality DVDs","review":"I completely agree with the previous reviewers and wish I had read them before purchasing from this seller. The DVD disc quality is POOR at best. The picture quality is grainy and at least 2 episodes \\"lose\\" their English translation. The English translation in an of itself is absolutely POOR. Discounting the numerous spelling errors and typographical errors, the translation is incorrect many times. Another reviewer gave more details on examples of the poor translation. Also, in 2 episodes, the picture freezes in multiple segments. I do not know why this seller, Rolling Donut, continues to carry this product. Can they not obtain a good quality DVD AND fire the currently company providing the English subtitles/translation?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good!","review":"Just installed four of these on our kitchen windows and they work great.

It includes several case studies written by contributors who have very successfully used Mark's concepts, and they also include many brilliant ideas of their own. I don't think I've ever dog-eared so many pages in a book before! (And - this is a true story - my girlfriend was wondering why I keep a separate copy in every bathroom in the house!)I highly recommend this book, not just to marketers per se, but to ANYONE who must market or sell anything, be it a product, a concept, or themselves. That applies to salespeople, politicians, singles, teachers, you name it. If you have something to sell, this book will increase your results big-time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap piece of nothing","review":"The picture is deceptive.

It explains the three main ways to make money from adult websites; AVS, Free Sites, and Paysites. I found out that what I had in mind would be way too expensive, which I figured would be the case. However, now I know how to build up my business first by buying content from vendors, and building the business over time. I had gone to many Adult Webmaster sites which had good detailed info, but not the basics. This book breaks down the essential ideas of the adult website business.

Good only for background music."},{"rating":"2","title":"When this all meant something","review":"This is an effort by an aspiring Anthony Green and one of his early bands. I am generally pleased with most offerings from Green and I must say I did enjoy this as well. But compared to his other work it pales in comparison. It is an obscure ride, with songs like 'Flower, fist, and beastial wail,' you're never quite sure what they're talking about. I still enjoy going back to it every now and then as it holds a certain charm, in fact it is arranged very nicely, starting of with the slow, entrancing 'show your teeth,' then gradually building into some more fast paced songs.If you're an Anthony Green fan you will most likely warm up to this album, as long as you don't take it too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practice","review":"Audience of One gave their best shot in making something work. I don't believe that the vocals delivered by Anthony Greene were as quite as n'sync with the rest of the music. The band could not find proper ways to tie in transitions betweens steady beats, sparatic lead-ins, or chaotic explosive harmony. The entire album was a failed, but valiant rookie attempt at polishing anything from a rough garage-style sound. In Anthony Greene's second go at finding his place in the sun, he must have landed a godsend with the formation of Saosin. Pro-active listeners who were left starved with the mere fifteen minuete of Saosin with their EP; Translating the Name; will not find compensation with the sound or vocals in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to tile a shower","review":"Tons of useful information, and a chance to look over the shoulder of Jason as he actually does a job of tiling a shower.

The problem is then that the download does not give you all the software (mixing, recording...) which really shrinks the value.Also, the jacks are too close that I can't put in my mic and speaker/headphones at the same time.

What I got is a poorly written, hastily concocted manuscript filled with useless pseudo-information. As someone with relatively broad knowledge of Japanese, Nordic, Russsian and Eastern European names I was surprised to see the selection of names by the author. Many 'Russian names' are derivative forms never used as official names, the Japanese names are in many cases either outright bizarre or sex-switched, i.e. boys' names claimed to be girls' names. The meanings seem to often come from some poorly researched and even more poorly translated sources. I can only assume that the quality of lists of other 'ethnic' names and their meanings is just the same junk. I fell into a trap of buying this book lured by ignorant reviews. I hope you don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My husband and I were quite disappointed with this book. A much better one I thought was \\"Beyond Jennifer and Jason, Madison and Montana\\". It's about half the cost and far more interesting and useful. This book was quite bland and not really all that original. It was literally a grouping of excel spreadsheets that someone had bound into a book. It does list names by different ethnicities, but the \\"Jennifer and Jason\\" book I recommend also does this. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly disappointed","review":"While there are some interesting parts of this book, the bulk is lists of names by their origin. That would be great if you knew where names you like came from. If this book had an index of names it would make a huge difference, but it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was a terrible baby name book. It has many typos and looks like the author published it herself by printing an excel worksheet. The list of top 100 baby names does not match up with other lists of top baby names I have found (the name Emily, which I believe is #1 or #2 is not even in the top 100). The author has strange catigories of names including \\"Sexy Baby Names\\" and \\"Elf Related Names\\" and has a section on numerology of the names. It also tells you the personality of your baby by what month he/she will be born in, but for September the only possitive thing she had to say was that my child would be a good cook (along with being selfish and only doing things for others if it had benifits for them). There is no index of names. I would not recommend this book to anyone and I feel like the good reviews of this book were probably placed up here by friends of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"It's definitely a great book and everybody has to read it. There are many different and exciting categories which tell you everything about a name. After you read it, you won't miss anything.

It's even printed on 8 1/2\\" by 11\\" paper. The names are only divided by nationality. Many of the names are repeated 2 or 3 times. There are errors in formatting and in name placement. For example, the name Sinead is listed under the Irish Male Names, but then has \\"female\\" as the origin, \\"Irish\\" as the meaning, and \\"gracious\\" as similar names. Under the Hungarian section there are several names which have the origin listed as Indian. Given how few names are included, there shouldn't be so many errors. Very Disappointing book...I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I was highly disappointed when I received this book...it has very limited names and they are in groups of \\"actor/actress names\\" \\"famous names\\" \\"wealthy names\\" etc. It is sort of on the metaphysical side and has numerology and stuff (which is fine if you are looking for that) but it was not for me.

This story could take place anywhere, at any time, just by plugging in different dates. Many things hinted at in the story are not developed enough, and it left a taste of promise unfulfilled. Vinge is a talented storyteller but this book comes across as a rushed contractual obligation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 14 year old's review","review":"After reading The Snow Queen, I was a little disappointed at how this book did not carry the mythical mystique and mystery that I had hoped it would. It was pretty good, although some of the main characters I felt were underdeveloped, and that some of the terms used in the book aren't described in enough detail. (What is Survey?) However, The plot is original and well thought out, and I thought that the imagery was excellent.

Considering the price, it is a great CD.Many of the other recordings (which are 2 or 3 times the price) are simply flashy and superficial interpretations.

And the side drama(the death of Mama's cousin) just petered out.Plus some sloppy editing causing confusion with the girls' names, and the result was a read that wasn't as good as it could (and should ) have been.I'll read some more books by this author because I've read some by her that were better than this one, but still.Mama can do better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as others would say","review":"Pierrot's new album including 4 singles; \\"Barairo no Sekai\\" (intro thme to the anime \\"Get Backers\\"), \\"Psychedelic Lover\\", \\"Neo-grotesque\\", and \\"Hill - Genkaku no Yuki\\".1. a pill2.

This particular recording has virtually nothing to recommend it, unless you fanatically and compulsively collect every recording of these works, Sawallisch, or the Philadelphia orchestra.It may be cheap, but it's no bargain. If you want something that's cheap (assuming that you buy from Marketplace sellers), sounds better, and is infinitely better as a performance, try KubelikDvorák: Symphonies 8 & 9 / Kubelik, Berlin Philharmonic Orchestraor MehtaDvorak: Symphonies Nos. 8 & 9 \\"From the New World\\" [Australia]."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Disappointment...","review":"I'm not sure why this recording was given 5 stars.

In comparing this recording to a cheaper, generic version of Dvorak's 8th I found that this recording was totally inadequate. Sawallisch's rendition is played with a very noticeable lack of passion. In fact it's the coldest, most dispassionate playing of Dvorak I've ever heard.

See, \\"Our Love Will Always Be There\\".She has that mannered, hard R, over-enunciated phrasing, which she executes naturally and with true personality.

This book fit the bill.You will not learn C# in this book (it assumes you already know the language); but it will get you quickly into building Web applications.The examples are clear, well organized, and most importantly run properly when typed in correctly! The examples also have one important feature I prefer, which is a lack of over embellishment. They show only the code needed to complete the given task, not additional bells and whistles that can confuse the point of the example.After completing the book, I found it easy to adapt the examples for use in building my own web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeping introduction to .NET","review":"This is an end-to-end introduction to the world of .NET development. The coverage, which starts with the architecture and ends with deployment, is never comprehensive, but is always thorough enough to get you started.Graphics are used extensively, which is not appropriate for a reference, but which works here because of the introductory nature of the text. The book doesn't pander though.I recommend this to anyone who is starting with ASP.NET, and who wants an introductory text in the step by step style. If you are experienced in other web application development technologies then you would be better served by one of the O'Reilly ASP.NET reference books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just dial 555-CREEP","review":"Not exactly the best plot for a book, especially ahorror story.

No loss of suction, never fell off. However, starting in year two, it would never keep suction. I tried cleaning the window and the suction cup; huffing a little moisture onto it prior to sticking, not huffing on it, nothing worked and so I went without a mirror. Plus you cant really make it go above your windshield, so it blocks some of the forward view. It was a quality mirror for the price, but now its in the give-away box.

I couldn't put it on the windshield because I have an electric sunshade that it would interfere with, so I tried to put it on top of my dash, but it wouldn't stick. I then purchased an adhesive disk, also from Amazon, that is supposed to work with suction cup mounts exactly like this. I tried the two together, because I didn't want to stick the adhesive to the dash until I was sure it would work. No matter how I pushed the cup onto the disk, it wouldn't hold, so now I'm stuck with both a useless mirror and a useless disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sturdy","review":"This mirror is just not sturdy and breaks easily.

It really helped with my dry skin right away, my skin was smooth and mosturised with one use. I liked that it worked well under my makeup too, I didn't have to use primer because this worked as one : my makeup stuck to it like glue.

This author may know his subject very well but has no idea how to convey it to the newbie builder. The point of a book like this should be to explain the material in such a way to help someone who has never built a guitar to do so. His explanation of making a mold starts out with you the reader coming up with a design based on looking at pretty color pictures. Huh? He tries to explain about a shooting board and go-bar press assuming you already know something about it. Next he tries to explain a curved template in a way that I just don't get. Is this for an arched top guitar and if so why not say so? I think I am wasting my time trying to read this book. I got suckered into thinking this was a good book to own by the abundant color pictures. This is a coffee table book-\\"oh look at the lovely pics\\"- not to be confused with a how to on building a guitar. Anybody want to buy a used book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Good book. Author build a guitar almost from scratch using many hand tools. Author is even a bit motivational- telling the reader to have faith, focus on the task, and it will all go together. I wish it had more detail on building the various jigs and fixtures. I felt that I would likely need additional text to build a guitar, but this is a good book none the less. I was impressed by the authors extensive use of simple hand tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to guitar building","review":"Nice book. I bought this during my fifth guitar build. I don't use the plans that came with it (\\"OM\\" size but with the waist moved forward), but they look as good as any other plans I've used. The text is much more thorough than what I've found in other books. It takes a modern approach and describes lots of alternatives and choices to be made. It points out the more critical steps and spends more time on them so you know where you have leaway and where you don't. The book's organization is excellent. Pictures are clear and well reproduced. Lots of worthwhile tips. Great value for the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent building instructions with great photos","review":"I'm a novice acoustic guitar builder, but I'm slowly but surely building a nice library of books around acoustic lutherie.'Kinkhead' is my latest addition, and I must say I'm inpressed.

Mine is also mixed. Not an audiophile by any stretch, nor an authority on classical music or Wagner, I was somewhat disappointed in this compared to other performances I have heard of the same pieces.

I probably will by them from another company however. I do not have much of a problem with the price, it is the shipping. I paid more for shipping than the actual stickers, almost $8. When I got it, the stickers were in this big box full of bubble wrap and a pack of stickers. The stickers are great, but I would find them somewhere else just because of the unnecessary cost of shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SELLER","review":"Keep describing the items more in detail.

This act, which allowed the King to appoint officials instead of allowing the citizens to elect them, turned the people against the Crown. Through acts of civil disobedience, illegal conventions, and threats against appointed officials, the people of Massachusetts effectively took control of their government from the British.This is a great book that focuses on an aspect of the Revolution that is usually ignored or lightly touched on in any History class or book about the Revolution. It shows that the Revolution was started and won by ALL the people of America, not just Washington, Jefferson, Adams, etc.....Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The First American Revolution","review":"My brother loaned me his copy. We frequently exchange books, but when he asked for the return of this particular one, I identified it among the others as \\"The Great Book.\\" (This was a spontaneous utterance made during a walk, but I thought about it for a long time afterwards, why I had so described it.)This is a powerful, disturbing, and beautiful work. It is the sort of book that, after reading a few paragraphs and even sometimes a single sentence, you find yourself with your eyes off the page, wondering at what you have just read, trying to picture it, trying to understand how such remarkable people could have given birth to such a disappointing nation.There is a spirit somewhere here, I guess, that we should have inherited.

The radios actually function just fine in terms of range and clarity. The problem is that they are just poorly made. The first time one was dropped (and yes they will all eventually be dropped) it kind of exploded and did not go back together well. The battery location and means of holding in the batteries is much less than ideal, and just not well designed. I never tried the ear bud microphone because it was too poorly made to fit properly in my ear without pain. In sum, this was a cheap pair of radios that have confirmed the wisdom of shelling out the extra money for some well-made Motorollas. At least I have an extra set of radios when the need arises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functionally ok, physically could be better","review":"I purchased 2 sets of these radios to use while on a family trip to Disney World. They did work ok, but the protective rubber cover on the bottom of all 4 radios was lost within the first day of using them. This does not seem like a big thing, but the cover serves as protection in case they are dropped and also keeps the battery compartment cover from sliding off. If the design is changed, I may purchase them again, but for now, I have returned all 4 with the chargers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for the Money!","review":"I've purchased 4 of these and they are so much better than my Motorola radios.

Wow, can't believe this recording is selling at bargain price while so many lesser recordings are selling at full price. The sound is excellent. It came out in 1980 and sounds every bit as good as a DDD recording. The soloists are all fabulous, and the orchestra as a whole is appropriately chamber-sized and energetic. The modern trumpet sounds a lot better than baroque trumpets. The tracking is done the same way as all of my other Brandenburg recordings, with only one movement per track. Perfect if you want modern instruments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"I kept it in my car. the pin was flimsy this I noticed right away; rounding a corner yesterday the pin came out and the whole thing discharged all over the inside of my car.

In reality, it is a stamped tin frame holding a HORRIBLE color-print on a piece of office paper behind a piece of glass. Oh, and that porcelain knob -- it's actually plastic, and it is covered with sharp bits of glue or resin.An absolute wast in every way. Please do yourself a favor, and avoid these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed buyer","review":"This is a nice little walkman, the sound is very good the hold feature is nice to prevent accidentally switching stations if you're carrying it in a purse or backpack. The major fault I find with it and the reason I gave it two stars are the headphones, they are very uncomfortable, the foam ear pieces are very thin and actually hurt your ears a bit even though they don't fit closely. Also with the sound down fairly low someone sitting next to me could hear the music quite well, not something you want for a plane trip or sitting on mass transit. I bought this specifically because I liked the idea of having tuning and volume control on a remote on the headphones so I could keep it in my bag and not risk dropping it but the headphones were so bad I wound up using my old pair and foregoing the remote. To bad because it's a nice product except for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Headphone Jack and Poor Customer Service","review":"The product looked nice, but after using the system for a couple of months the headphone jack became loose and affected the sound (after that, I would need to press my thumb against the headphone jack so that the sound wouldn't break-up).In addition, navigating through AIWA's customer service is almost as bad as dealing with the IRS. It makes their warranty practically worthless.In my experience, the AIWA products I've owned (one shelf system, and one portable tape player) have functionally lasted about a year or less.

However, this potentially strong Elmore Leonard adaptation was marred by studio-imposed reshoots and the actor's ill health. Director Reynolds has assembled an offbeat cast (notably Charles Durning in a ridiculous fright wig), but the crime thriller suffers from a wildly inconsistent tone. Judging by its atmospheric start, one senses that Burt's original cut was superior to the messy finished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Recording, please look elsewhere...","review":"Although Sylvia McNair sings beautifully as Anitra and Sloveig, Tate doesn't conduct well, and the Berlin Philharmonic sounds very emotionally detached from this piece. The Hall of the Mountain King sounds terrible. The recording also suffers from poor editing, you hear the trolls yelling after the big closing notes at the end of inside the Hall of the Mountain King when they should have left out that annoying part. In any case, any recording with the choral parts is better than the watered down orchestral only Peer Gynt suites. I love Grieg's music, but this is just a poor performance. You get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT HITS-but not enough of them","review":"Most of the classic hits of the Osmonds are included in these 3 C.d's but, as usual, there are hits missing.

They added album cuts instead and the one's chosen are not even the better songs. If you're a new fan, then I recommend this set but for long time fans like myself this is a waste of money,if you're looking for songs new to c.d. The original albums need to be released on C.D!!!

PARKER AND NOAH'S CHARACTERS WERE SO WELL TWISTED THAT I HAD TO GO BACK TO THE PROLOGUE SEVERAL TIMES JUST TO TRY AND GUESS FOR MYSELF WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING. IT WAS GREAT!

Maris trails the author, P.M.E. (Parker MacKenzie Evans) to Ste. Anne Island, Georgia believing she has trapped Evans when in reality she has fallen into the clever trap he is setting. The story weaves several tales into one satisfying conclusion. As is always true in Sandra Brown's books the characters are likable and the text is intelligently and sensually written. I finished this book in one sitting- my measure of a truly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Twinkie","review":"I have seen this book described as a romantic mystery. There wasn't much mystery. I knew where the story was going after about 60 pages. Romance? Not much. Explicit, uninteresting sex? Yes. I read one of Sandra Brown's earlier novels and remember it only because I disliked it so much. But with all the hype and glowing reviews surrounding this book, I thought I'd give it a try. The beginning...the prolog of the \`book within a book'...was very good. I was intrigued and found the character description of the crusty old sailor quite appealing. But the rest of the story was a let down. The writing was okay and the pace moved along at a pretty good clip, but the story line was lightweight and predictable. It wasn't a total waste of time. It was like eating a Twinkie when what you really want is a big slice of triple chocolate cake with fudge frosting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Envy - by Sandra Brown Audio CD","review":"I read to escape. This was my favorite Sandra Brown audio book. I enjoyed it so much I bought it and gave it to all my friends. I tell them it's a great escape. Most of them couldn't put it down. Youth, crime,romance,intrigue,infidelity, revenge, did I say intrigue... and then finally success in getting the bad guy. Just an entertaining fun ride. \\"Smoke Screen\\" is my second favor thriller of hers.

I happen to run across this book in books that was given to me. I thought...I use to read Sandra Brown all the time, I'll give this book a try. WOW! Was I surprised. It was an amazing book. Took me a little to remember the characters from the manuscript. But once I figured out who was who on the joke playing it all came together. The twist & turns were great. I didn't want to put the book down. It kept you on your toes wanting to keep reading & find out what can possible happen next. I loved that it was a story of an author writing about his past. You grew to have passion for all these characters.

Personally, I think this would make a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as her very old ones.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

In a nutshell, great premise, bad execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one","review":"I have read just about every Sandra Brown book and even though this book was different than her usual style, it was a great story. Sandra Brown never lets you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best yet!","review":"I have read several of Sandra Brown's books and enjoyed all. This one I loved. Deep down I figured out most of the mystery and then some, but it was great fun along the way. Parker Evans' dialogue and repartee were excellent, Mike was great, Noah was a b.......and Maris was good too. All the players were well defined. The sex wasn't bad either. :) Some of you may be offended; Sandra never holds back. All in all, it was a terrific read, especially in the last few days when we all needed a distraction once in a while to postpone reality! God preserve and protect America!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on Track","review":"One of my first reads was Sandra Brown. I so appreciate her use of persons with disabilities as part of the story - not an add-on.Frankly, her last few works have been weak. But I really enjoyed Envy. As someone who (like millions of others) wants to write the great American novel, the storyline adds the right amount of spice. Hey, tell bookstores and those who inform us of new books that Sandra Brown is not another Joan Collins. If this were true I wouldn't be writing this review"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Great Read","review":"Call me a sour old cow, but looking at the reviews here I realize that I am one of the few that hated this book; perhaps I am the only one who hated it with a passion. This book cemented the fact that I will never purchase another Sandra Brown novel. Her plots are getting really \\"out there\\"--for the lack of a better term--and her writing is not strong enough to make these out there plots plausible. And I was neither offended or aroused by her sex scenes; I am used to the so-called \\"vulgarity\\" of them and they seem to be written purely for shock value and have gotten downright classless. Ms. Brown has also, of late, been sacrificing character development to support her ludicrous plots...only to provide you with her TWO PAGE ending, which is so damn predictable, you wonder why you bother. If you ask me, I was infinitely more interested in Parker's novel than Ms. Brown's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MY LEAST FAVORITE SANDRA BROWN BOOK","review":"I found this book to be lacking in the romantic department. At times it was too vulgar for my taste.

It was ok, but definitely not the top of her game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"Brown's old books are much better than this drivel. The book is in no way up to the standards of Brown's old paperback romances. The hero is very poorly defined. I couldn't figure out why a supposedly classy lady would like such a jerk. And the villain was too over the top to believe, i.e., the murder of the heroine's father-- such an unnecessary event and out of character for the supposedly sharp witted dad. The whole book was a patchwork of bits and pieces that failed to jell together into a novel. Farfetched and poorly written, I'm glad that I got this one from the library and didn't waste my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Envy","review":"I could not put this book down.

It is when she receives the stirring prologue of a partially completed manuscript in her slush pile that she is drawn to a small island off the coast of Georgia, where she battles wits with an angry yet prolific man.The multiplicity of the characters and the plot in this book are enough to make a reader out of anyone. There are more twists and turns in this book then on the track of the Indy 500 speedway.The author strikes out at the reader with the fundamental, basic emotions of envy, revenge, and hard won justice, key elements that take the reader on a roller coaster ride that leads them to the grand finale ending. There are some sexually explicit words and scenes, for those who are easily offended take note. All in all I would give this book 4.5 stars. Kelsana 3/27/02"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique idea with good follow-through!","review":"A quick enjoyable read you won't want to put down. Parker (a.k.a.: P.M.E.) is a rich believable character who spins a wonderful suspenseful tale of his own as the author of the book inside this book. You are at once involved in the lives of the authors, gossips, and publishers as well as anxiously waiting for another captivating chapter from Parker. Maris the heir to the Matherly Press thrown is a bit too gullible to believe; and the plot to trap Noah was predictable, despite that a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgy...Steamy....and completely Fabulous!","review":"When it comes to Sandra Brown, you never have to worry about her delivering a great story, packed with twists and turns. But ENVY tops the charts ! The whole 'book-within-a-book' was masterful. As always, Sandra leaves her reader wondering if the truth really is stranger than fiction with the story of how two friends allowed envy to totally rip their lives apart, and the woman who must be clever enough to wrap together 15 years of loose ends. The insider info on the world of publishing was great to experience, and gives you an overview of what goes on behind the scenes before a book ever reaches your hands. It was informative without being boring. And as always, Sandra's bunch of colorful, strong, and savvy characters will leave you itching for more. Don't wait for the paperback. Grab this one now and ENJOY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The real mystery?: How did this get published?","review":"I bought this book in hardcover at an airport, wanting a fun, bubble-gum read for my travels. I was being entertained until I repeatedly came upon antisemetic comments in Ms. Brown's book. As a mystery writer, I'd think that she could be more subtle in hiding her profound prejudice and be more creative as to divert from stereotypes of races and religions. When I dislike a book, as I vehemently disliked Brown's \\"Envy\\", I give it to the Salvation Army, library or a used book store. In the case of \\"Envy\\" I put it where it belonged- in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a turkey","review":"I have a long commute and listen to many audiobooks as a result. My most recent listening experience was \\"Envy\\" by Sandra Brown. I have to say that when one is able to figure out a plot, including most of the so-called twists, very early on, it's pretty obvious you've got a turkey on your hands. However, to go beyond the plot transparency of \\"Envy\\" and be more specific: the characters were cardboard archetypes and superficially drawn (Noah is absolutely not to be believed), and the many sex sequences were over-ripe to the point that they were often hilarious. I was literally laughing out loud at times. I enjoy a thrill ride as much as the next person but this was just poorly done formula hokum."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"got this book thinking it was a mystery. boring, poorly written, predictable and ridiculous.characters lacked any depth or definition.won't be reading any more sandra brown books!@"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful story!","review":"I just loved this book! I couldn't put it down. The story line of this book was very quick moving, you never got bored with the plots. Maris Matherly Reed was a great character, someone you could look up to, even though her husband thought she was stupid and a wimp. The story moves from New York City to Key West, Florida to an island off of Georgia. The relationship between Parker Evans and his male companion, Mike was really interesting and a great twist in the book. There are many unexpected twists in the book, which keeps the book flowing and interesting. If you like a book that has more than one story in it, than this is the one for you!

I really enjoyed this book, as I do most of Sandra's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentionally Hilarious","review":"In desperation, I bought this book in a drug store on a night when the bookstore was closed. Big mistake. The characters are paper thin, and the plot is so predictable, so contrived, so ridiculous, I found myself laughing out loud at its absurdities.The novel within the novel is pathetically [bad], but what really struck me funny was that our heroine, a high-powered editor at a big NY publishing house, thought it was a work of genius. Good grief. If you manage to wade through this thing to the end, which I did by speed reading, be prepared for a good laugh. That last scene had me howling. Silly, silly, silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Envy","review":"Sandra Brown is an excellent author, she is so good that I always buy her books as soon as they come out. However, I was very disappointed in this book, it did have a good plot but I was turned off by the excess use of profanity and descriptive sex scenes that bordered on being pornographic, they definitely didn't do anything for me except make me skip over some of those pages. When her next book comes out I will take the time to review it before putting down the bucks for a hardback that I have no wish to keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally predictable, but fun","review":"I really enjoyed this book, despite the fact that I knew exactly where it was going from the beginning, and was a little disappointed that it was so predictable. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the ride, and the book-within-a-book was a fun twist. I agree with someone else who said the villain is too evil.....I think it would have been a stronger book if he was a little sympathetic. However, this is just what it is, purely entertaining, a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Brown's best reads","review":"This is a raw read: Parker Evans, the reclusive Southern author central to the story, is not a likely hero figure. Angry, vulgar, coarse, mean -- you won't really like him til the bitter end. The \\"love\\" angle is overly contrived. And you'll guess most of the plot no more than midway through the book. Yet, Brown does a masterful job of drawing you into this story inch by inch so that, like a car accident, you just have to keep going to see what happened. Skillful writing, realistic if gritty dialog, the perfect summer vacation or up-all-night page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Envy review","review":"The book arrived quickly, condition was as advertised and was packaged well.

A difinite page turner in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome writer!","review":"This is the second Sandra Brown book I found on the bargain rack. The first \\"The Crush\\" left me feeling a little flat with characters I didn't feel for, but \\"Envy\\" is one of the best suspense novels I've ever read. I see how some detractors felt it was unrealistic at times, but for me, Brown knows how to write her scenes in such a seamless manner I had no trouble buying whatever plot twist she had coming. This book would make a great movie, I wonder has one been made? Looking forward to reading more of Sandra Brown's work even if I pay full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Did any of these reviewers actually read this book! No New York editor is going to \`track down' a writer who only submits his initials with a pedestrian at best prologue. Then when she does track down the author, he's so rude, any editor would have consigned him and his novel to the trash. These unbelievable events ruined the rest of the book for me. Did Ms. Brown's own editor think this was a feasible plot devise? I know this was fiction, but was it fantasy too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable to the last drop!!!","review":"I would like to say that I recommend this book to others, but I'm affraid that would be grossly misleading. Having never read a Sandra Brown novel before, I was intriguied by the jacket-cover description of ENVY when it showed up on the \\"New Fiction\\" shelves at the local bookstore. Unfortunately, my fascination ended there. I thought Ms. Brown's book was extremely predictable, entirely too sappy, and contained sexual descriptions that left nothing to the readers' imagination. I could not believe in the characters, therefore it left me struggling to finish this story of revenge. ENVY only proved to me that \\"you can't judge a book by it's cover.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Really tiresome and tedious....","review":"Sandra Brown is an excellent story teller and I usually enjoy her \\"mysteries', but I have come to find her writing tiresome. Her vulgarity and crudity gets old after a while. While I know she is trying to make a point that the bad guy is really bad and the good guy is in a lot of emotional pain, there is a way to convey this without all the vulgarity and crudity. I also did not find the magnetism between the man and woman in the past two books she has written that I have found in books written before them. I could of cared less if they ended up together. Quite frankly, I found the book tedious and I rushed through it only to get it over with. This will be the last book I buy of Sandra's unless she can seem to find a way to get the point across without all language."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Sandra Brown Fans","review":"Sandra Brown just gets better and better. When you think you have the ending figured out she twists and turns it again. At first the changes in time are a little confusing but it quickly becomes another part of the spell Brown casts over her readers. I found myself reading until the wee hours.

There wasn't any surprise ending, flipped to the last 30 pages to confirm all my suspicions. Was very disappointed. She is going the way of Danielle Steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandra Brown should stick to what she does best!!","review":"In terms of raunchy, soft core sexy novels with a basic plot of boy-meets-girl, girl-hates-boy, sex-sex-sex and happily ever after, Ms. Brown gets my vote anyday. However, whenever she has tried to integrate some sort of mystery into her writing, she falls too far from the mark. \\"Envy\\" is just as bad as her other mystery endeavors, it is totally unbelievable, weak characters and frankly, there aren't enough sex scenes. I could care less about what happens to the main characters and, by the end of the novel, wished they had all drowned in the first chapter. Like my title says, Ms. Brown should keep churning out such great novels like \\"breakfast in bed\\" and \\"longtime coming\\" and, stay away from any forrays into mystery or god forbid, adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was very good","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I am not very interested in war or military titles but this was a departure from the standard fare. Mr. Jackson's personality and joyful approach to life left me feeling proud. His view of life is very uplifting. I can't really explain the way this book made me feel, a combination of proud and sore, from laughing, but with a better understanding of why someone is willing to fight a war. The last chapter made me cry as did other parts but overall the book was a pleasure to read. I may even read it again I definitely will be buying it for friends.

I am now buying additional copies to distribute to friends and family. Mike Jackson and Tara Dixon-Engel have written the definitive personal history of Vietnam. It won't be 100 accurate for everyone who served there, but everyone who served there will recognize parts of it - and smile or weep. Incredible writing and a pace that keeps the reader from doing anything but reading! In a year that has seen plenty of Vietnam debate these guys distill all the stupid issues down to one salient point: the men (boys?) who served there were human beings and brave soldiers. They deserve our respect and gratitude. Period. Read it.

In fact the first 100-plus pages are nothing but stories about growing up in small town Ohio along with anecdotes about Air Force Officer and flight training. When the author finally arrives in Vietnam he devotes entire chapters about his living accomodations, finding a rat on his pillow, etc. The title chapter, Naked in Da Nang has nothing to do with the war. It's about taking a long hot shower in Da Nang during a typhoon - the power goes off, the lights go out, the author gets himself stuck outside, naked, in the storm. The actual stories about flying as an o-2 FAC in Vietnam are few, brief and far between. Don't buy this book unless you are related to the author (you probably wrote one of the rave reviews) or else you went to Tipp City (Ohio) high school with the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book great guy","review":"I enjoyed this book but feel that the author is a little too good,he is a good Airforce person and doesn't rave about idiots, blunders and ladder climbers.

What impressed me most about this book is that it is a tale of an average guy just doing his job on a daily basis in the middle of a war.

Unfortunately, these are NOT safe at all. When my daughter was nine-months old she could pull them out of the sockets with relative ease. They are too easy for her to grip and pull out of the socket, so we switched to a different kind that lay almost flush with the outlet covers.(We have an older home with a mix of older electrical sockets and newer electrical sockets, and these did not work as they should for either style.)Edited to add: I had contacted Safety First regarding the ease of removal by young children with these covers and asked if there was something I was missing when installing. Their response was that children develop at different rates, and we need to keep on eye on our child when said child is around the outlet covers.

This field has widen on the type of meters in the market now. The first thing I did notice was the illustration. (No color or B & W pictures) Which, where a little cartoonist looking. It has a chapter on testing TVs. On using the old picture tube with vacuum tubes. On page 194 it shows a illustration on building your own Vaccuum tube tester.

I spoke to the techie at Cafe West and he agreed that the machine probably needed a new brew group and sent another. I inserted the unit and the machine did the same thing: snap, pop, rattle, discard ground coffee, stop.I called again (it's an expensive item), they sent a different machine and I returned the first unit. OK, works much better. Still a noisy item and has begun a/o today throwing out the ground coffee without making coffee.

The frothing unit also functions well when working. The problem is that it is an unreliable machine that breaks down very frequently.

BPO play well, and Muti leads them pretty good, though Handel is probably not his forte. The keyboard accompaniment, vital to the score, gets lost in the background. At the moment, I don't have any alternatives to suggest other than to say that I am disappointed by the sound of period instrument ensembles. Baroque trumpets don't sound very good.

Wow. I'm stunned. Where Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress failed, Tokyo Godfathers greatly achieves. I loved this film. It's real-life anime with characters most of us have been at one time. We've all struggled--some to the point of being homeless. We've all had defeating family issues. And we've all wanted nothing more than to get away; this movie captures both that fantasy and that reality in one anime package.And the story itself is touching. How can you not feel for these homeless people as they struggle to get a child back to its rightful mother? These three very unique individuals struggle to no end, facing bodily harm, organized crime, AIDS, and a possessive father, just to get this tiny little child to a safe place, a home, where it can be loved.

Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offbeat, Optimistic Modern Adventures in the Tokyo Slums","review":"The most accessible film of director Satoshi Kon's all-too-brief anime career. Where Perfect Blue and Paprika are more adventurous and challenging, they're also difficult to sit back and enjoy in a traditional sense without falling into a deep state of analysis. This one, of three bickering homeless chums who find an infant girl in the garbage, retains the quirks, charms and emotional punch of Kon's other works without challenging quite so many conventions. Sweet, funny and grounded, it's constantly flashing a dry wit and, although it often tugs at the heart strings, things never get overly soft or weepy. The trio of leads are diverse and interesting, each with an onion skin of personal history to explore, and their hunt for the child's parents amidst the overpopulation of a major world metropolis constantly jolts out in surprising new directions. Beautifully written, drawn and animated, it can also be a bit static and randomly fortuitous."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU GOTTA BUY THIS","review":"I'm so glad to see so many others really enjoyed this movie as much as i did.

Hey, the animation looked good, but I've been disappointed by recent anime flicks I almost passed it by. This isn't a typical rehased story or vaporware plot. The characters are solid, flawed individuals, the story is comic, brutal, exciting and overall very heart warming. Highly recomended if you like quirky fun films.The soundtrack is nice too. Not the best 5.1 surround, but it's there when it matters. The music is quirky and IMHO suites this film perfectly. Sorry, no english dub on this one. But an average dub job would ruin this great character film anyway.Oh, and the preview for Otomo's \\"Steamboy\\" was a nice little bonus, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tokyo Godfathers-storytelling at it's best.","review":"As an avid fan of Jidei Geki and Anime I am probably more attuned to the Japanese storytelling style than most westerners. This one is a really well told and beautifully visual story of a group of losers who manage to come off as heroes. Some will be offended by the side story of a love interest between a drag queen and a burned out straight, but the story wouldn't work without that thread. It really dips into the misery of the human condition and yet the ability of the human spirit to rise above it all. A must-have film for the true anime buff, but it is not for children. Very deep and complex once you get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must !!!","review":"El trabajo artistico quita el aliento, la historia es fresca y comica, el factor humano fue trabajado como la vida real."},{"rating":"2","title":"tokyo godfathers","review":"a anime film about three homeless people find a baby girl in the garbage dump on Christmas Eve.

From start to finish, it really does deliver well. It's unique and socially responsible to boot. Interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satoshi Kon does comedy","review":"If you are familiar with Satoshi Kon's films, he is mainly known for the psychological thriller he does best. But Tokyo Godfathers is a completely different genre: comedy. He finally chose this genre, and no surprise here that this movie is equally as amazing as his previous films. This shows that he is versatile and he has great range of genres when it comes to his filmmaking. The movie has heart-warming moments as well as hysterical and ridiculous moments. This is what makes me, an anime fan, proud of being one because of amazing anime films such as this and amazing director like Satoshi Kon. This movie is a must-check out for all anime fans, Satoshi Kon fans, and just any film lovers who appreciate great storytelling as well as animation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Quality","review":"These Pendaflex Extra Capacity Hanging Expansion Folders, model number 04152X1, are disappointing.As years go by the quality erodes for many products. Things are designed wear out as soon as feasible. Pendaflex folders used to be very nice quality. This current generation of Pendaflex appear to be made by the lowest Chinese bidder.The old Pendaflex folders were sturdier and had a better quality of paper. The metal hangers were a stronger gauge.The pressboard bottom needs to be installed by the user in a cut-out at the bottom, a really junky construction. One should expect a built-in reinforced bottom.There is no info-pocketOffice Depot no longer offers Pendaflex. The Office Depot store brand is even shoddier quality. I guess the Office Depot low price for junk has pressured Pendaflex to lower its price and the quality in order to compete.On the other hand, it does not appear that anyone else now makes a better quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"Very well made with reinforced bottom. I got these and a box of 2\\" capacity. I have used high capacity hanging folders for years. I'm mostly using these to replace Pendaflex High Capacity folders that are 25 years old.

Thus, when I saw this book in the library, I was quick to check it out. And wasn't disappointed.\\"Women in Mythology\\" is not very long, but it's detailed. It describes...well, you can tell by the title. What thrilled me the most about it was that it _wasn't_ just a book on Greek goddesses. It talked about all sorts of mythological women, from Hebrew to Irish (think Cu Chulainn) to Sumerian to Chinese. It really did succeed at being a \\"world mythology\\" book. The mythology it did include about women in Greece and Rome was about the Illiad and the Aeneid more than anything else.It was a bit too short to be a complete reference...but that was my only objection. Overall, a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish it was better","review":"Okay. So i really wanted this book to be good. I am really interested in women in mythology. The basic problems with this book is that it contains almost no real information. The book is tripple spaced and is really just full of stories heard second hand. I was hoping it would be more factual, giving info about more women. However it just gave stories about certain women, if you are interested in that just seach for a good website like paleothea.com. If you want facts, info, or good writing look elsewhere. I really hope that someone else writes a book about this topic because i find it incredibly interesting. However i will give the book two thumbs up on its images. the beautiful color photos of art work are really nice illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable popcorn read","review":"I received this novella length book as part of a Goodreads giveaway.

This book is no exception. The chapters are short, single scenes with little character development, yet every action of the characters is described.Fans of H.R.

We had a hard time finding additional software until recently. We purchased the games on-the-go pack and enjoy competeing against each other. A lighted unit would be better, but it really is fun just the ways it is. My son is now 8 and still enjoys playing with it. We have never bought our kids the game boy products, but this seems to be an educational alternative when you buy the learning fun software.

In spite of what the Wilton instructor might tell you, a wood rolling pin (with a very thin coat of shortening) rolls just as well as this one. But this one does have some extra benefits:1. Since it doesn't have handles and/or is not tapered (as my two wooden rolling pins are) the entire width is used.2. With the available (but purchased separately)rings--which fit perfectly--you can roll your gum paste to an even thickness.3. It is heavy so you don't have to work as hard.4. It's a helpful tool for draping the fondant over the cake or for curving drying leaves and flower petals.I use it for fondant to cover cake layers or small gum paste jobs but, if I have to make a lot of gum paste flowers (especially if it's many of the same flower)I prefer to use a pasta machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Got this to use in a cake decorating course. needless to say I'm not impressed.

I love that my 11 month old can use it now and he will be able to use it for many years to come. There are a lot of different paths for the beads to be moved along, some are quite complicated which I know will continue to challenge him as he gets older, but there are easy paths for him to master now. The name mini rollercoaster is really the perfect description the way the beads take off and are catapolted across the track is fantastic. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"A Christmas gift for 2 granddaughters, ages 3 and 1. They never tire of placing the beads just so.

Made the shopping experience easy, especially with free shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"When I bought this toy, I payed around $40. I really think that this is way too much for what it offers.First, it's not really that big. My daughter is under 2 years old, and she has hard time tracking the beads through hard to reach places of this toy. I think that the wires are too tight in some places thus restricting access of little hands. Overall it's not very exciting. The bids are a little difficult to move around for a smaller child. Perhaps my daughter is just too young for this toy, and I'll keep on trying to encourage her to play with it. However, I do not recommend it at the price I bought it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it - tracks could be more spaced out","review":"My son loves to play with this toy daily. He does get a little frustrated when he cannot move the beads they way he wants but he figures it out. The orange track gets a little tight even for their little hands but eventually its managed. Also he attempted to sit on the bead maze and the wires bent. It took a little muscle power to unbend but it worked out. It would be better if the tracks weren't so close together. If I were to buy another one I would inspect to see how close the tracks were so their hands can move the beads about better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show.

We missed watching the show and have since purchased Season One and Two. I absolutely love it, clever writing, Patrick Jane's lines are so amusing, especially the way he'll say things with a twinkle in his eye, and they have a well developed and enjoyable cast. The recording are done well, and there are a lot of episodes, Season One has 23 episodes and special features. We typically watch two or three a night, and have really enjoyed them. It is one of those DVD's that you'll watch, then pull out next year and be happy to watch again. Season Three, just ended last week and that DVD will be coming out in the next few months.

The American Generals in charge ordering or allowing indiscriminate bombing of non-military targets and especially the residential areas should have been convicted of war crimes along with the Japanese.Granted, an all invasion would have killed staggering numbers of civilians.

That view is incredibly simplistic and naive.If you believe that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the worst events in WWII, this book will educate you regarding the occupation China. About 300,000 Chinese were slaughtered by the Japanese in the Nanjing Massacre alone. In total, millions upon millions of innocent Chinese were tortured, raped, and murdered.It's an ugly fact, but the millions of lives were saved by dropping the bombs. (This includes the hundreds of thousands of Marines, soldiers, and sailors that would have been killed invading mainland Japan.)And don't forget: More people were killed in the fire-bombing of Tokyo than in Hiroshima and Nagasaki COMBINED.

I thought that between all the books about individual island campaigns, books about the overall Pacific war, books about the Enola Gay and Bockscar missions, books about strategic bombing in general, etc., etc., I knew quite a bit. I was wrong. There is so much in Frank's meticulously researched book that I knew little or nothing about, that I wouldn't even know where to start.

In small rooms, you will want to use it only as needed. The ozone smell can become significant. The low quality part, it is made in China, which has it's own smell. If you run it fairly constantly, the bulb lasts about a year (no option to replace it). The fan is low quality, somewhat noisy, but loud at times.

I used opaque markers and also crayons in coloring it.I am not at all religious, but enjoyed the brief stories that accompanied the pictures.On the minus side - Mr. Green's strong suit is not drawing women. They all pretty much looked alike, and their faces were not very attractively drawn for the most part. He is much better with drawing horses and men.Everyone wears long, flowing robes, so there are no beautiful clothes to color, but there is background included in each picture and the drawings are large and easy to color.I would recommend this coloring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women of the Bible","review":"If you have ever wondered about some of the women in the Bible, this is a great jumping off point!

Not that the girls noticed that. What they did notice right away was Eve, in her pre-sin state without even a bush in front to cover her, just some long hair over her chest.The usual godly women are pictured like Ruth, Abigail, Sarah, Mary, Deborah, and others; but along with them are Delilah, Judith (from the Apocrypha) holding a man's slain head, Bathsheba (while her godliness is not in dispute by me) with only part of a towel covering her and a David gaping at her in the background, along with Ahab's wicked daughter, and others.These negatives and more like it make me give the book a low review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pouch","review":"I just got this bag this past week and so far so good. My first impressions were that this pouch was much sturdier looking than I anticipated. Perhaps it's because my last tool pouch was a couple years old and very worn down in comparison, but the pouch is very sturdy while still being somewhat flexible. It also has quite a few inner compartments too, much to my surprise, and the pockets are deep so your tools won't fall out. I still haven't been able to fill all of the pockets. Everything is comfortably within reach and safely stored. Now, its a little bit less comfortable to wear than I imagined, but that's probably owing to the fact that I haven't used a 'shoulder' type tool bag before. I'm still getting used to it.

Unlike many other books on the Bible and homosexuality (including my own), Wink's book does not so much delve into biblical analysis of the \\"clobber passages,\\" but rather it offers a more personal look at the struggle to understand to God's will as it relates to homosexuality.

Not that we shouldn't welcome sinners into the church, that's exactly where they need to be. Jesus never said to hate the person comitting the sin, God actually does love everyone. The issue comes about when you grab onto a sin and make it your lifestyle. Use it to bolster your identity.Christianity isn't about hating or bashing gays, as the LGBT front would love you to think. It's about doing what is right in God's eyes and walking rightly with him.The argument of \\"Born that way\\" doesn't hold here. I may be born with a proclivity to steal, but if I \\"come out\\" and say, \\"Hey man, not my fault, I was born this way!\\" then I am accepting the sin.

Believe me, this little guy knows how to put a toy through its paces. Yesterday was his birthday and we couldn't resist adding this Fire Truck to his collection. His Mom & Dad got him a bicycle - which he'd asked for. However, after opening the Fire Truck, he grabbed it up and fled to the sand box. He didn't want to return, even for cake and ice cream. Our daughter is 5' 6\\" tall and the ladder reaches to her hip - if that gives you an idea of the scale of this toy. It's a great feeling to know what you select for a present was a winner.

NOT FOR YOUNG TODDLERS!!!","review":"Bought this for xmas for my twin almost 3 yrs olds (because amazon says they are 3 and up). Lo and behold, the box lists it as for 4 year olds. And that is for real. These are incredible trucks in great detail, but they are not up to the damage of the love of a 3 yr old, nor are they safe for one. Sadly, they got these for xmas because their mom believed the ad and they are broken already and NOT safe for them (many chokable parts!!!) and they are in love with them so I can't hide them 'til they're old enough.By the way, for an older kid these would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"bruder firetruck","review":"this is a fine product. should have seen grandson's face when he found out it really squirted water! he's put out 400 + fires since christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Toy came with no instructions.

After six months of outside use, the belts are destroyed the ladder is broken off and unusable, and the hose nozzle is long gone My son still likes it to spray at camp fires we have, but besides that it was way not worth the money.

Sorry Bruder, try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well the 5 year old loves it","review":"Santa hit a home run with this one. Can't stop driving it. Loves the ladder and sirens.

Did I say this thing is big! The specs don't really do it justice. And the ladder has to extend 3' from the rig!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A year later still a favorite","review":"This is my son's favorite fire truck, and he knows a good fire truck when he sees one. It has held up AMAZINGLY to the rough and tumble play of a three year old. The ladder extends and retracts, the hose actually can shoot water, should you choose to show your child. Unfortunately my son figured it himself and has extinguished many a \\"fires\\" throughout our home. Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive but probably worth it","review":"This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 3 1/2 year old grandson. I looked hard for a fire truck made of steel but was unable to find one except on eBay (which became very much too expensive as it was collectable). The features on the Bruder toy all worked well and plastic seems to be relatively durable, although I would have preferred steel. We also gave my grandson a DVD (compatible with his age group) about fire and rescue. The two complemented each other well. I think the toy would have been enhanced if a couple of firemen figures were included with the truck. Overall, I am not disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, AWFUL READING OF THE BOOK!!!!!","review":"This book is a timeless classic for sure, but the narration is the worse I have ever heard bar none!

However, it is a Hunter product and a good price. I have used this product for 2 weeks. I have 2 cats and a dog in a small apartment. This is only used in the living room. It has done nothing to pick up any dirt and cat hair. I noticed on the top inside the grill most of the fan is covered with Styrofoam. It seems to block 3/4 of the fan. I called Hunter and asked if this is supposed to be there and they confirmed yes. So it's going back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"USES TOXIC STYROFOAM PARTS","review":"BUYER BEWARE: I just set the unit up tonight and am horrified to find out that the inner lining of the fan area is made of styrofoam. Yes, the highly toxic substance that health groups are now advising be removed from all cooking, cleaning, and other products. In this case, the purified air from the filter has to blow over the styrofoam to reach the room. You may be cleaning up dust by using this filter, but you're adding that many more carcinogenic particles to the air. This product should be banned from the market--it is a health hazard, masquerading as a health product. I will be returning this product and not purchasing anything else from Hunter in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad motor","review":"The motor gets noisy after a couple of weeks. Also, there is no way to tell which way the hepa filter goes in.

This product is inexpensive for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Chinese Parts, Expensive Filter, Poor Customer Service","review":"The replacement filters are a ripoff, the Chinese on/off switch shorted out and getting help from Hunter customer service is more frustrating than dealing with the 3 Stooges.

My \\"man cave\\" is a small room, about 8 by 10 feet (80 sq feet), and this Hunter 30090 True Hepa Room Air Purifier does exceptionally well at removing the smoke, pepperoni pizza and whatever other smells from the room.

I thought I would do the same on this model, but they wised up and used a completely non-standard filter size, so you have to go through them for the replacement filters (which cost as much as the unit does).

After one week I was shocked at how much dirt it cleaned up from our air. You do have to replace the filters but it is totally worth it.If it is in the room with you and you are trying to talk or watch tv it is very NICE to be able to turn it down, to hear better without having to turn it off. Don't get me wrong, even the high setting is NOT that noisey. I highly recommend this air cleaner for the price and for the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great air purifier for the money","review":"The Hunter line of hepa air filters are great.

It's cheaper!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So impressed I bought another!","review":"You can see the results! Bright sunshine coming through the window showed air was not clear, haze and particles in it. Couple of hours on medium and it was crystal clear! Can't see any reason to run on high which is slightly loud unless something on the stove burned. Seems well made. Will probably change charcoal filter rather than washing since it has a finite adsorptive capacity which washing won't remedy. Half list price was deciding factor in purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, efficient air cleaner","review":"I have had Hunter air cleaners for 6 years & this is the most efficient & quietest yet.

I was worried about the noise factor bc so many people mention that in their reviews. And I was conscious of price bc these machines can be quite pricey. (I've had this purifier for 3 months now.)Well, I'm VERY happy on both counts. I did a lot of research and reading before buying this purifier and I couldn't be happier with it. It's very quiet on the first two speeds and sometimes I use the third speed too, without problem. The higher speed does sound louder, but not a bother for me or my baby. I really like the added bonus of the airflow output. It's nice having that to help cool the room and since we don't have ceiling fans, I really love that.I'm buying another for our room next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good air purifier but don't replace the expensive filter","review":"Each year, I buy a new air purifier because the replacement filters are more expensive than buying the whole unit new."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sturdy and basic HEPA air cleaner","review":"I bought 2 of these units for my apartment. On low you don't know they are running. On high they are like white noise, a low hum, but they put out a lot of air. After 2 days I am already noticing a decrease in the amount of dust in my apartment. I think I'll buy another one so that I don't have to move them around so much from room to room. The units are lightweight and easy to move around and they are not so bulky that you cannot easily find a place to park them while they eat dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this air purifier","review":"This review is for the Hunter QuietFlo Air Purifier, 3 speeds, 30090. I bought this unit for my son's dorm room and it has worked very well for him. The air in his dorm apartment is, in general, rather musty, but having the air purifier in his personal bedroom keeps the air fresh. While it is not completely silent, it is relatively quiet on the lower speeds and is not really loud even at the highest setting. My younger son is starting college this fall, and I plan to buy him the same product."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great for awhile","review":"Well this filter worked great for about a month.

We put it in the garage and ran it for a week..the smell did not go away. Contacted Hunter...very long waits on the phone. Once they do answer they are happy to help. We sent the cord from the unit back and got a replacement unit. The second unit emitted the same awful burning smell.Went through the same incredibly long wait to customer service. They gladly sent us a different model altogether. I cannot understand how the third unit smelled as bad as the others. You would think before they sent a third unit out they might test it first.We am so disappointed in their air cleaners. We just cannot purchase a filter from this company. If you have lung issues...steer clear of this company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's A Fake...Not Stainless Steel","review":"As several other people have reported, the scoop is not stainless steel but plated pot-metal (albeit somewhat thick, which disguised it for some time).

The sound quality is terrible, and the sound cracks everytime Lea reaches any high or loud notes in her singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Show","review":"A beautiful voice. I was blown away with \\"Too Much For One Heart\\". Definitely Lea's best song ever recorded. How the producers of \\"Miss Saigon\\" could have left this song off the show is just unbelievable. They really blew it. Lea sings it with so much feeling. It would have been the highlight on the entire show. This song alone is worth the price of the DVD (or CD). This song could have been what \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" is to Sarah Brightman and \\"Phantom Of The Opera\\". I hope Lea somehow reads this and knows how much I love this song. I hope she will include it in her future concerts."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiring Journey","review":"This is an amazing documentary about an amazing man. Elmo is an inspiring character in the first place, so it is even more edifying to learn the story behind his puppeteer. The documentary is well done with a balanced approach, solid editing and wonderful interviews.I use this documentary in my debate class when we're learning about avoiding bias and effectively incorporating interviews; but besides being a great way to approach this, my students were amazed to find out \\"Elmo's voice is black!\\". Teaching at a low-income school, having positive role models is so very important and this documentary shows how the combination of creativity and determined hard work can take a person to great places. Clash's story is one for the ages and particularly fun for those of us who remember his work before Elmo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanderful Documentary!","review":"I highly recommend this wanderful documentary. I just watched it this afternoon on PBS right after lunch. It's a film full of inspiration and how a person should follow their dreams no matter what. Kevin Clash did just that. He is an amazing puppeteer with a beautiful, God-given gift. He followed his dreams to a enduring and famous \\"Street.\\" Sesame Street that is. Watching this doc was an emotional one for me. I perform puppet shows and know how much puppets make an impact on kids and people in general.

This is a remarkable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for making me a \\"Reformed Elmo Hater\\"","review":"Yep. I was an Elmo Hater. My teenage daughter suggested we watch this. I moaned. I groaned. I gave in. And I am very glad I did. I have always found Elmo annoying (especially after the Tickle Me Elmo craze), but seeing the person behind this character and the true gentle spirit of Elmo I must admit I have been reformed!

This book is very small (60 pages, and 5 1/2\\"x4\\") and doesn't fully explain all the concepts it goes into. (For example, it mentions the 1800/1500 rule, but doesn't explain when you would use either number.) It does have some good suggestions on where to wear the pump, and similar issues. My suggestion, if you can get this book for very cheap, and you already know the basics, pick it up. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing photographs of surgeries with moving text.","review":"Imagine as a layperson being a witness to 100 major surgeries and you've entered the world of Max Aguilera-Hellweg's incredible book, \\"The Sacred Heart.\\" A review of this book of surgical photographs in the Los Angeles Times grabbed my attention. \\"...these images are so visually beautiful that you are drawn into them before you know what you're looking at . . .Most of us have some familiarity with medical photography, and though it's rarely pleasant, it generally has a clinical quality that allows us to distance ourselves from the events depicted. Aguilera-Hellweg upends that tradition as well; drawing a parallel between the invasiveness central to surgery and photography, he leaves the viewer no place to hide and pushes everything front and center.\\" This is the only book I've ever experienced where you think twice about turning the page for fear of what you might see next. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"photos that make you feel squirmish and at awe all at once!","review":"Max Aguilera-Hellweg has taken an often shot subject and developed his own point-of-view.

Quite possibly, as a photographer, some of the best photography I have ever seen. The story is well written, and does not detract from the amazing images that grace the viewer's eyes upon opening the cover. After our break-up, the book still was amazing, and I decided to share it with someone from my gym. I have seen neither recently, and really miss this book as it just grabs your attention and latches on to it like an alligator initiating a death roll. I need to get another copy, I have another to share this with."},{"rating":"1","title":"The human body portrayed in the most brutal manner","review":"I bought this book after hearing an interview with the author on public radio. At the time, I was involved in observing numerous surgical procedures and found myself in agreement with the author's descriptions of the beauty of the human body as seen through surgery. The images in the book convey nothing of the sort. While technically brilliant, it seems the author selected the pictures for their shock value and brutality. Where is there any notion of the care that is taken for the patient? Where is there any depiction of the exquisite skill of the surgeon? Where is there any attempt to preserve the dignity of the patient? They all are on the \\"cutting room floor\\". The author provided no room for them in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made","review":"It took a second listen to find out which songs I really liked. So many of them were amazing. I believe the best song on the CD is Everything You Ever Wanted. It has great music and a very catchy tune, not to mention good lyrics.

I will say that the one and two stars reviews are a bit harsh, but I can understand them too. *Smile, it's the end of the world* is sub-par at best, and I'm sure most HN fans have already figured that out.

When I purchase new strings I will try light gauge. I've been playing for a lot of years and just wanted a light weight giutar to haul around with me. One of my guitar students has a Jasmine and I've played hers before. Mine has a deadened bass E string for some reason, I have not figured out what is causing the problem yet. The guitar came with strings on it, but no case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big, Bold, and Beautiful","review":"I got the guitar and was a little bit surprised at its size. It was much bigger than I expected, but it really didn't matter. I got used to it within the first 15 minutes and it was a happily ever after. It won me over with its natural finish and the nice dark wood, a beautiful piece of manufacturing. In the beginning there was a little bit of buzzing from the second fret, but that was easily fixed with a quick turn of an allen wrench inside the guitar. Great sound and feel for a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The Jasmine looks and feels nice,but when I tried to tune it,the top E string had an annoying vibrating sound and the bottom E string was \\"dead\\".Some adjustment of the truss rod helped,but I can't understand how a guitar could make it out of the factory sounding like that.It's obvious no one in quality control gave it a test before packing it in the carton.Even with the adjustments,it seems the strings that came with the guitar are not well suited to it and it still lacks the quality sound I was led to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for its price","review":"This acoustic guitar seems thinner in the picture. It's a little heavy and sounded a little cheap with the copper strings it came with, but it sounded great after i switched them to some D'addarios. I recommend this guitar to beginners. It's a great buy for the price being offered."},{"rating":"2","title":"jasmine by takamine","review":"great guitar - love the sound. delivery by supplier was very quick. would recommend the instrument to anyone. initially i did not like the 'matt' finish but now when i look around all guitars are usually glossy hence i like mine being different from the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I just got this guitar a week ago and I totally love this guitar now the finish is different but it is still a beautiful guitar. I had a little trouble with the strings but found out it was the neck of the guitar that was not in place but now is in perfect condition. Truly a beautiful and awesome guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it, but its quality is bad","review":"2 stars mean \\"I don't like it\\"... It's not that I didn't like it, it's just that it's quality is bad. And it doesn't matter how much I paid for it, it's how much its list price is. This should have a reasonable good quality for its list price. Instead, the one I bought came with a bad neck, buzzing a lot. I'm not going to tell the whole story here, but I ended up returning it.Unfortunately, I learned the worst way that, sometimes, I should buy things in local stores. Sometimes, you must touch it, try it, feel it, before you buy it.If you don't care about it buzzing or if you're willing to pay the same price you paid for the guitar to fix it such that it's usable, buy it. Otherwise, go to your local store and choose the guitar you like most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takamine S34C Jasmine Guitar","review":"Really a very nice guitar for the money. The strings that come with it are a little stiff, so I might buy lighter weight strings, but this is a nice guitar that easily sounds like a guitar 4 times its price or better."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I guess you pay for what you get. I just wish manufacturers (Takamine) and sellers (Brooks May) perform better quality control before they ship out their products.PROS: It's a beautiful guitar in terms of appearance. The satin finish and the woods used are very pretty.CONS: On delivery the 2nd fret and 5 fret on the high E string were dead.Only one guitar strap button on the guitar.The quitar strings were low quality and old. Be prepared to restring.Simple quality control before shipping out would have resolved these problems. You can't play the guitar with dead frets! A visit to my quitarman and 50 bucks later, after setup, new strings (Martins) and one more strap button made the guitar what it should have been from the start. Of course, the price for the guitar is good, but beware a visit to your guitar shop may be necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong order","review":"They sent wrong guitar.

Arrived on time and packaged well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This is a great beginner guitar. We purchased it for our son's 10th birthday so he could take guitar lessons. The owner of the store suggested we have the bridge adjusted to lower the strings to the finger board. This made it much easier for our son to play and when we did this new strings were put on too. It sounds so much better now with the new strings. It also stays in tune well, which is another indicator of good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"inexpensive with a really nice sound","review":"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on whatever new guitar I purchased because I was planning on using it for alternate tunings, however after receiving the S34C and doing a little fiddling with it, I was surprised how good it sounded and played. I decided to use my other guitar for the alternate tunings for now. I slotted the bridge to lower the strings into the bridge and made a new bone saddle to replace the plastic one that came with the guitar. This guitar is laminate top to bottom, but really has a nice sound. For under a $100 you can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Gave this to my 14yr old granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it. Had her Dad put a instrument hanger on her wall immediately so her 5 younger siblings could not reach it when she put it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar for the money","review":"Very nice guitar for the beginner. It has great action. It is also very light weight. It makes a great campfire guitar that you can bring along with you on trips. If something were to happen to it, you are only out $100, so it's not that big of a deal. It has pretty good sound. I changed the strings for D'addario EXP11's right away. It sounds much better than the strings it came with. I would have given it 5 stars, but let's face it. It's a $100 guitar. It's no Taylor or Martin. It's decent and gets the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This is a good guitar for beginners because it's something to start with and learn on. It's cheap which allows you to not spend alot of money on your first guitar only to lose interest or quit. But I do not recommend this guitar to any seasoned guitar player. It goes out of tune very quickly. Alothough it does produce a warm tone, I just can't handle the constant tuning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takamine jasmine s34c","review":"After some filings on the metals bars frets i was able to elimate the vibration made of the first string to the metal bar of the fret board.

Im very satisfied with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plays great","review":"I've always wanted to own a Takamine, and now I'm quite happy to have purchased one. The action is really good, it's got a fast neck, and definitely gives a great tone for classic rock and 90's acoustic songs. It's a great addition to my ever-growing collection of guitars, and I've already received many compliments. I highly recommend this guitar for beginners, intermediate, and professional musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jasmine by Takamine S34C","review":"For the price, this acoustic is hard to beat. Action on mine is nice and low. No fret buzz issues at all. Decent sound. Tuners actually hold very well, better than I expected at this price. The workmanship on mine is quite good for less than $100.00. However, the frets could use a little filing on the ends along both sides of neck - but certainly still playable. I will try my hand at that little project with a file I purchased at the Stewart McDonald website when I restring it next time.Remember, this is Not a $500 - $1000 guitar. Good for a take anywhere guitar - beach, campout, ...and hey if something happens to it you are not out much and can get another. Also, great as a starter to find out if you really want to stick with learning guitar.If you are doing recording or live gigs, this may not be for you, otherwise just a fun, low priced guitar to have fun with. (As always, good strings keep the tone sounding good.) Rock On & GOD BLESS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised at the good reviews","review":"Maybe I got a lemon? I ordered this one after reading so many good reviews, but ended up receiving a guitar in the mail that had a severe two tone discoloration down the front (one half light wood, the other half dark) and a pick guard that had fallen off. I found it at the bottom of the box. Cosmetic things sure, but I guess I'm a little picky about how my guitars look. Didn't even bother playing it. Had a helluva time getting the company to complete the return with it as well. After months (literally), I finally got them to take it back. I know Takamine is a very reliable name so it is likely I just got a lemon, but still."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor condition","review":"This product arrived with a broken e string and infact the whole set of strings was in poor condition. The neck was out of adjustment and all strings buzzed when playing the first three frets. I was very disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!","review":"I've had this guitar for over a year now, the action is way to high. I had to put electric guitar strings on it because regular acoustic strings make the neck bend and it makes the action way to high. I can't play any notes above the 12th fret which just isn't cool. DO NOT BUY THIS!! Please save your money for a more expensive guitar. Word from the wise: Never go cheap on a instrument!! I recommend getting a Washburn, Ibanez, or low end Taylor or Martin. I really suggest you DO NOT buy this. I myself am never buying a Takamine ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable for $100","review":"If not for all of the great reviews for this guitar, I wouldn't have ever bought it. I wouldn't expect a $100 guitar to be very good at all, but this one is an exception. It looks really good, sounds great, and seems pretty solid as far as I can tell. Very pleased with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great budget acoustic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jasmine review","review":"For the price this is a wonderful guitar.

If you need evidence of this man's utter madness, look to the mind-numbing exercises devoid of holistic comprehension, and to the chaotic presentation of grammar. Introducing the passive voice a dozen chapters after deponents? Absurd! Criminal! This study guide might be necessary, but it is also clumsy in arrangement and difficult to navigate.

Most of the pieces recorded are the preludes, the slow, sombre, 'mystical' elements weaving in and out of O'Riley's fingers. Whereas O'Riley is able to bring out these elements with effectiveness, his overall playing lacks dynamics of any kind. He plays with no abandon whatsoever. Sonatas 4 and 10 are on this CD. I could not finish listening to the 4th, maybe because I am so use to THE Hamelin version. As for his performance of the 10th, it was mild. The last track, Vers la Flamme-again, no abandon, no dynamics. A very hairy piece I admit. But Sofronitsky I think does it justice. Every reviewer gives this CD 5 stars. Poetry is fine, but you need more than this to play Scriabin. O'Riley just doesn't quite cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"breastfeeding easy as pie now!","review":"My baby had a hard time latching onto my inverted nipples to breastfeed.

Otherwise, it suffers from poor editing in the text itself and ill-conceived structural arrangement. And it contains a fatal flaw, for nowhere in the book does the author cite a single source or reference for the information he presents,except the self-referencing first hand accounts, thereby violating the First Commandment of the history profession. The result is often clumsy paraphrasing that could leave the author open to charges of plagairism. Also, by not citing his sources or supplying a bibliography, he denies the curious reader any chance of following through with his or her own research of a particular item mentioned in the book. Let's hope he does better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old timers reminisce","review":"Imagine a group of WWII veterens sitting around reminiscing.

I stayed there about six months before going back to demolition work with UDT4. AT UDT4, I spent about two months as the executive officer of the team.

Time and time again, mother's overlook their son's flaws because all they can see is the love that they have for them. And more often than not, those same son's take that same kindness for a weakness and uses it to their advantage.Thus the plot of Ms. Smith's fascinating novel. Her characters all have different circumstances but the results are all the same. They fear for their son's destructive ways which are empowered by their actions and they are all at a crossroads on how to correct the error of their ways.Take time out of your busy schedule and join them on their enlightening journey to self discovery for the betterment of themselves, their families, their sons, and maybe you and me.

I live in Tampa, FL in a pretty busy area and the most signal strength I ever get is 0-2 bars.Last but not least, it's a shame how much the salespeople at Verizon push this phone so much...it's really not worth the headache just because it has an MP3 player, camera, and so on.

The earpiece for my latest version was dead, again, two weeks after it was replaced and I just don't feel like going through the hassle of waiting for another new one via Fed Ex. I think it is telling that Verizon stopped carrying this model shortly after I purchased it and every replacement has had to come from the manufacturer itself. I have only owned LG phones prior to this and was satisfied with all my previous models. I may even buy another LG in the future--after adequate research--but this one has done nothing but inconvenience me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally dissatisfied with the VX8100","review":"After almost 2 years with this phone, I have nothing good to say about it. The reception has been terrible, the battery discharges within 10 hrs (and that's when I don't use it--when I do talk, the talk time is under an hour), and it's difficult to hear anyone half the time.

I love the multi color light outside of it and the SD slot allowing me to add infinite music and ringtones. The battery life on this phone leaves something to be desired, as mine only last for about 1.5 days after a year of use. Also i notice that others with Verizon can get sevice in places I cant with mine. But overall the service is consistent, and this phone has held up great. Full of features and great for those of you like me that have destroyed phones in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a year","review":"Yeah, it was a good phone for a year, great reception, battery life even when I was usnig bluetooth, hence 2 stars.

In their quest to push the loudness of the CD, they made it sound terrible by taking out all of the dynamics of the original sound. Sure, it's louder, but the volume on the drums and certain other parts of the mix that used to stand out in the mix because they were louder have been clipped and the volume on the softer parts boosted so now everything is just loud white noise.

TOWARD THE TERRA presents a staggering view of the unimaginably distant future, wherein humankind has been split into two camps: those ruled by powerful Computers, and those on the outside, the feared and hated \\"Mu,\\" for MUTANTS. Outsiders, rebels. A peaceful minority seeking a new home, the ancestral homeworld, Terra.

Don't misunderstand me - I like cranial anime, but the plot here fails to keep one's attention, and meanders too much to be effective. And I never thought I'd say this about anime, but Toward the Terra is just too long. 112 minutes to tell a story that could have been over in 75. Character development is inadequate, and the extremely shojo (girls' manga) character design is tiresome, and the music is awful - even though I like J-pop. Then again, this could just be 19-year old animation showing its age. On the plus side, the animation is fluid if drab, the revelation of the psychics' purpose is interesting, and TRSI is selling this for $5 now. If you like melodramatic space opera, and especially if you like classic anime, give this a shot, but I personally reccomend Gall Force in that category."},{"rating":"1","title":"sister freaks","review":"repetitive of Jesus Freaksnot enough new stories in it that differ from the Jeasus Freaks book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!!!","review":"This is an excellent book about female Christians that gave up a lot for God.

For example, in his description of the arrival of Lewis & Clark, he extols the nobility of the Nez Perce while describing a council meeting that, but for the intervention of one women, would have decided to murder the visitors in their sleep.

It is filled with every topic you can think of and is laid out well. It's easy to read and straightforward. The back of the book has a list of resources which is a big plus. The book contains state specific information which is important because states have their own statutes on unemployment and health insurance.This book talks about unions, sexual harassment,wages and hours, the Family Medical Leave Act (NOLO has a separate book on this if interested), privacy, health & safety, unemployment, illegal discrimination, losing/leaving your job, worker's comp, SSDI, retirement plans, and lawyers and legal research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource, but not complete","review":"This book is so helpful and comprehensive, that I'm giving it 5 stars.

They shipped a new power supply that had a reset button on it. Up until about 2009 it worked great as it was, but I had to ductape the button to keep it from accidently resetting on me. Eventually my Xbox refused to turn on at all. Since my solution was to trash the Xbox & buy a new one or try replacing the powersupply that's why I did. This powersupply fixed my issue and my Xbox runs fine now.So, it definitely runs on the older Xbox models and although it doesn't have the surge protection feature the original one did, I think it works better without it and I plug it into an external surge protector anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better","review":"I found this info very dry and hard to get thru.

All the previous ones stuck like magic. In one case to WET glass to hold up a car power window with a broken lift mechanism! The adhesive held better than duct tape, but I did use a layer of duct tape on top of the kraft to make the paper waterproof. This particular Shurtape is much thinner than others AND does not stick to plastic. It literally falls right off the top of a plastic garbage can lid. It DOES stick to a cardboard shipping carton, however. But that is not the only use for a Kraft tape. Perhaps this particular stock is old. Hard to tell, but I will not reorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent results!","review":"Couldn't find any presized boxes with lids in order to store some collectables and went ahead and made my own boxes and lids.

I would prefer a few apt, tight metaphors to dozens of cloudy word pictures that leave me wondering \\"what is he trying to say?\\" Yes, much of the language is beautiful to the ear. And perhaps McGuane frequently intends to create a sense of ambiguity. But reading McGuane reminded me of fishing with a guy who likes the sound of his own voice but isn't sure why he's talking. After a while it is grating.I'm not looking for a mock-Hemmingway style in my angling literature. But McGuane gives us so... many... words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick","review":"This book was horrible. Nothing but sex and fish, fish and sex.

Hot-blooded writing swirls his decades of experiences into a landing net of honest, from-the-heart prose that speak well for appreciating Mother Nature -- the natural world. Once you finish his collection, add to your reading the classic book LIFE WITH NOAH, a posthumous memoir of Richard Smith,an Adirondack mountain fisherman, outdoorsman who was befriended by Noah John Rondeau, a hermit who lived in the Cold River valley from the 1920s until his death in the late 1960s. Both fished for their survival, for the love of the sport and had no greater respect for woodland animals and nature's importance to an individual's inner peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scissor Jack","review":"I bought the jack because it looked like it would fit my application well. It did fit, but it wouldn't lift a 1,000 lb load although rated for 4,000 lbs. The screw was well lubricated with grease, but there is just too much friction to be over ridden by the crank. It was cheap, but still not worth the little money I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy, but it works","review":"We purchased this air purifier to try to manage a mildew smell in our basement. When the fan is on medium or high, this is a noisy machine. Since it's in the basement, that doesn't bother us, but if you have this purifier in a living area, be prepared for some racket. Having said that, I will also say that the smell in our basement was just about gone just a few days after we set up this machine. It does the job the company claims it will do; therefore, I'm giving it four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean Air","review":"Great product, no setup as the filters are installed. Quiet operating, if you notice more noise, check the filters. Easy to forget them as there is no filter status indicator except for a dial on top with set time frames.

The air filtration is typical Hunter (great) and after a short while you forget it is even on (particularly on the low setting). But a key feature of air filters for us is the sound. I have found the 30057 a lower-pitched humming than some of the other Hunters with more of an air flow sound than a typical fan whine. Lastly, I recently noticed that opening the front screen while the filter is running will shut the fan off. I like this safety feature as we have several small children in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Louder then hoped but working good","review":"We learned our baby has really bad allergies to pollen and dust. Our doctor told us to purchase some air purifiers. The Hunters had the best reviews so we bought 2. We received our air purifiers on Monday, and they were a little louder then we hoped but expected it. They sound like a box fan on the med. and high setting; however the low is not bad. So far they are working really well. There was a new smell the first day we had them plugged in, but after the first day we couldnt smell it. I have one in my kids room and leave it on through the night and it doesnt bother my light sleeper. The rooms smell cleaner but I dont know if its actually purifying the air...we will see. Anxious to see the long term :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purifier for the price","review":"I've had this purifier for about 4 months now. It's been great! I have a cat in my small apartment so I use it to clean the air of cat litter dust and dander... because of the litter dust, I've already had to replace both the pre- and HEPA filter way before their time, but I guess that just means it's working. The pre-filter can can also be vacuumed or shaken out to clear the dust. The noise is minimal, but I'm used to having fans running in my room already... I would definitely recommend the Hunter 30057 as a cheap HEPA purifier.Also note that it takes a while for the initial plastic smell of the parts to fade, several weeks in my case. If you have a sensitive nose, you may want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WORKS!","review":"I'm surprised there aren't more reviewers commenting about the strong plastic (and metal?) smell this emits for the first few days it's turned on. It was so strong, I decided not to use it in one of our small bedrooms. Instead, I put it in our living room, which has vaulted ceilings. I can tell it actually works because I was sneezing a lot one afternoon, and after I turned this on to the highest setting, I stopped sneezing after a few minutes. At the highest setting, it's about as loud as an air conditioner, but I don't mind because it does what it's advertised to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Smell","review":"This machine gives off a horrible plastic/chemical odor that stunk up the whole downstairs of my house. Some have said this odor goes away after a couple of days, but after running this for a week, it still smells hideous. To me, this totally defeats the purpose of having an air purifier! I'm sending this unit back and trying a different brand. BTW, I tried calling Hunter, and their customer service is, quite frankly, total crap. Was on hold for over 10 minutes, twice, and finally got an option to leave a voice mail only to reach a recording that said, \\"sorry, we can't process that request right now,\\" and then was disconnected."},{"rating":"2","title":"quiet and runs smooth","review":"I needed another air-cleaner that I could use in the front room with our fire place, and this one has been A-O-K so far.Runs quiet, I mean so quiet I have to walk over to it, and look down in side to see if the fan is spinning.It's doing what I wanted, making the air clean in our place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odor","review":"The humidifier works well.

Hamish is sleuthing on his own in the small neighbouring village of Drim. He's the only one that thinks that murder most foul has been committed there. He puts his professional life on the line to first of all prove that murder was done, and then to show who actually committed it. Hamish is his usual laconic, endearing self. No wonder that the books of Hamish Macbeth have started a cult of followers over here across the pond from where MC Beaton and her fictional characters live. As in other books there is a sense of despair but a true sense of warmth as well. Her books in this series in particular are prime examples of black comedy. And her characterizations are absolutely wonderful with each outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death of Charming Man: A Hamish MacBeth Mystery","review":"I have enjoyed all the Hamish MacBeth books I have read so far.

I have a good clear plastic liner that goes on the highchair so it was able to suction pretty good. Even with that he learned to pull it off.. that in itself became the best game for him - to pull until it snapped free. It's a good toy but could be a great toy if the suction could be better.

At that time I wasn't an avid reader nor did I truly enjoy reading. It was this book that changed that perspective for me. This book was wonderful and exciting to read. The details made visualizing the story easy. Now, as a 29 year old teacher, I still love to go back and reread this book. Granted, I love Harry Potter as much as the next person, but for a truly mature suspense thriller \\"Daddy\\" is a sure fire winner. Tom Clancy has nothing on the suspense and emotional investment in the characters that are developed while reading \\"Daddy.\\" I only wish an excellent screen writer would take it and develop a mini-series.

It tells of an endless chase on behalf of wartime Nazis of a prepubescent multi-lingual boy who carries in his head data on hundreds of accounts whose contents have the smell of wealth to the masters of the Third Reich. It is about human intelligence and its foibles: in the boy, his German tormentors and his Daddy--a title which his playboy turned hero biological father earns in spades as he seeks to save his reluctant son not just from Nazis but also from his inner demons.+++It is hard to believe that this is a translation from another language (French) into English.

Thomas is the boy, a genius with theknowledge of $350 million in Jewish fortunes that have been hidden in numbered accounts that his pursuers would goto any lengths to obtain. Translated from the french original the book is a compelling read and one that you wont want to put down until you come to the climactic end.

The ability to take to the skies and take down enemies with guns and missiles is always going to be the completion of a childhood dream for some, and what better way to realize it than on the Sega Dreamcast? The visuals are top-notch in this game, particularly in the dark nighttime levels where sneakiness comes into play. Gameplay's pretty simple, although it would've been nice if landing and taking off in the plane was included (oh, well, you can probably get enough of that in Aerowings).

As a social worker for children and adults with disabilities I have recommended this book to many people. It is absolutely the best book I have read that gives insight into the confusing world of autism. It gives first person accounts of what it feels like to be autistic and encounter the world. It gives excellent insight on ways to provide treatment to someone with autism to avoid over stimulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed....","review":"I was so excited when I received this book. However that all changed once I began reading it. I have read many books on Autism and this one was by far the worst one I have read. I felt the writer dragged the chapters out. I was hoping this book would provide a lot of information on the sensory issues in autism, instead it just gave each sensory issue its own chapter without really explaining anything. This book is less than 200 pages long, it could have been written in probably 60 pages. I do not recommend this book. It is very boring and uninformative. Read \\"The World of the Autistic Child\\" or \\"Facing Autism\\", you will enjoy them a lot more and get more information and they cost a lot less too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle with Care","review":"The book highlighted some popular notions about what the experiences of people with autism are, but was not supported by any credible information. The advice was trite and intuitive, and offered very little that could be considered meaningful. \\"Right From the Start\\" or \\"Let Me Hear Your Voice\\" are much better buys, and are far more practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep, perchance ...","review":"This is a twisted take on the time travel theme we've grown up with.

The Editorial Reviews above tell you more than you need to know about the story line.This was a fun read with some depth that will give your brain a workout if you let it. I will be reading more of O'Leary's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I stopped reading Sci Fi","review":"I purchased this book after hearing O'Leary's poem on the car commercial. While the poem was mediocre, it did provide a certain haunting quality I thought I'd find in the author's books.Unfortunately, that one poem was probably his best work. This book is an example of why I quit reading Sci Fi in the 70's. It reads like a bad nightmare (and I don't mean a nightmare that is so real it is scary - I mean a nightmare from which you wake up and go \\"HUH?\\").There is no real discernable plot in this book. It shows no imagination whatsoever on the part of the author. The author substitutes the shock-value of vulgarity, in actions and language, for plot and character development. It provided no comedic relief, no real drama or pathos, and left me not caring what happened to the characters.Someone here compared it to HHGTTG by Douglas Adams. No way! Douglas Adams provides class-act comedy. O'Leary doesn't even approach the level of Three Stooges comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A puzzling work of SF","review":"I looked forward to \\"Door Number Three\\" after reading the jacket cover. I like SF that plays on issues of time and alternate realities and the like. This book was not at all what I hoped for. Mr. O'Leary writes well and fluidly. His story has a staccato quality that must attempt to highlight the discontinuities of reality that he explores. For me, the result was a book that was difficult to \\"get into.\\" The main character is appealing. This was not the case for the others, including the mysterious woman from an different plane of reality. The ideas are interesting, and the writing is crisp. The story execution falls short, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-fi Soup for the Soul","review":"This is a great book. I didn't give it five stars because I don't think it's an undisputable work of art for everyone, but I did mark it with four stars and as a favorite.This book is a marvelous mixture of psychology (particularly the dream work of Jung), crime thriller, and science-fiction. Unlike so many science-fiction books, this book isn't about a great \\"idea\\" or the world of the future . . . it's about love, loss, time, memory, and being a human.Patrick O'Leary's website talks about how this book was sort of a love letter to his unknown daughter that was given up for adoption when he was a teen (he has since met her and is part of her life). It is this very touching, deep, human element that is at play underneath the intrique, fun ideas, and even humor of this book.Recommended therapy to read this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For a good time, dial EFO","review":"The problem with reviewing a band like Eddie From Ohio is that I am forced to try and describe the music in relation to bands you might have heard of, and this isn't fair to an outfit as creative and original as EFO. Is it pop? Is it folk? Is it serious music? Is it \\"gimmick\\" music? The answer is (e) All of the above. EFO hails from Virginia and plays a great blend of folk-ridden pop... or pop-ridden folk that features some of the sharpest, cleverest, wittiest lyrics you'll hear these days. The songs range from very funny (Stupid American, Eddie's Concubine) to deeply moving (Minnesota 1945, Twenty Thousand Hearts) and everything in between you never thought someone would write a song about. It's sort of like the Beautiful South... without the bitterness... and sounding completely different. Imagine XTC... from Virginia. Anyway, despite a couple of musically nondescript tracks, the overall quality is high and the mood is upbeat and fun. For a good time, dial EFO."},{"rating":"2","title":"ED-DIE, ED-DIE","review":"It don't get much better than this. Mix Americana (i.e., rock, country, folk, big band) with a generous helping of humor and you end up with this delectable treat.

Became a rabid fan, as you will instantly after you purchase this because it is one of those rare offerings that grabs you right from the intial listen! My wife got me a t-shirt next Christmas and I wear it whenever we travel abroad ---> and I am always greeted with \\"Hi Eddie from Ohio\\" by some passing stranger in foreign lands.

This folky-rocky quartet's ability to mix skillful playing and delightful harmonies is so refreshing. Not meek enough to be labeled folk and not angry enough to be rock, they tend to fall through the programming cracks.

A great book to read if you love romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"This is supposed to be a historical romance, but it doesn't really read that way at all. The setting isn't drawn realistically at all, and there are really only a few references to how life was in the 1900s. You can easy tell that the setting wasn't well-researched and that N.R.'s attempt to drawn a mental picture of the 1900s fails miserably. The main characters are thoroughly modern, and I just get the sense that N.R. didn't put too much effort into this book. The love story is cute, but so are a million others that are on the market. There is nothing remarkable about this story and nothing that would have you wanting to re-read it or recommend it to friends. This book was written well before N.R. gained in popularity, so I would skip it in favor of a more recent book of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"This was really bad.

I should have read it sooner, because it was very engaging! Surprising, I enjoyed it better than the contemporary story that it is based on, Loving Jack (Love by Design). Sarah and Jake were well-drawn characters with great chemistry - I liked the way they interacted with each other. I also liked the sisterly friendship between Sarah and Liza."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust the TomTom","review":"I live down South so here in SC the roads don't change much and so the TomTom seems much more accurate to us hicks than you sissyfied city folk. Ok I'm only kidding but the TomTom seems very accurate to me. I only use it on long trips (100 or more miles) and if I have to go somewhere downtown and I'm not familiar where the place is. I've learned to pretty much trust the TomTom but it always seems to falter at the last couple of buildings. But, it does get you where you want to go. The TomTom loves the interstate so it always guides you there even if you know a shorter route from experience. I gave it four stars because it works well for what you pay. I've had mine about 6 months.Bear"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"I ordered this product and was informed that it could not be shipped to my PO box in Alaska.

I have fat fingers and yet I can tap out destination addresses without a problem. The directions are clear and accurate. I like the automatic rerouting when I decide to pass up one of its recommended turns. And the size is magnificent.On the down side... I found it impossible to select an intermediate destination through the \\"tap the map\\" function. Restaurant points of interest are not categorized by type. The \\"find a POI close to me\\" would be better to only look forward in my trip - I don't want the closest restaurant that is behind me!Overall the primary functions work like a dream. I recommend the TomTomOne."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUY","review":"Very nice GPS, it came at a great price, lowest even after 2 months of getting it. I have used it numerous times, very user friendly and sleek machine. Works great even on overcast days and in heavy rains (no signal issues here).

This is the TT1 Second Edition, but the Third Edition is out now and you should buy that one. The TT1 2nd edition will soon have all the software features of the 3rd (Map Share, etc.), BUT, the preloaded map in the 2nd edition is NOT compatible with Map Share and TomTom will NOT give a free upgrade, even if you bought the 2nd edition today.My father-in-law bought a 2nd edition days before the 3rd edition came out and TT customer service refuses to give him a free copy of the new maps. They are actually being pretty rude about the whole situation.

Yes there are models that cost much more and will serve you tea, while massaging your feet but I just need to get from Point A to Point B. Which is exactly what this little Tom-Tom does. The screen is nice and easy to see, I like the way that the volume correlates to your speed increasing /decreasing. The only drawback I had is that when I took it to Memphis with me it was stuck on safety locked, I called the number( help) and after what seemed like 500 hours- more like 30 minutes - I was told that it was because I turned it on and was out of my home area, had I driven to Memphis it would had been ok.Basic unit good price.

The size is great, the audio clear, the graphics and ease of use are wonderful. I solved the problem of the suction cup which is not so good on glass, by buying the dashboard donut on line for $15, which is how I now use my unit. This is convenient, blocks less of the window and dash area, and protects your unit by not having it fall in the car. Also, you do not have to put the unit all the way onto the bracket, which means easy removal when you leave the car. I travel alot so taking the donut with makes using the Tom Tom in rental cars very easy. I should have done this years ago!Norm - Chicago"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is my first gps unit and I Love it.

I had seen it everywhere for $300+. I found it online at Amazon for much less and that included the case. Very easy to use. My only concern is the battery wears down rather quickly and you would probably want to get the home charger. You can keep it plugged in while you use it, but if you do, you woudn't want it mounted to your dashboard.It saves recent locations and your \\"home\\" location and has a great feature that you can change the view from \\"day colors\\" to \\"night colors\\" that aren't as bright at night.

This goes for the Garmin that we have at work.The Tom Tom One that I purchased was really subpar. There is no text to speech with street names. The Tom Tom says, \\"In 300 yards, take the next right.\\" Also, the Tom Tom said their were resturants and hotels at an intersection and there were none to be found. Also, my Tom Tom dropped from my windshield when I was taking a turn. And last, the graphics are not very good. It does not even have my address on the map.I would not recommend the Tom Tom...

The user-interface is also pretty easy, barring a few occasions that had us confused. But that is primarily a matter of familiarity and convention. We are ery much enjoying the freedom from pre-trip direction-printing. it is also allowing to change tracks whenever we want to, by recalculating routes to the final destination. In summary - the gadget is doing its job very well.Two complaints. The PC interface was too bad, and didn't work. Not that it matters though.The map seemed slightly old and thus couldn't catch many current addresses and point of interests. So far, that didn't become a major problem for us, however I wish we can update the map very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"TomTom ONE","review":"Works well, very simple set up.

After looking at several models, we ordered the TomTom ONE because of its well-designed interface. When we tried to actually use it, though, we discovered that its maps are hopelessly out of date.Our unit (ordered in August 2007) shipped with the version 665 maps, which are a blast from the past. The end of our street is blocked by a barrier has been there for at least 8 years; our old GPS, a Magellan unit from 1999, knew about the barrier. The ONE, however, thinks that the barrier does not exist and routes us through it every time we try to go to or from the highway. The TomTom also doesn't know about the new entrance to the San Jose Airport. And that's just from our first hour of usage!TomTom sells updated maps, but they cost 99 euros -- more than half the price of the unit itself! Needless to say, we returned the unit.Skip the TomTom ONE and go with a newer model. Or do what we did and buy a Garmin instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"TomTom One GPS","review":"This product is amazing! I took TomTom ONE Portable GPS Vehicle Navigation System on a business trip with me and it easily found my client's location. The only minor problem I found was that it may be off by one or two buildings. I'm not sure if it is a software update issue or just the accuracy of the tracking satellites, but it is fantastic. Especially the audio feature that talks you to your destination without having to look at the screen while you are driving. The volume even increases automatically the faster you drive.

Voice sound is strong. Screen is 3.5 but works fine for viewing. Do not really need text to speech as directions are clear and street names come up. Battery life could be better - less than 2 hours.

Sometimes it would suddenly place me a couple hundred feet away and give me instructions for getting back to where I already was. The voice directions used the word \\"yards\\" when it should have said \\"feet\\". The POI database was often incorrect. It would tell me that I had reached my destination when it had actually put me in the middle of nowhere. Gas stations would turn out to be closed down and new ones wouldn't show up. In some areas, POIs are about a half mile off.The PC software did not work with the device, so I could not set-up itineraries in advance of the trip.

Now, if only the POI database were updated and the units fixed in the dialogue, the product would rate 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can give bad directions","review":"After reading many reviews I purchased a Tom Tom One with the expectation that it would be an inexpensive base line portable GPS. I tried it out around town so that I could get familiar with it. Its logic will route you to numbered highways over surface streets and this may not only be confusing and perhaps dangerous, but it can increase the distance to be driven.While driving on names highways, it would direct me to dirt roads and even a farmer's road between grape vines and tree fruit. In addition, the time on the unit would be off by the wierdest amount, ie not just even hours. In fact, the time was never correct, or even close.I am afraid that if I was on roads that I was not familliar with, I might have been placed in harms way it I had followed its directions.I returned the unit for a credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"TomTom needs to find a new day job","review":"I hate this unit with a passion and I sell the things.

And good luck talking to customer service, both I talked to didn't speak english...A dreadful unit, maybe TomTom could go work at Walmart"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding me, TomTom","review":"Sure, the customer support(Business hours only) is weak, documentation is poor, and the One sometimes takes several tries to start. I could live with that. But the one I received as a Christmas gift just stopped working, a month later. It won't progress past the startup screen even after being reset, and I'm taking a trip tomorrow. Thanks, TomTom. If I can get hold of the receipt, I'll be exchanging it for a Garmin."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Tom Tom","review":"Not Sue Sue, Tom Tom! I purchased my Tom Tom One three years ago and I am very satisfied with the results. It is accurate and clear with the verbal direction cues. I am also happy with the way the system will auto adjust if I miss a turn or an exit. I have let friends and relatives borrow the system as well, and they have loved it! The only issue I have with it, is that I can't figure out how to leave it on when I don't have a necessary destination. I have seen other Tom Tom's that have a \\"No Destination\\" or roaming type mode, but mine does not seem to have it. Other then that, I am very happy with my Tom Tom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guided me nowhere more than once","review":"I dont know how other products stack up but ive found this one to want to drive off to no where too many times...Just wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PERRFORMANCE","review":"What a perfect marriage of price and performance. Worked flawlessly right out of the box. I'll never get lost again. The more expensive models have more bells and whistles but I really don't need all that.Minor complaints are, if you need real time traffic, you need to buy certain cell phones and none will work from Verizon. Too bad because they have the best network in the NY area. As with Mapquest, a few times you get a round about way to get to a destination but get there you will and it gives you alternate routes. You can update maps for free via computer USB port. Forget the optional AC charger as you can charge the unit in the car and when plugged into the USB. You must get the carrying case to protect the screen. This unit will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops","review":"The TomTom One is excellent. Very easy to set up and use out of the box.

For the price and quality there is nothing on the market close. I use it daily and I have found the directions accurate and straight forward. The features such as points of interest, voices are an added value. The bluetooth technology is has some room for improvement. But I didn't buy it for that. I wanted a naviagator that got me around and was paying attention to where I was going even when I wasn't. It does that and that makes it a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible...","review":"i really loved everything about this tomtom until i started using it to avoid highways. i live in los angeles, and it does not considers major highways like the 101 and the 170 freeways!!! it became really annoying to constantly be setting it to avoid those roads. then, it just stop charging! the charger connects to the cigarette lighter and it was really really hot and out of nowhere STOPPED WORKING! i couldn't believe it! since the tomtom doesn't come with a wall charger i couldn't charge it any other way. and it definitely was not my car's cigarette lighter because the light was green and kept getting really hot! luckily, i was able to get store credit from where i bought it for another GPS. i'm getting a garmin this time! and also... tomtom work on an inferior routing system than garmin and magnellion. i would suggest trying out those two brands instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"TomTom One a Great Deal","review":"This product is top notch and very affordable.

But then after using it a few more times, I realized to my horror that this device was absolutely useless. It couldn't give me correct directions, telling me to go straight into a one way street. It doesn't have enough POI and could not even locate a major highway.

I'm a cop, and my TomTom has helped me make it to several emergency calls without error. I highly recommend such units for use in Law Enforcement, and Emergency response applications. It does not distract the driver from safe operation of the emergency vehicle, and the voice instructions are clear and audible.My only problem with the TomTom is in the inability to update the maps. I have logged onto the official website many times, plugging the TomTom into my computer, and attempting to achieve an online update. It doesn't happen.My city has grown. There are regions and areas which the TomTom sees as \\"outer space\\". It zones out into blueness in these places. TomTom Corporation, fix this problem, and you will have a perfect product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't I buy this sooner?!?!?","review":"I love this product...I used to get lost everywhere and going somewhere new would make me very anxious. This product is well-worth the investment! Since I bought it, everyone in my family has gotten one too.Update 2/27/09. I still have the TomTom and use it often. I still am mad I never got one sooner. You can get these for $100-$150...so I would not pay more than that. At Christmas you can get them at many places for $99 (actually the day after Thanksgiving).Our company purchased a lot of Navigons one year instead of the Tom Tom's because they were $10 cheaper a unit. The Navigon's were awful...some stopped working after two weeks. They were a mess and would even take you on the hwy if there was a side street that was quicker. Now that I have something to compare it to...I still think the Tom Tom is a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Falls a Bit Short","review":"I used a Garmin Nuvi 350 at another job and it was great for one simple reason; it called out the street name I'm suppose to turn onto.

For a few dollars more I prefer the Garmin.I will pawn it off on someone else and buy the Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Customer Service","review":"Can't say how good a GPS this is.

Messed around with it on my normal route to get the morning paper. Now for the big test, using it for an actual destination that required the marvel of modern technology. Well, maybe Edison NJ isn't mapped on Satellite yet but the unit hangs up and reboots for all points in Edison NJ. I tried the points of interest (Menlo Park Mall where I wanted go) as well as random addresses in Edison. Reboots every time! Other addresses in NJ work. So, I recommend you buy this as long as you don't need directions to the city of Edison NJ. I sent an email to TomTom so lets see what the remedy is. There is no pone support but I won't go there. Perhaps a topic for another rant.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"TomTom One","review":"I am a little disappointed in this product. Does a fair job but sometimes the maps aren't complete.

GREAT!!!!","review":"For our work trucks we use Tom Tom One's New Edition. They are great for getting trucks around the city and when setup properly every time you enter a destination you can select to: Avoid Highways, Shortest, Fastest, Limited Speed, etc... we use the Avoid Highways and take back roads into the city almost daily and helps us get there on time!!!As stated they are in work trucks and decently harsh conditions... I've seen them hold up to being dropped, sat on, and poked pretty hard. The one that broke was eventually due to being left in the truck in the extreme heat of 100+ degrees outside so we think it basically melted on the inside being closed in the truck.Unfortunatly the units that were stolen were believed to be taken by an x-employee our fault for not locking them up and being to trusting.The other two that are still in use are used daily and we will be adding more soon, once we get a locking cabinet.-Atlanta"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems I live in limbo...","review":"I purchased the Tom Tom One at the end of July 2007. I since found whole sections of highway missing, in one instance 20-30 miles showing open fields. This highway was completed in 2004-2005. Consequently the GPS will not route the shortest or fastest route. I contacted customer service and found that they will not support updates or map share on my map version, (v6.65) which is the most current version until edition 3 is released. (v6.75) It is very frustrating because I know that if I found this many missing roads in my small travels the total missing roads must be vast over the entire country. I am going to attempt to return it but I think I am past that point. The bottom line is Tom Tom does not support map updates on my v6.65 unit. They claim that they will support map share on the v6.75 units. All of us with the v6.65 units even though they are a new purchase are just out of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Purchase!","review":"I wasn't sure I would have a need or use for any GPS but now that I have the TomTom I am so glad - I use it all the time. It is accurate, clear, sleek, user-friendly and an overall quality product. I have friends with the GPS built in to their cars and there are ridiculour flaws to the routes. My TomTom in superior! I use it to find new routes to regular commutes/travel and to discover new places to go in neihboring towns and in the city nearby.

Miss my mother's home by a half mile. Located my daugther's house two streets east of where she lives. It has only been right on about 40 percent of the time. It is very easy to use but what good is that if it doesn't take to the location you want to go. Can I trust this unit in a city that is new to me to get me to the right location?

As it was meant to be a gift for my directionally challenged hubby, this feature was most important to me. As promised, there was really no assembly required and we put it in the car last Saturday morning for a test run. Imagine our suprise when the touchscreen announced that we needed to retrieve an online activation code. It really wasn't difficult to do, but it did require going back into the house, and upstairs to the pc in order to retrieve our code. Perhaps the instructions should have indicated that this would be necessary. Other than that, the unit delivered as promised. I agree with the other reviewers that it might be nice to have street names announced. Then again, we live in New England and many streets don't have signs posted so it really doesn't matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it","review":"I have been really impressed with how this product performs.

It's very small and, therefore, very portable. You can easily store it anywhere in the car and out of site. It's accuracy and ease of use make it a pleasure to travel into far and unknown places. It mounts securely and easily onto the windshield. My only suggestion to the maker of TomTom One would be to have the GPS tell the driver verbally what street you are turning on or what highway you are entering. Instead, it shows the next major road you will be entering in a rather small text. Otherwise, it's an excellent GPS for most people.

TomTom is unbelievable in county lanes and stunningly powerful for geting around the urban jungle - but it has a great finale when you leave the car.

Also, we could not plot our location as HOME, partly because our area has not yet complied with the 911 re-addressing and so we still have no street or road numbers, only rural route box numbers. This is not TomTom's fault. Still, it makes it impossible to plot many addresses. Also, when I tried to install the software that comes with TOMTOM, I recieved an error message that my computer lacks a necessary dll, UNICOWS I think it was, so I cannot use the program to update or save my data on my computer. Otherwise, this is a fun product to use, and helpful and easy to program for directions to addresses it recognizes. Four stars for ease of use and features. Two stars for battery life.

It gave me awful directions, and the maps were out of date. One road where I live is about 5 years old, and the TomTom did not have it. Also, the directions were so poor that I would have preferred printing directions from Yahoo instead of using this device.I ended up returning the TomTom and getting the Garmin Nuvi 350, and I am much happier. The Garmin has the road that the TomTom was missing, and the directions are much better.Garmin, most other GPS devices, and web sites like Yahoo all use Navteq maps. These are considered the best.

I have found the unit too buggy in terms of routing. From what I have read on the Internet, this unit uses Tele-Atlas, the data base from a Dutch firm and most of the competitors, including Yahoo and Google use the Navteq data base, a U.S. based firm and generally get much better results. Tomtom had me going in one direction and making a U-turn on the freeway for some unknown reason. I'm going to sell this unit and buy a Garmin Nuvi 350.

Add to this the frequent 'White Screen of Death' (I read of this in chatgroups, but didn't listen).... no contest: Trade it in for Garmin. The Garmin 350 took me right to my doorstep, with instant recalculations when I intentionally took a wrong turn.

On several occasions, it seemed to me that it did not identify the optimal and fastest route, but it did ultimately take me to my destination. Also, for the price, I think that it should come with a home charger which is a must because the unit does not hold a charge for very long with the car adapter charge. A home charger costs another 25 bucks or so.I've used the Tom Tom extensively for about a month and it's been a great help as I try to negotiate the often times complex roads in the Wash. DC area.

There are some things you have to get used to. Tom doesn't measure feet well, but it is fine for miles. Ex: You may be told to make a right turn in 150 ft, but it may be only 25 ft. to the turn. Also, the documentation is poor. The battery can be charged by connecting to your computer, a wonderful feature that you are not told about.

We picked a destination and found both the TomTom and Garmin took us essentially to the same destination when we entered an address. We had to take a trip to a hardware store. I picked Shopping and then House and Garden. The Garmin showed me Lowes is 2.1 miles and Home Depot is 2.3 miles away. The TomTom didn't show the stores.

There was no real rebuke to the scientific studies, just some comments on what 'seemed' flaws in the methods. No proof whatsoever. I realise that to many people (not medical doctors or psychologists), the arguments the author presents may actually seem intelligent and sightful, but to be honest, they are really weak and flawed. I was actually kind of angry at the end of the book: does the author think we people are dumb and we'll buy anything? Apparently. I honestly don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic, hateful, unscientific garbage.

This book really should be titled: \\"To a Parent Who Does Not Quite Understand.\\" It should really help those parents who neglect their children.

It is time people actually UNDERSTOOD their bible references, put down their shellfish (which apparently is one of the other sins in the same sentence as \\"laying with another man\\"), and start the application of truth and love.

Stupid, stupid, stupid! Then, he says if fathers play sports with their kids and take them out for ice cream and talk about male bonding issues, they will be fine. Come on, the kid will simply become a sports-loving gay guy.This is harmful because it misguides parents. It gives them false hope, and the author has seemed to suggest in the past that he has alternate reasons for his \\"psychology.\\" When I was a kid, my kindergarton teacher told my parents I was showing gay tendencies, and my parents went on a compaign to change me, like forcing me to play cowboys and indians for an hour.

Dr. Nicolosi has either a completely clouded world view... that discounts science, or deliberately misleads the uneducated reader into denying current accepted thought and practice in medicine and psychiatry (not to mention science). While I would grant that he seems to have some well meaning intentions (in his world view), I would argue that his method would probably do more harm than good, as the success rate (which I do not believe is ever quoted in the book) of his therapy is undoubtedly low, and he offers no acceptance model if \\"therapeutic failure\\" results. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to loving your children unconditionally?","review":"What is wrong with people today, this book is not only a representation of how to destroy your family and reject your child but also how to limit your child thru guilt till they cut their wrists bc their mommy and daddy could never love them just bc they like the same gender.

Certainly the kinds of people one is attracted to are not only genetically determined, but the argument that interracial relationships should be prevented has for the most part died out.With no other real arguments to fall back on, this book comes off not only as a work of ignorance, but as a message of hate that has been present in society for centuries, interchanging 'gay' with other groups convenient enough to fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"get better info","review":"do you want to be \\"right\\" or do you want a good relationship with your child?

And coincidentally, I didn't think that Bad Boy shares much more than a plot device with The Boyfriend School."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are you, Sarah Bird?","review":"I am not a person who usually rereads books, but I just read THE BOYFRIEND SCHOOL for the third time in ten years, and it's one of my absolute favorites. Funny and yet touching, as well. I'm so glad that this book was recommended to me years ago. What I'd like to know is, what happened to Sarah Bird? After 1993, I can't find any record of her having written anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the characters, speech, setting, almost everything.","review":"Okay, maybe the second half, after she discovered Rye, wasn't my favorite part. I really liked the beginning, when she's describing life at her magazine and at home, LOVED the Luvboree, Juanita, Carrie, Lizzie, and Andrea. Enjoyed excerpts from Gretchens book and from others. What I didn't like about the part with Rye was that it seemed like she didn't spend as much time with Juanita and Lizzy, and when the three of them were together was the funniest part in the whole book. However, the climax is interesting and unexpected, and I loved all the characters, the humor, and the setting. God, if I met someone like Rye I wouldn't care how many Trouts I had to go through to get to to him. Gus Kubiak is sweet. I know some people think that Gretchen is shallow about him, but you have to think, the author was trying to be realistic. Not a lot of women would be phycologically capable of looking past that face and that much earnestness(desperation)."},{"rating":"2","title":"For every parent who is seriously considering diabetes camp","review":"Getting The Most Out Of Diabetes Camp: A Guide For Parents And Kids published by the American Diabetes Association is a practical, useful, authoritative guide for the parents of diabetic children considering a summer vacation option that can teach young people with diabetes about fun, independence, and the importance of taking proper care of themselves.

It is also an extra bonus that they have to figure out how to put the food back together so it looks right!

I prefer the Melissa & Doug play foods over the plastic stuff that likely has BPA and other chemicals in it. Yes I realize this stuff is painted, and the paint isn't too durable. My daughter has pretended to eat some of the foods and has scraped the paint with her teeth. Overall we have fun cutting up and eating the food. You can't really make a sandwich with the foods provided in the particular set, so having the \\"toast\\" and loaf of bread is a little repetetive if you're trying to teach balance of the food pyramid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"My daughter loves playing with these items in her kitchen. She was always practicing to cut playdoh, so this only seemed fitting to buy for her! The velcro is of good quality too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this toy","review":"My sister bought my son this toy for Christmas but I had to give it my review. Best toy ever! My son is only two but loves to play with \\"knives\\", I know it sounds creepy but it really is just innocent imaginative play. He will go crazy cutting these wooden food items over and over again... and it really is so cute to watch him cut them then push them aside with the knife like a real chef. The French bread loaf and cucumber are his favorite and he really hates to cut the carrot because it requires standing it up vertically and its hard for his little hands to manage... but I do love a good challenge for him. Already the paint on some of the items is scratched which is why I rarely buy Melissa and Doug toys, but honestly because he loves it so much it doesn't really bother me. I highly recommend this toy to any child who loves to play kitchen or dreams of using Mommy and Daddy's knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy","review":"I bought this (and pizza cutting toy) for my nephew's 2nd year birthday. He's almost 4 now and when I last visited, he was still playing with it. The veggies and bread are fun and it comes with a pretend knife and it makes a cool noise when you cut the food. When I was cutting real veggies in the kitchen, I told him to pull up a chair and bring his food so that he could work with me. He cut along with me and he enjoyed it b/c it made him feel like an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"My 3-1/2 year old grandson opened this gift, among others, at Christmas and kept going back to it.

And whats vegetable soup without a little (or lot) of water. 30 mins later, the paint is peeling off all the tomatoes and carrots and the whole box has to be thrown away. Im suprised this hasnt come up in any of the 100+ reviews, maybe I have the only kids who extensively use water when they're playing with food. They rinse, they boil, they wash and these pieces cannot handle water.Im sure this is a great quality toy, but not for the way my kids play. Also, the pieces are heavy and hurt when dropped on toes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up...","review":"People all say they love this toy. I bought it about 1.5 years ago. I have tried to like it, as my daughter got older I hoped my feelings about it would improve, but they haven't (She is 4 and my son is 18 months). It is cute and maybe for an older child who likes puzzles it would be great, but the way that it has to be put together is not easy for a small child. Some pieces have two sides of the same type of velcro and if you misplace those, the rest of the pieces are useless. It also makes it hard for little ones to get it together correctly. My kids do enjoy playing with the little pieces, so it hasn't been a total waste, but I always end up having to put them back together and search for the parts all over the house. I feel similarly about the sandwich kit. The cookies and the cake are great. I also have the 4 food groups and I wish I had ordered two of those instead of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a US toy; China manufacturing","review":"This item smells strongly of paint, and the velcro deteriorated quickly. The finishing quality is much lower than that of European and American made product equivalents. I had (foolishly) thought of Melissa & Doug as an American company, but a bit of research has shown me that M&D is essentially 100% Chinese low-cost manufacturing; it just pretends to be American."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other M & D sets...","review":"I just purchased this at a store and am disappointed. These pieces are harder to put back together because they have to fit precisely. I watched my daughter lose interest as soon as she couldn't figure out how they fit. She has another M & D set she loves and uses all the time. I was also taken back by some of the shapes of the veggies, they don't look right, and some don't even have detail paint or design, just one color with no identifiable markings like our other sets have. I wish I could return mine now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fumes, fumes and more fumes","review":"My daughter seems to enjoy it but I'm very disappointed by the fumes--which makes me believe that the paint is not eco-friendly and/or has not off-gassed yet. I spent a bit more and bought the PLAN cuttable foods and there is no smell. If this is a concern, I would definitely buy PLAN. Going forward, I will no longer use M & D products--everything smells unless it's used for awhile and has off gassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO!!!!!!","review":"Trying to Homeschool and keep twin toddlers busy is tricky. This set is wonderful. Much better than I expected. our set only has one knife, it must be a new version , we had no paint odor at all that the other reviews talked about. COmpletely worth every penny. very well made, a great high chair toy. We have both the cutting food and sandwich sets, both are great. This company makes well made hierloom quality wooden toys. We have many of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"generally good, but the paint was stuck.","review":"It looked good and educational when I was tearing the plastic wrap.

We used it on a New England trip this fall & it was able to pull in some WI FI signal where the wireless card on my Dell Latitude did not have a prayer. There was some heartburn while getting it going... keep on trying. It took a reinstall after the Hawking support guy told me to return it & get a replacement. Just before I was ready to give up & return it, the Hawking sprang to life!

It is very simple to install and does not require knowledge of how networks work. I'm using it with Vista and have had no compatibility problems. I use it to pick up the wireless connection at the other end of the house, going through multiple walls. It improves my signal from \\"fair\\" to \\"good\\" at almost all times that I'm online, making the online experience much, much better. Some reviewers expressed concern about its sturdiness, but that has not been an issue for me since I never need to move it. I'm very pleased with this purchase - its reasonable price was an added bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"USB extension helped performance","review":"I was disappointed at first, until I plugged it into a 10 ft [also 15 ft] USB extension.

So that was fine but now, this literally stop working. Its not even ONE YEAR ! , I will not buy this again for the price. Even though it does received a better signal but its not worth it. The last netgear I bought get good signal. At least it lasted two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for XP, not for Vista","review":"I used this device happily in my RV under Windows XP. It's not nearly as fragile as it looks and travels very safely in the padded box it arrived in.Using XP, it has great software that shows you both signal strength and signal quality for all available WiFi networks. Once connected, it has a series of blue lights on the base that indicate signal strength so you can fine tune the direction you aim it in. My only gripe was that it's hard to aim at low transmitters without shimming up the base (that, and the usual clueless tech support).It works best if you disable any internal WiFi card in Device Manager.All that goes out the window for Vista. No meters at all, the lights on the base never change --- ever, your WiFi connection will be lost periodically, and your browser will crash often.The people at Hawking have known about these problems for about two years. Why they haven't fixed them is a mystery to me since it's costing them many thousands of dollars in sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Hawking","review":"It stopped working after 2 weeks.

After reading recommendations & reviews, I purchased the Hawkins HWU8DD, expecting a half-way decent connection, at least good enough for the kids casual surfing. Was I wrong. The connection went all the way to 54.0 mbps. FYI: The main cable internet line goes through a computer with Vista and the one I hooked up the Hawkings to runs on XP. Set up was virtually painless and completed in less than 5 minutes. I am so impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GREAT product!","review":"For once, a product which lives up to its claims! Got this to correct a barely-there wireless network in my house. My connection went from 1-2 MBS and frequent disconnects with another brand of external-antenna adapter, to a solid, always there 24 MBS. No problems with installation at all -- plug it in, get a solid connection.It might not be the best thing for mobile use, as others have said, the hinge looks a little fragile. But for my situation, a long way from the access point with multiple walls and lots of metal (big cabinets and tools) in the way, it works spectacularly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Driver Available for Win 7","review":"Be aware that the latest driver is for Windows Vista.

It is just the same. It still has to receive the signal from about 50-60 feet through two rock walls and it does not do that any better than my prior non directional adapter/router. Hard wire may be the only way to go but is way too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good functionality, inferior performance","review":"I just tried and am returning an HWU8DD. Seemed well built, software was very good, no installation problems, worked fine under XP SP2. Looked good, too. BUT the sensitivity was not nearly as good as my old D-Link DWL120+ with its small dipole antenna. And I pointedthe HWU8DD at known targets and rotated it through 360 degrees. The DWL120+ saw and associated with signals the HWU8DD never saw, and provided a much better (10dB or more) signal for those both could see. This is my second disappointing experience with a similar Hawking product (wasted time a bit ago with aHWU36D); never again! It is awkward to store and use and does not provide higher performance than a simple dipole unit from other vendors. Don't waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful little device","review":"I received this item only 2 days after ordering with super-saver shipping. Very impressed. I first installed the software on my laptop (no problems at all), then plugged in USB, instantly it found the network and I was surfing. Then installed the software on the desktop (again no problems) and plugged in the USB, and just as quick had the network. The desktop had never had any high-speed connection (ie, wireless card etc...). Very impressed with the ease of use for the unit. I would highly recommend this item for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"hawking high gain wireless antena","review":"Had hard time setting unit up, but 24/7 tech help, got me up & running in a short time.

The one thing you have to watch for though is the disk that comes with it to set it up with doesn't work with vista. We had to track it down online to download stuff that would help it work.

The box packaging was for HWU8DD, then opened it, tried to use it, and WHOOPS! Looks like Hawking decided to put the model HWU8DDA. Mac only model! However the packaging said \\"Windows Vista\\" the drivers say \\"Windows Vista\\" and the loose paper said \\"Windows Vista\\", however the HWU8DDA is NOT PC compatible. Lovely!

I spent a few hours trying to figure out how to make it work, then called their tech support (India), who was very nice and patient with me, but he it was hard to understand him. After nearly 90 minutes on the phone with him, the device worked, and worked quite well, but there were lots of steps that I had to go through to make it work. The next day, when I restarted my computer, the device would not connect to my wireless access point, and I couldn't remember all of the steps to go through to make it work, so I sent the device back. Perhaps it didn't work because I'm using a Windows XP Tablet version (for a PC tablet).

I was able to get into MetroFi several times but the signal strength is less than 20% even though my building is within 300 feet of a router. I have a Pentium 3 with Windows 98 so I'm going to try it on another computer but if that doesn't work I'm sending this thing back.

I spent about 30 minutes each time I wanted to use the internet trying to find the signal, and when I did, it didn't gain me much speed. It would also lose signal frequently (thus spending more time finding the signal again). Plus, it is very cheaply made and I had to be careful when trasporting it. I sent it back within three days. Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what i needed","review":"I recently moved and needed connection for job searches and e-mail but didn't have the extra money for a cable connection. My laptop was able to pull in a wireless signal but it was just to weak and real hit and miss, I couldn't get the signal if it rained and lost it for days at a time. Odered the dish and was caught off guard at how fast it was delivered, ordered it on a sunday, had it in my hands on wednesday. Since then I have not went a day without connection, even found another signal to use. May not be as powerful as I would have liked but was exactly what I needed, already paid for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got it to work","review":"I don't know if this is a good product or not, but I can tell you Hawking Tech Customer Service sucks!

Awkward to transport.","review":"The performance of this unit is good; however, the dish and its base do not fold into an easily transportable shape (it must remain open), and it appears that it could be easily broken in transit. I use this unit with laptop to pickup hard to reach signals when I am working, which it does well. The inability to transport this unit safely in a bag is the only real downside."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a difficult time believing their claim of 8 dB gain but even if it is this isn't a real dish antenna.","review":"I have a hard time believing their claim of 8 dB gain, for a parabolic dish to properly focus the received signal and to have reasonable gain it needs to be much larger than this, about 10 wavelengths in diameter. At 2.4 GHz a wavelength is just below 5 inches of diameter, how can this thing act like a dish should if it is below ONE wavelength? The moment I took a look at this units photo I knew it was a scam, trying to make people believe it is a real parabolic antenna, it isn't. It might have some gain, maybe even 8 dBi of gain but at 2.4 Ghz you can easily get more gain than that from a simple whip antenna. Look for one here on Amazon, they sell for as little as ten dollars and have +9 dBi of gain and 15 inches tall, more gain than this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawking 8db USB dish","review":"Most of the time my laptop can get a strong wifi signal but due to the far distance away from the Station, the laptop is not able to emit a powerful enough signal to communicate with Station.The Hawkings 8db dish really works, it boost and improves the signal from my laptop to the station and I'm able to get and receive signals even when I'm 200m away.The only disadvantage is , u have to know the direction of where the signal is coming from. or the Hawking will not be able to preform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing results","review":"One thing that was never conveyed by the manufacturer on this product is that if you have any obstructions (e.g. trees) to the signal you can't get proper reception.

I had no interest in the \\"Spirit of 84\\" CD when making my purchase. Such a fine album deserved a better transfer to the digital format. This remaster is not good, great, or average. It is terrible. All the sonics are gone and they were an important part of the original recording. Some tracks don't sound like they are from the original master tapes used on the LP. I consider \\"Future Games\\" second only to \\"The Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus\\" in the Spirit catalog. That recording got a great MFSL treatment from Japan. \\"Future Games\\" got butchered by BGO from England. As an aside, all the discs I have on BGO are inferior to their original vinyl versions.

Too bad because it's a cute design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, Pretty good","review":"It was pretty good. But when my cousin saw it she whined and whined to her parents to go to the Bahamas. I think that they kind of went overboard with the whole getting in trouble part which i think is a bad influance on kids. And their parents didn't even get that mad at them when they went past their curfew. There was no plot what so ever only about another girl trying to steal a guy away from one of the twins.And them finding illeagel goods. The scenery was beautiful but everything was just too perfect and that isn't what a real vacation is like. And they kept getting the perfect guys so it kinda was soo predictable and one of the twins was having a horrible time with a guy and another was having a great time and that was unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!","review":"Have I already said this movie was dumb? Because it is! I have seen all of the Olsen twin's movies and this is by far the worse. The movies is pretty short but it feels like hours!It takes place in the Bahamas at the Atlantis Hotel. While the scenery is beautiful the acting is not. Mary-kate and Ashley spend the whole time flirting and giggling (with boys twice their age). The plot of they movie makes no sense at all and only comes ito play at the very end. I suggest that anyone who wants to see this movie waits till it becomes a .99 rental (if even that)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holiday in the Sun","review":"My 7 year old daughter preferred Winning London, Our Lips Are Sealed, and Passport to Paris, to this thinly veiled advertisement for the Atlantis Hotel.Holiday in the Sun has no plot from the beginning. It was like watching the Olsen sister's home video of their most recent vacation. Did you ever have to sit through someone else's home movies or slides of their vacation/trip? This movie was just like that. BORING! The antique smuggling part of the adventure was only actively thrown in for just the last 15 minutes of the movie.Overall, this movie was disappointing. Buy one of the other afforementioned titles, they're better."},{"rating":"2","title":"best one yet!","review":"I love the twins and they are filling out nicely! As they grow up I enjoy them more and more. I would love to see more bikinis in their movies as I am in love with both girls. As they grow up and out I know I will get every video they star in.

I tried to pay close attention to the mind numbing movie, but I couldn't for the life of me find a plot. The movie had no action at all until about a half an hour left in it. It was absolutely terrible. Mary Kate and Ashley usually turn out at least decent movies, but this one was truly the worst I've ever seen. It basically looked like the girls decided they wanted to go to the Bahamas and have the camera crew film them while they had fun. There was hardly any acting and what there was of it wasn't all that great. The \\"parents\\" part was definitely way too corny. Overall, it was incredibly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!!","review":"Its better than some of their movies. This is more for teens but is not that good. I thought it was kind of boring. They play Alex and Madison and they take a family vacation to the Bahamas. Although Alex and Madison are dissapointed because they would rather take a vacation with their friends, and not another boring family vacation.

Truly the worst film the two have ever made, and that's really saying something.

This film is targeted to the tweens crowd, and if you don't like it, it means you are too old to enjoy it.Full of sun and fun and the worlds cutest girls, if you expect Hepburn and Tracy you will be dissapointed,the film is light and upbeat even in the scary parts and thier acting has developed although, you may not notice because they've always played themselves. Yes, shameless product placement abounds but if they flipped the bill for my production I would advertise for them! it's the American way.If you can pretend you're 14 again or you are or a MKA fan you will enjoy this movie as much as any of the other MKA flicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Watch","review":"We rented this to watch before we went to the Atlantis resort in the Bahamas.

I have seen Holiday In The Sun many times and I have read the reviews of other people. I personally found this movie good. It seemed like the girls were more themselves in this movie then any other. Out of all their movies, this is my favorite. At times, it was a bit cheesy but it was still really good. An example of when it was cheesy was at the beginning..not EVERY 15 year old girl gets to ride on a private jet, go on a class trip to Hawaii, or complains when they go to the Bahamas! However, like I said, the movie all in all was really good. You can just watch the movie and make the decision on your own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holiday In The Sun","review":"I thought that this movie was really chessey.

It just made me wonder, \\"why dont I have a private airplane, why dont I get to go to resorts, why do I have a limo, or a private suite, or tons of boys after me...\\" I even wanted a twin at that moment!

Well, 6 months later I am upgrading to the Magpul forearm and just bought the 6 shot to go along with it. You'll want the more rounds if you're not wearing a chest rig or shell sling.

On the dust jacket, we're informed there's a \\"Phoebe Fine franchise,\\" a la MI2 or Tomb Raider (as in, \\"Angelina's got her franchise! Now she's set for life!\\"). Franchise means the subsequent books will likely get worse til Lucinda Rosenfled hits bottom and is branded the new Tama Janowitz (after which she'll write something different, like Peyton Ambrose).

Her mother has cancer, their house is falling apart, and even her \\"perfect\\" sister Emily seems to be losing some of her polish.Throw in some fake Eastern Europeans, a broken viola, an old elementary school crush, and a really lousy first date, and this novel somehow comes together. I think my favorite character might actually be Jorge, Emily's South American Jewish lawyer husband and his awkward English.Rosenfeld's prose isn't always pretty, but her characters are unique and a blast to read. And by all means, before moving back home, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why she didn't read this whole book...","review":"This book was so boring and infuriating that I skimmed through about 100 pages and read the last few chapters, just so I could see how it ended. Why Phoebe would ever keep dating Roget is beyond me- he was pompous, rude, annoying and cheap. Even though she can't stand him she apparently keeps dating him because she has the self esteem of a doormat. I skimmed the book to see when she would dump him and was so disgusted when that didn't happen.

Useless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed too soon!","review":"I was dissatisfied with this product. Although concerned about the limitations (e.g. Don't expose to water. Don't expose to direct sunlight or freezing conditions, etc.) I placed the thermometer under an overhang facing north, as instructed. And I live in Southern California, so freezing conditions are not a problem. Despite those precautions, the thermometer failed (i.e. half the display is no longer readable.) within 6 months of purchase. Ironically, it failed in August 2012 during a heat wave. In short, don't buy this product. Sadly, it is another example of inferior off shore manufacture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acu-Rite Suction Cup Thermometer","review":"We received the thermometers within days of our order and are very pleased. We've used these little thermometers in our motor home for the last several years and, of course, since we attach them to the outside of the window, occasionally we forget to bring it in and they are lost. Fortunately, they are quite inexpensive so we stocked up on them this time. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Cannot Manually Reset \\"Max\\" or \\"Min\\" Temperature Readings","review":"I was looking at similar La Crosse Window thermometers which I noted approvingly reset their \\"Maximum\\" and \\"Minimum\\" readings daily which seems logical and useful to me. I then noticed this AcuRite looked similar and had slightly better reviews (although not stellar) so I impulsively opted for this AcuRite model. I felt ridiculous when it arrived yesterday and the owner's manual said the \\"Maximum\\" and \\"Minimum\\" temperature reading is only reset when you replace the battery! So theoretically with a 2-year battery �?instead of a daily range of temperatures... you get BIANNUAL range of temperatures! Idiotic design in my opinion. And... little reminder to me to read carefully and not take features for granted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and well made","review":"This thermometer is very accurate and sturdy. I have it stuck on the outside of my sliding glass doors on the North side of my house and it hasn't slipped an inch despite heavy rain, wind, and snow. My only complaint is that it is hard to see in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exterior window thermometer","review":"The plastic cups will not stay stuck to the outside of the window. So it is basically unusable. I have attached it to the inside of the window frame with double-sided tape, which will probably take the paint off when I remove it. Not what I wanted at all. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor for outdoors","review":"If used outside, it is not water proof. Also you cannot read it when it's dark outside unless there is light from behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Year On - Thoughts","review":"After using this thermometer for a year I can make these evaluations:- it works great as an indoor thermometer sitting on a flat, stable surface- the suction cups are absolutely worthless; all three times that I've tried to attach it to a window it has fallen off and chipped the glass that protects the display- there is no feasible way to use this outdoors without building a special housing and support, which defeats the purpose of the suction cups"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"The suction cups do not work. It fell off the window within 2 minutes. Another stupid thing about this thermometer is that the Min and Max temp is not for the day, but from the last time the unit lost power, which is probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard. This is getting returned"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this item","review":"This thermometer sounds like a good idea. But you can only see the temp when there is some light behind it; meaning if you are up before the sun, forget being able to see any numbers on this thing. And if you do not view the device just from a certain distance or angle, you see nothing. This is a waste of money. Spend less and get a normal looking one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not \\"acu-rite\\" at all","review":"Im in a room that is 62 F...this thing says 82.3F...Garbage!I don't have anything to add but look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I'm surprised by the 3-star average for this product and the less than satisfied customers. Granted, I only use this product indoors. And yes, the suction kind of sucks. Anytime I've tried to hang it up it does fall down within hours, or days at most. So, okay, maybe the 3-star rating is justified. Nevertheless, I've been very satisfied with this product. It seems to be working well as far as accuracy goes, and it's small, very portable, and cheap. I think it's been about a couple of years since I've changed the battery, and it's only starting to fade now. This product has been very useful for me, despite its imperfections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who designed this?","review":"The battery compartment is not the typical slide type, but rather is sealed with little tiny screws. We have a little tiny screwdriver set and attempted to open the little tiny screws so that we could activate the battery. The little tiny screws are very poor quality and are screwed in so tightly that we ended up mangling the tops trying to get them unscrewed--I failed at one and gave it to my husband to try, and he stripped out the top of the other, with neither of them budging for either of us. So--tiny screws that require a special tool that is not provided, and screws of such poor quality and so tight that they cannot be unscrewed even with the proper tool. Needless to say, this is going right back and I won't be trying this again! If you are a remarkably strong little tiny person with little tiny hands, you might be able to activate the battery; otherwise, move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend--hard to read","review":"The display on this thermometer is almost impossible to read when it's dark outside--a MAJOR drawback. Even with a back light source (deck light) you have to adjust your viewing angle just right to finally get a temperature read. Even in daylight the display is dim compared to the packaging illustration. The suction cups are iffy. I cleaned and wiped the window completely dry (outdoor temp. was below freezing) and attached the two suction cups successfully--I thought. One of the cups (they alternate) keeps losing its grip and then only one suction cup is supporting the (then crooked) unit. I'm waiting to come home one day and find the unit broken after falling off the window. Only had this five days... will probably return it for a simple, 24-hour readable, dial-type thermometer. Simple is sometimes better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps to know what to wear.","review":"This is a great thermometer. I keep it on the outside of the front door, so I can see from indoors what temperature I'm going out into - no matter what the time of day. My only complaint is that it is not waterproof - it will not work if it gets water inside, so wherever you place it there must be shelter from rain or snow. Otherwise, great little tool - a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blauner Writes Thrillers for Smart People","review":"This isn't a stupid beach read. It's a suspenseful, entertaining, often funny book that reflects both the comforting and the unsettling parts of suburban life. As Blauner fans know, this author has been quietly carving out a unique niche-- combining serious fiction (deeply drawn characters and detailed social observations) with very readable, highly enjoyable plotting. No warmed-over serial killers here but something more sophisticated and rare--flesh and blood characters whose hidden flaws and deep secrets bring about their downfall.

While some parts of the storyline \`hold water', the majority of the novel lays fallow, and unfortunately fails to deliver on almost every level imaginable.The various not-so-subtle references to 9-11 are not apropos to the plot, and as a result, appear to be a flimsy attempt to draw curious readers possibly scouting for terrorist intrigue. The shallow two-dimensional, and often gutter-mouthed, characters fail to engage the reader, and only highlight the carelessly constructed plot which is neither absorbing or captivating.

Their \\"secrets\\", their long history going back together to high school days, are inferred by readers long before they are slowly \\"revealed\\" by the events of the book.My conclusion?

The content is vague,biased and sometimes even wrong. I read the first five chapters and was unable to contiune due to my discontent.

Also in my setup is a pair of Bose 210's as the rears which work amazingly good, and a Polk Audio center channel. Others have complained that the high upper range in these speakers is not that great, but if you adjust the treble settings on your receiver along with the bass ones, you can really get it just right for any type of music.

The boys also got out their pens on Millennium- Kevin Richardson has written, what I think is one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded on \\"Back to Your Heart\\" the melodies on this one will knock you out!! \\"The Perfect Fan\\", written by Brian Littrell, is a completly different sound for the guys, but once again flawless. I believe that Backstreet Boys Millennium is one of the top albums of the 90's right next to Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\", Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\", Lauyren Hills \\" Miseducation of\\", and Beck's \\"Odelay\\". If the boys keep taking control of their music the way they did on Millennium, I CAN NOT wait to hear what they come out with next. They will definatly be a HUGE part of the new Millennium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain depressing","review":"What do people see in Backstreet Boys? They didn't even write their own songs when they started out and don't play instruments. You call that a band? Their music isn't very original and sounds just like all the other teenybopper groups out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"good songs......wrong voices","review":"ricky wright must have a child that loves these guys, because if you read the review of BSB and then read his review of NSYNC. You can see a major prefrence, unfortunately both are unfounded. BSB's harmonies lack much to be desired, they don't incompass the entire spectrum. Their songs, while I love \\"show me the meaning of being lonely\\", lack the proper voices to make the songs achieve their full potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it much","review":"When this CD first came out, I bought it, loved it, and listened to it all the time. Now I guess I'm tired of it. I'm sick of \\"Larger Than Life\\" and \\"Show Me the Meaning...\\" because I heard them on the radio too much. However, I'll never get sick of \\"I Want it That Way\\". It's a great song. \\"Don't Want You Back\\" is my other favorite. It's very catchy, even if the lyrics aren't so great. \\"The One\\" has always been my least favorite on the album, and now I can't stand it. Why did they release this as a single? I'm sorry, but I don't like \\"The Perfect Fan\\", either. It's sweet, but a little too corny for me. \\"It's Gotta Be You\\" is a good dance song, though. The remaining 5 songs on the album are alright, I guess. They all kind of blend together. This is not to say don't buy the album. I'm sure you'll love them if you like stuff like 'N Sync. However, BSB's debut album is better, so I'd recommend that before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST EVER","review":"THIS WAS THE BEST CD EVER. LARGER THAN LIFE IS A GREAT SONG AND THE FIRST ONE I FELL IN LUV W/ SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE CD. I WANT IT THAT WAY WAS ONE OF EVERYONE'S FAV'S. EVEN MY GRAMPPA SINGS ALONG TO THE \\"TELL ME WHY\\" PART. SHOW ME THE MEANING OF BEING LONELY IS A SAD SONG DEDICATED TO DENNIS POP WHO DIED OF CANCER. SPANISH EYES, MY FAV IS ABOUT HOW YOU CAN LUV PEOPLE FROM THERE EYES. NOONE ELSE COMES CLOSE IS MY FAV, BECAUSE PERSONALLY FOR ME NO ONE ELSE COMES CLOSE TO AJ. THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER SONGS. I THINK THIS IS A MORE PERSONAL ALBUM FOR BSB AND IT IS PERSONAL FOR ME. ONCE YOU LISTEN TO IT, IT'S JUST A CATCHY BEAT AND YOU CAN PICK IT UP IMMDEATLY. YOU WILL JUST LOVE TO SING ALONG. I THINK YOU WILL LOVE THIS POP, R&B, AND COOL SOOTHING SOUNDS WILL EASE YOUR MIND."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I've only heard the one song they play on the radio, and it sounds exactly like one of the songs from the last album, only the words are a little different.

I have said this in every review i've written for pop albums now if you are a metalhead/goth like me reading this wanting to write a bad review or just hate this band welcome join the club, I would list some good rock/nu-metal/ heavy metal/ goth rock bands below or you but. I do not want any decent bands to have fans that listen to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really sad music has come to this.","review":"It's preppy boys making girls cry and prancing around. Not really liked for the \\"music\\" they make but really for their looks. People buy this because it on MTV. Don't be brainwashed and save your money and buy Bush or somthing. You'll thank people like me later. Not one song I liked. Later"},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you mean Millenium","review":"There is no reason why this CD should be called Millenium. There is nothing special about the album . They sound the same as the first album. If you want something good go buy the *Nsync CD. It'a way better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Millenium, best album ever","review":"BSB is back with their third album (second in the U.S.) which is an excellent album. Here's a track by track review of it:1. Larger Than Life, 10/10: A song for the fans, it has a good rock sound.2. I Want It That Way, 10/10: Classic, excellent vocals by all of the boys.3. Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely, 10/10: Same as above.4. It's Gotta be You, 9/10: Great up-tempo song5. I Need You Tonight, 9/10: Nick's vocals are great on this one.6. Don't Want You Back, 9/10: Another great up-tempo song.7. Don't Wanna Lose You Now, 10/10: Excellent ballad.8. The One, 9/10: Great song9. Back To Your Heart, 10/10: Excellent ballad again.10. Spanish Eyes, 8/10: Great ballad.11. No One Else Comes Close, 9/10: A.J.'s vocals are great on that one.12. The Perfect Fan, 9/10: An ode to the moms written by Brian, great song, only Nick's vocals are missing.An excellent album overall, I'd recommend it to anyone who love god ballads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland-O-Rama","review":"I have enough heart to say that this album isn't a disaster, but even by a pure pop standard, \\"Millennium\\" falls short. The single \\"I Want it That Way\\" is definitely first-rate, with its memorable chorus and mid-tempo groove. The same can be said for the pleasant, if slightly cheesy, \\"Larger Than Life.\\" Elsewhere, things get patchy and the songs, for the most part, begin to sound the same. No doubt BSB are a halfway-decent singles boyband, but they have yet to make a consistent album. Will they ever? Time will reveal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backstreet boys review","review":"I have heard many cds in my lifetime, but none like this. This is the worst collection of no talent songs ever, and only shares value in screaming teenage girls who see nothing but the obvious visuals. I recommend no one buy this cd because of the no effort put in it. It is all about sex and no other matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bad joke","review":"New kids on the block part 2 no thank you.these guys can't carry a tone and are a bad joke.who is spending there money on these bums? they will never get any respect because they lack any real talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"mom","review":"I loved it and I'm a mother of one of their teeny bopper followers.My daughter played it for me thinking I would just roll my eyes,but they suprised me with the maturity and agility of their voices.I strongly reccomend this cd to all age groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst music I have ever heard","review":"This is horrible. How can anyone like this stuff? A bunch of guys with high pitch voices screaming at the top of their lungs isn't music. They don't even use real instruments. The songs all sound the same- singing about their mom, singing to their fans (mostly little girls). Yes, A.J. may or may not be \\"hot\\" but really, have you listened to their music lately??? Come on, quit now. It will be over in a couple of years. Start listening to some real music like Jimi Hendrix. That guy was an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Backstreet Boys EVER!!!!!","review":"I have been listening to this album almost non-stop since I bought it. My hat is off to the writers of the music and the lyrics. Their sound is so clean and polished. My favorite song on the album is \\"Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely\\", but I was not disappointed with any of the cuts. It's no wonder they are selling out their concerts in record time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BSB doesn't deserve to win the Viewers Choice Awards.. KORN!","review":"Okay you pimps and pimpettes! Grow Up man!! BSB can't even write their own songs, they don't play instruments!! if you want a real band.. Try Serial Joe and yes! KORN!! KORN KORN KORN KORN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first.","review":"Millennium is actually a pretty good album. I especially enjoyed \\"I Need You Tonight,\\" \\"Spanish Eyes,\\" and \\"Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely.\\" I feel stupid for liking the album because I'm not a screaming twelve year-old and I could care less what they look like, so I feel like I have no place in the BSB world. Once again though, the album is worth buying. It's better than the first one they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great!","review":"This is definetly one of the best pop albums of the year!Here are separate reviews of the best songs on this album. Larger Than Life- The best song on the album, it has a great beat and a good message. I Want It That Way- A pretty medium-tempo song Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely- a slow somewhat sad song. The One- A great medium tempo song, it ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Appropriately entitled","review":"MILLENIUM was the appropriate title for this album since it was released when the twentieth century was nearing the end(May 1999). Following the blockbusting self-titled debut 2 years earlier,this album spawned many hits for the Backstreet Boys. They are LARGER THAN LIFE,I WANT IT THAT WAY,SHOW ME THE MEANING OF BEING LONELY and THE ONE(not the Elton John-Bernie Taupin song). Around the beginning of 2000,SHOW ME THE MEANING OF BEING LONELY became a hit. The group's Jive Records labelmate Britney Spears became a hitmaker with her debut album released the same year as this one. The aforementioned hits were later recycled for 2001's THE HITS-CHAPTER ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet's better than ever!","review":"The Backstreet Boys are so hot on this album! This album is great!Larger Than Life Great song. The lyrics are great and the song is fast-beat. I Want It That Way That is a pretty slow song, but I still like it. It's pretty good. Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely I think this should be one of the number one hits in this album. The song is great. It isn't fast beat, but it is a great song. It's Gotta Be You Great Beat. I recommend it. I Need You Tonight Slow motion. But it's still a very good songFind the rest your self!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased!","review":"I'm an older fan and let me tell you that I love this CD. I did't understand what all the hype was about over \\"boy bands,\\" but when I heard MILLENNIUM I was very impressed; I had to buy a copy of my own. The guys have incredible voices and they use them beautifully. Now I have a lot of respect for the Backstreet Boys. My personal favorites are \\"Show Me the Meaning,\\" \\"Spanish Eyes,\\" and \\"Don't Want You Back,\\" but they're all great. I highly recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not the Best, but it is a really good Album!!","review":"This Album isn't the best, but it gives the best a run for their money. They really have a possible #1 album on their hands. The Backstreet Boys are Back and as far as I'm concerned better than ever. They go from slow ballads(ex. \\"Back to your Heart\\" and \\"Don't Want to Lose You Now\\") to Latin inspired beats (ex. \\"Spanish Eyes\\" and \\"Show Me the Meaning..\\") Then straight to in your face songs such as \\"Larger Than Life\\" and \\"Don't Want You Back\\". This is a very good album and whether you are a fan or aren't, this should be something for you to pick up, even though they do stick to their Pop/R&B roots!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I THINK THAT THE BOYZ HAVE OUT DONE THEIR SELVES","review":"CAN WE REALLY CALL THEM BOYS STILL? I THINK NOT I THINK THAT THIS CD SHOWS HOW THEY HAVE MATURED INTO THE MUSIC INDUSTRY OVER THE YEARS AND GIVES US ALL A PREVIEW OF WHAT IS TO COME IN THE NEW MILLINEUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we get yet ANOTHER slow song?","review":"The CD started out halfway interesting, the Daft Punk sample was pretty cool. The first track actually got my attention. Then track #2, which we all had heard before, was ok. Then the whole Cd went downhill. Not ONE good dance song after track 1. Good grief....at least I didn't pay for this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Irresistible","review":"All I can say is that the Backstreet Boys have proven that they have done it again and they are without a doubt the No.1 guy group in the world. Before BSB, I didn't like guy groups, but somehow, they put a move on my heart and mesmorized me with their absolutely to-die-for vocals, esp. my sweetheart, Nicky Gene Carter who has the sweetest smile and voice. (Justin Timberlake could never ever compare!) 'I Want It That Way' will definitely be an all-time favorite. I don't care what Anti-Bsb creeps have to say, the cutest Fab Five from Orlando, Florida rock!!(much better than N'Sync!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow up","review":"Like I've said before, to be so young and so successful, you need to have a look, and the Backstreet Boys have that down just right. They certainly aren't the only pop stars to use their look to create success- Elvis, The Beatles, Madonna (to name just a few) are guilty of this as well. However, what distinguishes them from the BBoys is the ability to grow and mature into legitimate artists with a wide range of artistic expression and musical influence. Do the BBoys have it in them to grow as well? Not likely. Enjoy the BBoys while you're young, because you won't be listening to them (I hope) after you turn 17."},{"rating":"2","title":"First CD I played as a DJ","review":"I DJ'd an 8th Grade Graduation Party on a Friday night at my old middle school and the first song I played was \\"Larger Than Life.\\" This CD was a good one to have a few months before the year 2000. \\"I Want it That Way\\" is a good song as well. If you are a fan of pop music in the 90s, go for this CD, if not you can pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, You call this music?","review":"Ok, 5 guys who have some potential are completly drowning in the same tired melodies over and over again. I think if the boys could try a new melody and some lyrics they actually understand, they might be ok. But in this album, you've got a bunch of guys singing about somebody else's life and dancing to gain the attention of America's girls betweeen 8 & 15. If you want to have an album that all of us will love, play your instruments, write your music, and take the focus off your looks. Overrated? I think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mega commercial heartbreakers","review":"The typical profile of their fans must be 14-year old girls desperately in love with at least one of the members. How disappointed they'll be. This is not music for me. This is just as commercial as music can be. Hence the music is transformed into a substitute for anything. Try listening to some real music like Marvin Gaye , The Commodores with Lionel Richie, Bee Gees, Jonathan Butler or Barry White. These are at least, great musicians, producers or singers. How often do you hear Spice Girls on the radio in these days? BSB will certainly also be forgotten in two years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teen trap","review":"These guys use catchy melodies and lyrics that touch the hearts of anyone that's lyrically challenged to suck money from teens and their parents. Most of the bboys fans that hate me now will understand my point in a few years. Fans--- find music that can feed your brain, not music that will feed your heart and hormones only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamer than life","review":"This CD is for losers. It has almost no sound and has no power, aggression or variety. It only talks about love, that's it. Come on, heavy metal talks about a variety of different topics. Give rock a chance before you spend your money on this total waste of plastic. Believe me, this album is NOT recommended. Try Slayer or Metallica or something with power instead, okay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no talent","review":"anyone can sing but to play and sing at the same time is something the bsb can't do,this requires talent something the bsb do not have.ths cd has songs on one subject only where is the diverse writing skills.you can't progress musically if you don't play,look at new kids on the block,boyz to men,and nsync bands with no music ability.i suggest listening to led zeppelin a group who actually made their own music and it is still being played and will still be played when we are gone and when are chidren are gone too.bsb won't even be remembered.just look at the reviews of any any led zeppelin cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"not quite...","review":"Ok, so I may not be a huge Backstreet Boys fan - but I've got two step-sisters who listen to this album constantly and I have to admit some of the tunes got stuck in my head. The Boys, to be fair, do the up-beat, up-tempo tracks pretty well, perhaps better than most of the other boy-bands out there, and Larger Than Life probably is the best of the bunch. On the other hand, they are not so adept at tackling the slower, slushy numbers. These tended to be plaintive at best, but at worst pathetic. The lyrics are just awful! In all, the album's good if you can fast forward through the ballads, but there are too many of them to save Millennium from getting any more than two stars from me. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth","review":"I am certainly not the one to dismiss this album as a stupid, teeny-bopper, air-headed album. But in all honesty, all their songs seem to be slight variations from the previous ones. I give them credit for being great performers, but the lyrics are so neurotically simple that I can never get into their songs. They are simply a fad that will go the way of NKOTB."},{"rating":"2","title":"bsb rule","review":"this cd rules and i don't care what other people say this cd has slow and fast songs. i would recomend this cd to anyone that loves the backstreet boys or anyone who just likes great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Keeps Getting Better!","review":"I'm 18, male and still completely love this CD! I've been a fan of the Backstreet Boys for quite a while now. I have every one of thier albums(CD's), and so far this is the best. I really liked the fact that they all had a chance to sing in just about every song. The harmonies in the ballads and in the up-tempo songs is unmatched. I think that we still have much to see from these guys. My new favorite song quickly became \\" I'll be The One \\". I am quite anxiouly awaiting thier new CD. This CD is a must have for anyone who enjoys good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah right!","review":"My best word of advice, don't go near it. If you want to listen to sappy, all-identical songs with not one ounce of originality or authenticity, go right ahead, be my guest. But so you know, this CD doesn't deserve the one star I gave it, and if it were possible I would give it less,much much less. Every song is the same,whining and not one song has areal instrument in it, so if you still want it go ahead but I wouldn't advise it"},{"rating":"1","title":"KEEP ON SWALLOWING THIS GARBAGE !!!!","review":"BACKSTREET BOYS thanks you all for buying souless music massively supported by marketing. This CD is nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much different from their last one.","review":"I was a huge BSB fan for a long time, but they are really starting to get boring. When I bought this CD I expected something a little different, maybe more R&B or something like that. But what it is is mostly ballads, with a few recycled dance songs thrown in. Overall, nothing original, save your fifteen bucks and go buy Red Hot Chili Peppers 'Californication' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best, but mostly mediocore for the high price.","review":"Honestly! I know this may be offensive to BSB fans but honestly, when the craze has worn off you will be able to understand(I used to be a teen-ager and had my crazes too). I believe that it is mostly psychological why the Backstreet Boys are so popular. I believe marketing tactics and glossy art work as well as fairly hansome faces are the driving force behind the BSB craze(that is what sold me on the cd. It always works but now I feel that I need to speak objectively since the record company has elected to take advantage of BSB fans by pumping up the price far more than these boys are worth).At best this album rates average with \\"The Perfect Fan\\" being perhaps the most emotive and thought-provoking song. \\"Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely\\" does show some sense of maturity. \\"Larger Than Life\\" is a rollercoaster ride and very much rates high for it's infectious and exciting blend of rock and pop but still..."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought the New Kids on The Block sucked...","review":"This CD (and believe me, I heard enough of it to know exactly what I'm talking about) was created by a record company executive to prey on the pocket books of young girls whose minds haven't developed fully and who don't know any better. (p.s. 1 star is the lowest rating I'm alowed to give. Truthfully, it doesn't deserve any stars at all)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!","review":"Definately,one of my favorite CDs. This is an amazing work by some truly talented guys who work hard(and who are also much talented then that OTHER group 'N Stink.) Don't get me wrong. I like some of 'N Stink's songs. But any mature person would know that Backstreet boys are MUCH better. So is 98 degrees. People that say they don't write their own songs don't know what they're talking about,because they do and are involved in a lot of the production. People need to get their facts straight before they trash on people. \\"I Want It That Way\\" is one of the best radio hits ever. \\"The One\\" is equally fantastic. \\"Back To Your Heart\\" s very beautiful and I wish it would be released as a single. So,if you're one of the maybe five people in the country that do not have this,it will not be disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must say that this album was pretty much what I expected.","review":"And.. I love it. The songs were much more mature than anything they have had out yet. Everyone sings lead in almost all the songs and even this is a good thing. They all sound superb. AJ couldn't have improved from the last album, but somehow he did and Nick gets the \\"Most Improved Player\\" award. I love this album and am looking forward to learning every single word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Millennium Exploding","review":"I love this Cd! It shows their talents! They have grown as musicians and a unity as one but, yet indiviuals still! Howie and Kevin get to show their beatuiful voices as well as Kevin and Brian write on this CD!

There's a reason why no one anywhere listens to New Kids On The Block and never will again - because it's worthless. These bands are destined to fade into the background of music history, obscured somewhere in disco's lost shadow. This is a band that exhibits not one single unique quality, shred of thought, or ounce of musical ingeniuity.

I do find it funny however, when girls tell me that they will always be fans of this teeny bop crap.

It's the hottest boy band alive!","review":"I discovered BSB in 7th grade and I can't get enough! On the day Millennium came out, my class was on a feild trip and I had the wait the next day to get it. I like \\"I want it that way\\" the best because you get to hear a each boy's voice at least once. The cover has awsome pictures of all of them with their faovrite element: Nick-water, Brian-sky, AJ-sun, Howie-fire, and Kevin-steel. I listen to this every day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting new collection of songs!","review":"I was introduced to BSB original album last year by my now 7-year old son. He loves different kinds of music and is especially excited by BSB. He knows the words to most of the songs and dances to the wonderful rythms.

Yuck! Nasty! Gross! Help Me! Bleh!","review":"I got stuck listening to this CD on a long distance trip with my so-called friend. It is SOOOOO bad! The only reason it even deserves a star is because I could halfway tolerate \\"I Want it That Way\\" for the first BILLION times it was played, but the radio stations and TV channels play it every 5 minutes! It was overplayed and I hate that song now! The album as a whole sucks! The songs are all the same as their other songs: STUPID! People seem to like them for the way they look and all, but I think it's funny that the ugliest looking one (AJ) is the only one who has the best voice. (and that's not saying much) For a real BAND (as in someone who actually writes their own songs and plays instruments too), listen to Supergrass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I WISH I COULD GIVE IT 100 STARS!!!!!","review":"I loved this CD!!!!!! I am a HUGE fan of BSB. I liked this CD better than their Debut CD. I LOVE the song \\"I Need You Tonight\\" sung by Nick Carter! He is, of corse, my fave Backstreet Boy.

It dipicts so much emotion that I've cried... (And I'm getting a little too emotional...) But what I'm telling all of you, this album is very good.

They've matured since the last cd, which was truly exceptional as far as catchy, melodic, sing-along tunes go, but MILLENIUM offers the true fan a bigger dose of what is making these cleancut, adorably great guys so successful. I'm 33 and not ashamed to say: I LOVE THE BACKSTREET BOYS! Keep on entertaining us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Show me the meaning of a waste of money.","review":"Okay, so they had a massive radio hit with \\"I Want It That Way.\\" Have you listened to the lyrics of this song? It's obvious English is a second language for the writer of the song. You want what what way? Right.The wrong mix of \\"Larger Than Life\\" is here. This one is too thin. There's no thump to it. Should have included the \\"Video Mix\\" which is available on import. The words are kinda cheesy, but it's got a great beat and an interesting arrangement, despite the clutter of the crowd noise.Aside from that, the CD is junk. I know, I know, it's for little kiddies who haven't grown to appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into the art. BSB need to keep it real on the next album. Kill the whiny synths. Get some real drums, piano, and some nice guitar work. More organic, earthier. And work on the vocals, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy Bands..","review":"The only song I can stand on this album is \\"Larger Than Life\\", for its upbeat, get-you-dancing mood. Don't waste your money on this CD if you're looking for something with quality and variety. I myself would recommend going to any 3rd party MP3 site and taking advantage of the record company by downloading the CD, rather than paying 16.95 for it. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's awesome, definitely better than the first!","review":"I have both CD's, and this one just shows the maturity of the guys. I'm a 20 year old male, so this is not just music for crazed teenage girls. BSB is awesome, and I look foward to hearing from them in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this cd is fresh and fun to listen to.","review":"The title Millenium implies that this is music for the future. The songs Larger than life and I want it that way are truly as dynamic and innovative as the culture of the new millenium promises to be. As the past has shown, the Backstreet Boys are incredible at blending each individual voice into one multi-faceted yet intricately intermingled voice. Listening to this cd is quite enjoyble."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Have Come Out Of The Closet","review":"For someone who loves deep music like Sarah McLachlan and Alanis Morissette, I must say that I was BLOWN AWAY by this album. I've heard (but never purchased) their earlier albums, and I thought they were just a bunch of good-looking manufactured guys. However, after listening to this album, that image has all gone. I can actually relate to \\"Don't Want To Lose You Now\\" and I find this album very deep. The quality of their voices has vastly improved! Way to go! A great album that should reach out to a broader audience. I have come out of the Backstreet Boys closet, but I won't be buying their earlier work. Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One word, Sucks !!!","review":"To all of you BSB lovers out there, you only like them because their hot and not for their music possibly because their music sucks.

At least not is this country. How are pre-teens living off of a parent's weekly allowance going to afford a CD with a list price of $18? Singles are only $1.50 to $3.00 each. Is this band so greedy they don't care about their biggest fans anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You have my pity","review":"To all the the little girls who are too blind and narrow-minded to see that this, as well as almost any other pop record out there, is nothing but meaningless drivel falling out of cute (but amazingly shallow) mouths and who are unable to open yourself and your mind to meaningful music, have my pity. I want you to know that you are missing out on so much beautiful music by settling for this schlock. I beg you, for your sake, that you stop listening to this and pick up a record from some real musicians like Radiohead, The Doors, Pink Floyd, Portishead, and even some classical stuff. Until then, you have my pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"May I say Baaaaaarf?","review":"I am so disgusted with this type of music, the so-called 'boys bands.' To begin with these talentless morons are not bands (they wouldn't know how to play the maraccas) and their voices (or as their legions of brainless fans call them 'harmonies') are simply the product of computer programing and studio work. I can't believe that this trash has found such a lofty place in American culture. When they first came out they were 'cute' but please! People, buy yourselves a brain or some taste! My tasteless little sister played this album until she had a brain concusion. This is garbage, God I just wanna barf."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want it my way","review":"Their cd is good dance music, if you happen to like it.

I don't care for boybands, only a couple of them have anything to offer a person with any developed music tastes. This album sounds like it had the effort of a couple of people on keyboards jamming for a week. Nothing new, just flashy images. Gave it an extra star though because it kept a couple of nine year olds shut up for an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated","review":"the songs r ok---not so nice yet does not deserve to be hits because the songs lack emotions--very superficial sorry for all boybands lovers for this frank comment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music... some songs i dont like though","review":"Like all CD's theres some songs on this album i dont like personally... but there are only 1 or 2. the sound qualitly is great and i luv the song 'the perfect fan' along w/ \\"show me the meaning of being lonely\\" those are my 2 favs on this album. overall its a good album and shows they have evolded since their 1st CD relased to the US"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"I didn't really care for their last album. The song \\"Everybody\\" really got on my nerves! But, the Millenium album has really made me a fan.

It shows how much the group loves and appreciates their moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet Boys helped me a lot.","review":"If you like slow stuff you should buy this cd. The beat and songs sound really similar. The songs are great to get your girlfriend into making-out with you but it is not really the cd to listen to by yourself. However, the final song, perfect fan, was a good dedication to their moms and I think the singers show a lot of class by doing that. Larger than Life was probably my favorite because the beat was a lot higher and stronger, mostly different from the other songs. Overally it is a good cd for a dance or a party but not for a cd player unless you are sharing it with your girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than the Rest","review":"I have 6 other BsB CDs (Backstreets Back) (Backstreet Boys IMPORT) Backstreet Boys ECD) (Everybody single) (INBYH) (and PoP Reviews BsB) This one tops them all the songs have so much meaning love and life to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! If you weren't a fan before, this CD might convince you","review":"I have to admit that I wasn't a big fan of the Backstreet Boys before, but Millennium has changed my opinion! It's definitely a step up from the last CD. It shows that the Backstreet Boys do have talent and have matured quite a bit. I think this CD will appeal to a wider audience, not just swooning 12 year old girls (I'm 25 and I love it). It has something for everyone. If you're thinking about buying it, do it. You won't be sorry. It's incredible!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic album","review":"I'd like to share my point of view with all the BSBfan in all over the world.

Exe:N'Synk, Five ect. Some people say that people like me are jelous of them. Untrue. Girls like Fred Derst, and I don't care, I am a fan of Limp Bizkit, but what gets me mad is that the Backstreet Boys are getting by on their looks, and despite total lack of talent, they make millions of dollars, and sell out huge venues, while there are many unsigned bands out there with plenty of talent trying to make it in the music industry, but aren't. If you want to, take my advice, and avoid Millenium at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD EVER","review":"I love the Back Street Boys, and the last CD was good, but i thought this CD was ALOT better than the first.

Well all i have to say is buy this CD and support the BackStreet Boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A word from CANADA","review":"Well I heard the cd. It's pretty good.

I recommend everybody go get \\"Millennium\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run for the hills!","review":"For some odd reason my friend bought this cd, and told me to listen to it. I did, song after excruciating song. I thought music was going downhill when the Spice Girls arrived, but this pallid and lame pop is even worse. The boys may have competent singing voices, but this album has absolutely no variety, all the songs deal repetitively with gooey b.s. like \\"Oh why is love so hard!\\" or \\"Girl, you know you want me!\\" (Not actual lyrics) Avoid this musical rubbish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD ever by a pop group","review":"This is a great cd, i could listen to it a 100 times and not get sick of it!

When all of the teenage girls who buy this grow up they will be a distant memory. (New Kids on the Block, Menudo, Shawn Cassidy, etc.) My advice to them is to invest their money wisely because it will be gone soon. Saying this is music is like saying Velveeta is cheese and Spam is meat. Technically it is, but not really. Do yourself a favor, open up your mind, buy Dave Matthews, Metallica, Bob Marley, (people who actually write their songs and get this: Play instruments too!!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try","review":"I listened to this album just to see what it was like. It was a very long 20 minutes. I don't think that it is really the groups fault. Unfortunately they sing a type of music that is very easily manufactured. What this means that competing record companies will have a group like them coming up. What this does to their music is ruins it. There is only so much that you can do with pop music. In order for them to succeed they need to bring something to the table on their next album, that the other 100 boy groups don't have."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GROUP IS WACK!!!!!","review":"Once again they have made a wannabe soulful CD. I don't know what they are trying to accomplish but I wish they would give it up. Their songs are weak and don't really say much. Basically they appear to be trying to sound like something their not. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY GAWD!!!","review":"This is such a cool CD!!! I Want It That Way is my favorite song and I love Larger Than Life!

Things to look out for:1. Brian's and Kevin's attempts a composing ( Give them a BIG HAND!!!!)2. Kevin's singing3. Their dedications to their moms in \\" The Perfect Fan\\"Basically,this album is worth your money!! Better save up some more cash 'coz u are gonna wear this CD out by listening to it too many times and you have to buy another one!!! :) BACKSTREET RULZ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG STEP","review":"The boys have really come out with their new album and captured many more new fans, including the guys.

I love these guys so much, and I thinkit is great what Brian did for his mom. Nick's cute, and A.J is FINE!!! Howie's cool, and Kevin has a great voice. All you guys out there who haven't gotten this CD yet, get it! It's well worth it. I'm also a 'N sync and 98 degrees fan, and I think they all have a lot of talent and are putting it to good use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter the Millenium with MILLENIUM!","review":"This CD is like a new beginning for the Backstreet Boys. They have refined their voices even though they were great before. The songs on this album are really a part of them and they put a lot of wotk into their music. They are hot, talented guys that definitely deserve some credit for doing what they love to do as well as making other people smile.This album has great listening music on it including slow songs as well as upbeat ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks doesn't make good music","review":"The only reason that people liked them because of their looks, they care less about the music. Video Game music is a lot better than this music.If The Backstreet Boys are fat and old, No one will ever listen to them in the first place. Thats what wrong with music today. People care more about what they look like than the music itself.I always hear \\"They're so hot!\\" from a couple of teenage girls. WHOCARES, WHAT ABOUT THE FREAKING MUSIC MAN! IS THAT IMPORTANT?Long time ago, this is an true story. I've dated ab girl who is an pretty person. But she break my heart.Don't judge a person what they look like. Thats just plain wrong. We listen to the music because of the music. Gezzzzz... whats this world coming to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD makes them \\"Larger Than Life\\"!","review":"I was looking at these reviews, and I was pleasantly shocked to see not only girls, but guys and even older people thought this CD was just as phat as I did! That just proves they're too hot for the title \\"boy band\\" cause this album proves they're really men now! This will prove to the world we're not all swooning 12 and 13 year old girls, that they're really respected musicians! I've never liked every single track on a CD before, and I thought I never would, but Millenium just proved me wrong! More mature sound but still with a little of the sugar-coated stuff that without it, it wouldn't be the BSB. From the sweet ballads like \\"Back to Your Heart\\" and \\"Spanish Eyes\\" to the edgier funkier songs like \\"Don't Want You Back\\" and \\"Larger Than Life\\", this is an album that will appeal to everyone and every taste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The music is all the same. All desperate sounding songs that the backstreet boys didnt write. They are just another manufactured boy band. Same stuff. It lacks heart and real meaning. All it is is like \\"i need you\\" or \\"Come to me\\" kind of unrealistic stuff. As for the album name,\\"millenium?\\" that has nothing to do with the concept of the CD. Sounds like their just trying to cash in on the millenium thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I think this album is awesome.

There mixture of fast, slow, and out of this world crazy songs (for example Larger Than Life) keep you dancing and singing till you reliaze the CD has stopped an hour ago and you just hit the play botton again and possibly the repeat button. Basically you will be rocken with these guys so much that you won't believe that you never thought they were that great. Oh and the way they put a out of this world crazy song at the beginning you know you are NOT gonna stop this CD from playing. The way they make you get out of that bad mode of yours and make you just forgive the person that was rude and put the past behind and throw a party. Anyway that is how I feel. Maybe you should borrow the CD from a friend first than tell me what you think. Is this CD out of this world?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that this Cd is the best yet from BSB they rock","review":"On this cd the backstreet boys show there real talent and they show that they have grown musicaly this cd is the best yet from them and Im sure that there will be more coming from them in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, go away!","review":"This is the cheesiest stuff I have ever heard. Repetitive, monotonous, droll, saccharine, etc. I hope to God that these guys fade away in the music scene along with N-Sync, 98 Degrees, etc. But obviously it won't be any time soon. So if you like this stuff, don't let my negative review keep you from buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets annoying","review":"There has been so much hype about the CD but when you hear it, it's a total let down. All the songs are slow besides maybe two and they all sound exactly the same. \\"I Want It That Way\\" and \\"Larger Than Life\\" are basically the only two singles they probably can come up with off \\"Millenium.\\" My hopes were up to listen to it, but now I feel kinda stupid that I paid to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"an alright effort","review":"i got this cd on the 1st day it was released but i am pretty disappointed. The song \\"I want it that way\\" and the boys vocal are the only good things about the album. The rest of the album sounds alright when u first listening to it but don't really make u want to listen to them again. The lyrics are very stupid as well (esp .Larger than life and Spanish eyes) There are very few hits in this album compare to the last one as well. My advice is to wait and buy the cd singles only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best","review":"Despite recent record sales for NSYNC's NSA album, I, and many other critics, musicians, and fans think that The Backstreet Boys \\"Millennium\\" Album surpasses them all. This peice of work truly defines who they are, and where the rank in the rather large music industry. RIGHT AT THE TOP! Between great ballads, and happy lift-me-up songs, the truly re-difine the meaning of Pop Music. They have grown as induviduals, and as a group so much seince the last album. They are finally getting the credit they deserve for all the hard work and many hours they have put into their craft. I can't wait for the next album, because if it's anything like Millenium, it's gonna blow EVERYONE away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet heaven!","review":"This is an awsome Cd!

Was I wrong or what! 'N Sync's songs would get a little boring after a while but the BSB's would stay fresh. Their songs are so heartfelt and go way beyond the words. My favorite song is \\" I Want It That Way\\", but there isn't a single song you will need to skip over. I also think it's really neat that these guys who are known worldwide have enough love for their moms to write them a song on their album(The Perfect Fan) The song \\"Larger Than Life\\" shows how much they appreciate their fans. Oh yeah, And in comparison 'N Sync 's new album cannot even come close. It really seems like they tried to copy the BSB, but they're obviously number two. Well, as you can see THE BACKSTREET BOYS ROCK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Backstreet Boys?","review":"These \\"musicians\\" (if you could call them that) should not be allowed to record music. They must lip sync everything. They're basic purpose is to sell millions of CD's to teenage girls. BSB don't care about music at all! If you ask any one of their fans, the girl(obviously) would say: \\"Oh my gosh, because they're so hot!\\" Backstreet Boys' 15 minutes of fame is way over. Am I the only one who knows that?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst album EVER","review":"Wow. I had no idea that an album could be this bad. The songs have no meaning whatsoever, they didn't write the songs they sing thus they aren't expressing any emotions or opinions. Total bubblegum music (music that's main sales are from kids below the age of 18 or girls). I'm not sure why anyone would be looking at buying this album. It's horendous, mind-boggling. I have no words to describe how corny this \\"band\\" is. Yes, their voices sound good if you like that kind of sining, but that's not why their records sell, plenty of other artists have great voices and few of them are what the backstreet boys are, popularity wise. However, (thank god almighty) they aren't popular anymore. Instead, a band who might be even WORSE is leading the way for pop music, Nsync. Please, help me and others who can't stand these kinds of bands. Put Nirvana and Greenday and Weezer and the Smashing Pumpkins back atop the charts. Let's have another grunge explosion, PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not real music!","review":"Okay, if you are into the Backstreet Boys and are a seven year old girl then you don't know real music, but if you are thirteen and listen to these repetitive love songs then you obviously have no mind of your own. Each song is basically the same with no meaning except that want some girl or shes \\"breaking their heart\\", who honestly cares about that kind of stuff? May I suggest something that at least pertains to a real persons life like Ani Difranco, Heather Nova, or Kate Bush. They at least know how to sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEN WILL IT END?","review":"This album by the backstreet boys is absolute garbage.This is the type of manufactured commercial garbage that pollutes the air waves on a daily basis.I dont understand why anyone would like them.They are downright corny and cheesy.Anyone with half a brain would see through their fakeness and see that all they want is money.This album doesnt contain even one good song and all the songs sound the same.Their singing is terrible and uninspired.If you want real music then listen to Iron Maiden,Sepultura or Black Sabbath.HEAVY METAL RULES FOREVER!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"commercialism?","review":"Just advice, no offence to those who like this...This is very pretty and clean and sung nicely... but thats what I don't like about it. Where's the harsh, bitter edge - the emotion sounds rehearsed. If you want a song that really involves emotion, listen to a band that feel that emotion in their lives, not just during the recording of the particular song. Try listening to a band like Type O Negative. They may not be \`number 1' or whatever, but that is a band who are very upset, depressed and sad... who better to write music with such emotion?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubblegum retread of New Kids....","review":"Kid's stuff.This isn't real soul or even dance music.They pretend to be funky or even soulful,but they're still in the Mickey Mouse club.How are they any different than New Kids on the Block anyway??

Backstreet's sophomore album will definitely show die-hard fans and critics alike that the Boys of Backstreet really do have an awesome amount of talent and potential. With heart-felt ballads like the chilling \\"Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely\\" and the poignant \\"I Need You Tonight\\", Backstreet's talent as an r and b group is unsurpassed. However the faster dance songs, \\"I Want It That Way\\" and \\"Don't Want You Back\\" also reveal that they have not lost the pop talent they showed on thier debut cd. Combine these factors that many of the songs (\\"Back to Your Heart\\", \\"The Perfect Fan\\") were actually written by the Boys and you know that Backstreet is here to stay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the greatest CD of all times!!!","review":"The songs are great, the voices are great, and the boys are great too!!! you will never listen to something even better. It's the best CD ever!!!! I LOVE THE BOYS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You must buy Millenium form the BSB!","review":"This is a very cool album from the BSB. They have a mix of different types of music such as the slow melody ones and the more upbeat ones. Slower soothing songs are \\"Back to your Heart\\" written by Kevin and \\"No One Else Comes Close\\" and \\"I Need You Tonight\\" which was mostly sung by Nick's sweet voice. The faster songs are \\"Larger Than Life\\" ,which is a song co-written by Brian and is a song dedicated to the BSB fans, \\"Don't Want you Back\\",\\"It's Gotta Be You\\",and \\"The One\\".Those songs you can play over and over again and never get sick of it.It also has the famous No.1 hit \\"I want It That Way\\". \\"The Perfect fan\\" is another sweet song written by Brian dedicated to his mom.Aawww... how sweet of Brian.It's a great album to get for Mother's Day to play that song for her which can show our love for our mothers. P.S The BSB sure can swoon anyone with their oh so sweet voices that harmonizes so well together.Hope You will all enjoy the album as much as I did! BSB 4EVA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Millenium","review":"I think this album has no diference in the old one. Their voices have not impoved and their voices dont work together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but i don't dig it","review":"O.K i've listened to the CD and I almost fell asleep. Slow after slow same old same old they are doing the same music over and over again. there is no evolution in their music at all. If anybody got to listen the Backstreet back CD(canadian version) it is the same stuff as Millenium. The version of INTY is much better live than on the CD. I think BSB should spend less time whining on national T.V.about other boybands cause they look pretty pathetic when they do that and spend more time on their music cause it's suffering from some real originality. Bottom line if you need something that is deeper and edgier and that can make you dance avoid this CD at all cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Upbeat Songs - Great Sound Track","review":"Although some people think this album is too 'cutsie' it has great vocals and good background music. Very up-beat.It has many major songs on it (all hits) -- not just one or two. If you love modern Disco music this is a must as well as Venga Boys and 'n Sync."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"i liked it when it first came out, they did a bad job of covering joe's song \\"no one else comes close\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is Larger Than Life!","review":"I'm not much of a Boy Band fan, and I generally have little respect for cheap 90s pop. But this is some of the best damn music I've ever heard! I don't care if the Backstreet Boys don't write their own music, and I don't care how much their voices are electronically tweaked - these are extremely well-written and well-performed songs. \\"Larger Than Life\\" is single-handedly worth this CD's weight in gold, and its musical perfection is proven by the numerous amateur music videos based on it.Not every song on it is great, and I don't particularly like the performers, but it's a damn good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The First","review":"The Backstreet Boys have grown some. Their music has some age to it. The first album was wonderful, but this one is better. Growing up with and being a big fan of New Kids On The Block, I have to say the Backstreet Boys have topped all the \\"boy groups\\" that have come out or is out. WAY TO GO GUYS!!! You have topped your last album and got past the sophmore album syndrome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backstreet Boys suck alright","review":"Well then... I have heard about every song on this album due to practically it seems like a video for every song and all those 10 year old girls who's whole life is based on listening to backstreet boys and collecting photo's of the group and posting them on there wall and sorry to say, this album is really bad. Don't people ever get sick of songs? I mean I have heard the songs about a million times before and I don't even own the CD! check out other bands like superdrag and phantom planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"BACKSTREET BOYS ARE MEDIOCRE AT BEST.","review":"The dirty blond lead singer (don't know his name) is wasted in this group. With such fabulous vocals he should be out on his own. The group is mediocre at best with run of the mill ballads, and pop tunes, all I can say is boring. They are the strongest of the male groups, no doubt that is why I give it 2 instead oF 1 stars. The likes of N Sync, 98 Degrees, and Five will fade fast. What keeps the Backstreet Boys alive is vocals and personality. Otherwise this is just another stale mate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"When I really started getting into pop music, this was the first cd i bought. I listened to it for two months straight - nothing else. So what kind of a cd does it have to be to be good enough to be able to listen to it for that long without a break? Also, this is definitely the best Backstreet cd. If you want to get a Backstreet Boys cd, this should be the first one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"Okay, first of all, I USED to really like the Backstreet Boys, but I do not like this cd. I'll admit at first it was okay, but I'm so sick of it. All the songs sound the same. Nick is always flat, so he never blends. Some of their songs sound like they've tried to cover up the vocals with the background music. Honestly, if I try to listen to this cd I get a headache. It isn't as great as some people say. Even when I was a diehard fan of the BSB, it wasn't great. I'm not trying to be rude, but unless you're either tone deaf or don't care what you're listening to, you probably won't like this cd. Just stick with the singles 'cause those are the only things worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...","review":"I have never in my life heard such horrible music...when i first bought this cd i thought it was ok, then after listening to it about 3 or 4 more times i started to hate it! It isnt like most people that buy the Backstreet Boys albums like the music, they are just 5 more pretty faces to go down in music history just for their looks. One word....Talentless, especially the little blonde one, he sounds like a transvestite that has taken waaaay too many steroids, and the oldest one with the gaotee, i think his name is Kevin, what is he doing in the band any way? his voice is so flat, he is a horrible singer. So...now that I know ive offended most, if not all BSB fans, i think ill move along, just one word of advice....Dont buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say...BAD street boys!!","review":"I understand that there a lot of people out there that like the backstreet boys, but I am not one of them!! I personally think that the backstreet boys are pure garbage!! I'm practically trying to give away my cd's!!! HORIBBLE!!!! They are a bad influence to our young society!!! They are putting bad vibes into our world!! STOP THE MADNESS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok.... for a boyband","review":"Let me start off by saying the Backstreet Boys are alright musicians. 2/3 of them can sing, whereas the rest sound like screechng cats. However, in my opinion Millenium has too many slow songs, for my liking. Precisely 8 out of 12. More than half. \\" Show me the meaning of being Lonely\\" is too depressing, Larger than Life was the best song on the album, until it got played out by MTV. My favorite songs are \\"Gotta be You\\" and for a slow song, \\" No One Else Comes Close\\". But, millions of prepubescent girls probaly disagree with me, and thats fine. I'll just keep listening to their first album instead, and pull out Millenium when I'm in a bad mood, and need a good laugh, all I have to do is think of Nick's prepubescent voice singing \\"I'm your bad boy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"this really puts a damper on the musical revolution that took place in the 60's. Did we learn nothing. Why are people like this singing music, they should be on sope's cause they sure as hell don't have any musical talent.If we've learned one thing from our parents it has to be what good music is. The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, John Lennon, The Stones. Those are musicians that can write and play their own damn music. The backstreet boys will be forgotten in about a year or so. To quote the late great John Lennon, \\"your voice is muzak to my ears.\\" Kids do me a favor and don't buy this, try and make your life a little richer, and buy The White Album, cause this is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Backstreet boys are full of themselves.","review":"Basically, the whole CD is about how many fans they have"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do we really need more of this stuff?","review":"Oh mother of music, please release my world from this musical funk youve put us in. We are sent countless crap. Its piling up quick. No Limit, korn, limp B., ricky m., and these guys are right in the middle of it. My list of crap could go on forever. THese guys have nothing to say. They get on stage and do their synchronized dance moves and so on. Theyre songs have very mediocre lyrics. Its all love bull. The majority of theyre fans wont have much to say about the music element of these guys. They usually say something about how they look. Any speaking of theyre artistic element usually is something like, \\"It has a good beat.\\" Anyone who agrees or disagrees with me feel free to email me. But please stay respectfull."},{"rating":"1","title":"It all sounds the same... probably because it IS! $$$!","review":"The backstreet boys music is irritating.

Whatever happened to music that MEANT something? These guys are all about money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Want It This Way","review":"This CD was much better than I expected. Though, it does have its low points, the last few songs aren't very good, this is a good sophmore album from the BSB. The best song is definitely the Grammy nominated I Want It That Way. Other good ones include Larger than Life, Show Me the Meaning of Being, It's Gotta Be You, and The One. All in all, this is a good CD that proves why BSB are the number 1 boy band."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSB STILL GOT IT GOIN ON","review":"In my opinion I think BSB is still the best Pop group ever. For the past years they've prove not only to their fans but also to the media that they're not just a bunch of good looking guys being put together and being manufactured, but they've prove that they've got talents. And for the past years they've also grown from backstreet boys to backstreet men. And their Millenium album proves that, because most of their songs from this album can relate to anyone. BSB might not be the record holder for selling an album for its first week release but they are a talented group and THEY'VE STILL GOT IT GOIN ON. KEEP THE BACKSTREET BOYS PRIDE ALIVE.....KRISSY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borennium!","review":"This has got to be the biggest piece of rubbish I ever made eye contact with in all of my life!

Can someone please show them the meaning of rejection? No one else comes closer to plagiarizing trash like these boys. I'm begging you, don't buy this CD, and don't buy any of the other works from N' Sync, 98 Degrees, etc. They've gotta get right out of town! \\"I WANT IT THAT WAY!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"old news","review":"I think backstreet boys are getting old.

I must admit I am more impressed with 'N Sync's new dance-heavy album... Hopefully BSB will take a step up with the next album and break from their fluffy style. Its way too sugary... I'm disappointed with the entire album, save one or two songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"prefabricated pop songs without a soul","review":"I think Millenium included only 2 pretty good songs: I Want It That Way and Larger Than Life. It was really hard for me to keep the melody of any other song of Millenium in my head for more than five seconds.The only thing the Backstreet Boys bring with this album is prefabricated pop songs without a soul. They didn't take any risks musically. They just did what we can expect from them. Also, The Backstreet Boys just co-wrote 4 songs out of 12 on Millenium. They are not writers like Hanson, another band who also has a young audience.I suggest you to buy \\"The Soft Bulletin\\" by the Flaming Lips instead of Millenium. The Soft Bulletin is probably the best pop album I heard last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like all guys and girls in the late ninetys early thou's...","review":"i liked to jam this music.

I actually can't believe i wasted those new millenium hours listening to this millenium CD ( wow.. cd name is millenium too.. wow.....? ) relaly though, there are only maybe 2 songs on here worth listening to once or twice then the CD should gather a few inches of dust and wait for you to listen to it again some time... a few years later"},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Terrible","review":"If possible, I would tell Nick and his buddies that they were wasting their time, and anybody who listens to them is also wasting their time. That is all I want and need to say about the Backstreet Boys, and don't go out buying a different album than this one I'm reviewing(Millenium), because that too would be a waste of time, and also money.Just think about all the other things you might have or that companies would be making if it wasn't for all the plastic used for the CD cases, the paper used for the lyrics sheets, and all the materials of the CD itslef of this dreadful and pitiful artist. Seriously, think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?","review":"Okay, just to start off with, I was one of the biggest Backstreet Boys fans until this album came out. After the brilliant Backstreet Boys, then they got better with Backstreet's Back. I was expecting this CD, Millennium, to blow me away, and the rest of world too. The rest of the world was, but I was disappointed. The whole thing is filled with boring ballads, like Show me the meaning, I need you tonight, Don't wanna lose you now, Back to your heart, Spanish Eyes, no one else comes close and Perfect Fan. There are a few mediocre up beat tracks, like Gotta be You and Don't want you back, but the best tracks on the whole CD are I want it that way and The One. If you have the Australian version like I do, the bonus track You wrote the book on love is okay, but the other one, I'll be there for you, is the most deadly boring song I have ever heard. It's worse that the whole load of garbage on the CD. What happened to the awesome stuff they pumped out in 1997? ... ."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSB Rock !","review":"My 12 year old daughter received this CD for her birthday last year. When my 5 year old son heard the CD only a few months ago, it became the household favorite ! We take it with us in the car, on vacation and really \\"jam\\" at home with the stereo.

Thank you, I needed to express that. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"I think BSB are good singers and harmonizers and also can play their own insterments, as you will soon find out if you havent yet in their 3rd album comeing out, it wont be long now. This was probably equally as good as their 1st in my opinion, it had its ups and downs like any other cd. Exept this does have a defenate more mature sound. My fave trax are \\"Spanish Eyes\\" wich is an amazing slow song I absolutly love, and \\"The Perfect Fan\\" a song written for their moms.

This is a processed singing/dancing group organized to cash in on young teenage girls. They do not write any of their lyrics or music. They are five handsome lads in their early twenties who sing in simple voice tones and line dance. Cant anyone and everyone do this? As for the songs on the album, there is not one unique, fresh song on the album. Some of the songs dont even make much sense. What do they mean when they say \\"I dont ever want to hear you say that you want it that way,\\" in I Want It That Way. Every song is either a sappy love song, or a song about breaking up and being sad. As if any of these spoiled kids know anything about being sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Form, not substance.","review":"I'll make it clear right now that these guys are good singers. However, it takes a little more than good singing and good looks to make a great album. The songs are overplayed, and probably will not stand the test of time.

I think its just plain sad people don't realize how gay the crapstreet gaylords are, despite the fact they literally go right up to each other and look at themselves in mirrors and stuff on their videos. And their music video awards performance was a joke, especially with that one idiot wearing a Britney Spears-type outfit (not that she's any better of course). I wanna know just what makes the BSB any different from Hanson. And their new video, \\"Larger Than Life,\\" is just a copy of Jay-Z (notice the dancing and outfits), a copy of Garbage and Star Wars (spaceships shooting at each other), and a copy of the Spice Girls (the whole spacy thing reminds me of \\"Spice Up Your Life\\"). They should consider renaming themselves the Spice Boys.

Place this in the discount bin beside your OTOWN. It is laughable to think a so called music critic from these boards believes JOHN LENNON could learn something from this prefab band!

They have changed their appearance from alley rats to millenium angels (Which do you like better?). In Millenium, they have more variety in their music. On their first album, you kind of get the feeling that the songs repeat themselves. In their latest album, they have different kinds of songs for different kinds of people. Overall, the BSB have taken a turn for the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the cd rocks!!!!!","review":"i definitley think that this cd is the best ever. it shows off each boys amazing voice. the songs all seem to be split up very fairly and there seems to be no lead singer. also, this is one of those cd's that one can not get sick of. it's good for all types of occasions and moods. there's up-beat and dancing songs, but also mellow love songs. i can't rememver the last time i've been able to listen to one cd over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attack of the pretty boys..","review":"The Backstreet Boys are cute. That's about all i'll give them. Their c.d. isn't all that bad, if you want regurgitated, reiterated, non original songs lacking a true purpose. Honestly, they barely make sense. Maybe in your eyes, but I can't find a meaning in any of them. Their songs are made up of silly, transparent, apathetic and emotionless lyrics and melodies used to hook pre-teen girls, which evidently they have. Take my advice and get Ben Folds Five, the goo goo dolls, or Semisonic and listen to some real music. And maybe you'll decide that there is actually a music world outside of them. Sooner or later you are going to grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"An over-rated album coming up short","review":"The new Backstreet Boys CD \\"Millenium\\" just doesn't cut it. It lacks originalty BIG TIME. All the songs sound so similar that none of them are able to stand out. In addition to this lackluster of an album, where are the upbeat tempo of songs that have made them so famous? How are they gonna dance on tour when all their songs are slow. Please someone gives these guys a clue before its too late. There is a lot of potential, but they just don't possess it just quite yet. Perhaps it has to do with their writing contribution to the songs. BACKSTREET BOYS sorry to say but leave it to the professionals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting!!","review":"I am shocked. I have hated the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC for so long because all they are is $$ and girltoys. I have to say, Millenium is a whole new thing. I have only heard Larger Than Life and I Want It That Way, but i love them both. They are the only two songs I like from these two groups, give or take a few. I will never be a DRONE to BSB or NSYNC. I will be faithful to Dave Matthew's Band and The Bobs. The BSB and NSYNC will not take over my mind!! Still, those two songs were good."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSB Rules","review":"The Backstreetboys new zcd is the bom.

It was definitely a good investment and I was far from disappointed. It has become a fast favorite! I was extremely impressed by the credits. There are several tracks either written or arranged by members of the group. The last song, \\"The Perfect Fan,\\" is a beautiful sentiment. The Boys should be very proud of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are under the age of ten you will like it.","review":"I really dont like this CD at all.

Ilove you Howie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the deal????","review":"Okay I don't know why everyone loves these 5 guys so much. They don't even write their own songs, so why are you giving them all the credit? All they do is sing them and I don't think any of them have an especially good voice. Come on they don't even play any instruments! All they do is show off by dancing and singing and thinking they are so awesome. \\"I Want it That Way\\" is the only decent song on the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAG ME!!!!","review":"Tell me, does anyone who isn't a twelve year old girl actually like these freaks? Their music is cliqued and just plain stupid. Who cares how they want it? What they NEED is something original. And a group haircut. The little groupies think they're cute? Didn't anyone happen to see the MTV Video Music Awards? Four of them wore suits that resembled garbage bags and the fifth wore a bra! I know they look like girls, but women's lingerie is not necessary. However, the saddest thing is that other groups desperatly want to be like them! Want a hint? It's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSB are \\"Larger than Life!\\"","review":"I rearanged my whole day on May 18th to be among the first to hear the new Backstreet CD, and it was worth the hassle. I am so proud of them. I think that the main accomplishment of this album is that after such a sucessful debut album they managed to produce an even better one. The tracks on this album have much more mature and realistic lyrics. Their first and loyal fans will love it, but they may also draw new probably older fans out of the closet, who won't be ashamed to say they love the Backstreet boys. All in all this is definitely the best new release of the year and the Millenieum."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best songs I have ever heard.","review":"The boys made it big time agan. I have all their CDs and singles, but in this album I heard fantastic songs. Who can resist in \\"Show me the meaning of being lonely\\"?

It's fabulous!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album!!!!","review":"I've been listening to the BSB for a long time and I enjoy all their CDs!!This album has got to be their best so far!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercialism at its worst...","review":"This CD doesn't even deserve 1 star... How fabricated can you possibly get? This album is a carbon copy of the BSB's previous efforts and offers absoluetly nothing new. I find it very sad when you can hum over melodies from their previous CD's on top of the \\"new\\" songs and realize that they fit together perfectly! I mean, come on!! I know that the BSB don't write their own material, but whoever does is a very pathetic excuse for a song writer! Do yourself a favor, if you want some good and refreshing pop music, go buy Robbie Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY ARE THE BEST GROUP OUT RIGHT NOW","review":"Backstreet boys are the best group out right now. They keep proving it with every album. Millennium is great cd shows how much they have grown as a group and they sing so good. This is a great album ya'll should check it out. It doesn't only attract younger people either I'm 19yrs old and proud to say they are favorite group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad looks+Bad Music=a cult following,& a #1 video on TRL!","review":"People? I have a question... WHAT is SO special about the BACKSTREET BOYS?! I listened to this album song for song this summer via a friend, and... honestly, I guess I just don't get it. I found not even a speck of talent OR originality on the record! Even the people who write FOR them are lame! To me, all of the music is just a reminder of how terrible the early 90's were. I've heard it all before! And beside the point that they cannot SING, they can't even write, though they did TRY, which I will give them a bonus point for.But HONESTLY, people, are they really THAT hot? Their looks do nothing for me... I grew out of that teen heartthrob stage when I was,hmmm 11...and I'm only 14! Please, people, I urge you to listen to Real Bands with REAL TALENT... Try Unwritten Law!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2000 Never Sounded Better","review":"Millennium had some of the best songs that I have ever heard. I listen to everyday, and never get tired of it. BSB did a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this CD,it is a waste of time and money!","review":"I have heard some of this of this CD and their old old one,I think that most of all their songs sound to much alike for me(that also goes for Nsync,98 degrees,youngstown ect.)and their music should not even fall into the catogory of popular music!This is not the kind of music that you can injoy or brag that you have it.It is pure GARBAGE! I had to give it a star not because they deserve it but because you must pick from 1-5 I picked the almost agreeable number!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is great!","review":"i got this cd the very first day it came out. i listen to it all the time. i have no idea why they would have hidden kevin's voice. he sings really well and his song that he wrote, \\"back to your heart\\" is really great. I can listen to this cd all the way through and i can't do that with many cd's. The songs are all great and everyone should buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can they sing ?","review":"Can they sing? Yeah right! I would never buy this cd. My friend got it and said there was one good song. I don't even think it was good. Buy Nsync. I give that 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to originality people?","review":"This is a review from a guy that like's pop music, BUT unforunately Backstreet boys new CD is way far from originality, the beats are that of a teeny bopper medly. I've listened to the CD to try to like it but it didn't work. There are only about three song that are decent and one song that is cool. If you do want great music like a nice ballad, or up to beat party music, i suggest you swallow your pride and buy an NSYNC CD. Or at least go to their concert, its amazing what they can do. Sing, dance, song write, and play instrument, you'll be awwed for weeks. In retrospect, BSB's old CD was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY GOT #1, NICE WORK GUYS.","review":"The BSB's did it again. This CD is great, I bought it the same day it came out looking forward to listening to \\"I want it that way.\\" It doesn't only have that great song, but it has so many more. All the songs are great, beautifully recorded. If you are out there thinking about buying it, don't waste your time. BUY IT! It a great CD. If you liked their first CD, you'll definitely enjoy this one. If you ever heard a song by them that you enjoyed, you will like this CD. Trust me. Here from LA, this is MusicLoverLA saying good-bye people.

Do yourself a favor and buy the CD, you will not regret it.

I love the CD because it is so good. The guys were going for a new sound and I'd say that they did it!!! I am so happy that they have such a great album. I'd like to say that they did a great job on their new album, I know that it was a lot of hard work, but it really paid off. I think all those people who before were against the Backstreet Boys should give them a chance and at least listen to their new album before you criticize them. I am so happy for the Boys!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"The album is great! The song are really good!

If you must have a boy band cd though i would reccomend the new one from NSNC.At least there music is partway entertaning.MAMA BETTER SIT DOWN ON THIS ONE BACAUSE THIS CD AINT NOTHIN TO BE PROUD OF"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite playing those tunes","review":"Ok bsb is not a good example. They like have a million probs and want to spread them around with the world!!so ethier drop it or stop it because its really lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocrisy of the Voice","review":"These fellows follow a trend in popular music that continues to sustain and promote a sound that many have mistaken for the human voice. Well I suppose it is the human voice, but it is not the natural human voice. It is a put-on unnatural sound delivered with arrogance and decadence to the art. Singing is an art or an art form. There is no question that this boy group is performing within the boundaries of a true art form. The question is one of how well they deliver and achieve status as true artists. And that is a question of talent. Don't see much here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A yawner","review":"Borrowed a coworker's cassette so I could see what all the fuss was about...what I heard was boring lyrics, boring instrumentation, boring production and bland melodies. There's no unique personality to the songs, no uniqueness in the singing...I can think of literally hundreds of other acts out there that could sing these songs just as well, if not infinitely better. I'm not surprised they've sold tons of CDs...this stuff is ordinary and safe. Nothing even slightly challenging on the album. Nothing about it sets them apart from the pack, which(unfortunately) is what most listeners crave--music that sounds like they've heard it before. My coworker loves them...but then again, she's not into music...she's into songs--and yes, there is a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beats for the money, there not real.","review":"The only reason I'm giving this CD one star is because I can't give it zero.

Something real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet Is Back","review":"The Backstreet Boys are back. This album is just as good as the first. These guys know how to jam. There music videos are awesome as well. Keep up the good work guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was awesome","review":"Everyone who says the BSB suck and they don't write their own lyrics, and that they don't play their own instruments. GET A CLUE!!! Okay so you don't like that kind of music, so what, I personally hate Limp Bizkit and Korn, but I don't go around insulting them constantly. No I did not buy this CD because I thought they were hot, I bought for the music. I think it is really good. They can't sing, well wake up, neither can Kid Rock!! They do write their own lyrics. Maybe if you had heard the CD, then you would know. Brian wrote 3 songs and Kevin wrote 1 and on Backstreet's Back, Brian wrote another, and he played the guitar for it. Kevin plays the piano for Back To Your Heart in concert. SO JUST SHUT UP ABOUT IT!! If you don't like them fine, but you don't have to go around lying and dissing them before you've heard the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a product, like acne-medication aimed at teens","review":"If you are a young female, your affinity for this group is the result of the fact that your are still maturing as an individual. As you begin to be able to see past your hormones and fantasies, perhaps you will understand my criticism of this group.This is not impassioned, personal music. It is a carefully marketed product. Demand more from your music. Demand that it be art, that it challenge you rather than appease you. Pop, bubble gum music can be both melodic, catchy, AND intelligent and truthful."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not just the little girls who like this one . . .","review":"I have to admit it--if the Backstreet Boys had been around twenty years ago when I was 13, I would have been screaming and plastering my room with their pictures too. As it is, I genuinely like this album, as do a lot of other adults (although some will only admit it with a gun to their heads). The guys can actually sing, the lyrics are a cut above what you might expect from a pin-up boy band (\\"Eyes like stone observe the trends\\"), and the arrangements are first rate (I dare you not to dance when \\"Larger Than Life\\" comes pounding over the speakers). The Boys appeal to adults too, even those who don't have swooning teens and pre-teens in the house, and that will be the secret of their longevity, long after the 'N Syncs of the world fade into obscurity. And they are all pretty cute, by the way . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is buy far the worst CD I have ever heard","review":"For the love of god. They could make a barney sond track and it would sound better than this. This time I don't have to keep my name anonymous.Don't waste half a penny on this... let alone 20 bucks. If you spent money on this you wasted it. If you got it for free because they wanted the Barney sound track instead, you wasted your time.There \\"hit\\" song larger than life, shouldn't even be considered a one. If you want something good get the Offsprings Americana. All around bad CD. Don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 song worth 2 stars","review":"This album I will give 2 stars because I have to admit it... I Want It that Way was a well written and sung song.

You don't have to be a fan to buy a certain cd. THis cd was honestly the Backstreet Boys, best one ever. All of their singles released from this album so far, have done really well, soring the charts to the number one spot. If you don't believe me, why don't you try listning to the samples, then maybe you'll find out if you should get the cd or not, It is the best though, from my point of view and I think that everyone would like it nomatter what age they are. After all they have fast songs and slow songs, that are both the bomb. I hope this review was helpfull 2 you and that if you do get the cd, that you really enjoy and like it. -Sorry if this review bothered you too, =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than The First...","review":"Unlike *NSYNC, the Backstreet Boys open up with a song about appreciating their fans, and sign off with a ballad about their MOMS! how incredibly sweet of them.

This is worth double what I paid!PEACE, y'all! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate manufactured garbage","review":"Please, all this album is meant for is selling t-shirts, posters, and tickets to kids who dont know any better.

Sorry, I cant respect any group that doesnt write their own material or play instruments on their albums. 1 star because there is no zero star rating. Open your eyes kids, theyre emptying your wallet right in front of your eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah, this band is original, unlike metallica...RIGHT?","review":"Ok, i'm just gonna tell you facts about this album. They hardly wright any of their own music or lyrics, and still all their songs are about the same thing. I don't mean the same theme, thats different. But they all sound the same. A beat with chime like instruments and teenagers singing about girls like they are in love, in EVERY SONG. Sorry, but they just aren't original, and hardly even a band."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fresh perspective","review":"I feel shameful for even allowing myself to surf into this page but I also feel my voice and those that truly appreciate music should be represented to balance out the score. N' Sync and all other assembly line groups are designed to do one thing and that isn't to make art but rather to make money. Granted there is talent to be found but it is packaged up, wrapped in cellophane and marked with a price tag. My biggest gripe is not necessarily with N' Sync, but with the response that they and those like them have received. I know this will only be read by the 8-16 demographic but I had to get this off my chest."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son likes this one, so...","review":"...I couldn't help but give it 4 stars.

I give the boys credit for their musical talent, but they have forgotten about their fans. Plus, their talent doesn't translate into the CD; too many unnecessary solos are included. \\"The Perfect Fan\\" is a lame attempt to connect with the audience. The song is for their mothers? Can you say N sync's \\"God Must Have Spent...\\"???"},{"rating":"1","title":"BSB needs to get rid of Nick","review":"Now, I'm glad That I never had any need to ever get this CD, but since my sister got it I gave it a spin. The reason I gave it 2 stars, were for the 2 songs Nick didn't have a leading part. Sorry BSB would sound 100% better without the boy. Sure everyone thinks he looks good , but really he has brown hair and is BUTT ugly without his Makeup. Another reason this CD was bad was the fact that they still don't write their own songs. Sure Brain and Kevin have credits but they had a real song writer help them, and they only write lyrics not Music. So If they get rid of Nick and learn to really write song, they will begin to get more respect, From everyone who is not a girl between 8-25."},{"rating":"1","title":"you call these kids rappers?","review":"i bought this cd looking for some great hip-hop music, and i got some messed up 'pop'. these kids can't rhyme! they also got wack beats! they need a better dj, too! he can't scratch worth jack! ya'll need to peep the Black Star Crew,or the Native Tongues (TRIBE, DE LA, and JB's).

This is because the whole of any boy band's fans represent the most ignorant group in society--a group quite impressionable enough to, not just like, but embrace what is truly, as I have said about 'N SYNC's No Strings Attached, an execrable piece of pop music trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Little Girls and, well, eh-hem, some Boys...","review":"First of all, I received this album as a promotional item from the local music store that I worked for. So listening to albums is my life. I approached this with open ears and all biased opinions put aside. But it really does merit less than one star. They, the B-boys, are after-all, marketing gimmicks used to swallow every single dollar that any 8 to 17 year old girls may have in their pockets. Their music is heartless and contrived cheese pop. What's really sad is that they don't write lyrics or play their own instruments. But boy would they look good on TV! Right Ladies? Jealous I am? Not a chance. I am a little sad that the general public feeds off of this mindless marketing musical trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can sing","review":"Whoop di-frickin'-do! I give five stars to the producers and the writers of all their songs. They really know how to manipulate millions of people into thinking that this stuff is actually good music. They could turn anyone into a teeny-bopper. Hope these guys enjoy their fame and fortune while it lasts. Then they'll look back and laugh at how easy it was to make millions off of candy-coated, processed, repetitive, aggravating, pain-inducing noise, which is something I could never allow myself to do to other people. Nevertheless, since 99% of the people who will read this review will disagree with me, I must say that the Boys are quite a dance-pop phenomenon and that they certainly have good voices, and thus I give them a very generous two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I freely admit to prefering *N SYNC over the Backstreet Boys, but a friend of mine convinced me to have a listen. The first time around the songs are okay, but after nearing the album two or three times, some of the songs (I Want It That Way, Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely), get old real quick. Their first shout-outs to should be to Lou PEarlman, the svengali who made them and two the producers for helping Nick through his \\"bad vocal year (my friend's words). I also think their attack of other pop phenomenons is rather comical. I mean, we know they don't like *N SYNC, there's no need to talk about it in every freaking interview. I don't see this band staying around after their fan base (kindergarteners to pre-pubescent girls) matures. I don't feel that they, as a group, have the ability to mature along with their fans. Therefore, I'm biding my time, waiting for them to disappear like the New Kids did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Nothing That Interests Me!!!","review":"Last January, I bought Backstreet Boys \\"Millennium\\" for myself firsthand. The only thing I can say is that \\"Millennium\\" is an apt title to include an intro and maybe a few interludes just to make the album longer. ONLY two songs caught my interest: \\"I Need You Tonight\\", and \\"Back to Your Heart\\".

I have loved(secretly of course) all of the songs that they have released but whatfinally convinced me to buy this album was \\"The One.\\" That song is so beautiful and I was even more surprised that Brian wrote it. The other song that I absolutely positively totally love is \\"Back to Your Heart\\" (which was written by Kevin). That song is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. There are a couple of songs on here I don't really care for but you can't like everything right? I've been listening to this for about a month almost continously (I am a year behind, give me a break!)

Every song is fabulous! Although it took me a while to adjust to I Need You Tonight, now I love it.

I would have to say, Don't Wanna Lose You has to be my favorite, and that was a VERY hard choice because I love them all.Brian Littrel, God I love the way that man sings.

They all have such beautiful vocies, its no wonder they are on top of the boy bands. Go to the store and buy it, if you haven't already. Forget that every teenage girl on the earth loves them, forget that they are a boy band. Go there thinking--if i miss out on this cd, i'll be missing out on real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The difference between art and entertainment","review":"Whats all the hype about? Have people forgotten what music really is? Sure, this CD features \\"good-looking\\" guys with \\"great\\" voices, but there is NO TALENT. People have quickly forgotten music genuisis such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam (Pioneers in great alternitive music), and turned there attention towards this type of music. The music which the Backstreet Boys produce is only famous because of their so-called \\"good-looks\\". If the Backstreet Boys were nothing but 40-year old, bald, and fat men with the same voices, would they still have the attention? The answer is no. Do your selves a favor and turn your atention back to good music. Believe me, You will find it is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"um, no.","review":"If you're looking for whiny, unimaginative ballads and dull, overmixed uptempos, this is the cd for you! After waiting years for BSB's sophmore US album, getting handed... THIS was purely insulting. I'm not sure what The Boys were trying to prove with this cd, but they did a BAD job.A word of advice: Stick to what you're best at. Being a boy band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance.....","review":"I hadn't heard of the Backstreet Boys until I heard \\"I Want it That Way\\"....I became hooked! They may not play their own instruments or write all their own songs, but that's not uncommon in this type of music. They are at the top of their genre. If you're more into heavy metal then this is not the CD for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terminal!","review":"This band has hit \\"rock bottom\\" in being the worst bubblegum pop band out there! Of course, like New Kids on the Block, they'll be gone in no time. Under all that plastic surgery, piercings, and expensive clothing is actually 5 greasy guys who are cashing in big time on teeny bopper's allowance money. It shouldn't be long until Hanson teaches them how to flip burgers at McDonalds.So where's the musical talent, Rod Stewart? There is none. These guys don't write their own songs or play any instruments. What you have here is elevator music (VERY bad elevator music) with 5 high school dropouts singing to it in a chorus type of way. What earns the benjamins? Their outfits and physical appearance. There is \\"NO.\\" musical demeanor in sight.If you're not going to listen to what I say, buy their CD. Rest assured you'll just be buying a very expensive blank compact disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok.... for a boyband","review":"Let me start off by saying the Backstreet Boys are alright musicians. 2/3 of them can sing, whereas the rest sound like screechng cats. However, in my opinion Millenium has too many slow songs, for my liking. Precisely 8 out of 12. More than half. \\" Show me the meaning of being Lonely\\" is too depressing, Larger than Life was the best song on the album, until it got played out by MTV. My favorite songs are \\"Gotta be You\\" and for a slow song, \\" No One Else Comes Close\\". But, millions of prepubescent girls probaly disagree with me, and thats fine. I'll just keep listening to their first album instead, and pull out Millenium when I need a reminder of how innocent they seem to be, and why millions of underage girls go gaga at the very sight of them. After all, I was there, and it aint pretty. And, when I'm in a bad mood, and need a good laugh, all I have to do is think of Nick's prepubescent voice singing \\"I'm your bad boy\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"backstreet's back alright!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"The new album is their very best. I have to admit that there where quite a few to many slow slongs. But that is exactly why I love them to death. My favorite songs are(in order): \\"Don't want you back\\", \\"Larger than life\\", \\"I want it that way\\", \\"Back to your heart\\",(cuz Kev wrote it) and of course \\"The perfect fan\\"(cuz B-rok wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The CD is sad.","review":"The content of this CD is is very disappointing compared to the brilliance of the Backstreet Boys'last one. There are way too many solos by Nick Carter, who can't sing, and most of the songs focus on themselves. \\"Larger Than Life\\" is a perfect example. Can you get any more conceited?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A vast improvement over their debut album.","review":"I'm 19, and I must admit that when I went to the counter to buy this CD I was embarassed, but once I got it safely home and into my CD player I was glad that I endured the embarassment. I'm still kinda a closet fan though (notice I didn't include my email address, I was afraid someone I know might see it). \\"Larger Than Life\\", \\"I Want It That Way\\" and \\"I Need You Tonight\\" are my favorites. Also, I like \\"The Perfect Fan\\" (their mothers must be beaming), \\"Back To Your Heart\\", \\"Spanish Eyes\\" and \\"Don't Wanna Lose You Now\\". My all-time favorite BSB song still has to be \\"Quite Playing Games With My Heart\\". I think that this is a wonderful sophomore album. They've matured and involved themselves a little more in the songwriting and vocal arrangements. So, give them a break. If you don't like their music then don't listen to their music. Duh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow,they actually have talent","review":"FIRST OFF:WHY MUST THE PUBLIC THINK THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO LIKE THE BSB ARE WIDE-EYED,INNOCENT,LONER TEEN GIRLS WITH NO LIFE!!!!!!I personally like the bsb because I have something to sing to girls:)This is so weird:a pop cd with depth.Every song on this cd is good.There are actually 6-7 songs that could be hits.Though I have nothing to do with Larger Than Life,it's a cool song.I want It That Way is a more brilliant radio song than even baby one more time.from the oh-so-sad Don't want you back,to the feel good song It's gotta be you,It's defintely the dawson's creek of music.AJ needs a haircut,BAD,but that's the only problemI could find.IF YOU'RE THE 3 PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T BOUGHT IT ALREADY,GO GET IT.>Best songs:1,2,3,4,5,6,7.BEST SONG:9.TRUST ME."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"it's very cool. i love the backstreet boys. \\"it's gotta be you\\", \\"show me the meaning of being lonely\\", \\"i want it that way\\", \\"don't want you back\\", and \\"don't wanna lose you now\\". they sigs awesome and the melodies and lyrics are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"U ToTaLly WuN ReGrEt DiS!!!!","review":"one sentence: get it or regret!!! all the songs are totally kewl!!!! prob the best album coming out dis millennium!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Verdict: Poo.","review":"This pathetic hunk of worthless crap wasn't worth the measley fifteen dollars I paid for it. Every damn song follows the same standard formula. All the song's lyrics are gooshie manufactured falsified love ballads. The only reason the Backstreet Boys sell so well is because of the poor, pathetic teenage girls who fantasise about the ugly buggers singing about them. This is shallow, unimaginative, pointless music. It's most definately not groundbreaking, nor does it try to be. All it does is shows how gullible our youth is. Shame on you for even looking at this page. If you have to buy chicky music, buy something with SUBSTANCE, eg. not this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is not good","review":"There first album was alright, but this just flat out sucks.

I'm really tired of hearing endless mushy ballads about love. Is that all they can write about is relationships? there's more to life than that. I think the BSB have huge potential to be something good, but they obviously aren't showing it. I would normally give 1 star, but since they sound better on this album I'll give them 2. Oh and to the person who said that anyone who gives this 1 star is jealous or afraid they will like it, it's not a case of either. Some people just don't like the backstreet boys at all(i myself don't really like them that much). Shocking, isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's I have bought in a while","review":"The is not your ordinary CD. It has songs for just about everyone! Im not usually a pop fan, I haven't really listented to my \\"POP\\" cd's for a while, but when I herd their new single \\"I want it that way\\" I fell inlove with the song right away, and just had to have the CD. I have 2 copies of it( My first copy was ruined :o( )and I like listen to it every day. I mean ya can't really say enough good stuff about this cd, it has everything from great dance songs like \\"Larger than Life\\" to soulfull ballads like \\"Perfect Fan\\". I luv this cd and I reccomend this to everyone...young and old.....people who like all kinds of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ever","review":"The Backstreet Boys are a new style of group. They started, and several other groups followed with the same style of music. Such examples are N-Sync, 98 Degrees, and Five. All these groups have a great style. The first to have this was the Backstreer Boys. They started out with one hit and skyrocketed to the top. After a while their first album was starting to lose its popularity. I was starting to wonder if they would rise and fall like Hanson and the Spice Girls. However they already had this under control. Their new album Milenium is even better than the last. It is great and is worth the money paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment indeed","review":"I have been a huge BSB fan since day 1, and listened to the first CD so much I wore it out and had to buy a new CD! I even went out and bought the album a third time just to get the song Everybody into my collection. For months I counted the days down to the release of Millenium, and when the day came, I was literally bouncing off the walls! I got the CD before all of my friends, took it home, gave it a spin, and didnt even finish listening to it! It's songs like Larger Than Life and The Perfect Fan that just aren't gold songs and need sooooo much construction to make them pure BSB. I hope someone agrees. I just gave away the CD today, and am hoping NSYNC can cure my boy fix now. Hope they wont release a disgusting sophomore album like BSB did."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's the hit cd of 99'","review":"this cd is awsome. it's the bsb's best cd yet. \\"the perfect fan\\" is an incredible and touching song. it shows love to all the moms out there. it is a great cd all the backstreet boys' fans out there should own a copy.Each song is carefully written.

And what is a band if no one plays their instruments or writes half the songs? I might be able to over look that, but the bottom line is none of the songs are worth listening too!!!

Much love to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great and very different from any other BSB releases.","review":"This new album is most definately a step-up from previous albums. You can really see the maturity in the lyric contents and in their voices too. They even co-wrote some of their own songs. I would've liked if the albums were the same world-wide though so I wouldn't have to get the import! I think that more uptempo's would make the album more multi-steller than it already is. I just can't stop hearing it. My family is getting tired of it and my Backstreet mania is getting to some people - so I'm exposing their greatness to other people. The Boys don't have to worry about expanding their male audience - they are almost there. This is a must-get for anybody. It's hypootizing. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"BSB are back and on top!!","review":"If you don't have this CD, you HAVE to get it! It rocks! If you think your not gonna like it, think again, atleast give it a try! I'm sure all the guys are gonna love \\"don't want you back\\".

Im not the whole pop music typ but a friend of mine had the cd and I actually enjoyed listening to it. My favorites on the cd are \\"Back to your Heart\\" and of course \\"I Want It That Way\\". I couldnt believe I was humming these tunes when I left. If any cd can make me do that, then its worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone who enjoys real music.","review":"The BBB know very little about music. To have some guy mix a few percussion beats in a studio and then have a writer put together a few redundant, genotypical lyrics is not what I call creative and beautiful music. Where has the music that stirs the soul with a syphony's violin, or a bluegrass banjo, or a guitar burning from the speed of the solo, or even a soothing church's organ? Where has all the music gone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's okay","review":"I think the songs sound a lot like their first album...and I don't like the first album. Some of the songs have similiar melodies and the words of 'larger than life' doesn't really make sense. Truthfully, I'm not a backstreet boys fan, but they do have some talent, I'll give them that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of the boy bands...","review":"...which is not saying much. I have a strong aversion to the groups of five or so guys who can't sing, for the simple fact that their songs are not real music. However, I found myself enjoying some of the Backstreet Boys' melodies, even if the lyrics are not extremely creative and were likely spit out by a bubblegum-pop generator. The songs are more enjoyable than many by other \\"teenybopper\\" artists; I would not buy this album but I give the Boys credit for not being completely horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"I like this cd for its different fast and slow songs.I think this is a CD for most anyone,it has great sound,great artists and good lyrics.So in my opionion if you like anything even close to this music you should buy the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"This CD is dull and boring. They don't have much of a variety of songs on the album and the songs get REALLY ANNOYING after a while. And plus, a lot of their songs don't even make sense! The only close to good song is \\"The Perfect Fan\\" but other than that, the songs are no good. I myself am an *NSYNC fan, but I also liked the BSB even though they kept saying how *NSYNC copied them (it's not true), I still liked them until I heard this CD for a couple of times then I was like, \\"BORING!\\" If you want a good CD, get No Strings Attached. It has a good variety, and it actually has talent in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BSB are phenominal!","review":"\\"Oh my God\\" were the first 3 words that came out of my mouth after I listened to this CD. I think it's one of their best yet in fact. How can people not like these guys? They can sing like there's no tomorrow, they look as good as they sound, and they've got the moves. I read one on-line review about this CD, and was very disappointed. They said BSB have no talent. That the Red Hot Chilli Peppers are better. Well, excuse me, but not every person likes the type of music Red Hot Chilli Peppers play. And not every person will like pop music. But you can't say BSB are better thn RHCP, and you can't say RHCP are better than BSB. People have different opinions about music. BSB rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-stoppingly good.","review":"I remember listening to this album for the first several dozen times, I had to remind myself to breathe. It is so rare that an album comes along that you can listen to every track of, let alone an album that you love every second of.Part of the appeal of this album is in knowing that it was and is so incredibly popular around the world. Musically the album is a definite step up from their first album (first two if you're not american). I love their early work as well, but there is no denying that the group is more unified, got better songs, and ended up with a better product on this album. They have all matured vocally, and in particular Nick has improved greatly, stepping further into the limelight.The only thing better than listening to this cd was hearing it live in concert. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i LOVE this cd","review":"I believe that this is one of, if not the best album of 1999 and maybe even 2000. This album redefines who the backstreet boys are.

They're growing with their fans. They're growing as musicians- after all it's a growing process. They began as boys but have definitely matured into fine men. I'm sure the BSB would have won some grammies if good ole Santana hadn't come out with his way cool and inspiring Supernatural. Oh well 5 grammy nominations aren't that bad.

After about a month of singing lessons, you'd be up to the same level of tone as these 5 twits.Parents - if you child (or children) asked for this album, buy them a Nat King Cole album instead, or purchase some music lessons for them.I can easily believe these people write their own music - it's all horrible.

I will admit that their hits are kind of catchy but there's no substance to the songs so after about 2 listens you want to shoot the speakers the \\"music\\" is coming from. The only appeal they have is to 12 year old girls who think they're cute. It's just the same as Britney Spears. I think she's really hot, but just like the Backstreet Boys, she has no talent.

To me, boy bands respresent the crux of the problem with today's society. Everything is done for everyone. Here are five guys with no musical talent (until the producers fix things) who had their group created for them. They can't play their own music, and they can't sing either. The only reason these affronts to music are allowed on stage is because they can dance and they look good. What ever happened to the original bands? The ones who never sold out and played music for the joy of playing and not for the money? What happened to bands like Led Zeppelin and Simon and Garfunkel? No boy band deserves respect until they write their own material and play their own instruments. As a guitar player/songwriter, I know the difference that comes from writing your own music. You can feel the music.

I need you tonight is a great song for all the nick fans. my favorites are don't want you back..very good beat and all of them sound really strong and powerful..and back to your heart..very mellow song..but it's also very unforgettable. but overall..this is a cd that you should have at home even if you're not a bsb fan. you will like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD EVER!!!","review":"I love this cd!! It's the most soothing and romantic songs I own! For months every night I'd listen to this cd on full blast in my headphones before I went to bed.

I will admit that I want it that way is a really good song. That is why i picked this up. This cd is really a generic album the perfect fan..what a joke you would think these boy bands could write ALL of thier songs. Does anyone have any taste in music? I feel bad that i bought into the system and bought this. can any of you think for yourself. Stop buying into trl unless your 12 then i guess it is kind of hard to go against the grain. When you don't know the diffrence"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever","review":"This is to all of the people who have been hating on the Backstreet Boys: Backstreet Boys are a very good group, with REAL talent! I mean these boys...Well, men, are power packed, and always ready to harmonize. They are probably the sweetest huys in the world. They love their fans and love what they are doing. Other so called \\"boy bands\\" aren't even half of what BSB is. BSB's new albulm \\"Millenium\\" is the best CD I have EVER listened to in my life! I bought it the very first day it came out (May 18th), and I haven't regreted spending even a penny of that money I spent on it or their first and imports. All in all I'd give \\"Millenium\\" 5 starts (or a 100%)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good effort","review":"Okay I know I've already written a review but I am bored so I'll write another. What is so special about BSB? Their songs all have the same beat and their lyrics are so simple and boring that you can't stand it! But I gotta give them credit for writing a few of their songs, and 3 of the 5 have decent voices. If you are sick of all this peppy pop music, but dont want something really depressing like Korn, get the new Red Hot Chili Peppers CD \\"Californication\\" I just got it and its really good. Bye Luv ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is the worst","review":"I'm warning anyone who is thinking about ordering this album, it's horrible. The guys can colaborate their voices worth anything. There are about only 3 songs on the whole cd worth attemting to listen to. They just can't sing together worth a dime. I think you should go order *NSYNC's No Strings Attached. It is the best cd I've listened to in a long time. It has slow songs,party songs, and even songs about the future! I think you would be better off buying a Nsync cd then anything because the can actually sing together and very well on top of that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll give them credit for trying","review":"This CD isn't as great as people think it is. Every song is totally dense pop and they all sound the same. I guess you may like it if you are a true pop fan unlike myself who like *N Sync more becuase they are more R&B. And this man Rickey Wright well he's just Wrong. I dont think he understands the meaning of \\"Good Song\\". Although at one point in my life, I had respect for these people but it was all lost once I heard what they were saying about *N Sync. Just becuase *N Sync broke every record set by them doesnt mean they have to get all childish and say harsh things towards them. It just shows that the Backstreet Boys have poor spartsmanship and will not be around for very longer. They've had they're run and its time for them to say byebyebye to the music business."},{"rating":"2","title":"I JUST LOVE ALL OF THEM AND THERE SONGS.","review":"I WOULD LOVE TO MEET THEM.

But that is NOT why I don't like them...I like N Sync. Why?Backstreet Boys lack edge in their music. Their dance songs are middle of the road...such as \\"Larger Than Life\\", playing it safe.On the otherhand the album is filled with sappy ballads for those teen girls thinking that their fave Boy is singing to only them.\\"I Want It That Way\\", and \\"Show the Meaning of Being Lonely\\" to name a couple are from the same ballad cookie cutter mold, which I am sick of!Their latest single from this CD \\"The One\\" is so run of the mill pop, and it shows, peaking at No. 30 on the Hot 100 Billboard chart, radio is maybe finally taking notice, that it isn't the artist that makes the song it is the song that makes the artist....Bye Bye Bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backstreet Boys \\"Millenium\\" is \\"eh\\"","review":"I got this CD on May 18, 1999 (the day it came out). I told myself I liked it and sure, some songs were good (\\"Larger Than Life\\" \\"Show Me the Meaning\\" and a few others) but most of them sounded a little too alike. There are albums that you get and think, \\"wow! This has variety!\\" such as *N Sync. Now THERE'S a great boy band. I started to dislike BSB because not only are they bitter but I have to close my ears when I hear them sing live. Sure, there are some good songs on this album, but it ruins it when you hear them live and try to go back to the album with a positive attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"How come there is not the option for 0 stars","review":"This album is apauling. if people give the BSB 5 stars for talent and don't appreciate Mozart's talent, that must say something about the reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Larger than Life","review":"This is my favorite Backstreet Boys album. It brings back so many memories and happy thoughts. Just popping it in the cd player puts me in a good mood.True, the lyrics may be corny, the voices a little too sweet to believe, but this is a feel good album at it's best. Listening to the Backstreet Boys is the perfect way to kick back. Stop worrying about how you'll become a conformist by listening to \\"manufactured pop\\" and just enjoy it.Besides.... the pictures in the booklet are just too adorable to pass up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You are the Fire...One Desire!","review":"Backstreetboy 'Millennium' is one sure pick one can't miss to listen to the cool guys with their Best vocals ever. Brian is so natural and the guys are lively in singing 'Show me the meaning of being lonely that makes one feel 'Tell me why we can't be there where you are' The song is emotional wanting to fulfil all wishes. The catchy tunes with lyrics almost on lips, all numbers are five stars. You are my fire is one song that simply says all and I need you tonight is a slow number that picks up cool. Having won the MTV Viewers choice award, bkstboys has superb harmony. Larger than Life is one song irresistible to teenagers. It's gotta be you..aha aha...is my fav and Don't want you back is nice way of honestly saying that she's no more good and dont want her back. Millennium is a Must pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!!!!","review":"Whoever says the BSB are one hit wonders must not have ever heard this album!!!

I have all their cd's: Backstreet Boys (canadian), Backstreet's Back (canadian), Backstreet Boys (U.S.), and of course Millenium. All the songs have a great meaning to them unlike some other ones they did in the past. Even \\"10,000 Promises\\", \\"Like A Child\\", or even \\"That's What She Said\\" couldn't compare to the best song in the world: \\"Show Me the Meaning Of Being Lonely.\\" This is a sad song, but it is great. It is the best song bsb has ever done, and that's hard to come out of my mouth because I've liked \\"10,000 Promises\\" for a long time. This CD rocks, and for what dumb reason anybody doesn't have this cd, it's a MUST HAVE!! I love each and every one of the guys and I know that they are better than any \\"boy band\\" out there, trust me on this, they RULE! KTBSPA!! AJ, Kev, B-Rok, Nick, and Howie D Forever!!!

Although there are very few dancing songs, the slow ones are deep, and make you cry! This CD is a must for any Backstreet Fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, pretty music from a pretty-boy band.","review":"Pop music nowadays can easily be divided between three groups: angry rock singers, angry rap singers, and formulaic pretty boy/girl bands. Backstreet Boys, needless to say, falls in the third category along with 'N Sync and 98 Degrees. Music that is somewhat cheesy tho' catchy and occasionally contradictory is a sure winner for the less belligerent (majority) bunch of teen agers that go for rap or rock. So Backstreet Boys and others write songs according to the formula. Who cares? That's what they do and they do it well. I generally reject R&B or whatever BSB are in favour of Alternative or Metal, but I have to admit that they're not bad. When my friends played \\"I Want It That Way\\", I was singing along by the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backstreet boys ROCK!!!","review":"I think B.S.B. went from a long way nick 13 and now 19. The backstreet boys always had the bomb cd's but I think is the best one ever. I want every one to listren to this cd it rocks and so do the backstreet boys. They look good a.j. looks FINE!!! B.S.B have there own styel and there own way in music. Who ever dosn't have this new cd yet what are you waiting for get up and buy it. B.S.B. ROCK!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but close enough for me!!!","review":"This is an EXCELLENT album. Like I said, it\`s not perfection, but with songs like \\"No One Else Comes Close\\" and the unforgettable \\"The Perfect Fan\\" (why is it that whenever there\`s a song that\`s dedicated to mothers, it\`s always a GREAT song?) the Boys are able to show us their best and nothing but. When someone uses their talents to their full potential like they did, it gives us a better appreciation of them. Now, you\`re probably wondering why I think this album isn\`t perfect. All I can tell you is that a couple of songs are too hard core that they\`re annoying. For example, \\"Larger Than Life\\" sounds a little too loud and obnoxious for my tastes. But then again, that\`s probably because I prefer R&B slightly more than pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! Thank you, Mr. Perry","review":"I have been anxiously awaiting Eye of the Hunter. I have had a schoolgirl crush on Brendan Perry's rich, silky voice for many, many years (I think I was a schoolgirl before Mr. Perry was born!) He definately borrows his stylings from the crooners of yesteryear, which adds a sense of urbane class to his simple, lovely compositions.This new CD is lush and lovely, but it suffers a little from the overuse of the reverb. Perry's voice is strong enough to stand on it's own, and the recording sounds as if it were made in an echo chamber. I have heard this effect used with much success to hide the sins of lesser voices, and it just isn't needed here. Because of this, my old ears have a hard time making out the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"thankfully, this isn't \\"world music\\"!","review":"For those who are familiar with Dead Can Dance, this is closest to Brendan's songs on INTO THE LABYRINTH and some of the work on TOWARDS THE WITHIN. It's not ground-breakingly new, it's not overwhelmingly powerful, but, aside from wearing his Walker/Buckley/Cohen influences on his sleeve, Perry makes some lovely music and stretches his range a bit. (at least it's not the affected accents of DCD's SPIRITCHASER) This can seem immediately accessible, but, there are wonderful dark and light undercurrents. I think his eventual next release will be a bit more sure-footed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"How far Brendan Perry has fallen","review":"I got this CD right when it was released. The cover indicated that maybe the spirit of Dead Can Dance had not completely died. How wrong I was. After listening to this, I realized that the real soul of Dead Can Dance was Lisa. You can still hear it in her music. Brendan seems to want to be a folk singer now. I suppose being in arguably the greatest musical group of the late 20th century just burned him out."},{"rating":"2","title":"DCD lives on with Perry's fine new CD!","review":"'The guy from Dead Can Dance' makes an entrancing solo debut with \\"Eye of the Hunter\\". A rather moody and contemplative record, recorded with the pristine clarity we've come to expect from DCD records, listeners will not find this to be much of a departure from Perry's tracks on Dead Can Dance records. The difference is a more acoustic and unclutterd approach -- the world-music percussion of DCD's last record is gone, but Perry's trademark dramatic synths and gentle guitar picking remain. Standout tracks are the opening \\"Saturday's Child\\" and the closer \\"Archangel\\" .. both of which feature some surprising new vocal stylings. This is fine and beautiful music -- a perfect rainy Sunday record!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ATMOSPHERIC, MUSIC TO CREATE TO","review":"I heard about Brendan Perry while visiting a friends webpage. The music and vocals were so enchanting that I HAD to find out who this musician was. Brendan Perry is amazing! I am an artist and i use his music to create to and I have to say some of my artwork has been inspired just by this CD.I read his Bio and found he has an extensive musical background. I will buy his earlier work for sure. This CD was a great introduction into his music for me anyway.I find myself going off into meditation with near all of the songs, this is a magickal and inspiring CD, the artist truly has a gift for creating an atmosphere that surrounds you, and takes you to another world.Love love love this artist and will buy his music again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one made me cringe","review":"I can forgive the somewhat cheesy lyrics, and I did find the musical accompaniment to be very good here. What is unforgiveable is Brendan's voice. It's just plain bad! From the first track on, I almost felt embarrassed for him for releasing such deplorable crooning. And what's worse, Brendan produced this mess himself! Not to be entirely negative (I did say the music was good), there is one track on which Brendan's voice sounds like his old self and which is wonderfully arranged - Medusa. Great song. Sadly, one great track does not compensate for cash spent. DCD fans, take heed. Keep the taps flowing and be well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I, too, was very sad that DCD parted ways. At least Lisa and Brendan are still making music! Beautiful music. So they parted? Brendan's music is like the Sun and Lisa'a is like the Moon. When they are together it is an Eclipse. Maybe one day we will get to see that eclipse again. Until then, feast your ears upon Brendan's first solo album since DCD parted. It took me a little time to get used to half of the songs on this CD. He has a Gothic Western sound. I don't like Western music, but this grew on me. I can only compare it to the sound of the Cowboy Junkies. The rest of the songs are pure magic. Songs like Medusa and Archangel will make the hair on your arms stand up as you are transported into those worlds that only a true musical bard can send you. Very good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor direct to video sequel is a waste of time","review":"Mommy was an Ok story, it tried to be classy but failed because of sluggish pace and lack of action.

The product needed assembly, and there were no instructions as to how to put the blade on. There were instructions for installing the battery and for the adaptors, but not the main blade. It was well sealed in clamshell packaging, otherwise I might have thought I had received a previously opened product. After snapping it together, it was so flimsy that I used tape to hold it together. The light did not work, and it pulled the hairs instead of cutting them which was painful.

The Hunter product makes little crumbs of activated charcoal, which this one does not, making it questionable whether it is an activated charcoal filter for odor control.If they are selling a generic filter, they should note that and people can choose whether they want that or the Hunter product.

Third, there's no evidence of any carbon filter material, and that's probably because there isn't any. Finally, you have to cut it to fit. While not terribly difficult, this isn't a product you can easily mark with lines for cutting, and it's not just a matter of cutting the length to fit: you have to cut along both axis.

However, in the concept's execution, the author's constant (and gratuitous) asides about ideological matters are so distracting and take away so much focus from the story that reading the book becomes very frustrating. Early on, when sitting in on voir dire to pick a jury the author remarks that the only question worth asking prospective jurors is \\"What are your politics?\\" Clearly that is how the author frames Life. The story would have been much more effective (and credible) if he had just told the story.

The book works as both an insider's account of a trial, replete with offbeat descriptions of circumstances and characters that a lesser eye might not even notice, and as an indictment of our justice system, which all too often is a crap shoot with the dice loaded against the poor, the young, and the dispossessed. Fortunately, the author doesn't stop there, as most such books do--this isn't a screed but a prescription for progress that we would be well advised to heed a sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad, but always colorful story of how our courts work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Book!","review":"The author is a weak, whiny fellow who spends the duration of this slender volume wallowing in self-pity at his wasted life. There are no insights about criminal trials nor criminal justice; the author is too much of a milquetoast to even do anything during the trial other than watch.I feel bad that the author is so unhappy in his profession; but then he graduated from Harvard Law in 1975, so it isn't like he had no choice in the matter.Geoghegan preferes to whine and complain, and it is excruciating for the reader to bear.

The flourescent light that is also on the back worked for about 15 minutes after the spotlight stopped working. The instructions warn against letting the battery completely discharge, so we turned it off before the lights completely stopped working. After another 20+ hour recharge, we had the same thing. 20 hours to charge for 5 minutes of bright light, and the spotlight is bright for a good 3-4 minutes before dimming, is just rediculous.

Otherwise, the universal lid cannot sit flat, thereby defeating the purpose of the lid. Your pot or pan handle must sit at least one inch below the lip of the pot or pan. My pot handles connect low enough, but the handle is then in a raised curve so that the highest point of the handle actually sits about 2 inches above the lip of the pot.

He shows us how faith, spirituality, equality and social responsibility can fall into place. Sowell is not intimidated by the people in power. His shows us how tiny the difference is between education and brain-washing, between a capitalist democracy and fascism. My only criticism is that he asks us for the ultimate reason, for common sense and rationality. People are about love and relationships and not about reason.

Screen, being very, very, grainy, and the audio was recorded so loud that I had to reduce the volume on both my DVD player and T.V. to the lowest settings to sound normal, and even then it sounded pretty pitiful.

I thought that if I worked with my son and his cat I would be able to calm him down when he gets uptight. This book is not intended for that!! In fact, it has very little use other than its descriptions of what cats do and how cats react to certain things.

The Enneagram is a cosmic diagram more akin to what astrophysisists work with. In the beginning was the Enneagram...the Logo.It would not matter if it lead people to the real thing, but most seem satisfied with the dreams of growth this false system gives.If you read this, be advised that the Enneagram was given by G. I. Gurdjieff, it was unknown until and has not been found anywhere except where he first promulgated it. This was as he is quoted by P.D. Ouspensky in 'In Search of the Miraculous'.

The only problem for me was that at the end of each chapter, it goes into this mystical talk about spiritual growth and \\"Essence.\\" That may appeal to some, but it got on my nerves.

It takes a tremendous amount of effort to read this book due to the complexity of the plot, the burden of what I believe is a mediocre translation and, ultimately, what to this U.S. reader was unfamiliarity with Swedish/ Norwegian and Lapp culture.

My brother says to me one day ...\\"that's how come you were adopted\\", I replied ... \\"that's how come mom and dad were stuck with you ... they wanted me, they chose me.\\" That kind of feeling about being adopted came from not only my parents but positive, simple stories of happiness ... just like this book The Chosen Baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and outdated adoption story","review":"Although this book was widely used and recommended years ago, it is a terrible adoption story to pass on today. As an adoptee, I was also given this book by my parents to help explain my adoption. But there are some very important elements missing from this story. First, the birthmother is completely absent. What is not documented in this story is the thousands of birthmothers who were pressured into relinquishing their children for adoption.Second, the adopted child is never \\"born,\\" he comes directly from the adoption agency. As a child, I had the idea that I was \\"chosen\\" from the agency just like my parents would go to the grocery store and choose their dinner.Today, open adoptions are encouraged, and we are finally recognizing the importance of biological connection and adoptees need to understand their origins. There are better books available that recognize this fact and more appropriately explain adoption in today's context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two great symphonies in the hands of one great conductor","review":"Between 1985 and 1995, American-born Swedish conductor Herbert Blomstedt helped to elevate the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra to the same level of excellence enjoyed by its counterparts in Los Angeles, Cleveland, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York.This recent London/Decca re-pairing of the orchestra's recordings of Mendelssohn's celebrated Italian Symphony and Schubert's equally celebrated Unfinished Symphony is proof that Blomstedt had his conducting powers well in hand. The orchestra gives very even and very excellent performances of these two symphonic hallmarks under Blomstedt's great guiding hand.Given this, it is hoped by this viewer that this same orchestra and conductor's equally superlative recordings of Beethoven's Symphonies Nos. 1 & 3 will make a return to CD as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked Amish Blue Popcorn","review":"We microwave it without oil and really like it.

This book is excellent. While brief, it gives an excellent introduction into the working conditions of women in sweatshops. Many black and white photos. While the book is slightly dated it is sad to note that the working conditions have not changed much.I read the book again before being sent overseas to address problems developing at my company's factories.

It's not as anal-retentive as Diana Kennedy and more appealing than Rick Bayless. The recipes are truly authentic and I have lived in Mexico for many years, researching the cuisines of Mexico. This book contains the majority of the most common dishes cooked in homes in Mexico and a great deal of the \\"alta cocina\\" works as well. I have made 75% of the dishes in this book and have served them to Mexican friends to rave reviews. This is the real thing. Marilyn Tausend collaborated in this book and it shows. She is an unsung hero of Mexican Cooking.

My main complaint about her recipes is that they are completely Creole Revisionist... in other words they are done from a very Spanish / Euro perspective... the Herb, Chile & Spice combinations have been extremely simplified & you really do not get to understand & appreciate the true genius of Mexican Cuisine. Its like a Spaniard revised all the recipes.Truly dissappointing.... it should be embarrassing to here that Rick Bayless's books are a bit closer than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading Book","review":"First, the service was super good.The book, as you know is in Spanish, we are doing some classes in church and this book is perfect for that, because our classes are Spanglish!!!!!!!, yes, everybody speaks English and most of them also Spanish, so we can go back and forth with the Spanish book.

Her drawings of fairies, queens, horses, and other fantasy themes are generally highly detailed and textured. Her colors are very rich, whether she's working in watercolor or computer.That said, I was very disappointed with the quality of the art in this book. While it contains images of many of her best peices, the pictures are badly pixelated (grainy) and the colors and brightness uneven. Basically, the book needed much better quality control on the layout and printing side. Unfortunately, since this is an artbook, the graphics quality is critical to the value of the book.

It seems to be designed for a subset of Cox's native Wonkette audience, one that not only enjoyed her trash-mouthed take on Washington but cared deeply about the politics behind it.If you find yourself meeting those criteria, and don't expect this to be the next great literary gem, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the little things in this book. The in-jokes that you get will delight you; the ones you don't won't bother you. And Cox can certainly turn a phrase; while some of the book reads like it was written too quickly, her descriptions of messy apartments and messy luggage and messy thinking are all impressive.So ignore the myriad negative reviews: If you're a Democrat with an interest in things political and tastes that occasionally run to the trashy, this book (and particularly its wish-fulfilling ending) will be a pleasant vacation from reality for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is as bad as it gets.","review":"Dont waste your money or time this book is seriously bad.

This should have been tack welded to the the legs.

Unfortunately, nutritional information is not included with the recipes, but let's be honest, if you are using this book, you probably aren't too concerned about nutritional information, just excellent tasting recipes.

Funny, high-brow and piercing.growing up in a privileged world few would ever see let alone experience, Mr. Lapham skewers myths and exposes skeletons in the closets of the jet set. He also does an excellent job of explaining and describing the overlap of politics and the very very rich; the arena of influence where money and politics are exposed as the \\"wizard behind the curtain\\" of so much that happens in American society.

For me, the exact color I want is very important. That's why I spent the extra money to get the set of 40. Even though it looks like a lot of colors, they still don't give me what I want. I find that I need to lay down 4-5 different colors in order to get to what I want, and by then I can't use my colorless blender. There's no good skin colored pencil, the greens are all very yellow-ish, even the browns all have a strange green undertone to them. The reds are all very orange still, and it's very difficult to get a deep dark red color. Besides that frustration, they are better quality pencils that Prismacolor. I felt like every time I sharpened my Prismacolor pencils the led would break. These at least don't do that, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to get another set of Prismacolors just to give me some of the basics that I still need."},{"rating":"2","title":"more for the Firefly lovers","review":"For all those who are sad/mad at the loss of Firefly here are some more fan written tales.

Boring","review":"I am a big Firefly fan - own the TV series and the movie in virtually every format - so I was excited when I saw a new documentary on the show. Unfortunately, this product doesn't live up to the rest. It's a self-indulgent, self-congratulatory retelling of how the cancellation of the TV show drove the fans to guerrilla marketing techniques to get a feature movie made. But there's very little information actually shared here - it's mostly an adoring review of fandom and Joss Whedon himself - including several original songs praising the series, the creator/director/producer, etc. In the end, I found it to be a complete bore and had to force myself to watch it to the end.If you're part of Firefly fandom, you'll enjoy seeing familiar faces and putting usernames to real names.

His wonderful Plaisirs sucres looks like someone just threw each layer on top of the other without any thought for aesthetics. This repeats itself in each of the pictures. This represents the whole problem with the book. I thought I was buying a book that would help me make complicated, beautiful desserts, like in Pierre's patisserie. Instead, the products are changed to lesser quality products (using nutella instead of real Praline???, cornflakes instead of Paillete), the recipes are changed to very basic recipes, that have nothing to do with his magnificent creations. A homemakers edition for Pierre Herme, it's a shame he allowed his name to be connected with this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money.","review":"This collaboration from Herme/Greenspan offers absolutely nothing new. The recipes are trite and uninspiring. Did you notice that someone already has a copy to offer in the used department? No wonder - this book will only collect dust on your shelf. The \\"pretty\\" pictures aren't enough to justify the existence of the paper used to print them. This Greenspan \\"formula\\" cookbook doesn't work - Dorie, you've sold out! In other words, don't buy this book; you'll be sorry. I'm going to use my copy as kindling this winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This has become my favorite baking book. Whenever I need to impress, I make one of these desserts. Herme doesn't skip any steps or skimp on quality. As a result, the desserts are rich and satisfying. (My favorites are the black forest cake, the mousse, and the linzer torte. The black forest cake comes out better than that made at the local French bakery.)After you make the recipes a few times, you can easily adapt them to incorporate other flavors.It's not a beginner's book, by any means--simple things like the best way to separate eggs are not explained in this book (unusual procedures are explained, though), and most of the recipes are extremely time consuming. If you're serious about cooking, this book is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chocolate -- What Could be Better?","review":"This is a book of French-style recipes brilliantly worked so that an American home cook can make them. What could be better? I love French desserts and French chocolate -- what's not to love? -- and here I have the best of that world but carefully presented with American ingredients and familiar cooking techniques. Herme is a master chocolatier and master baker and some of his recipes are long and involved but Greenspan makes sure they are clear and easy to follow. She even points out when something can be made ahead of time. This is a valuble addition to my library -- to anyone's cookbook collection. If you love to bake, love chocolate, and appreciate good cookbooks, this is for you! Thank you, Pierre and Dorey."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect gift!","review":"This is a warm and wonderful book and a perfect gift to give to anyone who has lost a beloved dog.

I read all the reviews and thought I'd give it a try.First, most of it doesn't dissolve, so I'm not getting about 1/4 of each packet. It sticks to the glass and it just does not dissolve in any type of water, cold, cool, warm, etc. I think they could have put this in capsules, even if I had to take 3 or 4 to get the whole amt., at least I'd get it all. It also makes me sick to my stomach, and it does cause break outs. I have another box left, and I'll use them only because I already paid for them. But I don't feel any better after taking this, in fact I feel worse with stomach upset and breakouts. Maybe I'll look for some other type of Lyposomal C.

It raises the vitamin C level in the blood much higher than any other vitamin C"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't dissolve","review":"Why make a product designed to be added to cold water when it doesn't dissolve? Even as awful as it tastes I think it might make more sense to just squeeze the packet in your mouth rather than have it stuck in your glass. I'm not sure I understand all of the five star reviews. Maybe I just got a defective shipment.

Although this product is a bit expensive, it works considerably better than alternative forms of Vitamin C even at a lower dose of 1000 mg per day. Within a day of starting this product, I noticed minor flu-like symptoms which lasted only a couple of days. Afterwards, I began to feel noticeably better so keep consuming Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C. My level of energy has even increased as a result. Lastly, I don't find the taste objectionable at all. I recommend this product highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximum absorption and quality","review":"With supplements it's all about absorption and quality. Lypo-spheric has them both and I couldn't be happier with this product. So many supplements out there are just crap and aren't being absorbed.

Well, that hasn't proven to be the case for me. I get the same upset stomach with this as with other vitamin C products. I thought it might be the soy causing it, so I tried Dr. Mercola's brand of liposomal C, which is sunflower lecithin based, and had the same problem. Ester C does the same thing. I really wanted this to work, and have tried it 3 different times weeks and months apart, but got an upset stomach every time.

But I have found that I haven't had good luck getting it to stir well into cold beverages like it recommends. It doesn't completely dissolve and tastes a little \\"funky\\". I prefer doing like someone else suggested: I have a little shot glass of nice cold water, squeeze the vitamin C product into it, and then just drink it down in one swig. That way it's done fast, effectively, and I don't have to taste it as I am a little squeemish about drinking strange things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lypo-Spheric","review":"I ordered the Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C packets.

I plan to keep taking it for a while and monitor the results.Update 4 months later: I have been taking the product for four consecutive months now since the break mentioned above. I have taken one packet every morning and have not come down with any infections in that time.

It's hard to believe, but it's now been 3 months, and we wake up with this DVD every day (well M-F anyway ;)The workouts are just the right amount of effort for us non-morning people. Back Bends (Wednesday) is probably the toughest, but each session only lasts 20 minutes, and ends with Relaxation pose to put you in the right frame of mind to start your day.I would highly recommend these, especially if you are new to waking up and working out first thing. After years of trying and failing to get up and moving in the morning, I think we've finally found something that \\"stuck\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful way to start your morning!","review":"This is a wonderful yoga DVD, as are most of Rodney Yee's. I suppose if you were a very advanced yogi, this would be too basic for you, but for anyone in the beginner to intermediate range, it's a lovely way to wake up your body if you only have a short amount of time to practice in the morning. I've been practicing yoga for about 2-3 years now, and find that I can move deeper into the poses on days when I wake up feeling limber and vivacious, or can just follow the basics on mornings when that's not the case. Each of the 5 workouts is quick, about 20-25 minutes, and feels like just enough of a means to wake up my body and clear my mind for the day to come. For the price (think I paid $5.98), it can't be beat! Rodney's voice is soothing yet encouraging; just what a non-morning person like me needs first thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful","review":"A.M. Yoga is a great addition to my yoga practice. It provides 5 different sessions all of which do a great job of preparing me for meditation.

I recommend watching each session a few times and then follow along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I've been practicing yoga on and off for about five years now, and have used some of Rodney Yee's DVD's before. I just didn't care for this one. I didn't like the Grand Canyon setting, I didn't really like the music, and in my opinion, the stretches and poses were a little intense for a \\"right-out-of-bed\\" workout. It left me feeling stiff instead of limber and relaxed, and it was more difficult than I thought it would be. This is probably my fault for not going with something labeled BEGINNER or GENTLE POSES, but be ye warned: if you're looking for a gentler, more meditative start to the day, this is probably not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"Love the format - 5 short morning yoga routines. As others have said, the option for \\"minimal instruction\\" in the audio selections is awesome. Beautiful scenery, calm clear instruction, very relaxing and engaging way to start your day. I only wish the routines were a half hour instead of 20 minutes. They just feel so short to me. Highly recommended, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner to yoga","review":"I watched Yee's AM/PM Yoga at a rental property. Enjoyed it so I bought this. As a novice to yoga, I really enjoy Yee because I can attempt most of the exercises. Yee uses a soothing yet very informative narrative. Every time I use this, I hear/learn something new.

Rodney Yee DVD's are how I started my home practice and I continue to use his products and expand my yoga practice in the Iyengar method of yoga. I purchased this DVD to help develop a morning practice and have it provide variety. Every practice on the DVD is fantastic for each morning. Since practicing to this about a month ago, I have just felt better each and every day. The practices are not complex or difficult, but provide a great vehicle through which to open your body in different ways. I like how the five different practices are sequenced to start easy and then build to allow you to wake up, so to speak. Then after work I will practice to his Yoga Conditioning for Athletes or Strength Building Yoga. Great for any beginner or intermediate level yogi if you are looking for something to provide a great start to your day and/or add some different variety to your home practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to wake up","review":"I really enjoyed this DVD. I like how it gives you the choice on what to work on that morning -- twists, back bends, forward bends, etc. I usually choose my workout based on whatever is tight that morning.

Rodney Yee's calming voice is an added plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely basic","review":"I read the other reviews and find them extremely misleading!

This won't give you that gratification."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Instructor!","review":"Rodney Yee is the best yoga instructor for video that I have come across. His words are effectively translated into body commands that are almost spiritual. Too many videos that claim to be \\"yoga\\" are not close to the traditional yoga at all, but Rodney is consistently true to the art. This A.M. Yoga is great for warm-ups before an aerobic workout. Buying and using this video is one of the best things you can do for your body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip","review":"Maybe it's me but watching 8 to 10 postures over and over and over with NO narration is really NOT what I thought I was buying.

It has 5 excellent 20-25 minute yoga practices that concentrate on different poses : standing , twists , backbends , forward bends and hip openers. every practice feels complete even though it's barely 25 minutes , each one ends with shavasana. Rodney Yee has great and detailed instruction , the scenery is beautiful and the music is good , now it's my most used DVD and it's a great as add ons to other workouts or for days you don't feel like working out but want a little stretching after a long day.

If you've ever wondered why no one ever dares to sing country songs that some would consider to be \\"too country\\", well wonder no more my friend. Erin's here to show you how it's done and how to do it her way. As far as I'm concerned, she is the reigning queen of old fashioned, traditional country music. Erin can sing a country song, which satisfies my need for pure traditional country music; something I hardly hear on the airwaves anymore.

Her work would be completely forgotten if it was judged as poetry, but because she has been adopted as the ideological idol of PC fanatics everywhere, she has become an untouchable icon of the present. Rich is best compared, intellectually, to the literary drudges of Soviet Russia, who extolled the glories of the people for the Communist Party. The diffrence, obviously, is that Rich is not embraced by the State, but by the buddy system that is academic feminism. This volume, complete with the breathless worship -- oh, sorry, critical scholarly attention -- of the editor, is a very fine presentation of what is, for all practical purposes, the work of a transient figure whose prominence is entirely dependent on the current PC state of the American academic establishment.

This has saved a lot of room on my computer since avi files take up so much space. After I turn the avi files into DVDs, I won't need to keep all of them anyhow. I'll save them as DVDs which will take up less room. Also, I knew nothing about setting up an external hard drive before I purchased this.

The Motorola (H700C) is still working. You get what you pay for!So I ordered a cheap replacement hoping I would get a good one. I didn't. This unit didn't even take a charge.

And, sure enough, it broke 2 weeks in. The second included ear loop broke not long after that. And my attempts to communicate with Cardo about the problem and to get replacement ear loops were met with nothing but silence.

After listening to this though I found that I didn't really like most of the songs. Not that they were bad songs or poorly performed but that this album's collection of artists was just too eclectic for my tastes. I'm not a rap fan at all so Queen Latifah's addition wasn't my favorite and the album wasn't stickered despite Tracy Bonham's lyrics. Because of my disappointment I have to give this 2 stars. If you went to the fair and only watched the performances from performers you liked then I'd suggest trying to check this out from your local library. If you like all or most of these artists then maybe this CD is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's gone from suck to blow!","review":"Yes, that is from Spaceballs. But it's the only way to describe this cd, and most other Sarah cds. They just plain suck! (for lack of a better adjective) I thought she was whiny, once I plugged this in I wanted to choke and die. I wish I could give this LESS than one star, maybe negative somethingoranother. The songs are all obnoxious, and being live just makes it worse. Don't get this thing, please, for the sake of your sanity. Feel free to email me! BTW, who the hell was spamming this thing?

After that, I put the CD away. I recently brought it out again, put it in the CD player, and realized \\"Hey, there's some good stuff on here.\\" I didn't like it at first. Now I love it. If you are wanting to try some Lilith Fair, my advice would be to borrow this from someone... Listen to the whole thing a few times, even if you don't like it the first time. For some odd reason, it just grows on you till you are playing it nonstop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this CD just to hear ANGEL","review":"OK I HAVE GONE TO HEAVEN! HEARING SARAH AND EMMYLOU SING ANGEL TOGETHER IS WORTH EVERY PENNY YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS CD! EMMYLOU HARRIS CAN SING WITH ANYBODY AND SOUND GOOD, AND ANGEL IS ONE THE BEST SONGS EVER WRITTEN! THE OTHER TRACKS ARE OK, BUT ANGEL BLOWS ALL THE OTHER SONGS AWAY! THE HARMONIES ARE AMAZING! YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Fiction","review":"Prominent Soviet scientist falls in love with granddaughter of American President - it sounds like fodder for a best selling novel, so it's all the more remarkable for being true. Susan Eisenhower's account of her love affair with and eventual marriage to Roald Sagdeev is the fascinating story of two people defying the odds of the Cold War to make a life together. From their burgeoning courtship through the maze of beaurocracy they needed to overcome, their story is two-fold: the age-old tale of boy meets girl played out against the intricate politics of a world in transition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going rogue...","review":"Just the thing for those who want to read the memoir of a lame child of a famous family who can only catch her little bit of limelight by shocking us with her departures from the conservative, Republicanism of her famous and heroic grandfather.So granddaughter of the savior of the West in WWII marries a commie and then, when she needs another splash of attention, quits the Republican Party and endorses Barak Obama.Just another spoiled brat of political privilege making her mark by selling out the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad deal.","review":"This assorment is advertised as dimentions 11.2 oz net, shipping weight 4.2 pounds.

None of them would play on a Sony Playstation 3. Sony claims it is the movie. Mill Creek the production company, claims they haven't had any complaints about it not playing and says something must be wrong with my player. I have over 100 Blu-Rays and have since watched 4 other movies. Now remember Mill Creek are the wonderful people that gave us the butchered box set of WISEGUY. Now I need to figure out how to get my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Cusack is great!","review":"I just seen Money For Nothing and I think it was a great movie that kept me entertaining. The true story of Joey Coyle was very interesting because some people who find 1.2 million dollars out of a Armored car are shelfish enough to keep it and do goofy things to try to get away with it . This film was shot in locations I was filmilar with including the Old Airport and near monoghela river in my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA. John Cusack was just great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like John Cusack but","review":"My husband and I both like John Cusack but this movie just didn't do anything for us.

The narrators do a great job. We listened to the recordings while traveling long empty stretches of the California desert, a great backdrop, and time (and the miles) flew by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright and cheap","review":"These lights make a huuuge difference without breaking the bank . I would definitely recommend these to anyone with a TJ ."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I got this set to replace my old sylvania regular halogens (no CB, noXV, just H6024) with great hopes, since it does cost more than twice as much. Alas, as much as I would like to see Emperor's new clothes, I couldn't help but notice that it's actually DIMMER than a regular halogen. My friends have commented on the reduced brightness before even knowing that I have changed the bulb. It is painfully obvious. The light output is whiter, yes, but apparently they have made some sacrifices in achieving that color. In my opinion the reduced brightness is not worth it.Oh, on top of that, one of the lights just burned out yesterday, after less than a year of service (more like 10 months). I'm here shopping for another H6024 hence I thought I'd make a comment. Either get a real HID kit or just stick with regular halogens. These \\"high tech\\" halogens are not going to defy physics of halogen lamps. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sealed beams","review":"I just finished installing these beams on my Porsche 944. They are nicely bright and I feel safer driving at nighttime, they are noticeably brighter than my previous beams, whiter in color and project further. I don't expect these to have a very long lifespan however. Hella makes a better product, but it's cost vs. quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent replacement Headlight","review":"I read several review that said this was a good replacement for Jeeps factory Headlights that seem to be dim. I couldn't agree more. It puts out more light than the original lights and it's whiter in color. This is a must have upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Purchased a pair of these for a Jeep TJ, I have always used silverstar bulbs in all of my vehicles because they do offer a brighter, whiter light just as advertised. These are no different. Have used them for about 6 months now and just noticed one of them had condensation inside of it.. somehow the seal has been compromised and water got in. I checked for cracks and did not find any so I am replacing one already. The price is right considering a pair will run you just under 40 bucks, for the actual bulb and a new lens and reflector compared to the newer style plastic piece of crap lights most cars now use that will cost you about the same for just the bulb and you are stuck with that cheap, foggy and faded plastic lens and dirty reflector."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed twice","review":"the first time the bell set came the low D Flat was broken off.

There is another brand that has all the keys screwed on, I wish I had gotten more of those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book.....Don't understand how it was ever published.","review":"This book is poorly organized and suffers from a lack of proper editing. It's a ra-ra book for women in their 50's, but the friendship adventures are fairly boring. Throughout the book, there are poetry passages....actually some of the best writing. Otherwise, it's a badly written composition of disconnected stream-of-conscienceness experiences. It contains many, very lengthy boring descriptions that should have been replaced by more interesting dialog. Only at the end do you find out that the author had a difficult life and survived through family love and friendship.....Two very important messages for which you only had to read one or two chapters, not the entire confusing, boring book! It's hard to believe that anyone would have spent any money to publish this book! It needs so much work!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is the first album I have from this band and I must say that it is superb. Some great lyrics and you can tell that real emotion has gone into this production. Kinda reminds me of some of Third Eye Blind's better stuff (not their radio crap) which is a sound I have been looking for for a long time. Give it a shot, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"More magic from the Cast","review":"I was turned onto the Cast by a buddy who is a personal friend of the singer, so I'm admittedly somewhat biased towards them... but I would have become a fan anyway.There aren't many bands out there that can use music to weave a story, and do it well. With Two Conversations they not only did it, they brought two stories together and did it with a style and grace that you rarely see. Maybe they went a little pop on this album, but so what? It's not like the departure Beck made going from Odelay to Midnite Vultures.And if anyone gets the chance to see them live, take it! The Cast sound fantastic in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its NOT powder if you get it from 360Living","review":"Even though the picture states Henna Powder, I received a henna cream from the seller 360Living.

I'm not the usual mystery fan but I liked this book because it creates interesting characters that are multidimensional and it presents lots of interesting herb lore. You learn from this novel and you also have an interesting ride on the search for a killer. Her details on the modern religion of Wicca are well informed and grounded in reality. I've shared this book with several friends who enjoyed it thoroughly. We are now moving on to her other books with great anticipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable Halloween-themed mystery.","review":"...The author deftly solves most of the problems with alot of interesting herb lore.

Contains nothing you wouldn't find in other common texts, only there it is better explained. Fails miserably in problem-solving techniques. Very poorly structured. ZERO stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two beautifully complementary voices","review":"I first became interested in British folk music in the early '80s, and a friend introduced me to a number of songs from this album. Ever since, the voices of Tim Hart and Maddy Prior have symbolized for me what's best about folk vocals.The best-known track on this CD is probably \\"Fiddler's Green\\". I have since heard many other renditions of the song, but none has even come close to Hart and Prior for sheer beauty. Tim Hart's voice features most prominently in that song, and in general features more prominently on this CD than on Volume 1. Maddy Prior's voice is certainly indispensible here, but she plays more of a supporting role in most of the tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PRODUCT - DO NOT BUY","review":"My husband and I ordered this as a stand for the baby monitor and lamp in our son's nursery. It is horribly constructed. The doors do not line up correctly. The screws included in the package break if you do a basic tightening on them. Numerous parts (screws and what-not) broke. We ended up needing to use wood glue to finish the construction. Needless to say, it will NOT be in our son's nursery since it is such a poor piece of furniture. It will work for us to organize dog leases and food bowls, but that's about it.Do yourself a favor and find a better product.

I found that it offered a whole lot of different crafts, with really quite basic information for each one. My main hobby is knitting, and I learned nothing here that I did not already know from my simplest books. It essentially gives one option for each task at hand in each craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely worthless, way too expensive, no real \\"finishing\\" at all","review":"As you can see from my reviews, of the hundreds of needlework books I own this is one of my worst reviews. So you can see how poorly illustrated the stitches are, I have included in Images above, 3 pages. I absolutely defy you to be able to decipher the steps of the stitches. You usually can't even see a needle! Whenever I see a stitch encyclopedia or dictionary, I always see how it covers bullions as these are among the least intuitive and difficult stitches in hand embroidery. Here, there is only a picture of the final bullion with not one diagram! Impossible. Very, very few of the stitches are shown in context with the fabric or just \\"what\\" is being finished. And in a compendium of finishing, I expected to how to finish a pillow or curtains or frame a piece of embroidery. Nothing like that here. As another reviewer indicated, the costs for new and used volumes here are extortionist for what you get. Not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, as long as you dont use Amazon's sellers","review":"I have only briefly looked through this book, but I love what I have seen so far. The instructions are brief but thorough, the illustrations helpful and accurate. Definitely a good purchase. A word of caution, do not use any of Amazon's sellers. After recovering from the heart attack I had after seeing the prices listed, I went to Interweave's website and purchased an ebook edition for $20.00. Spending over $200.00 for a new book, or $80.00 for a used book, makes absolutely no sense at all to me, even to have a hard copy on had.

He was a very complex person and a great physicist. This book reflects that more than others about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous scientific biography","review":"I have ofter wondered about Dirac who I consider the mystery man of quantum physics.

Anyone who spends a day with a toddler or knows the struggle they have with autonomy and sharing...will understand. So many adults are troubled by this book because it shows a child hitting another child (The part kids want to look at and hear over and over again!....It's like looking in a mirror or reading a good book and going 'wow, someone understands me!' This book was introduced to me by a play therapist. She said kids need to see the struggles they face so that they have that validation that it is okay to struggle with autonomy and go through the \\"it's mine\\" phase. Still, most parents want to sanitize childhood and are uncomfortable with Barbo Lindgren's books. I wonder if that's why it is no longer in print in this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is NOT about compromise!!!","review":"I was compelled to write my own review of this book, because I didn't want any other mothers who were looking for books on sharing to make the same mistake that I did.
