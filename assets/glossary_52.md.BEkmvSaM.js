Certainly the little girl So Mi was great - with dialog you don't find in dumbed down American films. The anti-hero is great! And, his martial adversary was excellent as well - without words the bad-guy portrayed a complex relationship, a split within himself and a respect for the anti-hero. No doubt it will someday be remade here in the U.S. Steven Segal is too old and fat though the concept of defending children would be appealing to him. Leave this one to be ruined by Tom Cruise.

It has made my list of movies I could watch it again. For a two hour movie, every event and character had its place and meaning. Usually in a movie gratutious sex, the explosion of some object, or some other event is thrown in for no reason. Everything in this movie moved it along and played on your emotions. The storyline was well thought out, the pacing was perfect, and reached its conclusion in a fantastic fashion. A good movie also makes you care about the characters and the situations they are experiencing. This has it all. The last half hour of the movie held my interest to a peak. I could watch that part alone many times. This is a movie & \\"I Saw Devil\\" will definitely add to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Great Acting","review":"Definitely one of the best movies!

Call me crazy, but would some fight scenes be too much to ask for in an \\"action movie?\\"Now, mind you. This guy, Won Bin, was rather attractive, but that's really all I got from this film. I didn't even get his whole relationship with the little girl. He acted like he just had to go and save her, but he barely knew her. Even she was surprised to see him coming to save her. Ridiculous.

The box says that it is Mac compatible, but upon further review, you see that it is only compatible for Mac if you are trying to download pictures, not video. If that's all I wanted it for, I'd have bought a digital camera. The TRV27 works much better, is more ergonomic, has a bigger LCD screen, and is compatible with most if not all home computers. To the makers of Sony - why come out w/micro mv if there isn't any supporting hardware/software? As far as I'm concerned, the IPB-7T is merely a ... paperweight!!P.S.

I have attempted downloading on FOUR SONY PCs (2 running Windows 2000, and two running XP and failed every single time. I returned the camera to Circuit City after 24 hours of frustration.

The resolution is awful - all you have to do is look at footage on a TV and you'll see what i mean.Another HUGE disadvantage - MPEG2 encoding - NONE, I MEAN NONE, of the software NLE's (non-linear editors) support MPEG2 - so therefore, you can't use Premier, Final Cut Pro, etc...you are forced to use this 2-bit software app that Sony put out. It's awful. I tried it. It's painful.

Is Inger Lorre that mean spirited and bitter that she would subjugate her diehard fans to this mess?? Apparently so. With Transcendental Medication ,the former front woman for The Nymphs breaks new ground in the territory of crappy solo debuts. The songs are slow and painful, her qualms come off as whiny and prissy at best, and the melodies are dreadfully flat. The real pity of this album is not that it sucks, but that it was eagerly anticipated for such a long time. The Nymphs were easily one of the most unduly unrecgonized bands of the early nineties. Their debut (and only) album was a success from first song to last and a distinct pleasure in the realm of mundane music.

I'm very pleased. From the very first track to the last you are taken on a ride that brings out several emotions. I get emotionaly exhausted by the time I'm through listening to it. My personal favorites are She's not your friend, which is a personal(and in my opnion, justified) attack on Courtney Love in regard to what she did to one of Inger's best friends. It's a deep dark song which showcases Inger's haunting vocal abilties. My other personal favorite is Beautiful Dead.

Practically all the songs sound the same and the lyrics are drawn out and ridiculous. Is Lorre really breaking any new ground droning on about the consumption of halluncinogenic drugs? I think not. Should the consumer plop down fifteen dollars on this albulm when there are so many more satisfying choices on the market? I think not.

I recently wrote a paper on gender anatomy in the 18th and 19th century, and this book was my main resource. Laqueur has a clear and well written style as he describes the different theories on gender and sex throughout the ages and the rammifications of these theories in terms of culture and interpersonal relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"This book is covered with many glowing reviews. What none of them mention is that the author cannot write an intelligible sentence. Sometime in the 80's, perhaps due to the influence of that patent charlatan Derrida, it became fashionable to write lengthy, tortuous sentences using strings of polysyllabic undefined non-words. This book is firmly in that tradition. There may actually be valuable content here, but it's impossible to get at without subjecting yourself to a hideous reading experience. The author, like others in this prose tradition, seems unaware that his style invalidates his content. If he can't be bothered to write a clear sentence, why should we assume that his thoughts are clear? This book is a great opportunity wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aero Paws Smmal Inflatable dog airbed","review":"I purchased the airbed for my 18 pound dog. He has slept with me in at least three Areo Air mattresses for 8 years and I have never had an issue of his paws going through the mattress. The dog airbed seeped air and was flat by the time I arrived home from work, 10 hours later. So I returned it. I want a maintenance free bed; not a bed that I have to tend to every day. Someone said it was just a bad air mattress. I was relutant, but puchased anyway and wished I had not as it was worse than the first one. I was told to call the service department with Coleman to see if there is a trick to making the air stay in the airbed. Nothing helped; I received a refund for both air beds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot of pages, little use","review":"Designing enterprise apps in vb for a large cellular company, I can't tell you the number of times I got stuck in code, looked for the answer in this book, and after wasting 10 minutes picked up one of the other vb books and found the answer.

I had already taken a class in VB and had wanted to go to The Next Level. I picked up this book because it seemed to cover alot and it had the most pages (which I thought meant it had the most info). The author basically hits you from both sides, he doesn't explain the code well and he doesn't print the full code in the book. This causes you to have to keep going back to the CD and figure out the code by yourself which is annoying. Moreover, he tends to begin explaining something and then move on to something else without finishing the explaination. I did eventually get through the whole book but that was only because I'm a CS major and have had the concepts explained to me before in other Programming languages. But I wouldn't suggest this book for anyone, for experienced programmers the constant errors will drive you mad and beginners won't be able to understand it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many mistakes in this book","review":"I could not read past the first chapter in this book. There was one mistake after another. The text would say one thing, and the Illustrations would show something different, there were obvious programming errors all through the text (he would tell you to name the button bttnGame, then he would show you the code for it's click event and it would be a function called ShowGame_Click()). He shows code comparing a Double variable to a quoted string, he uses + for string concatenation in some places, and & in others, he names buttons \\"ClearBttn\\", \\"Plus\\" and \\"bttnMath\\" (no consistant naming convention). It really appears that this book was rushed to press without having been even breifly proof read"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many mistakes. Makes one want to rip her/his hair out.","review":"This book had so many coding mistakes in it. Even the corrected code samples on Sybex's Web site had bugs in them. I spent so many days and sleepless nights trying to learn and get the samples working. Half the time, or more, the author would start explaining how a project's code works; and then he'd just go onto something else without finishing what he'd started.

I didn't really get a lot out of it. Now that I've used a language professionally (ASP/JavaScript/VBScript) I have a much better grasp and I am able to get a lot out of the book. A book with this many pages is bound to miss covering certain topics in detail--I don't think it is possible to completely cover VB in one book anyway. Buy this book if you have programming knowledge. As far as the editing mistakes: I have a library of 50 large technical books, all of which were rushed to market and have dozens of errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not mastering but good beginner's guide","review":"This book is a good beginner's guide with a lot of examples, but it won't help you that much in real VB development, because the coverage of OOP and database technologies - two skills every intermediate VB developer should have - is poor and unprofessional. Thanks to author I Laughed Out Loud when discovered that drawing shapes and circles is 'Advanced Visual Basic'. Being a VB instructor some time ago I know that all this colors and shapes are attractive only for people starting their road in programming. This book may be good only for people who don't know about 'Common Dialog Control' or still think that it's a part of 'Advanced Visual Basic' too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy a different book","review":"I have to rate this book low. The organization of the book is lacking, the index is incomplete, and the examples are poor and inadequate. You would think a book this large would be more complete. Many topics are missing. For example, I use visual basic for many file i/o operations and this book does not mention one thing about file i/o. There are better books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Make a Good Door Stop","review":"I am relatively new to VB programming. I purchased this book because of the great reviews. What a mistake. The author glosses over topics, which I feel, should be covered in more depth, especially for the beginner. I wracked my brain trying to figure out the bad code examples used in this book. I try to purchase books from Amazon with at least 4.5 to 5 stars, and for the most part, I have been very satisfied.

Yeah right!","review":"Finished \\"Teach Yourself VB 5.0 in 21 days\\" last year, it was a fantastic book for beginners, and I was ready to step further, then I bought this book for my reference. Boy, this book is very confusing! Go to Chapter 17, for example (page 923), and do the data entry project. I spent hours trying to figure out, why the code just wouldn't work and I always got error messages for undefined variables! Finally, I use the CD to view the codes, and I found out that there were MANY procedures that weren't not on the book at all! NO WONDER! Thanks a lot! The author jumps around different topics, does not even bother to finish the darn project!If you want to learn VB, go for Teach yourself VB 5.0 in 21 days, and buy something else when you're done, DON'T TOUCH THIS BOOK! I don't understand why others gave 5 stars, did you guys even try the codes? You will change your ratings if you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible book for the beginner","review":"I picked up this book because an initial scan through the contents gave it the appearance that it covered more material than others and would be good as a beginner book and also as a reference book later. Unfortunately, there are just so many errors (in the code samples and the text) that I think a beginner programmer would get completely lost. If you are already an adept programmer, than this may be an ok book (well, maybe not for its price), but I think that there are plenty of better books out there. But if you can't recognize an error such as \\"the size of an array indexed from 0 to 49 is 49\\", then DON'T BUY THIS BOOK; go with one of the Sam's Teaching VB books."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the novice to the seasoned professional","review":"I am SQL Server DBA, but many times I referenced this book to help me write front-end applications for our end-users.

Many of my co-workers (vb application developers) come by my desk to lookup things in this book on a regular basis. Although, the book is large by volume, it is easy to find things and the indepth paragraphs take you step-by-step. Not to mention the price is right from Amazon.com. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A colossal waste of time, money, wood pulp...","review":"This book was a huge disappointment to me.

I am so thankful that one did come off because on the back of the label it states that these CAN NOT be used in a toaster oven NOR can you use them to broil - both uses of which I intended.

It is stunning visually, which anyone can see just leafing casually through it. But it is also a stunning journalistic accomplishment. This is not the first time Cobb has gone behind the closed doors of female society. She did a story for National Geographic, where she is a staff photographer, on Arab women. Like the Geisha book, it was an intimate and loving look at the lives of women usually hidden from us behind veils. The Geisha book gives us way more than the superficial beauty shots that usually pass for a look at Geisha life. We see them (quite literally) with their hair down. Which is, after all, what good journalism does. Enjoy the book just for the art if you like. Cobb takes photos with handheld, 35mm cameras using nothing but available light and makes them look like the work of a Flemish master.

Then maybe the Spencer series would take off again.Incidentally, if you are interested in reading some contemporary detective writers who are actually producing good work, try Michael Connelly or Robert Crais. And, if you want to see why Spencer is so popular, read some of Robert Parker's earlier works like Catskill Eagle or Double Deuce."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Was Revenge Served?","review":"I am a fairly good fan of the Spenser/Hawk books. At least I know what to expect concerning dialogue, etc. I even know what kind of shoes the characters wear.This one was fairly predictable. Hawk spoke more Ebonics than usual and of course had to lose his intelligent African-American girlfriend.This time Hawk and Boots, the Ukrainian mob boss, were main protagonists.After the climax of the story, Boots should have been left for a subsequent novel.Parker often has characters reappear in subsequent books.The Gray Man showed up in this one. Boots could have shown up in a sequel, because the final interaction between Hawk and Boots in this book was never fully explained. I think Chapters 58-61 would have made more sense in a later book, with explanation, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alas, A Lackluster Effort","review":"Despite a strong review in the Sunday N.Y. Times Book Review, and despite a nice-if-predictable premise (i.e., Spenser's sidekick, Hawk, gets mortally wounded but summons his strength to eventually do payback), this entry in an overall great series is unfortunately a lackluster effort. Just feels tired and played out. A lot of the action happens offstage, which I suppose is supposed to be refreshing, but only feels unsatisfying. Parker's recent baseball novel about Jackie Robinson was excellent, one of his signature books, so it's not like he doesn't have the chops anymore. Maybe Mr. Parker needs to take a little time off from his annual \\"Spenser\\" output & build up a creative head of steam for a bigger, better Spenser magnum opus a few years down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Least in the Spenser Series","review":"I listened to this book on a CD. I hated the narrator especially when he was suppose to be Hawk. Hawk speaking in Afican American dialect really grated on me. It was so phoney. The story wasn't much either. The humor was pathetic. Everything about this book annoyed me. Poor story, stupid humor, and unappealing characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"I give up, I can't finish this book. Never got into it. Fortunetly I took it out of the library, so all I am is disappointed and not upset at wasting my money (only some of my time). Usually I like Robert B. Parker's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad is good","review":"A bad Spenser novel is still better than most genre competitors. To make a long story short (unlike some of the reviewer/author wanna-bes...), Parker's publisher has narrowed his margins and over-leaded his sentences. Parker, himself is producing fewer words (Some of the pages look like lists of words!). Spare writing is starting to look like lack of ideas or boredom. This should be published as a novelette or a long short story. Still, I look forward to each new novel. Come on Bob, a little more writing for our money! Please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SPENSER ** BOOK THIRTY TWO","review":"Book 32 in this fine series is so so. Thought there would be much more violent but was dissappointed.

Series slipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert B Parker","review":"another excellent book by Mr. Parker. Too bad he has passed, the Spenser character is enthralling.I like the Amazon download but these Kindle books are about 4 dollars too much for a down load."},{"rating":"1","title":"All right...Maybe","review":"Hard to say. This is the third novel I've read. This one caused me to work to finish it. I just could not get that interested in it. The other two were Ok but this one didn't really deliver. At least for me. The coldness of the Hawk is good in a Novel but I have never seen anyone that tough. I have known some tough ones. Then a lawyer taking his whole career into jeprody to help his freind seemed a little make beleive. I hope he can do a little better in the future. If not this could be my last one of his to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parker at his endgame?","review":"In my opinion, Cold Service is a mere shadow of the kind of writing Robert B. Parker did at some earlier points in his career. That said, looking back, I have to admit that I now believe Parker has always been overrated by many readers, including me.In this novel, Spenser and Hawk are reduced to little more than their usual macho bravado and banter. There's just not much substance here, and more unfortunate, not much entertainment value either. Has Parker gotten lax in success? or has he just burned out or run out of ideas? As much as I've enjoyed a few of his earlier works, he really wasn't that great to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"New to Spenser? Do yourself this favor:","review":"Do what I did when I discovered Spenser at the library (at age 12):Go to the library, check out all of the first eleven books. Here they are, in order, from memory:The Godwulf ManuscriptGod Save the ChildMortal StakesPromised LandThe Judas GoatLooking for Rachel WallaceEarly AutumnA Savage PlaceCeremonyThe Widening GyreValedictionThank your personal deity for these eleven. And then do NOT read any of the others. They are reflex actions, increasing unimaginative, self-congratulatory and boring. If you persist, you'll learn what I did, the hard way: the magic is gone for good. And the person responsible for it, and apparently utterly oblivious to it, is Robert B. Parker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable","review":"I listened to the audio version of this. I thought the plot was boring and the dialog annoying. Wanted to quit several times (which I rarely do), and although I didn't, I know I wouldn't have missed any enjoyment if I had. Not at all a page turner to me. Although I liked Spencer's witty, terse dialog in other Spencer books, in this one it was mostly predictable or uninteresting. The constant \\"He said\\", and \\"I said\\" was irritating. I'd recommend passing on this one. There are so many better books to read that this one is not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Spenser and Hawk","review":"I have read all of Robert Parker's Spenser books and have been a great fan of the character and Mr. Parker's way with conversation. But this latest adventure is tired, trite and recycled. As someone in another review said; the conversations between Hawk and Spenser and between Susan and Spenser have become tiring and repetitive. What was fresh and amusing and thoughtful has become worn and old.Ukrainians owning and controlling a town of 80,000 people. An Afghan warlord supplying heroin. FBI and CIA contributing to the mixture. Cold blooded, callous murder and too many references to friendship.The story line is convoluted and the denouement quite unbelievable.What I wouldn't give to see a book that had the excitement, perception and intelligence of his early works!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME-SAME-SAME","review":"TYPICAL PARKER---IT'S ALL IN THERE---SAME OLD--SAME OLD---SAME OLD.BBBUUUTTT-----WHAT IS GOOD ABOUT READING A PARKER \\"\\"SPENSER\\"\\" ???THEY ARE JUST FUN TO READ---FOR A BREAK---NOTHING SERIOUS---JUST FUN."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish this one. don't care what happens","review":"Now I must admit that I'm not a big fan of the he-man black-white buddy-cop revenge and testosterone filled genre, but even so, this would not have even made the cut as a Law and Order episode. Clever dialogue??? \\"Beer tastes better with a head on it\\" what?? and all the recipies included? Gimme a break! It's like he was trying to make this book appealing to the ladies. Won't work, my friend. Anyway, I can guess what happens at the end ... Spenser somehow gets back at the \\"Grey man\\" for shooting him up, right? Anyway, I don't really care ... I think I need a good chick book right now to compensate for all the grunting in Cold Service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooorrrrrrrring!","review":"I couldn't believe this warmed-over Spenser novel. I was a big fan of the series early on, but it's just slid downhill over the years. The early novels had wit and charm, but these just seem like a couple of lame old guys going through their tired old \\"white guy black guy\\" routine.Here's a fact for you: BOTH Susan and Hawk use the line \\"Another fine mess you've gotten us into, Ollie.\\" What, was Parker watching Laurel and Hardy or something while he was writing this? Have Hawk and Susan gotten so boring, old-fashioned and culturally similar that they quote 1920's movie stars? Or is Parker just phoning this crap in for another paycheck?Whatever it is, this one stinks. The characters and situations are hacknyed, the action dull, the dialog leaden. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's it....I can't take it anymore","review":"This is absolutely the last Parker book for me. The first 24 Spenser novels were masterpieces, then things started to go down hill. It's clear that Parker has been on autopilot since then. This latest installment was disappointing, to say the least. If you're like me and really enjoyed the earlier Spenser books, try the Elvis Cole series by Robert Crais."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting worse and worse ...","review":"The last Parker I'll pay money for.

I was drawn back in with reviews saying this was his best novel in years. It wasn't. The dialogue and plot was so unbelievable and boring I couldn't finish it. It's time to wrap up Silverman and Spenser forever and take Hawk with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough","review":"If Parker can't produce the quality of the early part of the Spenser series, he should just end it. What has happened to the wonderfully caustic wit and dry humor? I have no idea why he continues to have Hawk speaking as though he just came from the cotton fields and not just for an occasional mocking \\"sho nuff\\" but every other line. I've purchased my last Parker book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"I have to agree with my fellow reviewers that gave this booka less than stellar review.First time, it was Spenser that got shot, and need to recover.This time, it's Hawk that got shot and need to recover and seekrevenge.Even the opening quote (from \\"Kill Bill\\" from Star Trek) hasbeen done before. That was immediately a bad/warning sign forme.Even the dialog in the book are getting boring and repetitive.I am not going to discuss the details of the book, because therereally aren't that much to write about.

Very distracting and lazy writing.Most disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Tired Entry in the Series","review":"I am a big fan of the Spenser novels, and have read every one, but this entry is dreadful. The conversations between Spenser and Susan, always annoying, are just retreads of every conversation they have ever had. And how many times can Spenser and Hawk have the same exact, word-for-word, shucking and jiving dialogue. We know Spenser is a honkie, and we know Hawk can speak both ghetto and condo. Can an author sue himself for plagiarism?There ia almost nothing to recommend this one, except that there are very few words per page, so you can finish it fast. I don't even think Robert B. Parker was interested. Maybe next time we can hae Spenser investigate a crime, or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've been a Parker fan from the first, but he's in a rut the last 5 or 6, recycling plots, cartoon characters, and the same old psychoanalysis exchanges with Susan & Hawk, which I'm thoroughly tired of. After this one, I doubt I'll bother with another, unless I'm totally desperate for a fix of junk reading, and stumble across a paperback in a used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Done That","review":"I, too, am getting tired of Parker's plots and characters. First, they are elongated short-stories; second, this particular novel is but a theme already used by the author - \\"a bunch of bad guys, let's get 'em\\" - and; third, the unchanging same-old-same-old relationship between Spenser and Susan is getting to be boring, tiring, and unrealistic; fourth, why does every woman who sees or meets Hawk want to bed him immediately? Is he so obviously the \\"Stud of the Century\\"? Well, pardon me while l go off to read Ian Rankin, Peter Robinson, Reginald Hill et al..and then joyfully re-read Colin Dexter and Ross MacDonald. They are, among a few others, the truly great ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored","review":"I have been a big Parker fan for years but his Spenser books seem to get more and more boring. Good thing I bought this one used and didnt pay full price for it. The dialogue is so boring it is hard to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"I couldn't agree more with the reviewer from Orange County. This latest Spenser novel is filled with the same old tired formula -- repeated cliches, predictable dialogue between Spenser and Hawk, Spenser and Susan, etc. I could almost guess what the forthcoming paragraph was going to read before I read it. Parker seems to take the short-cut on this effort, relying solely on his gift with conversational prose, but not delivering on the plot, characters, fresh ideas, and new sequences. Even his settings (i.e. North Shore, MA) are getting quite stale. I hate to say it, as I've been a fan from way back, but Cold Service reads like he wasn't even interested in his own story. It's not even close to his best and will probably be the last time I purchase a Spenser hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"VSwan's Review","review":"I just wanted to say what a great movie I thought this was.

I bought it to help make room for boxed items (mac n cheese, instant potatoes, etc) and it's too flimsy to use for that purpose, forget about tyring to put canned goods on it.I am returning it.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I ordered this rack for the back of my bathroom door, but it ended up sitting in my garage now.First,the quality of the material that this rack is made of is poor. It's that thin, light, metal thing covered in white paint, which you see mostly in hardware store. I don't even have a fancy bathroom. Most of my bathroom stuff are from Target, but this rack still doesn't look good in my bathroom.Second, as one reviewer pointed out, unless you are willing to drill several holes and put in screws in your door, this rack won't stay and will swing when you open the door each time. The worst part is that things will fall off from the back of this rack when it swings away from the door. Particularly because the rack itself is not heavy, when you put on something slightly heavier, it easily falls off.It does give lots of storage place, but I would only use it for garage or storage spaces where I don't care of the look and can fasten the rack onto the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable!","review":"I got this for the kitchen closet but it doesn't take the heavy stuff.

I must say that I love it so far. I tried hanging it with out the screws which is not an option as no matter how gentle you are it will slide side-to-side and fall off the door or spill your items on the floor. So long as you can use the screws to secure it then it is a great inexpensive option.I haven't tried using the bottom 3 shelves connecting since securing with screws, but I wasn't too impressed with the design of the bottom.

Nothing fancy but certainly sturdy enough for my purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I would have read all of the reviews!","review":"The description mentioned that it could be used to store cans. Had I read the reviews I would have known that this was not the case. Five cans were enough to bring the whole thing down. The design is horrible for storing pantry items that have any weight. I think the description is misleading and should be revised.Rather than screw holes to affix it to a door, the wire has a bend in it which is supposed to hold the shelf, but as soon as you put something on the shelf, it pops off the screws and starting swinging. For twice the price, I will go back and buy one that is sturdy and secure.At the price for the product and the cost for return shipping, it isn't worth the bother to try to send it back, so we are going to try to find a way to modify it and attach it to the walls in our pantry. Hopefully we will find a way to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Needs contant readjustment and stuff falls all the time!","review":"The title says it all. The shelf slides all over the hooks at the top and all the stuff falls out. There is a good 4 inch gap at some spots so stuff falls begind the shelf. Poorly designed and a waste of money.

Just a couple of days afterwards when I decided to rearrange the order in which I had my items on the rack, the \\"hook\\" part that fits over the door almost completely straightened out and the whole rack almost hit the floor.

It's really cheap, just some thin wires, and sways a lot. Also, the side eats into the measurement so even though it says 19 inches wide, there is only less than 16 inches of actual shelf space, a really poor design concept.

I do not recommend anyone to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT as pictured, LOUSY buy","review":"The storage rack I received was in 2 parts, which was fine. I'm used to that. I just used some Command hooks to help stabilize the shelves so they wouldn't swing out when I opened or shut the door. The REAL problem is that the top of the rack I received is curved. It may be decorative, but just precisely how am I supposed to hang a shelf unit by 2 over-the-door hangers on a CURVE? The hangers slide around, the rack shifts, and one of my Command hooks has already broken off because of the shifting weight. This was a LOUSY $20 shelf, and I wish I had realized it when I still had the packaging so I could send this piece of garbage back. If you buy one of these, check the top before you hang it! If it's flat, fine, you got a good rack. If it's curved, send it back immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I bought this product to use as additional storage space in my tiny apartment.

I had hoped to store my rice and staples on it, but within 2 weeks of purchase, the top had warped and bent under the weight of the products placed. I believe that if you were to bold it in, it may work better, but I specifically bought it for the over the door purpose. I am now only using the top half of the rack and for items that do not weigh more than a roll of toilet paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Ordered this to hang seasonings on the inside of my pantry door, and I was very pleased with the end result. It added a lot of additional space (which I really needed) and helped to make the pantry more organized and easily accessible. We used the screws to attach the storage baskets directly to the door, vs hanging it from the hooks that came with it. By screwing it to the door I didn't have to worry about the baskets moving or things falling out when I opened or closed the door. Great product! Im glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solution!","review":"I read all of the reviews before I placed my order, so I knew what I was getting into. This is a good solution for my needs (inside a closet in my kitchen to use as pantry storage). I did bolt it into the door vs. using the over the door hooks b/c it is in 2 pieces and would swing wildly if you just did over the door, plus the baskets don't go up in the back so as it swung, stuff would fall out. Again, I knew all of that going into this purchase, so I planned to bolt it to the door. Once bolted, it works great! I was pleasantly surprised that the baskets are wider than I expected and can hold larger items than I planned to store. It's working out well for me and is seeming to hold up well - I have it loaded down with cans and containers of bulk foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Any seller who markets this item should be ashamed. Worthless, flimsy piece of junk, fit only for lightest weight items such as ziplock bags, and then only IF you find a way to secure it to the door so that it doesn't flop all over the place when you open and close the door. I wanted this item as extra storage for for canned goods; but it bends & flexes under the weight of even one or two heavier items. Too much bother and expense to send it back. I definitely feel \\"had.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Was hoping this would help to make more room in the pantry and it does with lighter items that can go on the rack.

I was hoping this would do the trick like hers to get my many big spice jars out of our tiny cupboard. Wrong idea!The over the door hooks are too large for my newer interior doors. The design of the hooks that attach the two rack pieces together is stupid because it just makes the racks stick out. It comes with screws to secure it to the door, but as a renter, that is why I sought an over the door rack- so I wouldn't put any holes in the door! If I could put holes in the door, I would have gotten the permanent mounted racks, not some swinging piece of junk!The shelves are rated for 5 pounds each.

Maybe if it is mounted onto the door it would be an option but even then - it needs more wire something on the back. Everytime the door opens stuff is everywhere. Makes no sense. The rack needs some sort of a back bar to help hold stuff.

However, it does hold all my spices and then some!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very stable; expensive for what it is","review":"First of all, I mis-measured, so this turned out to be too wide for the hall closet, where I intended to use it. Plan B was the bedroom closet, where it fits fine. However, as other reviewers have noted, this unit swings and bangs against the door when you open it. You could, of course, screw it to the door, if you wanted to damage the door. Better would be if there were some kind of extension that would allow you to hook it under the door as well as over the top of the door. Because this is a 2-piece unit, it is particularly unstable where they connect. Putting anything heavy on the shelves makes the unit more unstable. Perhaps the best use is for such things as rolled up T-shirts and other lightweight items. Small things, though, would fall through the mesh. For most applications, an over-the-door unit with plastic pockets (such as for inserting shoes) would work better and be much cheaper than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"This works great for items that are short like canned goods.

It may not be as heavy as previous releases, but to not even give it a chance would be a crime.For me personally, I happen to LOVE this album.

The acting in this film is quite good most of the time. The story is good enough to keep you interested. The problem with this film is the poor direction and photography. It seems like these guys only had one lens with one focal length. All of the hockey action in this film is ruined by poor camerawork and a lack of imagination. It's like they shot the hockey scenes in a rush cause they couldn't afford more rink time or something. It completely ruined what could have been a great indie flick.

Assuming she's telling the truth -- and that's a huge assumption -- I feel badly for the author, but if her goal was to help convert her people, I think this book will not help in that effort. No faithful Mormon is going to be convinced -- will in fact be repelled. As an apologetical book it fails.

I didn't enjoy this book from her as I have her other publications, because it was so critical of a religion she formerly thought fit her lifestyle and faith. Why write a book that tears down what you have obviously supported? Why a book that tears down a religion at all? If I stopped believing in my faith, I would think it more natural for me to extol the new faith I was presently embracing. It's an interesting book, though its purpose is flawed. In this world of political correctness shouldn't we have tolerance for others beliefs? We live a country that was founded on religious beliefs and infact is the most devout in the Christian world. But because I am a Christian and don't believe in another religion, I don't believe it gives me the expertise necessary to thwart that religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"one sided","review":"Its amazing to me what people consider to be truth, and honesty. You have a very one sided view of one persons perspective, and somehow many people consider it truth and honesty. This woman has created her world with her words and fully believes it to be true, but then she can only see her world with her eyes. In my experience truth is subject to interpretation. It is not an absolute. And I have also found that my words create worlds, create realities for me, and that my memories can be twisted by my words - that ANYONE'S memory can be twisted by words.

My answer: not really.Although there were a few things that gave me pause about Ms. Beck's story, I'll cite one example. Throughout the book I consistently admired the relationship between Martha and John. At the end of the book when Beck updates the reader on several of the people in the novel I was wishing for an update on Mr. Beck. The reader was only left to assume that they were happily living in Phoenix.As such, I was very suprised to read that John and Martha divoriced over 10 years ago--about the same time that the events described in \\"Leaving the Saints\\" draw to a close. The details of the Beck's divorice is not my business, but at the same time, a reader would NEVER gather that the Beck's were on the verge of divorice from the way she portrays their relationship in the book.It makes me wonder how honest the picture that Martha Beck paints really is...P.S. I am not Morman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaving the saints","review":"As a non-Mormon who grew up in Salt Lake City, attending the lds church until I was 14 (although not baptized at age eight), I am constantly interested in stories of this type. Many, if not all, stories about people leaving \\"the church\\" are written by women. Martha's story is not so different .... All are inspirational.

I have been reading her articles in O magazine for years and had gotton a lot out of her two life coaching books: Follow Your North Star and Steering by Starlight.

I was disappointed to read that she did neither. I have left the LDS church, so you would think I'd welcome this book, but I found it to be flimsy and stereotypical for both the people of Utah and New England- both are dear to my heart. I've experienced some bizzare episodes while living in Utah, but none of them are the \\"beyond reality\\" episodes Beck describes. While I enjoy her narrative style and can relate to SOME of the cultural references and experiences, the book spun out of control and cast a bad light on those of us who have left the church for justifiable reasons- yes, there are some!

Some of the very same public censure Ms. Beck talks of, is the same I experienced growing up in a conservative small Texas town. I don't think it is all entirely religion specific. I was a transfer student sent to BYU by parents hoping to tame their wayward daughter.I wanted to give this book a fair chance. What I came away with is a growing sense of dismay, and not because of what Ms. Beck details.

She brings up an important topic: child abuse perpetuated by unexpected persons, especially the ostensibly pious. My concern? Unreliable narrator. She stereotypes the Mormon community just as she stereotyped the Harvard community in her previous book --if I remember correctly, almost every Harvard character was intellectually insecure, overly demanding, rather cruel, and a bit out-of-sync with reality. In this book, the Mormons are similarly unreal--all sorts of exaggerations or falsehoods pepper the book. I attended Harvard, and have had extensive association with Mormons, and can say that her perception of each community is exaggerated at best, unreal at worst.

Her thoughts seem disconnected and I've noticed several other instances where she will write one thought, and further on contradict herself.She also comes across very conflicted about the Morman church & its beliefs.

I might have fallen for her story in Leaving the Saints but her \\"lights\\", her \\"special feelings\\", blah, blah, blah are a bit too much. Now I read that after bringing three children into this world both parents at this late date decide they're homsexuals? Where did that come from? And that's a stable environment for her children?

Aside from the huge disservice this is to those who really have lived this horror, someone should have told Martha that so-called recovered memories have been discredited by true psychiatric professionals. I guess she didn't get the memo or bother to do the research. It appears that almost everything this woman does is in an effort to bring her the most noteriety.

It's a little hard to read because it's kind of bitter. It's interesting to read, because I found myself - mostly - thinking \\"really??

Chose to replace rather than rebuild after local service rep said problem is rampant on the Hayward units. Easy installation for the most part, but getting O rings to stay in place was a bit challenging. Pump is running great, if a bit noisier than I would prefer. Amazon's supplier source was great and pump arrived on-time without any damage in transit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pump, but you could do better.","review":"I purchased this Pentair pump because of good luck and longevity of the last similar Pentair pump I had. Hoping to get a similar run out of this pump but time will tell. As of now it is running quiet and strong.Now my complaint: The connection kit included with the pump had the wrong sized O-rings! Come on now, how much effort would it have taken to include the proper size? I installed with the kit and ended up cutting it out and doing a direct hookup because of leaks. This cost me money and time! The idea of the kit is to be able to change the pump in the future without redoing the plumbing. Now I don't have that option. My 1 star rating reflects this issue, which relates to my overall frustration, not necessarily the pump itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last a year.","review":"I bought this pump in May and it worked beautifully for a few months.

If so, it would never have been published.Examples:On page. 60, the book shows an IGMP join being propagated all the way back to a video server. This isn't how IGMP works; the only feedback a video server receives is RTCP reports. It is routing protocols that handle setup of multicast routing paths within the network, not IGMP.On page 164, the authors talk about 10-megabyte and 100-megabyte Ethernet. Throughout the book, they confuse bits and bytes so often that it appears that the authors don't know the difference themselves.Looking at the author qualifications, one author is a technical writer, and the other is a marketing person.

My all-time favorite Hooker track, \\"Tanya\\", is not on this album. The classic \\"End of The Blues\\" isn't on this disc, either. Instead, we get some rare Hooker tracks. \\"Hooker 'N' Steve\\" is immense fun. It's a real shame that more people, especially guitar players, don't know who Earl Hooker is.

But its not an Anti-war movie and for those that see it as such are missing the entire point of the movie and only interested in furthering there own views about war. This film is about normal people as others on here have stated. Its about people living during war and not really about the idealogical standpoint of the war. The film portrays the life and hardships of everyday people and how one day you can have everything and the next nothing.I wish people would stop using this as a PR piece for there own views on war and accept it for what it is.

Every film-maker eventually comes to terms with the actuality that only when a film provokes not merely an ideological or emotional attachment ,but an emotional change within the viewer, can it truely be asserted that said film has served its true purpose as an artform.

While the story may have had a deep meaning, I just couldn't enjoy the movie because I was annoyed by the two main characters! They were such brats! The movie was very depressing but it does a great job depicting civilian life during the wartime.The video quality was acceptable for such an old movie and fortunately, it was presented in its original widescreen format. The audio was also acceptable.Being a 2 disc release, there are plenty of extras. Tons of interviews and other production notes to keep you busy after the film.Recommended (at least rent or borrow it) because the film has such a great story that everyone has to watch it at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned","review":"This is THE most depressing movie I have ever seen.

Helpless.","review":"After watching this anime feature you will turn the TV off in silent stock and cry, or go lay down, or both. The anime, no, this movie, drags us along with two children, as they slowly lose against hunger, grief, death and indifference. Only the two things that don't seem to break is their love for each other and the little girl's spirit.There are bright moments, like tiny fruit drops of happiness and joy, which seem to lift our spirits slightly before diving us back into the neverending downward journey of these two doomed orphans. We know they are doomed but those brief scenes of pure love and delight give us hope, even where there is none.The setting of World War II Japan, with the burnt cities, the helpless authorities, the defeated people and the red glow of fires and bombing runs, just adds to the feeling of neverending change and uncertainty.Right up there with made-for-TV 'The Day After'. Don't let kids watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most touching movie I have ever seen","review":"I saw this at alot of anime websites as being one of the best animes ever made, and in the reviews everyone one said it was the saddest movie they ever saw and made them cry.I wanted to see what the fuss was about so I bought it of amazon. When I received it I immediatly saw it to see what type of movie would make most people cry. I thought I was prepared for it but NOTHING could have prepared me for this movie. I just couldn't stop crying throughout the movie. I even had to pause it a couple of times to wash my face!!!!!My advice for you is the see this, one of the the most compelling animations ever made. But be sure to have some tissues by your side and see what the fuss is about.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"It remains among my favorites.","review":"So, I will admit, first off, that only one movie in the world has ever made me cry, and none ever will again. That being said, I will say that this movie came an extremely close second. I loved it. I watched it with three other of my friends (all guys) and they were crying. To say that this movie is a tear jerker is an understatement. The animation is just as would be expected from Studio Ghibli, true artistry; something which is somewhat lacking from current computer animated cartoons. The movie demonstrates human spirit, and in my opinion belongs in a museum, just as much as DVD collection, as a testament to war. One reviewer put in nicely once \\"war is society's failure to perform its most basic duty: protect its citizens.\\" That pretty much sums up the movie. See it once, and decide for yourself.

The story focuses on the challenges of daily life, from finding eatable food and a safe place to sleep, to dealing with other people who also have very little left. It is about the people left in the aftermath of war, and how death doesn't stop after the bombs and bullets have. I wish everyone who supports war, no matter what side, could see this film. It might change their mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"I first viewed this DVD about two years ago when I had a number of free NetFlix rentals and chose to view this. I was incredibly awe-inspired and emotionally moved by the contents of this disc. It sucked me right in and kept me well after the final credits rolled.If there was ever any need of a piece of Anime to demonstrate that good Anime is not your run of the mill animation, I can't think of a better movie to watch. GOtF's story sets it apart with distinction."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than anti-war: anti-inhumanity","review":"Hearing of a Japanese film made about the end of WWII, the knee-jerk reaction is to figure that the film will be heavily anti-American. In fact, the Americans appear very little, maintaining a shadowy but definite presence in the background of the story. Unlike most anti-war films, which focus on the horrors of fighting a war, Grave of the Fireflies deals with the life of a non-combatant. In the end, it is harshest not on the Americans, but in its condemnation of the Japanese people who failed to help their own. The true horror of the film comes not from the war, but how people react to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully tragic","review":"I have been a fan of Miyazaki's work for a long time. He never fails to disapoint his viewers when he makes a movie, and Grave of the Fireflies is no exception. I have seen it more times than I can count, always with the same outcome, I'm in tears and utterly depressed for three days straight. The animation is fantastic, not even Akira can compare to this and rarely does that occure. Miyazaki is a true genious and his work will hopefully continue to be appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Grandchildren","review":"I have watched Totoro, Ponyo, Spirited Away and other Japanese anime movies. This movie was so depressing my grandchildren where frightened and in tears when it was over. There were many scenes of dying and dead people. Also many of the war injuries depicted were quite graphic for children. I thought I was getting something I could watch with my grandchildren at a Friday night sleepover and was extremely dissapointed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone younger than twelve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grandiose waste of talent","review":"Let me start out be stating that I viewed this in Japan, where I lived up until last Christmas - I read, write and naturally speak Japanese fluently. I saw this movie in the Japanese original.Further, I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan - I have just about ALL their production that has been released on DVD with ONE exception, this movie...Why didn't I like it? The main character is such a spineless, incompetent, suicidal and downright useless individual that it ruins the entire movie.All around him all other Japanese try their darndest to survive the very tough circumstances but not this guy, noooo, he just withdraws all their savings, steals from the local farmers etc. Finally his sister dies because of his incompetence. Pathetic.Brilliant animation work however - Studio Ghibli all the way.Don't waste your money on this nonsense, get another Ghibli instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is hard to feel sad for people who caused their own situation","review":"I had wanted to see this movies forever, then I saw it.

Absolutely dreadful.","review":"Man, I have never been so depressed after seeing an anime in my life. I know it is a depiction of the real tragic events on the citizens of Japan during the tail end of WWII, but come on. Were the citizens of Japan that heartless? Kids left to fend for themselves and die like vermin? If you were expecting a movie with the redemption of people while overcoming daily struggle, forget about watching this movie.

But the more I think about this movie the less I like it.It is more about the weird conflict between a boy and his aunt and a country that seems filled with selfish people. I don't know about what Japan view of social charity was, but large parts of the town are untouched. At the end many people are acting like they have been on vacation rather than in a war. Why couldn't one of these families help? Would they let 4 year die even if the brother was a bit of a jerk?I could go on, but let me say I agree with several of the negative reviews. Overall the movie relies on too many convenient coincidences and characters that don't wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"horrid movie. i can't believe how disappointed i am in this anime. i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad. but it's not. the little girl annoyed me so much. i just can't stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her. omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie. can't stop ranting yeah... for those who haven't seen it, you might like it like everybody seems to but... i would not recommend it at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"And now for a disappointing review","review":"to tell you guys the truth i fell asleep after the americans bombed the japanese and their mom died. woot! this show was so boring. the first time i saw it and hopefully the last was when i was in history class my teacher was teaching us about world war 2 and a student brought in this movie and everybody hated it including the teacher we ended up not finishing it and watched something alot better. i have watched some animes like Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away and cant say im impressed mostly likely because they are unrealistic. i have been a big fan of anime since i was like 6 if your looking for something better i recommend trigun, r.o.d., samurai champloo, appleseed, gunslinger girl, cowboy bebop, ghost in the shell, and inu yasha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah Grave Of Fireflys!","review":"Whoa what a good movie, i've never seen this movie but i bought it because of the reviews, i was not dissapointed! i loved this movie! but it was so sad! i loved this movie, you see what this boy and his little sister go through while at war and it just tears you apart because you know this stuff really happened!

Yeah Grave Of The Fireflys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend this film to everybody.","review":"I agree with one of the others - this does not seem to be a blatantly anti-war film. It just tells a story very well. In a typical anti-war film, would they have made the \\"victims\\" rich kids? If it has a message beyond the personal strength and character of the boy, the creators did a wonderful job of disguising it.I love this film. It's in my top five."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim, very grim","review":"To describe this movie, I would say it is both grim and depressing. There's no joy and no possibility of joy since joy left for another planet the minute I began playing this movie.

Otherwise, pick something else that has even the smallest iota of something positive in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More manageable than I expected","review":"With that said, I was slightly disappointed with this anime title. I expected to be reduced to a blubbering mass of emotions like with my personal favorite The Fox and the Hound or with Watership Down or even Mulan, but in the end, I just wasn't. I didn't feel the magic I felt with all my favorite animated movies. I couldn't stand the fact that I knew what was going to happen all throughout the movie. There were only a few parts I found geniunely shocking. However, I still thought it was a good animated movie, one that everybody in the entire world should see at least once. It is better than a lot of animated movies, but it's no Princess Mononoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Movie.","review":"This is a good movie and i do reccomend you to watch once in your lifetime, would i watch it again? probably not, honestly id rather watch The Pianist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart-wrenching film","review":"Exceptional anime - a very touching (and tearful) story about the tragedy of war... doesn't have to resort to blown-up bodies and severed limbs to get its point across. The quiet, matter-of-fact way in which it relates the tale of two children in war-time Japan stabs right to the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Powerful","review":"As I stated in my title, this is a very powerful movie. I see it as very anti-war. I'm Korean and even I kinda felt for the characters! This is a wonder, especially to me, given that the Japanese inflicted so much undue suffering on just about every corner of the Pacific Rim, funneling much of the misery through my own country! To say that this movie is a kind of castigation on the A-Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would be extremely (With highlighted emphasis on extremely!) hypocritical. Instead, I see it as strictly adhering to the universal theme of war being bad for everyone in general, and that's an issue that I can really feel for these particular characters about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agony","review":"There is little to do with the Enemy in this movie... It doesn't tell us to hate the American, or to pity the noble Japanese. The enemy was greed, war, disease, and apathy... so many children suffered in this long, terrible war, we can't ever atone for it. This movie is not some sword-wielding, prophecy-fulfilling anime, it is of agony, love, trust, family, and sorrow so deep that one cannot express it.I don't know about you, but this film crushed me, I couldn't stop crying for hours.... It let me never want to see war again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to see","review":"I own the \\"old\\" copy of this, so I can't really tell you anything about this release or the extra features this DVD, but the movie is still the same, right? And everyone should see this movie! It's at the same time extremely heartwarming and extremely dispirited tale about two siblings who have lost everything in their lives and can still not only survive, but almost flourish. Almost. In this movie, nobody is the villain (at least I don't see that is the intent of the movie), and nobody is the hero... there are only people trying to cope in the circumstances (as horrid as they are). There's a lot of symbolism embedded in the movie, even beyond the fireflies. I see it as an anti-war, pro-child film that haunts me and makes me cry. Please watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Side WWII","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the single most incredible pieces of art--yes, ART--I have ever seen. The background animation blows Disney out of the water (note, no CGI stuff, here, predates it). The foci of the story are a fourteen year-old boy and his four-year old sister, the precious Setsuko. This video pulls no punches about the hardships that the Japanese endured during the war, particularly the children. If this one doesn't touch your heart, you are cold indeed. A masterpiece, this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"English Version is a disaster","review":"The voice of the little girl is awful. Just awful. It sounds like someones grandma pretending to be a kid. It reminds of the low budget Godzilla films that are dubbed into English. The children are always voiced by adult women. This little girl has the creepiest voice I have ever heard.Not only did I not cry during this film, I couldn't stop laughing at that girls ridiculous voice. The voice of the girl is said to be done by one Rhoda Chrosite. However, a quick search on google turns up no such person. It's very odd.I recommend watching the film in Japanese with subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A possibly great movie ruined by english language dubbing","review":"I sought this movie based on the strong reviews and serious subject. But hearing an adult American's breathy baby talk *totally* broke the spell of reality that Setsuko needed. No emotions could sink in when the audio constantly rang false. I'm sure a subtitled version of this tragic story would have had a deep effect. Having real Japanese people from recent, desperate times running around sounding like Californians in a recording studio made me recoil in disgust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwrenching film of war and it's effect on the innocent","review":"The heartwrenching story of a 14 year old boy and his 4 year old sister in Kobe Japan during the last days of WWII and their struggle to survive against starvation. Based on true experiences of the author of the book. After seeing \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" it took a week to recover to see it again. I don't know if I'll ever be able to watch this movie again but I'm glad I saw it. I'll never see another child laughing or in pain and not remember this film. Cherish the children...cherish them. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Gold","review":"I saw this movie in a blockbuster and passed it by. But I couldn't stop thinking about it. This movie spoke to me, I went back and I rented it. I love the art style, no big saucer eyes and such. The symbolisam, plot and characters are breath taking. I don't care if you don't like anime, give this a chance. Not for the light hearted though. And I do believe this is classified wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really a five star movie, but...","review":"I wanted everyone reading the one stars to know this little tidbit.Nosaka wrote the novel this movie is based on to appologize to his sister - the little boy is him, and the little girl was his sister in real life. It's not dead-on a autobiography, but his little sister did die of malnutrition, and Nosaka blames himself, and wrote the book to help cope with the pain he still felt years later. So, the character Seita may not be tolerable, but that is the point. It's not poor writing... It's just the sad fact that something could have been done and was not.Also... It may not scream \\"We're sorry! Love, Japan!\\" but this movie is at heart an anti-war movie, and the message isn't really \\"I'm sorry\\" but more like, \\"All of us should know better now to never let this happen again.\\" And that, in my opinion, is pretty much just as good.Great movie, it really is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected...","review":"No complaints with this one.

This is a true-to-life story and does not have the standard \\"evil triumphs over good\\" plot or ending. This story is so sad that I am not likely to view it multiple times in a row. Everyone in the room was crying by the end. However, it is so well made that I am glad I purchased a copy. I recommend watching it in Japanese with subtitles instead of the English Dub. While the dub is well done, the original inflection and voices make the dialog more realistic and draws you even farther into the characters' plight. I highly recommend preparing a light comedy to view immediately after this movie, unless you want to remain in a sobered state for several hours :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very sad, but powerful movie","review":"This movie is very sad and is too realistic. It is so real, it is scary. It has a very sad ending, and it is a movie I will not see again. It is not worth it. But don't get me wrong, the quality of this movie is superb. This movie is not really appropriate for the little ones, 8 and under, but that is my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Story","review":"What many of the negative reviewers and people who think it seems like a soap opera are forgetting (or perhaps did not know) is that it is based on a true story.

It is extremely well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad movie about kids too proud to ask for help","review":"Grave of the Fireflies is a well-made movie, and it does have many emotional moments. However, I was left with a feeling that all the suffering in the movie was for nothing. Basically, the boy and his sister are starving because they are too proud to ask for help from the family member they were staying with. And when they were staying with them, the boy did not make any effort to work and earn money, which made the family resent them. It was difficult to feel sorry for the needless suffering of a boy who wasn't willing to work and earn some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"I have seen the movie many times, and it was as good as I remember it being.However, when I received the DVD the casing and the disk itself was made really cheap. I first thought that I had ordered someone's illegal copy that they had hand made. There were a couple language options, one of which was the original Japanese, as a native speaker, I appreciated this option. However, when the movie plays in Japanese there is no option of not having English subtitles, which was really irritating.I recommend this movie to everyone, but spend the little extra and buy a better copy of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great animation, cannot relate to such an inability for a lack of common sense","review":"First of all i would have to say i love animations and this one was beautifully done. Good now that that's over with, i cannot see how a 16 year old boy has such little common sense as this one. I stayed dried eyed through out the whole film because i was waiting for the main character to do something with sense. He did nothing. I was remotely sad when they both died, but honestly i saw it coming a mile away from when they left the aunts house. Emotional distress or not that is not an excuse for being so naively blind or indifferent. The movie made me more mad at the main character than sad to be honest so u watch it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have your Kleenex on hand","review":"Grave of the fireflies is a sorrowful tale about a young boy and his baby sister trying to stay alive after the hiroshima bomb.Educational and heartstopping.A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Wrenching","review":"I got this movie last night and sacrificed sleep to watch it,and let me tell you it was worth it. The love and care shown by Seita for Setsuko is quite touching,towards the end the simple line \\"she never woke up\\" ,well lets say it still sends chills down my spine when i think about it.Afew tears fell down my face as he looked at his sister one last time.Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This movie was an absolute masterpiece, worth anyones collection. It transcends both animation and acting, becoming a story of innocence - and lives - lost in the midst of a brutal war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Story, Sad Movie","review":"This is perhaps the saddest movie that I have ever seen and it is certainly one of Japan's most powerful anti-war statements.While the animation is fairly solid, the movie was not intended to dazzle the eyes, with the noted exception of the tear ducts.Those hoping to stumble upon another Ninja Scroll or Ghost in the Shell are barking up the wrong tree, yet open-minded fans of those anime greats should be able to expand their horizons and appreciate this movie for what it has to offer: a gripping tale of WWII Japan and that War's blameless victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEARTRENDING","review":"I usually don't like anti war movies.There are either too political biased against the US militaryOr too much in favor of total pacifism,which is a evil in it self.Never less I would rank this movie right up there with \\"All Quiet On The Western Front\\" as one the best anti war movies ever madeJapan set out on war of conquest and genocide and their children paid the price of their folly."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 cents.","review":"I don't think I can add any more than what 430-odd reviewers have already said about this movie, except for my 2 cents. I don't think I will say much about whether or not the movie had a message about the atrocities of war, about how people treat one another in the worst of times, about whether or not political or world ambition have any relevance to two children cast adrift in crisis, nor about what the brother and sister represent.What I will say is this: if you have ever had any direct or indirect experiences with, or armchair opinions about any of the questions above, this movie will shake them, and shake them hard. Don't dismiss this movie because it is anime; it is a strong story told from the perspective and viewpoint of two children trying to survive in a desperate situation caused by war. In fact, this movie will surprise you, and it will feel more real and tragic to you because its picture of the human condition is too honest to be believed.Prepare to think. And grieve."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most anime...er MOVIE I have ever seen period.","review":"Words cannot begin to describe what I feel when watching Grave of the Fireflies. I just watched it on DVD for the second time tonight and I cried even more ON THE SECOND VIEWING! Of course I watched the subtitled as all of you should. This movie proves that animation can be art and that you can depict touching drama without breaking the 3 hour mark as most american oscar winners do. This movie should have won best picture in the Oscars but of course life isn't fair. See this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a sad movie.","review":"Grave of the Fireflies, I believe, is one of the best anime movies to find. The characters, Seita and Setsuko can be related to our everyday lives. I'm shocked that people had dismissed this movie! Anyway, this movie is very sad. Don't be so critical of this movie, because all movies have flaws. Look at the good things, and in Grave of the Fireflies' case, that's alot of things. I reccomend this to everyone who can find it! But have tissues on hand. Just in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish everyone could see this film","review":"I just saw it last night and was deeply moved. I didn't cry watching it, but for some reason have found myself crying today as I think about the film. I won't reiterate what's been said previously by many of the reviewers--except to say this movie will move you profoundly.I've found having children changes your perspective on everything. As a father of a beautiful, wonderful 5 year-old boy, I pray for all the children out there who are subjected to similar experiences because we adults can't get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"The saddest movie I have ever seen","review":"A friend showed me Grave of the Fireflies and I was instantly moved by how tragically the movie started. I was shocked by how tightly the opening scene in the train station gripped me. More than a year after seeing the film, I can still feel it. I was told that the movie was very sad, but I effectively dismissed those comments as irrelevant as if they were coming only from those who cry easily. Once I began watching, though, I realized that 'Fireflies' was heartbreaking like no other.Grave of the Fireflies suits anime aficionados and newbies alike. The characters are well-developed and the animation is exceptional. If you have not seen it yet, then be prepared to watch a film with the potential to change you."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a sad story","review":"When I watched this movie, I felt it was what Akiyuki Nozaka wanted to show almost 15 years ago. Story was simple and straight-forward and some important parts looked missing. But I strongly believe most of viewers will understand there are such weak victums in the war behind victory and defeat. In this story, the death was an only savior to them. I know this author is a very famous for anti-war activities and I was able to imagine sad ending of this story. But I'm sure everybody understands what war destroys and cause misery to ordinary citizens. I want more people in the world watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.

I read this book because I thought it would offer, at least somewhat, a rational approach to this topic.

However, the author is obviously no professional writer, as the text is disjointed and difficult. Written as a history of each of the reconaissance regiments, some unit receive more attention than others. The actions of various individuals are highlighted, but there is little continuity or development of a consistant thread or theme throughout.

The characters had no redeeming traits, so were not at all likable or interesting. Great books have you wondering what will happen to the denizens of the pages. They draw you in to the story.

The problem for me is the performance. Notations for \\"Allegro, Vivace, Presto, con Spirito\\" are all ignored. These movements are played with a slow, lifeless, plodding deliberation. Another section marked \\"Andante\\" is played at a snails pace. One of the other reviewers mentioned a \\"strolling\\" pace. This was for a movement marked \\"Allegro con Spirito\\"! \\"Strolling\\"? While the first two quartets are more or less acceptable (accent on the less), the third is the worst. The case states that these pieces were recorded over a three day period. It sounds like they just ran out of steam by the third day. It's very frustrating listening to what should be lively, fun, exciting music played with such slow dullness. To hear what Hummel's chamber music should sound like, listen to the recordings of his piano trios, piano quintets & septets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Circuit Tester","review":"This is a well made tester.

The model, is okay, but not something to get all worked up about. Putting it together is somewhat simple, and not all that different from a Gun Sniper.However, if you want to make the Rev Raptor look more show accurate, you need to do a few customizations. Here's what I did. First, I clipped off almost all of the plastic strips on the sides of the feet, and painted them, the claws, scythes, teeth, and head part silver. And then, I added the two hand guns from a scrapped Gun Sniper project. Afterwords, the Rev Raptor looked much better.All in all, it's a good model, but it could really stand to have some work done to make it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's small but really cool","review":"The Rev Raptor is a cool Zoid, but not very strong in the TV show. It's a Velocirator type Zoid, one of my favortie Dinosaurs. It walks pretty good, better then the Gun Sniper, but the Gun Sniper is still cooler. The blades move when it walks. Theres some places where you can put extra guns, the only ones I found that fit were the 2 guns on the Gun Sniper fit on the arms. Its a little bit smaller then the Sniper Gun. Pretty easy to put together, took me about 15 minutes.

While it is indeed a handsome, lushly filmed movie, it drags on with precious little to keep the viewer interested. I felt as if there would be some plot twist around each corner, but as the films trails along in a snail's pace, you're left wondering why one should care about Tom Ripley or the shallow, vain people he so desperately wants to be a part of.

I didn't care about any of the characters enough to give a damn what happened to any of them (with the exception of the final victim, who was the only likable character in the story - making me dislike this film all the more when he was killed). This is a story about empty shells - walking, talking personas with nothing inside. Oh, I have no doubt there are lots of real people like this. The characters are realistic, to be sure. But I don't want to spend 2 hours with them. In its defense, I will say that this film had some good lines of dialogue and great scenery, and the acting was good - but the characters and the story simply weren't engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!

It seemed as though the writers were simply making things up to ad on as the movie went along. Even more shameful than the desperate attempt at a plot or consistent story line, was the unusually poor acting performances of Mr. Damon and Ms. Paltrow.

The entire film was boring, giving the viewer little to no excitement. I couldn't get into it. I didn't really know what was going to happen next, but I didn't really care! The performances were fine, and the visual design was excellent. It was a very colorful movie. It was just stupid. Matt Damon portrayed Mr. Ripley, a gay con artist, murdering psychopath who tried to live several identities and got himself into some serious trouble. Let that sentence be enough, because that pretty much sums up a waste of two hours and twenty minutes. Don't see this movie expecting thrills. Expect yawns. The R rating is not the heaviest of them all. Mostly for some violence. There was also a meager amount of profanity, and some brief nudity.

Well..... you won't see that here. Unfortunately when you think the movie is ending, you are hoping that it does..... but it doesn't. It's like a bad energizer bunny and keeps going and going. Beautiful scenery doesn't even help this movie move along as there is minimal action and hardly any suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. It takes too long to get into the \\"meat\\" of the movie and too long to fininsh it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Personalityless Mr. Ripley","review":"Okay, true ... so I didn't watch the entire movie. I understand that the quality of the plot varies from person to person, depending on how well you understood the film, but there was one thing that really bothered me about the characters. I don't know if it was the script, the acting, but all the characters seem so fake. From Dickie's moodswings to Marge's happy-go-lucky disconcern for her bf's affairs, to Tom's spontaneous aggressive personality. All in all, if you're looking for a movie featuring real human characters you can relate to, skip out on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, beautiful scenery","review":"The scenery and the people were beautiful. But, the plot moves along at a painfully slow clip and the characters are pretty much unlikeable. I couldn't wait for this movie to be over but made myself watch until the end because I kept hoping it would get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of talent!","review":"Utterly ridiculous movie with one of the most contrived stories I've seen in a long time. There are far too many things that don't make sense and exist only to provide later plot points. And to top it off the movie stops at the most contrived points as if to stand up and shout \\"Look how clever I am!\\". Complete waste of a very talented cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful!","review":"This may be a well directed and photographed movie, but that doesn't overcome the serious and obvious flaws it contains.First, the story is BORING! The characters are grating and as the title character bumps each off, you sigh with relief and chalk them up. The only thing \\"thrilling\\" about this movie is the end credits. I couldn't believe I wasted two and a half hours of my time on this dog. It's one of those movies that you watch because you hope it will get better. Be warned- it never does!The ending is nothing but a loose end and you feel cheated by it.Maybe Mr. Ripley is talented- but you would never know it from watching this waste of film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented? HARDLY!","review":"This movie is horrible, it is way too long, and brings the word boring to new levels. It starts out okay but just drags on and on to the point where you want to rip your hair out in frustration. The best part was just knowing that the movie is over. The main character is so stupid and it is unbelievable that he never gets caught. The word talented should not appear in the title because you can't find a trace of it in the movie. It is BORING, and a waste of precious time that you will never be able to recover."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Slowest Movie Of All Time","review":"This movie never goes anywhere for about the first 90 minutes. You get to see conversations between snooty rich white people and pasty Matt Damon about wine cellars. Whee! I swear, only a millionaire would know what they're talking about. The film moves as fast as an old man in the 1984 Buick hogging both lanes of the road. Near the end of the movie, you won't care what's going on. Oh by the way, I absolutely LOVED the predictable ending. It really fooled me! Don't watch unless you need a cure for Insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather shoove a spoon down my throat","review":"This film was simple awful. While i watched it in theatre i was debating if i should shoove my spoon that i had gotten with my icee down my throat so that i would be entertained. This was a sick movie that someone would have to pay me to go see. If you buy this movie then you must also like to stick needles in your body because both are painfully stupid. Thanks for your time. I hope you found this review helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripley \\"Rips\\"","review":"One of the best mystery/suspense movies of all time. Cast is unbeatable. It will keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Talented\\" cast of \\"Mr. Ripley\\"","review":"I'm actually really not sure whether I liked this movie or not. Some parts were funny, some were suspenseful, some were weird and other parts were just plain boring. One thing I know I did like were the characters. I found Jude Law's character Dickie to be really interesting. I mean why did he just take this guy in who he didn't even know and how he continued being best friends with him without even knowing who he really is. Also Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great again at what he does best. Really interesting supporting roles. I like him in small roles like this and Magnolia and Boogie Nights, but I can't stand him in entire movies like Flawless. He can annoy me after a while. Matt Damon was obviously good too, but the supporting is what makes the main character and story better. Just at least rent this one for an intersting and twisted story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like old fashioned movies for the dramatic soul","review":"I've seen this movie many times and by seeing one or two negative reviews had to write one for my own. This movie reminds of those old fashioned movies-you remember them-that used to feed your soul with beauty. The trumpets are depressing and the acting is intense. But anyone who loves that rush you get when you watch a great movie...this one is for you. You tend to not like Matt Damon towards the end of the movie, but his portrayal is real. The ones who should be praised here also include Jude Law and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Jude has that [attractiveness] and Phillip has the character. The music is to die for and the acting is real. For anyone who enjoys beautiful things...watch this movie...now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking homoerotic movie","review":"Matt Damon plays his role to perfection. While my wife who is a big Damon fan did not like his role in this movie, that only reaffirmed what I already knew, he nailed the role. This movie is a deep, disturbing picture which will leave you with an uneasy feeling in your stomach when you leave. The DVD doesn't have that many extra features which are better than the VHS, just a French version which isn't appealing to those of us who don't speak French. I would rate this as a must buy for a DVD collection as it was the second to make it into mine after American Beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't keep me interested...","review":"I don't know why. Usually, I love the psychological thriller type of movies, but this one I just couldn't stay interested in. Both Tom and Dickie just didn't seem real. Tom just walks up to Dickie on the beach, and then all of a sudden, their friends. Then they're fighting. Yes, I watched the entire thing, and no, nothing about the ending changed my opinion of the movie. I had trouble keeping my attention on this one. I suggest you avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smart and Classy Thriller.","review":"Anthony Minghella is a true magician. He turns the best books into the best movies. He is awesome. Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, and Cate Blanchett come together in a smart ans classy thriller that will blow your mind. This is one of the best assembled cast I have ever seen in the movie. The film is seductive and thrilling. It reminds me of the old movies of the 1960s. I highly reccomend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful backdrop","review":"Enticing plot. Matt Damon is convincing as a charming manipulative psychopath. GORGEOUS backdrop. I'd watch the movie just to fall in love with the beautiful scenery all over again. The soundtrack is great too, particularly that one song where Jude Law was performing with the rest of the band in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Torture","review":"I cannot express how horrible this movie was! Not only do you have to stare at Matt Damon's face for over two hours, but it also burns in your mind as you are knodding off while watching this bore. The movie was dragged out, with every cheap attempt to throw twists and turns that were completely not needed. The only bright spot was the acting of Jude Law, who is absent in almost the whole last 1/4 of the movie. Matt Damon and Gweneth Paltrow both over-act unbearingly. If I wanted to torture my worst enemy, I would tie them up, and force them to watch this unbelievable trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn, do I have to give it even 1 star?","review":"This movie was about the dumbest thing I've sat thru in years.

The story was boring and zzzzzzzz and ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool title; wasted on a horrible movie!!","review":"This movie was HORRIBLE!! You know when you sit thru a movie waiting for something... anything to happen... well, you'll be waiting a LONG time w/this movie. I was HIGHLY disappointed! Matt Damon was spectacular as usual. The man has a million faces and emotions.... brilliant. However, why he chose to do a piece of trash movie as this is beyond me. Oh and as a shocker <a touch of sarcasm there> Gwenyth Paltrow played a nieve, fragile, \\"so-called\\" victim. PLEASE!!!! How virtuous can one be in a scummy, sadistic, twisted plot. Moreover... this movie lacked humor, action, drama, dynamics, characters w/depth and basically a plot. HOW did this flick get made???? Every time I here the name ripley I shutter... what a waste of TIME!!! I wish someone would have warned me before I sat down and wasted 120 minutes of my life... which consequently felt like an eternity!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can<t fall a sleep ? watch this...","review":"If for some reasons you can't seem to be able to fall a sleep, it's really simple watch \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" and you'll be a sleep in no time, everyone can see it coming only the cast of this movie seems to be that innocent.... can't believe i've wasted my money on this movie...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long and Too Uppity","review":"What do you get when you cross a Merchant and Ivory Film with the typical hollywood serial killer flick? You get the Talented Mr. Ripley. The two do not mix well.Filled with great actors and wonderful scenery the film is too long and too talky. I think they tried very hard to make a \\"sophisticated\\" thriller and I they DID NOT pull it off successfully.Interesting at times, the film is ultimately too long with long streches of no real action.The DVD has some cool extra features but in the end I do not recommend owning this one. It is worth a rental if nothing else is in, but certainly not worth buying and watching again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Average","review":"I Didn't get the Fuss over this Picture.I Just Rented it&I Didn't get what The 50's,Jazz,Italy,Homosexuality,etc.. had to do with this Picture.I watched this Film&I Discovered that they Showed a Miles Davis Album Called Tutu that was Released in 1986 not the 50's? also a John Coltrane Album that was Put out in the 60's.but the film Ended so Fake.Nobody put Matt Damon as The Killer.it was Too Slick&Shallow.Gwyneth Paltrow was alright but nothing Special.this Film lacked Tension it was Boring from the middle to the End.Will Smith's 6 degree's of Seperation was far more COnvincing than this Film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matt Damon keeps you guessing","review":"Who's the good guy and who's the bad guy in this film? It's hard to tell at first. Dickie (Jude Law) is the wild child in the first half, while Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) seems like a nerd. It's at half-time that Dickie calls Tom \\"boring\\" and drops off screen, and we're left with the impression that the movie is going to drag through the 2nd half. But it's not true -- the 2nd half of the movie is the real thriller, and it flies by. We ought to know better - most of us have followed Matt Damon through Bourne after Bourne and never got bored. I wasn't too thrilled with the ending though - would have liked something a little more cheery. It sets Ripley up for his coming career, in films such as Ripley's Game (starring John Malkovich) in which he's completely polished up his fiendish act. Both films are based on a book series, but I just recently found out about this, to my surprise. \\"Talented\\" is an interesting if uneasy introduction to this disturbing character."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Was Better Then I thought","review":"It wasn't the best movie that i have seen but it was better then I thought. I was thinking it was going to be a thriller but it was more of a drama type. If you enjoy movies for the most part then I reccomend this Movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Talantless Mr Ripley","review":"I have to admit I was looking forward to this movie from the previews. The idea of someone taking over another person's life is an interesting premise. Too bad this movie wastes it completely. Mr. Ripley is as Dickie so elegently explains: is boring. His character is unlikable and not too smart. During the entire second half of the movies, I kept expecting his lies to indict him but no one (except Maude) ever figure out his crimes. The ending is completly anti-climatic, it never explains Ripley's motives and is a completly senseless murder. Why is it all these 'culturally signifgant films' seem toi be set in Europe and filled of vapid characters?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe it or not...","review":"Matt Damon's flawlessly crafted performance slowly seduced me as a viewer, pulling me deeper and deeper into Tom Ripley's world! This Harvard educated actor has been underrated and \\"cheese-balled\\" by far too many jealous detractors and critics. He gives us world-class acting of the highest caliber here! His technical range, having just seen Dogma (another MUST OWN DVD), is remarkable. Mr. Damon has chosen his projects well and has surpassed most other veteran actors in honing his craft to polished perfection! While disturbing and macabre in places, this movie plays with the viewer's notions of poverty, privilege, and decency. We root for Tom Ripley while at the same time we deplore his behavior.This in-depth character study, given by the talented Mr. Damon, is his finest work thus far and sure to be a modern classic! The supporting cast is superb! The cinematography is seamless and flowing! The storyline is deeply complex, disturbing just the right dullards in our society!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"What a horrible movie! I can believe Matt Damon was in this. There were only a few elements which were tolerable, the rest was pure garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well done, but depressing dark movie","review":"There are a lot of things to like about this movie, but unfortunately they are all superficial. First, the scenery is beautiful. 1950's Italy looks like an incredible place to live and provides a compelling backdrop for the actions of the characters. Second, all of the actors give great performances. Gwyneth Paltrow steals the show with her sympathetic performance. Blanchette and Hoffman are good and so is Damon as the evil Ripley. Law turns in a great performance as the victim of Damon's schemes. Then what is wrong about this movie? First, homosexuality is a big theme in this movie, which might turn some people off. Second, this is not a typical thriller so don't expect the typical good guy vs. bad guy ending. While the ending makes sense, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. My advice is to know what to expect before you watch this movie. If you enjoy these kind of artsy movies then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT suspense!","review":"I prefer to call this movie The Boring Mr. Ripley, because it certainly is. Beautifully filmed, aptly acted, long? Yes! Suspenseful (as claimed)? NO! This movie is 2.5 hours that seems to drag on for 5 hours. Thomas Ripley is about as threatening and imposing as my niece. But to each his own I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated, meandering and overall boring","review":"Two stars only for the perfect pitch casting. Because space is limited, let me just toss out the most egregious elements of the movie:* God this movie was long;* no Americans except people who think movies are art (these are the people who drink espresso and hold the semi demitasse cups with a thumb and index finger) care to see a movie about class tensions;* the protagonist should not be markedly stupider than the audience. Anyone who wasn't yelling \\"Get the hell out of Rome\\" after Tom runs into Meredith is probably dumb enough to think this is a great movie;* Exactly why should the movie end after Tom's third murder, as opposed to the second, or even the first? There's no rhyme or reason to that particular place to end the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dillon or DiCaprio, not Damon","review":"A great movie - taut screenplay, astounding cinematography. The beauty of Mediterranean Europe & the period have been captured beautifully. Jude Law is amazing. He is so expressive... every look, every gesture!If there is a flaw, I think it is Matt Damon. A little too wooden for my liking. Matt Dillon would have been a better choice as the sinister Mr. Ripley. Or Leonardo DiCaprio. But still, a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"The director (who is also the screenwriter, so he gets all the blame) has sanitized Ripley to make him more \\"sympathetic.\\" Tom Ripley is only interesting when he is not sympathetic! The whole homoeroticism was wayyyyyy overplayed in the media; there's nothing here that will make a literate, half-sophisticated person sit up and be shocked or even intrigued. Put Matt Damon in an ................. scene and THEN you have him really trashing his All-American image. The movie completely lost me when Tom supposedly kills Dickie out of frustrated \\"love\\" and then in the next scene has him coldly trying to pass himself off as Dickie. Apparently the novel has Tom killing Dickie in cold blood; now THAT would be more interesting. In terms of acting, Gwyneth Paltrow was annoying. Only Cate Blanchett I got excited to seeing whenever she came on screen. I think Minghella needs to stop making these bloated, cinematography-driven allegories and focus on character, character, character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish, but predictible and slowly paced.","review":"This film was one of those on the list of movies I SHOULD like. However, I found the pace of the film slow and plodding and the story less than intriguing. I was not surprised by any plot twist or supposedly \\"hidden\\" motive. I disliked all the characters and thus had no one to identify with. I was yawning all the way through - and THIS review is coming from someone who LOVED \\"My Dinner with Andre.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Talent","review":"I'm usually a fan of Matt Damon's, but this movie goes beyond his ability to help. This movie has nothing enjoyable in it. It is just a closet manic-depressive bordering on psychotic committing crimes of necessity to continually cover up his crime of passion. At no point does the movie throw any real twists or interest in. I suppose it is somewhat of a decent commentary on how even a seemingly normal person can become a monstrosity of conscience, but as that it is well beyond my generous capability to enjoy.Read Crime and Punishment if you want a story that really explores the depths of the dark side of human nature. I didn't enjoy that one either, but at least it was intelligent. This just gives you the darkness without the psychological exploration."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHat movie did you guys watch?","review":"So many positive reviews for this film. it was one of the worstmovies I have ever had the displeasure of seeing, Matt Damon ... did an ok acting job. thats as far as the positives goes.. The plot is just ridulas everyone else looked more like fools trying to act. by the way did I mention how Horribal that Plot was.. Normally I'd say rent this movie before buying it, But dont even bother, its not worth the 4 bucks for one viewing let alone multiple ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I give this a negative five stars.","review":"I can't beleive how bad this movie was. It's been a while since I have seen such bad acting and direction. There are few things I regret in life, and watching this movie is one of them. How did Gwyneth ever win an Oscar anyway? People, news flash! SHE CAN'T ACT! And Matt Damon isn't much better. I'm sure this review will get lost among all of the reviews that are giving this movie five stars. All I have to say is that I am very glad I don't know any of the people writing those reviews. If I can save just one person from wasting two hours of their life on this movie, I will be content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Remember the scene in Mrs Doubtfire(and countless other tv sitcoms) where the character leading a double life is about to get exposed and hilarious antics ensue?Well, change the word 'hilarious' to 'suspenseful' and thats basically the jist of the last half of this dreadful movie. Initially the slow decent into evil is interesting and the cast holds up. Unfortunately the plot is as manipulative as any hollywood junk and before you know it youre being led through 2 hours of the ups and downs of predictable murders and narrow escapes. There's not really much reason to like anyone in this besides Phillip Seymour Hoffman's smarmy side character. To top it all off towards the end theres a syrupy psuedo-psychological explanation of why poor my ripley is the way he is. Bring the air sickness bags.

However, if you are expecting to find out anything about Mr.Ripley that is incredible, I can save you a few Dollars. Unless you are of this flavor Mr. Ripley is a talented, psychopathic, homosexual murderer. I wish that was on the back of the box when I purchased this movie. With no offense intended against this particular community it would be nice if they would inform us before we spend the long drawn out moments trying to endure to the end ont this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Hitchcockian Thriller","review":"This is one of the best thrillers in recent years. The story centers on Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) who comes to Italy to befriend Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) and persuade him to come back to the U.S. (at the wishes of Greenleaf's father). Soon, Ripley becomes immersed in Greenleaf's style and doesn't want to leave. Identity swapping, lying, and murder ensue.What's great about the movie is how you identify with Tom Ripley even as he does many evil things. The story also highlights great truths about social class, gender, and identity.The cast is exceptional--Matt Damon and Jude Law are the best. And the look of the film is wonderful. If you buy/rent the DVD, be sure to check out the commentary by director Anthony Minghella, which is like a film class. Minghella highlights how he uses performances, shots, music, editing, and backgrounds to highlight the many themes in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and better than expected.","review":"My friends didn't like The Talented Mr. Ripley much, but I did. I was intrigued throughout the whole film and I did not want to leave to lave the cinema, even though my bladder was bursting! The only thing wrong with this movie is that Matt Damon didn't get nominatd for Best Actor. He did a marvellous job, as did Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law especially. An all-star cast to die for!Tom Ripley (Damon) has been sent to collect a young lady (Paltrow) to take her back to her father in which Ripley works for. Instead of taking her back, he stays with her and her husband, (Law) and Ripley kindly befriends him and they become best buddies. But then accidentally Ripley kills him and then he becomes him, which is as complicated as it sounds.If you want to see a good drama with thrilling moments and an awesome screenplay see The Talented Mr. Ripley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Highsmith is spinning in her grave....","review":"This adaptaion of the first of author Patricia Highsmith's \\"Ripley\\" series of books simply sucks out loud. While the movie sticks to some of the main plot lines of the book on which it is based, it gets totally lost as the film progresses until finally it leaves the book completely and goes off into the abyss. The \\"Ripley\\" books are some of the best crime ficiton ever written. I've read all the books and recommend them highly, but any fan of the books will want to bypass this movie. If you must see this movie, read the book first and then bring a barf bag when you see the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"is it over yet?","review":"I'm sorry. I usually like this type of movie. The idea was good. The plot was good. But what a dreadfully long, drawn-out movie! Exasurbating the fact that the scenes and dialog in them were slow was the fact that often the mumbled dialog was difficult to understand. The foreign dialog aside (I do not expect to understand Italian--this I can tolerate), I actually rewinded the tape to hear certain lines a second and third time to try to understand what they said, and still I couldn't make it out. I agree with my fellow reviewers that the cinematography was beautifully done, as was the soundtrack. I simply found myself squirming to go do something else about two-thirds through the movie. It's really too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours of my life I'll never get back!","review":"I watached this movie with three other people and at the end the verdict was unanimous - it was awful! If you are looking for a suspense packed thriller of a movie - keep on looking. This is definitely not it. I was hugely disappointed. While the plot definitely kept you waiting for something to happen - it never did! You get to the end wondering what in heaven's name was the point. It was a big let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The hint of homosexuality is over done.","review":"This is a well made thriller with some great acting.

It was one of those experiences where you just keep asking yourself when it's going to be over.This movie is billed as a thriller. But what is thrilling about it? The pace is excruciatingly slow and Damon's acting is so dead-pan as to be painful. Is there a likable character in this whole tedious story? Perhaps Paltrow's character is, but you see so little of her that the movie is beyond her saving.Who cares who gets killed or whether he gets away with it? You feel nothing for any one of these characters, hoping beyond hope that the killing is swift and the credits begin. And when they finally come there are so many unanswered questions that you wonder what the point was to suffering to the end of this miserable film. This goes on my list of all-time worst movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible movie!","review":"I'm reading through these reviews, and wondering if I watched the same movie as the others. I HATED this movie! It was terribly slow, and at the end I looked up and said, \\"oh, it's over?\\" I couldn't believe it ended the way it did. The movie is ridiculous. Totally pointless. Yes, the cinematography was amazing. Wonderful. The acting was decent. There just wasn't much there. I love Matt Damon, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman. I just hated this movie.

The premise is great - a very original entertaining idea - a star is earned here, and that's it. This movie dragged on and on and on... Nothing was resolved or accomplished at all. Sure it had nice scenery, but I don't watch movies for the scenery, I watch them for plots and entertainment - and this movie unfortunately had neither. I highly recommend it be avoided..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done feel bad","review":"A movie about the life styles of wealthy self-absorbed privileged entitled people and a wanna be. By far the best thing about this movie was seeing Matt Damon stretched to whole new level as the infatuated menanical Ripley. Phillip Seymore Hoffman is so sleazy that just watching him makes you want to take a shower. This movie is seemingly intentionally void of any redeeming characters or plot line, making me wonder what was the point, beyond the obvious message that people can be real bastards when allowed to be. The only point of light in this movie was Peter and his attempt to reach out to Ripley. But that was secondary, rushed, at the end, and didn't turn out as one may have hope. The DVD image of Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow is misleading and the DVD could use a redesign to better reflect the movie (which is film noir not a romance)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented Mr Ripley","review":"Love this movie. it's great seeing Matt Damon, Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow again in this beautifullyset movie. Arrived in good shape and in a very timely manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Slant","review":"The DVD of The Talented Mr. Ripley works as well on small sreen as the spacious film did in the theaters. Somehow the character development seems more fleshed out, probably due to the fact that the Theater version lavished us with the visual wonders of Italy. But here we are allowed inside the minds of each of the sterling cast of five: Minghella has drawn both individual moments and fine ensemble acting from Damon, Law, Palltrow, Blanchett and Hoffman. The music score is mesmerizing and assists in seducing us into fallling in love with people who share their evil side while masking their whole being beneath the facade of The Upper Class. I think the reason Tom Ripley wins us over inspite of his deeds is the fact that he is trying so hard to capture \\"The American Dream\\"...and all the shallowness that can at times represent. Worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devious Mr. Ripley","review":"The Talented Mr. Ripley is an entertaining tale about Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), who fakes his way into meeting the well to do Greenleaf family, and slowly ursurps the role of Dickie Greenleaf. Matt Damon probably gives one of the strongest performances of his career. There are many strong supporting roles as well. Philip Seymour Hoffman as Dickie's Buddy Freddie Miles (Remember Dusty from Twister), Gwenyth Paltrow as Marge Sherwood, and Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf all give amazing performances and really add to the complexity of this story. There are so many great things about this movie, the music, the locations, and the acting. This movie did not fare well on the big screen and may have to do with its length. It is a rather lengthy movie at 2 Hours and 19 minutes and does seem to move a little slow in a couple of places. If it wasnt for that, I would give this one 5 stars. I highly recommend picking this one up today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini vacation","review":"I have seen this movie twice before buying it and when I need a mini vacation from daily life, the colors and sights transport you to another place and time--like leaving your living room without actually leaving it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable Movie","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.

The plot was apparently based on the concept of boring the audience to tears and in that respect it suceeded. I went with a large group of people and only one person liked the film. Also, as we were leaving the theatre, everyone was complaining that they sat through this. Rent it first and if you actually see something that I didn't, then buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh and copy cat","review":"I heard so many good reviews I went to see this movie. I was sick. If anybody likes this movie, they should check with psychologist.It is one of those:\\"tell me if you like this movie, and I will tell you what kind of person you are.\\"The worst was that I found the same movie in foreign section--Made in Italy. So on the top of it, it was just copied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly worth buying","review":"What differs this movie from the others is that Mr.Ripley is an anti-hero, though you want him to win. I think this movie will be something different for those, who are tired of watching Mr.nice guys all the time. I have read the book years ago and and I think it is a very good adaptation but could have also been better. That's why I rated it with 4 stars whereas i'd rate the book with 5. The acting by Matt Damon is also very impressive, he is just like the Ripley I had in mind as i was reading the book. I hope they also shoot the other Ripley books soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen!","review":"If you like a movie which has no story line and drags on for ages then this is the film for you. Honestly I have to say it was the longest 2 and half hours i have spent watching a film. All it is about is a young boy who wants to be something he's not. He will willingly kill to get what he wants and thats about it. Exciting? no way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"One of the worst movies- EVER. The first 30-60 minutes is decent, but from there on out, it just plain stunk. The plot if pretty much predicable and towards the end it's as implausible as the end of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. My suggestion is to leave after the first hour. If not, you're in for a long, boring rest of the movie, which you could take a nap during and not miss much."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long, to long and to boring","review":"This movie did not live up to any of its hype. The Talented Mr. Ripley has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. It could have been cut by 1 hour and still have been boring. When you find the interesting parts of a movie is the scenery its time to burn the film which is just what I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"see and compare","review":"Have you seen the version of this film played by Alain Delon (in the role of Mr. Ripley)? Do and compare. Matt Damon may be good at plain tear jerkers, but he is incapable of playing a psychologically multilayered character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful... awfully boring, too.","review":"Pretentious, slow moving, and unbelievable. I felt embarrassed for Matt Damon throughout this entire film. He cannot turn in a convincing performance to save his life. How the other characters in the film couldn't see through Mr. Ripley's shallowness is surreal. This astonishment totally subverts the audience's ability to suspend disbelief and begins to sink this tawdry film almost from the first reel. The most excruciatingly dull film experience I've had in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooorrrring!","review":"This is without a doubt the dullest film I have seen in a long , long, long time. I've seen more stimulating french films. This film is credited as a psychological thriller and I suppose if you spent a few months in a sensory deprivation chamber you may be mildly aroused. I gave this film three chances, thinking I had missed something from the first veiwing but upon the third sitting I realized there is nothing to miss. Damon's performance is completely pedestrian and could have been duplicated by absolutely anyone. The story is the stuff Nyquil is made of and how any of characters are fooled by Thomas Ripley is the ony mystery in this insult of a film. Too bad zero stars is not an option..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting/BAD movie","review":"The acting in this movie is very good, but thats all you can say about it. The movie does drag a bit and as another reviewer said you don't care if the characters get killed or not. The ending has to be one of the worst I've seen in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neverending movie","review":"I must agree with another reviewer in saying, \\"I couldn't wait for it to end.\\" While I liked Jude Law in the role of Dickie, once he gets axed the movie begins to plunge past the level of mediocrity and keeps going until the end. Honestly, I didn't find Matt Damon's performances subtle -- I don't fault him as an actor, I just think the role wasn't really suited for him, not to mention there really wasn't anything compelling about the character to begin with. Not only is the movie needlessly long, it is in fact painfully long. The only reason I watched it to the end is because I figured -- \\"ok it has to be over soon\\" (this went on for at least an hour). By the end I didn't care if Ripley was caught or not, confessed, went on a bloody rampage, or moved to Kentucky, as long as it happened soon so that the movie would finally be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"I just finished reading this book and really enjoyed it. I dashed out to rent this DVD and had to stop halfway through for the sheer irritation of it all. I finished it this morningI didn't like this movie for two reasons. The gay card was used too fast and sends a odd message. Ripley's character is more complex and making repressed homosexuality the motive for his actions is slow pitch. It's an easy solution and dumbs him down. I'm not comfortable with the message it sends of gays being psychotics and murderers. Oh well, that's Hollywood.The acting was over the top. It's too ham fisted and the actors were cast more for their star power instead of their actual acting ability. Oh well, that's Hollywood.Rent this movie if you must but do not buy it. Read the book. Patricia Highsmith is a great writer and this movie doesn't do her justice. I think I just made a pun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Talented Adaptation","review":"A meandering wandering venture that transforms Ms. Highsmith's novel into a homosexual parady. See Ripley's Game for the proper feel of the character Ms. Highsmith created. A disappointing movie cursed by a bad screenplay and a waste of so many talented actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exploration into the pathetic","review":"Although the acting is good, the premise is utterly despicable. Why would I want to watch a movie about a character with no redeeming values? Just to elevate myself? It's hard to believe that Ripley was a popular enough character to garner five books and multiple movies. Jude Law and Matt Damon were excellent actors but I could never get over the poor storyline. I would definitely not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"the not so talented mr. ripley","review":"Good looking film reminescent of the fifties and sixties films when budgets allowed for exotic location shooting. It takes much too long to get to the spice ultimately what could have been a very good film comes away as just okay. the scene in the jazz bar is a direct ripoff of the scene with the really wonderful \\"It started in Naples\\" with the wonderful sophia loren and clark gable funny i havent heard anyone mention that.

Paint discolored due to the heat, and I would of thought it would be designed not to do this, and to withstand the heat.

This is the last time I buy a toaster based on appearance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book of a Limited Scope","review":"This is a great, GREAT book, but it essentially only covers the excavation and robbing of archaelogical sites in Sipan (Peru). The author does try to make some cross-comparison, but it is apparent that he is not nearly as familiar with other areas of exploration, such as Iraq. However, it is a fantastic exploration of an example of what is currently happening with \\"open\\" archaelogical sites. Like the book cover indicates, it also has a lot of fun detective/police chase stuff. The real life characters in this saga are fascinating. Worth a read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"protects camera..","review":"I an a Lowepro before that had the velcro for the belt strap.This one does nicely but I do miss the \\"easy on\\" velcro..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent size and fit for the Camera","review":"My camera fits nicely in the main pocket of the bag, and it opens smoothly with support on the sides so it doesn't just spill open. The front pocket is expandable, but the velcro flap that doubles as a card holder makes it awkward and bulky. So if you want to carry extra batteries it almost doubles the size of the bag because you have batteries that push it out then a massive flap awkwardly holding it closed. I like it, but I might consider carrying my batteries in another bag if I take it on a trip or an outing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Got This Item","review":"I'm not sure how to rate Eidolon's \\"Coma Nation\\" album, since I never got this item.

I won't ever purchase anything else from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Interesting, and Inspiring","review":"I'm a freshman at college and I was required to read this for class. When I sat down to read this I thought it was going to be just another stupid book. I WAS WRONG! It is one of the most moving and motivating books I've ever read. Wilson backs up all of his ideas 110%. Though they are opinions, he makes some really good points. You'll want to be a biologist after reading it. You'll want to go out and not just plant a tree but a whole forest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very rich book!","review":"An incredibly full and rich book that seems to cover every aspect of nature - it poses great questions about diversity and human impact and uses countless examples and sound research. Really great - better if you have a science background as I (without such a background) was a little lost in some of the examples/descriptions. I ceratinly feel better for having read this book. Its a very important work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a remarkable accomplishment","review":"One of the most accessible of E.O. Wilson's books. This book puts humans in the context of another animal amidst great biodiversity. One of the most humane aspects of this book is to help us humans feel part of something greater, not someone superior and exclusive to nature.The value of biodiversity and the symbiotic relationships of animals to each other paints a picture that is both enlightening as well as uplifting. This book was one that changed my mindset on many fronts and I owe a great deal to E.O. Wilson for this wonderful book.As a companion to this wonderful book, I would read \\"The Ancestor's Tale\\" by Richard Dawkins. You come away from reading both books with a renewed appreciation for life on our planet and for our place amidst this great diversity of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Diversity of Life","review":"Although this book was well written, with sophisticated language, it was quite dry. It greatly resembled a biology textbook, which causes the reader to lose interest. A lot of imagery and vivid description was used, to help depict the theme of the novel. The book explores the many diverse organisms prevalent in the world, as well as the ones that were presend throughout the course of history. Wilson starts his adventure off in the Amazon River Basin, where he encounters many not widely known species. He explains throughout the novel, the importance of the diversity of life, as well as how nataural disasters do not neccesarily harm diversity. This book is recommended to those who enjoy biology, and would like to explore the theories and examples of biological concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we read the same book?","review":"I hated this \\"book\\" more than most. Firstly, I thought it was a whole lot of examples prooving very few points, like a bad essay. He also seemed to rely on his cumbersome vocabulary as a way of asserting his role as the knowledgeable professor; who does he think he impresses? The value of his words ought to be enough, though he doesn't seem to know this. A writer he is not, and it takes one to be a mainstream author. Also, his biases towards his and Darwin's work was sheer denial of the opposing facts. Even worse, his prejudice on the Leaver tribes in the places he stayed at was ghastly. The whole thing made me retch. Why would anyone read this out of free will? The people who think they enjoyed it probably didn't understand it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If you love the planet and want to understand your small place in the grand scheme of things this book is not for you. If you want to understand how we are all interdependent on the life around us, and how evolution has shaped the face of the earth, buy this book. Mr Wilson's writing is welcoming and the information is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great table!","review":"We LOVE this table. It was easy to put together. It is in our entryway. It's very sturdy. There are no nicks in the wood and we really like the color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughh! What a hassle to assemble!","review":"Not as advertised- Poorly made assembly line item imported from China. If it wasn't such a hassle to send back, I would have. Buy Gorilla Wood Glue as the funky screw assembly units for the lower shelf are a trip. I eventually got this hunk of junk put together properly but not without the help of the glue I mentioned and a few bungee cords to act as clamps holding the legs tightly together. I would recommend you find a better table and avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible instructions wrecked product","review":"The table comes dissassembled: no problem, if you can decode the impossible to follow 2-step instructions for a 10 step process, AND if you have the power tools needed to drive screws into holes that are bored too small for the screws. Within 15 minutes of attempting to assemble this table I had ruined it. Shoddy instructions. You get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And the series hits a wall..","review":"My girlfriend got me hooked on this series about a year ago, soon after I had finished trekking through the Harry Potter series. The first book, I finished within 2 or 3 days and loved it, it was fresh and flowed beautifully. The second I enjoyed as much, if not more. However, I'm nearly the end of this one (it's been over a year since I started it) and it's taking every ounce of concentration just to keep up with the story and push through it. I feel the ideas for this book were lacking and Stephen King was pooling from a very short list of ideas. My advice to anyone new to the series, be prepared for a droning and hard to read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLAIN IS PAIN IN MY BRAIN!!!","review":"Where else but in Stephen King's wild imagination could you ever read a book that gives you nightmares about an intelligent but psycho train named Blain? Oh yes, I am having nightmares. This series is consuming my walking thoughts as well as my dream state thoughts. I also was very happy to see Jake again. His early departure had left a hollow inside of me. He is not only back, but he has such more depth to him. Kudos to King!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Waste Lands Book III","review":"Far better than its predecessors. It is a more mature Stephen King, an author who always realized the power and potential of this series, but has now grasped it with white knuckles and pulls you down into the abyss that is his mind. Furthermore, the characters are beginning to be defined with greater clarity, a bond is being formed through King's dialogue. Splendid novel. Despite their unfortunate plight, the reader wishes to join this band of wild cards on their long odyssey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another cliff hanger!","review":"Not only is this story a cliff hanger, it is also a nail biter! Truly remarkable!! Unmistakably one of Kings best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go slow past the Drawers","review":"The Waste Lands I think is what really brings out the decaying world of Roland Deschain. In the first novel, Roland is in frantic pursuit of the Man in Black (Walter O' Dim), and in the second novel, Roland is in a fight for his life at the Western Sea between crazed companions and infection.However, until the third novel, the Waste Lands, Stephen King only hints at the world Roland lives in. It's not until we meet Shardik the Bear and see the madness that is the City of Lud, that despair and tragedy of Roland's world really comes together.I've read this book a couple times now, and I still consider it my favorite of the Dark Tower series. It is truly and epic novel, and really brings the world of Roland Deschain to the reader. I really like how the characters develop, and we see new characters at long last being introduced.Do not pass this novel up if you are a fan of Stephen King and the Dark Tower Series. Once you've read this novel, you have to see how the Series ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"King is amazing! The wastelands is unbelievable!","review":"The dark tower 3 (the wastelands) is a masterpiece of fiction writing and you could make a case once again that THIS is the best book in the dark tower series. There are so many fantastic scenes in this novel.

I could not put it down. The whole series has been spectacular, and every book build on the characters and the story.

He is my favorite author in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands","review":"Third book in the Gunslinger series. Lots of action, paced well, incredibly imaginative. So far, all the books in this series have been excellent. Literary crack."},{"rating":"2","title":"First half - 3 stars; second half - 5 stars!","review":"Yes, Stephen King's epic Dark Tower series is worth continuing, although The Wasteland isn't without shortcomings! King gives us a distinctly different style with each book, and has succeeded thusfar with the exception of the first half of this book. After the cryptic and mysterious Gunslinger and the rip-roaring Drawing of the Three, King hits a little bit of a rut trying to reintroduce Jake, the boy you should recognize from The Gunslinger. The first half is a bit of a drag, plodding through a lot of half-baked, formulaic filler before returning to the real meat of the story - Roland's quest. Fortunately, King makes up for it with a memorable and exciting second half, wherein the weary travelers brave a Mad-Max like post-apocolyptic city with some VERY unfriendly inhabitants. A worthy, if flawed read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roland and Blaine","review":"I am not going to do a rendition of this book, I see this has already been done. This is the third book of the Dark Tower series, following The Gunslinger and The Drawing of the Three. This is my favorite book so far. The story gets better and better the deeper you plunge into Rolands world, and Blaine just topped the cake. Take my advise and read these books in order, you do not want to be lost in Roland's story. I recommend this book and this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book in the series so far","review":"At the end of book two I for one was hoping Roland and his new found traveling partners would at least make it to the base of the tower by the end of book three. If not, then I was hoping Jake would eventually be drawn into Roland's world in book three. If that didn't happen then I wished we could at least explorer Roland's post apocalyptic world a bit more. Two out of three aint bad! In this book, Jake is eventually drawn into Roland's world, we learn a bit more about how messed up that world is and we learn a little bit more about Roland's past. The tower itself is talked about in depth as well and we learn more about it as we learn more about the beam and how both worlds are affected by one another. Finally, there is a chase scene through the ruins of a great city and a cliff hanger of an ending. You couldn't ask for more short of them arriving at the gates of the Dark Tower itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively the best book I ever read!","review":"The Dark Tower is the the finest peice of literature I've ever read. Nothing made a better page-turner than this book. I can't wait until i finish the next one, Wizard and Glass, so i can start waiting for the 5th in the series, Wolves of Calla.

The writing is brilliant; the story is clever and original; and the characters develop even more into real people. Stephen King once again proves that he is a master of his craft right up until the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the series, hands down","review":"King handles the first half of this book with a brilliance he hasn't matched elsewhere. I actually read WL before the other two in the series (had to review it), and I'm glad I did -- \\"Gunslinger\\" would have put me off of DT altogether, and it really is an excellent series. The Waste Lands hooked me from page one, and the intricacies of Jake's travails in New York... suffice it to say that the whole section leaves me, as a writer, with a green-eyed monster in my head. :) Ned Dameron's illustrations are lush and beautiful; I was very disappointed in the illustrations for the others after seeing these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why has Amazon done NOTHING to get this resolved??","review":"There have been issues with this kindle edition of the series for a very long time - given this is not a standalone book, but part of a series...you would have thought some proactive intervention from the publisher.

Stephen King really shows his power as a writer in these books. A suspenseful thrill ride through Roland's Mid-World is the only way to describe it.

You will NOT ne disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess that were the adventure end for me.","review":"After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that seriesNothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boringI guess this is where the adventure end for me.."},{"rating":"1","title":"King in the 90's","review":"King's quality of writing dropped off substantially in the beginning of the nineties, his last great book being Needful Things. None of his later creations can compare in either substance or richness of style to the books he had written in the 70's and 80's - be it Bag of Bones, Gerald's Game, or, for that matter, The Waste Lands. The latter is easily the worst SK book I have read. For the first time I found myself skipping through entire chapters without losing the thread of the narration. The story could be as well fit in a third of the volume. May be a worthy read to the dedicated fans of the Gunslinger series, but definitely not a start for those who want to just familiarize themselves with SK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Held my interest","review":"I enjoyed this third installment in the Dark Tower series.

I truly reccommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very accurate history about the Moffatts!!","review":"I have read this book, and found that the book is not very well-researched about the four brothers from British Columbia, Canada known as \\"The Moffatts\\". I have been supporting (not just a fan of) the Moffatts since late 1994, when I first discovered their gifted talent of singing. I have also learn the history about them, (based on press kits, articles, and the real source, their dad.) Anyway, to the point: I have found many errors in the book that I know are not true about The Moffatts. And there alot of misspells, miswords, and misphrases. For instance, they did not sing \\"What a Wonderful World\\" by Louie Armstrong on their \\"It's A Wonderful World\\" Album. It was \\"(What A) Wonderful World\\" written by Cooke, Alpert, and Alder that they sang was also sung by Herman's Hermits. Totally different lyrics.So I am not giving this book a great rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful............","review":"Now, I got this booke because it was on the Moffatts and I'm like a crazed fan so ya know.....Anyways, the errors in this book were horrible. Yes it is an unathorized book, but there could have been some research involved. The sentence structure, terrible. This is supposed to be an author writing this, it sure didn't sound like one.

The attention to detail and historical accuracy woven into a \\"can't put down\\" story line is exceptional. Creel deftly captures the lives of the Anasazi civilization during its final days. The reader is at once swept back in time and learns about an America that existed well before 1492. I am sure that this book will find itself in the hands of many middle school students and teachers who want to learn more about this period of history-and read a book that is of the same quality as Scott O'Dell's great novel Island of the Blue Dolphins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I believe that this book is so poorly written, so incoherent, that tears well in my eyes about the waste of paper and trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read!","review":"I found the book suspenseful, surprising, creative and thought provoking. At times I had some difficulty following the various storylines, but it was well worth it. I was hard-pressed to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not sure if I loved it or hated it; I won't forget it","review":"This book is haunting. Parts of me want to say it was outrageous, too many ideas that don't fully work, too long, and basically absurd. On the other hand, why didn't I put the book down? Why did I read the whole thing over two days (it takes a longer time than you might expect)? Why can't I stop thinking about the book and the ending? Don't worry, I won't dare reveal the ending. The book has, turns and twists and turns and twists. Some questions are never answered. The book pounds away at the imagery of the shadows it becomes far too much. Still, you read this book and search for ethical answers and find none. I think that confusion and frustration is intentional. So either the book is a work of genius, a mediocore hack job, or something in between. Still, I gave it four stars and you should probably decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but not a Classic","review":"The writing is easy to read, and the plot is easily understood without being too simplistic. It has sci-fi underpinnings, but does not bog the reader down with explanations that would probably wind up being nonsensical anyway. I must note, however, that the passages pertaining to the \\"Shadow World\\" video game become a bit tiresome and over-wrought. There is a twist to the end, which anyone who is paying attention can see coming, yet still manages to suprise based on the \\"I can't believe the author had the guts to do that\\" factor. In other words, its not that you didn't think of it yourself, its that you didn't think anyone would actually DO that - which adds to the fun of the book. I could easily see this book being adapted to film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vacation book","review":"A great read! A fascinating look into cloning and inherited vs. learned behavior.

The entirety of the \\"Shadow World\\" idea is laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot flaw? Too much dumb luck","review":"The writing is ok, the premise is interesting. There are one too many coincidences in the book. Even adjusting for that, the book has a fatal flaw which is only apparent near the end. Unfortunately I can't say much more without spoiling the plot.The only way to resolve this flaw is to say that \\"sheer dumb luck sometimes happens.\\" Either that or a loosely tied sequel in which the mistake is discovered. The weakness starts with the DNA sample and ends with finding the serial killer. It becomes just too serendipitious, all for the sake of forcing in the twist in the end.Additionally, the author would have been better off with a more tightly written and ultimately satisfying main plot rather than veering off into subplots and extraneous characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific thriller!!","review":"I had all but given up on the entire thriller genre, when I came across this book, and I am glad to say that this is probably one of the most literate, complex, and unpredictable thrillers I have ever read!I can't say enough good things about it - it has just the right amount of suspense and an overabundance of character development - something that is usually totally absent from these types of novels.I recommend this book as a great gift - I don't know anyone who wouldn't enjoy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing thriller","review":"I've just finished reading this book, and, although I'm somewhat conflicted over the manner it which it ends (which says as much about me as the book itself, and is not meant as a negative), I've got to say that the book got me interested in the story right off the bat, and kept me hooked through to its ending. The premise is unique, the characters more complex then I tend to expect from the genre, and is very well paced, especially considering the span of time the story encompases. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an unusual and unconventional thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Great Things Must Come To An End","review":"What can I say, Yu Yu Hakusho was a great, and I mean GREAT, show.

This was great and all, but it makes me want to know so very badly!!! Oh yeah, there was one hole in the 111th episode, too. They don't even show Mukuro or Yomi losing in the next round! Instead, you have to listen to Kurama!!! Then again, I would rather have Kurama tell it than the narrator. (Jorge Satome, A.K.A.

What it truly does is gives you a program of social minsitry that ministers very little to the spiritual needs of individuals.

It has just about everything one needs to be a legal secy. I have used it everyday since I got it. They have great legal words like \\"indemnificaiton\\" which I have sought for. Plus, they have legal definitions of the latin terminology, an index of abbreviations, common legal acronyms, and legal brief forms. For me the common legal phrases such as, \\"stipulation discontinuing action and upon motion duly made are most helpful. Now if Ms. Mango would write a book with all that this dictionary has with legal letters, forms, contracts, and grammar, I would be most grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!","review":"I have been looking for the Angel movies for quite some time.

While I do give him credit for his creativity in crafting imaginary worlds, I think his skill when it comes to using language is underdeveloped.

Give me William Gibson instead any time."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a huge Lethem fan, I hated this book","review":"After reading Gun With Occasional Music, Amnesia Moon and Motherless Brooklyn and thoroughly enjoying all 3, I consider myself to be a Lethem fan--DESPITE this book.I have not read any other short stories by Lethem, but I didn't enjoy ANY of the stories in this book. They all start with really interesting and promising (\\"lethemesque\\") premesis and then either go somewhere too wierd in what is apparently an attempt to be provocative, or go nowhere. Each could probably be a great novel if flushed out. Instead, they either gross you out, put you to sleep, or bore you to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love JCO, but this was too difficult","review":"This is not the kind of book you should read when you're tired. It was difficult to follow. There were many characters, and sometimes they were the narrators, sometimes a narrator dealt with them, with little transition or indication. The whole novel is divided into a myriad of vignettes, at times way apart from one another. Also, maybe because i was so frustrated with it, the end is confusing and other than the veiled allusions of catastrophe, i couldn't make too much sense of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, repetitive dialog","review":"I must agree with Whitney (see the review) about this book. A great deal must have been lost in transation. Some phrases were used over and over and over. The dialog mostly consisted of two or three word sentences, and went ON for PAGE AFTER PAGE AFTER PAGE. I cannot recommend this book to anyone, I read about one third of the book before I finally gave up. And reiteration was rampant, adding nothing to the book. It culd have been whittled down to half as many pages with no loss of the story (assuming there was a story). Horrible!

I am an enthusiastic reader of mysteries from all countries. But swedish mysteries are getting on my nerves; the swedes can't get over their heat or their cold [I am scandinavian, by the way]- and this permeates their writing. I will finish this novel. I have taken a pledge. I kept up to page 100 and it appeared to pick up; but, alas, I put it down only to pick up again and so on and so on - will it ever end!!!

However, the three \\"Uptempo\\" remixes sound almost exactly the same. The second one is very subtly different, but aside from that they are very similar, and they really shouldn't have bothered putting all three of them on this single. The fourth remix, the \\"Ballad Album Mix\\", gave Raven a great chance to show off her vocals. If you are willing to spend this much money on the single, you might as well pay the few extra dollars for the full album, which includes four versions of \\"With A Child's Heart\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the reason why people think southern rap sucks","review":"This song is just a terrible, awful mess from start to finish.

Laffy Taffy is exactly what it is- chewy, sticky taffy. I remember getting it at the store back in the day for 5 cents and the Laffy Taffy wrapper always contained jokes printed inside of it. The jokes weren't even funny. Anway, the \\"Laffy Taffy\\" song is a generic version of \\"Tootsie Roll\\", which was also wack back in 1994. \\"Laffy Taffy\\" has to be the worse of the two. I'm sure Willy Wonka (Nestle) has seen a boost in its sales of Laffy Taffy thanks to free advertising. People who never knew what Laffy Taffy was certainly know what it is now.

Every musician has good days and bad days and unfortunately this was one of the bad days. There's really nothing melodic, harmonic, or rhythmically interesting about this recording. It just sounds like one person taking turns blowing a bunch of nonsense. All of the musicians can blow, but just because you can blow, doesn't mean you should do it all the time. The best jazz musicians build improvisations based on little themes and ideas that happened in a composition's main melody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, if brief, overview","review":"There are a number of 'Music In Review' DVDs, or similar UK-based rock docs, floating around and I enjoy them all quite a bit. While they were obviously filmed on a low-budget (usually it is live takes, demos or alternate takes that are played as the albums are being discussed) and seem to feature the same cast of UK rock critics (Geoff Barton, Dom Lawson, Malcolm Dome, etc.), I still think they are pretty informative and entertaining. These are not in-depth career overviews but they cover the essential albums (if not all of them) and the critics obviously know their stuff. This is not an band-authorized release but those aren't always truthful anyway, are they?For die-hards, I think this is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Defenders Of The Faith Review?","review":"No Defenders Of The Faith review?

After penning huge singles for the likes of Ginuwine, Aaliyah, Destiny's Child & 702, one might expect Missy to hold on to a tune or two that she can use on her own to her advantage. No such luck.The only hot things on this record are \\"Bring the Pain\\" with Method Man, \\"Gossip Folks\\" with Ludacris, \\"PussyCat\\" & \\"Funky Fresh Dressed\\" with Ms Jade. The rest of the album is pure garbage and makes fans urn for her to finish the construction next time before releasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"missy fans need to seek help","review":"\\"Ratta ta ta tata tata ta ta, sex me so good I say blah blah blah\\". I tell ya what, this girl's got some real rap talent. It must have taken her awhile to come up with those powerful and moving lyrics, I can't believe she dosent sell more records. This song is even more greatly lyrically laced than \\"get yur freak on\\".C'mon folks this is getting sad. I know this younger generation isn't very good at judging talent but do we really got to jock this stuff because it's forced in yo ear. Theres alot of artist that really actually spend time making there music that deserve a shot.

Have you listened to the lyrics on \\"Work it\\", she changes the subject every line. And all the production sounded the same on the album, all with that \\"space age\\" sound courtesy of Timbaland. She needs to stop trying to be original, and stick to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Old School","review":"I'm a big fan of Missy, but this album is too old school. I listened to the album on one of my friend's headphone sets and felt like throwing it in the garbage. Most of the tracks are old school, and I'm not feeling that. The only song I like on the album is Gossip Folks, the rest is corny. If you like old school, I suggest you buy it, but this is definately not Missy's best album.

Thirdly what's with the stopping in between songs to talk to us? If we wanted an exclusive lecture from Missy we would look for you online.(Stick with the music.)

Often Missy has found herself changing the face of hip hop and r&b with singles like \\"Da Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\\", \\"Hot Boyz\\", and last years smash \\"Get Ur Freak On\\", but songs like this just don't seem to exist on \\"Under Constructtion\\". The first single \\"Work It\\", with beats by Timbaland and some catchy rhymes, is already climbing up the charts, but you won't find any more radio hits for Elliott on this album. \\"Play Dat Beat\\" and \\"P***ycat\\" would be good radio singles for some artists, but are beneath Elliott, and often times on the album other artists like Ms. Jade overpower Elliott (\\"Funky Fresh Dressed\\"). All in all, Missy Elliott has definitely took a step in the wrong direction, some advice for Missy is to go back to \\"Miss E...So Addictve\\", her best set as far as i'm concerned, and get back on the right path."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a little more \\"construction\\"","review":"Honestly, i would not recommend buying this album because the only good songs on it are \\"Work it\\" and \\"Pussycat\\". i have never been a very big fan of hip hop and this album reminded me why.

When Missy and Timbaland put their heads together, they usually come up with something wild, off-the-wall, and blazin, but this time around, I just wasn't feeling \\"Under Construction.\\" It was cool how she considered trying to lace every track on her record with an old-school feel, but in her case, I saw it as a waste of time. She tried to change hip-hop classic beats with her own wicked style and it all failed to me. The only cut off this album that I thought was dope was \\"Can You Hear Me\\" featuring TLC, which is dedicated to the memory of Aaliyah and \\"Left Eye\\"...the beat was mellow and the lyrics were from the heart. Other than that, my advice would be to pass on this Missy album and to check out her older stuff (that's when she was dope)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missy deserves respect","review":"Missy is just tryin' to make hip-hop/rap a fun activity.

If I ever need assistance in committing suicide I might actually buy this album (or maybe if I ran out of coasters to put my drinks on).

(but still,O.K)Worth Your Money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aces","review":"After three CD's of great hits plus filler, Missy Elliott - Virginia's finest - goes Under Construction and comes up a winner. Her string of ace singles continues with the insinuating sex rap of \\"Work It\\", and there are no no lack of follow-ups - \\"Bring the Pain\\", \\"Gossip Folks\\", \\"P***ycat\\". Fresh and funky grooves pile up one atop the other, with the occasional break for a ballad. The woman herself may be thinner, but her beats are still - to use an old school term - phat. And, rapped or sung, her lyrics are always playful and imaginative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything Missy, anytime.","review":"Usually you spend your hard earned $$$ on a CD and after a few plays, put it aside until you hear it a decade later and want to relive the \\"oldies\\". On the other hand, you can invest in a Missy CD and listen to it for a year and discover each track is \\"your new favorite\\". Missy and Timbaland are one unit that makes me just buy the CD, cause I know it will be better than anything else out there - the music makes you move, the lyrics make you laugh and make you think. I look forward to each release date with anticipation of the music and the fabulous videos.On that note, I really do enjoy Under Construction. I think that there is a lot more chit chat on this one, and not minding the tributes, wish that every song didn't start off as \\"another Missy Elliott exclusive\\" - it's a little much. Yet, the beats, the words, they get trapped in your head and it's a good thing. I can't wait to \\"discover\\" each new track and look always forward to all of the future releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Under Construction","review":"If you like funky cool beats then Missy is a exelent example cause he base her songs on beats. But for those who like some good lyrics and a catchy hook then you should listen to something else. Missy is alot about beats, she mostly makes cool videos too that are geting overplayed on MTV. But the lyrics and dull and hook...what hook? has she even made a song with a decent hook. Thing is Missy is neither such a good rapper or singer, that explains why she always have guest artists on her songs doesn't it? This album brings absolutely nothing new to the market, it's just repeating the same message that she's already sent before. This Album is still under construction and i doubt it will ever be finnished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy crap","review":"I swear, hip hop is going downhill. With idiots like Missy Elliot trying their hand at rapping and succeeding, there's no telling what other talentless f***ers will show up to 'change the game'. She is by far the worst rapper to ever release an album into the hip hop culture and should be banned from releasing anymore (but it's too late for that, i.e. This Is Not A Test). Her lyrics are just f***ing stupid and sexed out, and how she got rappers and singers with actual skill to participate in this crap is a mystery. Someone needs to kill her before she releases anymore crap like this into the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a coaster","review":"Under construction?

I only recently discovered this author and as a Georgette Heyer fan I really enjoy Hodge too. This book is particularly good because it doesn't fall into the trap of putting historical details before story (as many of Hodge's books do). It has a good plot, great characters (including an unusually young hero who is about 22 I think), and, as the title suggests, a lot of adventure. The romance is nice but not sickly. A very enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for tall people","review":"Got 2 of them, but unfortunately had to return them. Still too short for a guy of 6.3'.

Her voice displays a lovely, warm intimacy, both with her lyrical topics, and towards her audience, and every word shines as clear as glass. This CD offers up a satisfying blend of comfortable old chestnuts and beautifully crafted new songs, most notably by musician's musician, Michael Brill. All in all, a lovely album from a lovely singer, unafraid to sing us her heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it all the time","review":"This is my second one.

Good product and does what it is supposed to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooks broke after second use","review":"We purchased our Zip Net to secure a load on the interior of our SUV. First use was a bit difficult - making adjustments wasn't that easy. On the return trip, it was a bit easier to sort out since we had already used it. We then stored the Zip Net in the back of our SUV. It's been about a year since we used it, but today we pulled it out and three of the hooks broke. We were shocked that the hooks just snapped in half where they connect to the cords. Fortunately we didn't have the cargo net under a lot of tension when the breaks occurred."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull book","review":"I wasn't overly thrilled with this novel.

The setup was extremely slow as it took over a day to initialize the raid drive. Once the unit was setup we discovered that it can only write at 7mb/sec max.

If these are advanced exercises, the beginner version must be for people with zero muscle mass. The voiceover is monotone, the models have zero personality or charisma.

And if you are buying it for the nudity, then you are better off with porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible work out video","review":"It is obvious that this was not meant to be a serious exercise video. It looks like it was filmed in someone's garage. The exercises are not very good and the models do not look like they are familiar or comfortable doing them.

An excellent purchase if you do not expect to get the Thoth deck with your order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apallingly simple, not for serious students","review":"It appears the author either never read any of Crowley's writing, or simply chooses to ignore it. He fails to mention the Hebrew Alaphabet correspondences in the Major Arcana. This is inexcuseable as they are clearly present on each trump. His treatment of Kabbalah and Rosicrucianism is practically non existent. In my reading the symbolism of the back of the cards in not even examined. Furthermore his descriptions are all slanted toward fortune telling, not from my understanding what Crowley was about. His description of The Emperor's legs as forming the number 4 is flat wrong. It is rather the Alchemical symbol of Sulfur the male element, in contrast to the Empress' forming of the symbol for Earth the female component. You will do much better reading Crowley's Book of Thoth, DuQuette's Thoth guide,or Banzhaf's Keywords book. If you are a serious student of Theurgy don't waste your resources on this childish effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angle all wrong for a tall bike","review":"Don't buy this kickstand if you have a tall bike.

However, it unfortunately did not fit my bike. The kickstand itself has a thick part through which you are meant to screw it onto your bike, but its thickness in addition to the thickness of its corresponding part on my bike made it too thick for the bolt provided with my bike or the shorter bolt provided with the kickstand. I attempted to use the longer bolt, but was unable to get it securely fasted onto my bike, so it wobbled back and forth. Additionally, the \\"instructions\\" provided with it were vague and unhelpful.

I also appreciate the fact that it's made in the USA. The black finish is nice looking and the design is simple and clean. However, it does not fit on my particular bike (Nashbar Hounder).

My order also came with the rubber feet which helps give the stand some grip.The only issue I had was that it was slightly too long. I was easily able to cut down the length with a hacksaw to make it work better. I probably took off a little too much, but it still works great. Some advice. Make sure you only trim down a little bit at a time to avoid making it too short.

The stadiums look great and the players are recognizable. The details on the shirts are a little blurry, but thats just being picky. The controls on the other hand are a little frustrating. The game requires you to use the analog stick which, in my opinion doesn't work very well. Trying to perform quick turns and cuts is almost impossible and my passes tend to go to players other then who i intended it to. Freekicks are incredible, indentical to the console versions. The sound is not bad, if you can stand the weird songs from all the international no name bands. It even has a music video from one of the bands and something that looks like someone's half attempt at a music video made with a computer graphics program.Overall the game is not bad, and being that I'm addicted to soccer in all forms and fashions, I give it a 4. Although i pray that there will be a Winning Eleven on the system, this is the best choice so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful purchase","review":"My son like the FIFA soccer and he is having fun with this item.

First the graphics are good, the gamplay is good but might need a little touching up, the songs are FINALLY good after 3 years of horrible song selections, and the franshice mode is really good. They put you in a season with your team that you pick while they already played 15 games or so. So you can bring your favorite team back to life, or continue there hot streak. This game should be in your psp collection along with Burnout Legands, Atv Offroad Fury 3 and NBA Live 06."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of replay value...unfortunate gameplay lags.","review":"While this game is lots of fun, you'll find some almost-unacceptable gameplay lags.When you take a shot on goal, if you score, no lag. If it ends up deing deflected or shot out of bounds (which happens more than scoring, of course), there's about a 2-second lag while the game processes the out-of-bounds. Also, when pausing, there's about a 4 second lag before the pause screen appears. Sometimes *gasp* you have to press it twice to get the pause. Like I said, the game is enjoyable and I play it a lot, but these little lags make you feel like you're playing something that was rushed out of the door to make the PSP launch.I've heard the newer Fifa 06 for PSP fixes these little annoyances, but that's not firsthand knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This book may well have been filled with great writing, however, as a dog owner and lover, I was disgusted and depressed reading these stories.

It is made for Physical Therapy patients so you know it's sturdy and won't explode if it gets punctured.

I blew them up I was sitting on the floor. My suggestion would be to order two sizes larger. I'm only 5'4\\" so if this ball was the proper size it would have been the perfect size. Since I'm between the height of 5'1\\" - 5'5\\". I returned the balls and got one from Walmart, the same \\"size\\" 55cm and it was much bigger like it was suppose to be.

Even when I inflate it to as much as it seems to hold, it still does not measure 45 cm. But, even if it is (and I am doing something wrong), it is certainly not functional. The ball is hard as a rock. So, given it's size, makes it impossible to lay on unless you want to feel like you are pressing your abdomen against a rock. Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping ripoff","review":"I didn't buy this ball because I read other reviews that say that the ball arrives in a small envelope and yet they are trying to charge me $14 for shipping it.

After the ball finished outgassing (it smelled like vinyl flooring for about 12 hours) I came across a longer-term problem: size. I'm 6' so I ordered the suggested 65 cm/26\\" ball. Unfortunately the ball is closer to 20\\" in height. I thought I'd confused diameter and circumfrence, but after reviewing my geometry realized that wasn't the problem.

First, it's not so much a ball as it is an egg -- its long diameter is a few inches more than its shortest diameter. Second, it's surface is slicker than other brands, making it difficult to use it in ways that depend on surface friction. Fortunately, I bought another brand and have happily switched.

Seems like a new cheap Chinese model versus the model I bought several years ago which is very round and works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inconsistent sizes, but still a great alternative to office chairs","review":"Best quality that I have found yet and the balls arrived quickly. The one drawback though is that the balls are not a consistent size. Ordered 10+ over several orders and there is some big size differences. Maybe that is just due to the nature of the product though. One of our silver (85') balls is smaller than the size of the other blue (75') balls. In addition, the silver balls are all slightly different sizes too, and not due to inflation differences. Did not contact the seller because the person was happier with the blue size than the silver, so it is likely that they would have remedied this if asked. Nothing wrong with the seller per se, but buyers might want to be aware that there could be size discrepancies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing is WRONG on the exercise ball","review":"Six years ago, I bought a Thera-band 65cm ball to use at the office.

This book is much more ponderous than anything I have read by him to date. The book attempts to be the light hearted adventure of his previous series (Guardians of the Flame) but falls way short. The basic story and premise are interesting, but the story itself is lackadaisically written requiring me to make a concerted effort to finish the book. It feels as though the characters are going in circles and the story randomly jumps from one character to the other, making it very tiresome to read.

I tried really hard with Paladins, slogging on well after I felt like quitting, but in the end I just couldn't take it. It just inches along at a terribly slow pace, the characters meandering around, crossing and recrossing their own paths without apparently making any headway or having much of anything interesting happen. Rosenberg keeps introducing pointless and uninteresting subplots and characters all over the place even as the overarching plot goes nowhere, and the whole thing steadily devolves into a confusing mess. Then suddenly the mystery they were trying to uncover is explained by a highly convenient villain who pops out of nowhere. The reveal was so random and underwhelming that I finally quit reading right then, at what was supposed to be right before the climax of the novel.What can I say? Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"On my bookshelves I have 11 hardcover books by Joel Rosenberg plus several paperbacks. I thoroughly enjoyed all of them. Rosenberg has few equals when it comes to action and adventure mixed with humor and an assortment of interesting and likable characters. That is why Paladins is such a huge disappointment. The book is totally devoid of humor. There is some action, but the scenes are interspersed with numerous pages of dullness. The characters must set a record for pomposity. Few of them are interesting or likable. The word that comes to mind that most describes this book is BORING. The book jacket says this is the beginning of a new series. I sincerely hope not.

(All of their shows seem to be of this caliber). The story is sugary, Marcus O'Malley comes across as a combination of Clint Eastwood and Robert Young, and the women in the story are generally portrayed as helpless, in need of a man's love and protection in order to survive.

I personally use it with MSFSX, so the fire buttons do not make much sense for me, but it is ok. It is awesome, mainly because of the double throttles which can be configured for two engines or engine/mixture or whatever you want. However, there is a BIG issue which would make me think twice before buying it: it does not have any vacuum rubber or velcro to stick it on the table. As a consequence, frequently you have to use the other hand to hold its base. What I did was to buy those velcro strips with stickers, which helped me to keep it steady on the table.

Reason enough to get this dvd. Beautiful film transfer, however, did anyone else notice (aside from the missing soundtrack in one scene) that the sound is slightly off? In certain scenes, if you pay close attention to the actor's mouths, the words don't quite match up with the movements. Paramount... what's up with that? Will these errors be corrected??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant re-work from Paramount","review":"I would consider myself a hardcore trekkie, and I was pretty impressed with this DVD. In the first minute of watching The Doomsday Machine, I heard a slight sound glitch, but other than that, it was superb! The film has been restored as well as it could have been by the looks of it, and the sound is great - apart from being a little flat in some places. One of the best episodes from Classic Trek, and the DVD release makes it oh so much better. Restoring anything from the 60's would be hard, so well done Paramount!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a favorite","review":"two of my favorite episodes--one one dvd. great quality dvd, jewel case, literature. quick service in mailing me my dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is awesome","review":"I loved this book.

And to that girl about breaking their nails, well, the Bratz wouldn't care, if they were worried about it, then they wouldn't go camping if that was to happen, maybe if they did they would say \\"Ow I broke a nail\\", I mean, some times it does hurt, but they wouldn't go \\"OMG, I broke a nail, call the ambulance, I'm going to die!!\\", they wouldn't get that freaked. Anyways, this is the perfect camping outfit, that still has style and beauty.

And her 'shine' is awesome--she is gorgeous, sexy and has a spunky character to work with, but...the show seems to say \\"Mediation\\" is the second coming and that just didn't 'win' me over. Sarah's relationship with her ex-husband the DA is ok and I like how she interacts with the other characters in her short skirts but the 'meat' of the program that Mediation results in a 'win,win' situation for folks headed to Court with lawyers is just not that interesting or believeable. So I found Sarah a '10' and hope she finds another series that matches her dazzling beauty and personality, but I found this show just too 'dumb' and 'light' to continue watching after about 6 episodes.

More will come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Porcupine Tree has some talent","review":"I have several Porcupine Tree albums and find them all a good listen. I find it to be boarder line Progressive Rock. All their music is big, majestic. Well written and well produced. You may put them in the vein of Spock's Beard but the Beard is clearly more Progressive and less commercial. Both good listens.This album is live if I remember correct and brings out the true sound of the band as Live performance tends to do. It's a good album all round and the songs are entertaining. Isn't that what we want in music.A lot of Tree's music seems dreamy and heavenly, as in floating on a cloud and not religious. But at the same time it won't put you to sleep. It's a complex sound and deserves it's due.I think the key to their music is really good song writing that is well executed and produced.If you're into Progressive Rock, you'll like the Tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just can't justify 4 stars","review":"As a general rule I usually avoid live albums, preferring studio albums.

These guys deserve no criticism from me, because they're doing what I'd give my left orb to do, that being playing wonderfully creative and truly emotionally evocative music. So how do we, the musically starved masses tell the world that a band like PT exists? I'll make it my chosen cause to do just that, because if it were me being Steve Wilson and being ignored by radio for all these years, I'd want someone to pass the word along.

There were a number of additional editions printed during Darwin's lifetime, reflecting later thoughts, but to see his thinking as of 1859, this is a good, and relatively scarce book to own.

Since it is a 'facsimile' of the first edition (written in bold yellow on the spine) it is the same- page numbers, language, everything. What I found immediately odd was that the text is centered into a small portion, there is at least an inch all the way around of blank paper. Leading me to the conclusion that the book could be of smaller dimension. Also the binding seems to be too tight (this may just be my copy). The book doesn't lay flat, it opens up toward the outside, as if it needs more space. It kind of looks like a well worn paperback, but this is a hardcover. Also, because of the tightness, it's hard to read. The book always wants to close on me, quite a lot of pressure is needed to keep it open.

The one star is misleading except to clear up an issue.The reason for this negative review is that I purchased my product from \\"Green Web Properties,\\" one of the sellers on this page, and was shipped Liquid Silk. The bottle of Liquid Silk even had a tag on it that said Maximus, but there is no mistaking the two. Maximus is a clear gel, Liquid silk is a white cream.In other words, with \\"Green Web Properties\\" you may not know what you are getting, if you order from them I suggest you contact them first to see if the issue was resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price of admission.","review":"Maximus is much more full-bodied than other lubricants out there. It has a wonderful ability to adhere to lubricating surfaces even in very tight quarters... it doesn't become wiped away when the squeeze is on, but rather continues to maintain a slippery film between the moving parts.If it is wiped off with a towel instead of being washed off, it doesn't leave a sticky, unpleasant residue like KY or ID will, but it isn't the nice smoothness that Liquid Silk delivers either... it is kind of neutral.So,the bottom line is: in it's place, (the very tight squeezes that will have a lot of friction) Maximus can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable for anal (for me)!!","review":"While this lube may work fine for you, I found it to be unusable anally.

This album was written prior to Bewilderbeast, so that should also be noted and considered. There is less music on it, and it has less lyrical prominences. The instrumental sections are still excellent, and the lyrical songs are still catchy, and their unique sound is still there.

These books should be read in succession for a revealing look at the writer, best known for his books about dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong singing","review":"This disc, one of several in \\"The English Anthem\\" series, is of notable achievement. It is also unique for the diverse nature of the selections. There are standards such as Walton's \\"Set Me as a Seal\\" and the romantically dramatic \\"Expectans expectavi\\" of Charles Wood. A new anthem to me was the unusually precocious offering by Thomas Attwood, \\"Come, Holy Ghost\\", sounding much more mature than the times in which it was written. Yet, new pieces such as Robert Saxton's \\"At the round earth's imagined corners\\" reminded me that English choral composition is still wonderfully alive and beautiful.The singing throughout is very good, although, as with many British choirs, the boy sopranos can often overwhelm. That said, this album is a treat for the ears and a lasting one for all to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not slim fitting","review":"This is probably a fine blazer, but it is not a slim-fitting garment, despite its description as such.

I've been on six different anti-depressants, had five years of talk therapy, and read a shelf full of books on depression. My results have been marginal.Nothing changes my moods and outlook as quickly or as powerfully as the work I do guided by Burn's book. His approach looks simple--even simplistic at times. Do not be deceived. The approach, thinking, and exercises in the book are sound and sophisticated. The key is following Burns' instructions and doing the work.When I purchased my copy of Burns' book, I dismissed the title as marketing hype. The title proved true for me. In less than a week after beginning the work in the book, I saw significant changes in my mood, motivation, and outlook on life.Get the book. Do the work. The exercises are challenging. There are days I hate Burns and his book.

After reading it, they are even more discouraged because the book trivializes their problems and as well as the seriousness of low self-esteem. Anyone who truly understands what low self-esteem is, knows you cannot recover from it in a few days, weeks, or even months.

I AM medicated, and to read that I could be cured \\"without medication\\" was quite offensive to me. It sounds as though the writer is suggesting that there is something wrong with taking meds (other wise why would it be highlighted as a positive that you could do without?)I have enough issues about judging myself without some author already thowing such an ignorant statement out there.

The hook that holds it on your ear is so soft that the headset just flops around on the side of your head. You have to keep your head tilted to the side to keep it in your ear!

Also included are cultural beliefs. A brief lesson in bread-related French words could also be obtained. It concludes with a wine suggestion for each type of bread. The recipes are easy to follow. A lot of practice might be required for best results and this little book proves handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it only as a gift","review":"Peter Mayle's \\"Confessions of a French Baker,\\" is a slim, cute little book that spans 89 pages and with its compact pages, extremely wide margins, and larger typeface can easily be read from cover to cover within 10 - 15 pages (and no, i'm not exaggerating).While the title of this book suggests deep insight into the secret methodology of a world-class French bakery what Mayle provides is an extremely limited and basic examination of Gerard Auzet's boulangerie - Chet Auzet. While this book does provide a handful of bread recipes and suggested wine pairings for particular style of loaves - the actual narrative content could easily be crammed into a pamphlet.This book will certainly appeal to fans of Mayle as well as Francophiles or bread/bakery afficionados and due to its elegant design would be well suited as a gift item as well.

Having been excited to receive this product, I was disappointed in the poor design and had to use a magnifier to see it while I worked. The connecting ring was just too small and flimsy, and I had to pry the wires apart with a letter opener which left the ring bent open. Then after I finally got the ring on the broken zipper part, I had to use pliers to close it and it did not close properly as the wires are just too small and fragile. My husband tried installing the second one and he was unsuccessful for the same reasons. I ended up throwing both away.

It briefly summarizes the nature of the functions when they're in the dominant role for purposes of contrast, but that's not the focus of the book. This is to my knowledge the definitive book on the nature of the inferior functions, and together with Lenore Thomson's \\"Personality Type\\" which deals with functions in their dominant role, it covers the most important aspects of personality theory. If you're new to personality theory, I recommend reading Lenore Thomson's book before this one. They're both roughly the same quality (excellent), but knowing the nature of the inferior functions isn't as urgent as knowing the nature of the dominant functions. These two books are a must read for anyone interested in personality theory. Naomi L. Quenk (the author) is INFP. I am INTP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read on type and the shadow function","review":"For decades I had been searching for a book on how the shadow function operates during stress or job burnout.

It's a book I will keep on my shelf and comes in handy when I write plays or novels as well to get a handle on my characters and how they interact.

Clipping grocery coupons and setting goals get equal mention in this \\"analysis\\".Then the writing and organization is simply sloppy: women are divided into alpha and beta types that are never defined.

Lastly I found it distracting that God was literally referenced on just about every page, along with bible passages and talks of much prayer.The final straw was when the authors suggested praying outloud to God when the love-making is over but while your husband is still inside of you.

A lot of the ideas seem natural for newlyweds so reading this as a refresher course is a good option. There are over 200 creative romantic ideas and special sections for \\"Hands-on Homework.\\" I liked the ideas about redecorating the bedroom to fit your fantasy location. Many of the ideas will also work for \\"romance on a budget.\\" Making up code words, leaving secret notes and surprising your partner with romantic outings will make your love life hotter than before.

It sounds like you are listening to AM radio. The rest of the tracks are all over the place, from bad to worse. There isn't a single track on this album that I can even stand to listen to.I can't believe that this was worked on by anyone who knows anything about music engineering or mastering. It obviously wasn't. The engineer(s) should be fired for doing this kind of work.I love the Monkees, but this set is a real disgrace to their music.

They were very popular and were well done and I am disappointed they are not included. Secondly, why was Peter Tork allowed to sing when his obnoxious song \\"Auntie Grizelda\\" was added and he sounds like he is struggling with the notes? He never had a voice. Mike Nesmith's \\"You Just May Be The One\\" is too country & western and is so out of place with this mix. Lastly, why did they rock up \\"I Wanna Be Free\\" when it was originally an slow acoustic version sung so sweetly by Davy Jones? Whoever made the song selections and did the engineering needs to attend a Rock 101 class.

Listening to the samples here.the music seems weak, the quality of the recording poor. I can't imagine why I remember enjoying these songs because most of them sound horrible now.

I was 7 when I first heard The Monkees and had a couple of their albums. Vinyl records are more memorable than this! In the Theme song it seemed muted. Last Train to Clarksville was what I remembered. I hated the few songs that Davey Jones sang on and Mike Nesmith is just too country. Spare your eardrums the monstrosity of Auntie Grizelda. Peter Tork sings flat and out of tune. I hate it now as much as I did when I was a kid. Some of the songs I never even heard of. There's also a Bonus Karaokee disk. Now I've Karaokee'd and I'm good, but this disk makes even me sound bad, and that takes some doing. All in all it's an UGH for me. After 2 plays I had to give it up. The Monkees, at least from my point of view, who was around when they first came out and used to sing with their albums should stay in the 60's where they belong. The Best of the Monkees?

It turns out her parents are complicit in repressing the nightmare and meanwhile a slasher is going around the town and the college campus slaughtering people.An interesting premise is helped by the fact that the film will hold your attention but in the end if you want a good slasher, there are many better ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initiation","review":"1980's teen-slasher flick that is pretty ordinary fare.The only novelty values in this film are a young pre-fame Daphne Zuniga (Melrose Place) and a young pre-fame Hunter Tylo (The Bold and the Beautiful).While the film is probabaly a forgotten past on the ladder up for both ladies it is Hunter Tylo who now campaigns for christian values who desperately tries to forget the film more.Hunter has the all-important vital role of - The pretty girl who takes off all her clothes in front of the cameraman takes a shower in front of him and then gets out and dries herself in front of him just in case the eager teen male moviegoer missed her completely nude body the first times around - .Oh the joy of hollywood!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheesey","review":"I got this because I'm a big fan of Hunter Tylo and Daphne Zuniga.

Watching this could be considered hazing!","review":"So the name Daphne Zuniga caught my eye while scrolling through the horror section and I thought. Damn, I love Spaceballs! So I gave this one a shot and somehow made it all the way to the end despite my wife's pleading. An unmistakenly 80's horror as you will laugh FAR more than jump!So the plot is, a college girl is having re-occurring nightmares about her childhood and then people start dying. Along the way we are introduced to her sorority sisters, parents and her 'dreamy' psychology professor. Ha, ya see what I did there! That pretty much sums it up. Oh yeah, it takes place in a mall or something.So here's what you can expect, bad FX, bad writing, bad (but hysterical) acting..... Catching on here? So if you feel the need for a horror movie, rent something else. Looking for a comedy, this could fit the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bargain","review":"The Initiation is one of the top ten 80s slasher movies. It stars Daphne Zuniga of Spaceballs fame. Good T&A plus gore, it satisfies the slasher flick formula. Mountaintop Motel Massacre is certainly watchable.

Demidenko produces a fuller, richer sound; his tone control and technique are simply extraordinary. The Lizst Sonata is a long, structurally complex work filled with many emotionally interesting episodes. The trick is to unify those interesting episodes into an interesting whole. Demindenko does that. In my opinion this guy Demidenko is one of the best pianists alive today.

For the old blue/red (really looks like green/magenta on these glasses), the 3D looks fairly decent!3 bonus DVD's contain Shemp, Joe Besser, and Joe DeRita's solo shorts mostly from the 40s and 50s. Shemp is truly hilarious in both starring shorts and supporting rolls. This is the first time I've ever seen these.If I have one complaint (very, very minor) is that the discs come one to a slimline case. That's a lot of cases. Would have rathered a deluxe 10 disc case or something to hold all of them, but trust me, I'm nitpicking.

Also, the shorts that were released in the original volumes that were presented in the \\"widescreen\\" format weren't actually filmed that way. Columbia, or Sony, simply cropped the tops and bottoms of the later shorts to have them appear to have been filmed in widescreen. Why was this done? The only thing I can think is that they released these shorts to theaters that were showing full length features that were in the widescreen format, which was new to that era.

Both are narrative, but Puzo's characters are rounder; neither is dramatic.Breslin is fun when he writes about those who connive against interest. But characters here are thin; interactions between lovers are haptic--flat AND thin, like cartoons. His gift is tapping memory for an image, a smell, a habit; and making just-in-time connections--gangster trading cards undoing the mob. But zip in his prose has gone missing. Maybe New York has changed for him, too, and his point, that the world of the mob was its own undoing, applies to him.

Reading about the Mafia was almost a hobby for me, real life soap opera; Breslin was always there, commenting, following, allowing me into their world through tabloid print. In this book, it seems like Breslin struggles in creating historic fiction. His story telling is uneven and sporadic, akin to sitting around with a reminiscing Grandpa, waiting impatiently through the slow and disjointed anecdotes, wondering if the chuckle was worth the wait. The characters, hyperboles providing targets of convenience for uprorious laughter, are underutilized as Breslin scores low, many circles away from the bull's eye.Big dissappointment.

I used to read Ms. Coulter's books with fascination until I went to college. Now I know better (and more). Her characters are trite and the rough sex is more disturbing than titillating. Also, her grasp of the English language is weak--a picture is \\"hung\\" and a man is \\"hanged.\\" Helen Mayberry had enormous potential as a character that she ceased to realize by the middle of the book. The suspenseful treasure hunt degenerated into nonsense by the end and was randomly complicated by the introduction of the former husband. Why must every woman in her novels receive a beating?

The discipline was an interesting twist, but still didn't exactly rivet me to my chair. The story does add more detail about the Sherbrookes (the Bride trilogy), and caught up a few other characters from earlier books, and these were what kept my interest. One very good thing was that she has stopped using \\"thus\\" so frequently in the characters' conversations, which was very annoying in her previous Regency books. I recommend it as a light read. Keeper? Probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs to be whipped into shape","review":"I agree with the first reviewer. All of the discipline talk did not give me a thrill.

I was excited to see that there was another book with tie ins to the other books. Where I really liked the characters in the Brides books, Spencer and Helen were VERY underdeveloped. There was all this sex and weird discipline, and the plot itself was weak. The villians seemed to be just thrown in as after thoughts. The supporting characters barely supported and the main characters were, well, boring. I usually read Ms. Coulters books in a matter of a day or two.

I found the characters thinly drawn and the dialogue so artificial that at times I felt as though I were watching auditions for a high school play. The period characters' fascination with erotic discipline was contrived to the point of a farce, but it did make for some giggles. In fact, at times I thought the author might be doing just that - teasing us with an absurd comedy. I've heard that Ms. Coulter's other books are excellent, and the story line did capture my imagination (even though the characters got in the way at times!), so I will give her another try in the future. However, this one will go into my give-away bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Coulter standards!","review":"For a long-standing Coulter fan, I found this to be a disappointment. The plot dragged, and the characters were too much like previous heros and heroines from her other books.

I felt Ms. Coulter was bored with the manuscript and the period. She has certainly shown her amazing talents in her latest contemporary novels, but those abilities are not showcased in this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Catherine Coulter's books have been on the decline for the past few years. They used to be wonderful, witty, and fun. Now, the story lines are slow and silly, the sex scenes uninspired (does everyone single one of her male characters have the same \\"problem\\"?) and the conversations strange (odd half thoughts inserted in a lame attempt at humor end up just being confusing). I had hopes that this book would be a return to her earlier style and for the first 3 pages, it was. It quickly went downhill, however. I couldn't even finish it. Please get a new editor, Miss Coulter, your's isn't doing her job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you do it?","review":"I have been reading your books, for about as long as you have been writting them. I loved how you brought old books back and added the new with them. You found the fear in loving someone diffrent and made it a possitive ending. You combined mystery with the passion of old. History is a very important part of our lives, and so much of it I find in reading your books. It's also refreshing to see how you combind the love of God, with the love of each other. Please keep writting and I will continue reading each one. You are a wonderful entertainer, and I thank you for taking us with you on your journeys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"This book was horrible. The author added a plot that simply dragged on and on and on and didn't particularly focus on the relationship/romance between the hero and heroine. It's a very bad representation of CC's work, don't waste your time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I have read every book by Coulter. I thought they couldn't get any worse than Mad Jack, but I was wrong. I have been trying to read this book for 2 weeks, and I finally made it to page 73 before I gave up. It rambles on and on with no sense of purpose. I definitely will read reviews before I buy another Coulter book. I was very disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Courtship","review":"I have been reading Catherine Coulter for 15 years and have always at least liked her stories but I threw this one in the trash can when I finished it because it's not even worth storing in a box in the attic! The dialogue was stilted and unbelievable. The story line was only slightly better. I was put off by the hero's constant referral to the heroine as his \\"big girl\\". I think someone else wrote this and put Coulter's name on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Having read all of the previous efforts, I found the plot weak, the characters uninteresting, and the effort not worth the price.The story line was boring, this book is a renter, not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this even get published?","review":"This is awful. I've never read another book by this author and after this I never will. The characters were annoying and way too modern, the dialogue was obnoxious, the plot was barely there and it took forever to begin. Oh and for some reason Lord Beecham kept referring the the heroine as the \\"big girl\\" which not only sounds unattractive but gets really annoying, really fast. Save your time and money and avoid this book like the plague!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn movie?","review":"Reading this book is like watching a porn movie: all sex and no plotline.Another thing I found unbelievable is that Helen took back her maiden name and became a \\"Miss\\" again. From what I know of the period, women loved to be a widow because that status granted them more freedom. Coulter could not come up with a good explanation why Helen would take back her maiden name after her first husband died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing is the only word that fits","review":"I've read and liked Catherine Coulter's novels in the past, so when I saw this at the library, I picked it up eagerly. Wow, was I disappointed! The sex was ridiculous to the point of annoying, and the whole attitude of the characters was very...\\"modern.\\" I don't think this should be categorized as an historical novel, and certainly not as a romance. The only reason I finished the book was the lamp plotline, and that was also a letdown. The dialogue seemed unlikely, the narrative careless. While I don't expect or even want romances to always be realistic, this was just not enjoyable me as a regency lover and a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Courtship","review":"There is always a first for everything. I have always enjoyed Ms. Coulter's books but this book was a sleeper. The characters were flat and I didn't care whether they found love or not. The discipline sideline was laughable and completely boring. The whole treasure plot was downplayed and that is what we have come to expect from this series of books. Please put the romance back into your books and characters that you can care about too. Give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad waste of trees","review":"I found this book not up to Coutlers usual standards. I am an avid fan of her books and have read many of them and enjoyed them all, but this one. I found it uninteresting and one dimensional. The plot was non-existent. I must say I was very disapointed. I thought it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accidental Delight","review":"Simple Stories was an accidental gift that I received several years ago.

It's an overly simplified explanation of library research that doesn't offer much by way of useful information, giving just enough information to make a researcher dangerous but not enough to make him good. Tensen tries to explain things, but ultimately, it's clear she's not a librarian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dj Power Strip","review":"This is just what I needed for when I dj, been looking for this for a couple years.

I have two of these and love them on my music gear. One is in my home studio and is used for all my amps as a convenient way to power them with some protection. The extra long cord is an excellent feature. I have a second one that always goes with me to gigs as a nice long extension cord with protected outlets.

It is great for what it is built for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made","review":"I haven't seen this attempt to surpress a surge yet, but as multi-outlet strips go, it's refreshing to see something with all-metal construction and a long cord.Appears to be a step above nearly all multi-outlet strip options and provides a decent amount of room for larger plugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job!","review":"This strip is black and so it looks sleak with a DJ setup. Easy to hide. It's metal so it doesn't feel cheap, only bad part is it can get banged up pretty easily. I like the extra extension power cable, it's easy to reach far distances if needed. Hopefully I'll never have to test out the surge protector but Furman seems like a great brand so I have no fear it will protect my gear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best surge protector so far","review":"I have owned several of these and several APC surge strips over the years and the Furman strips have lasted the longest. They are of high quality and the extra long cord is a big plus. Well worth the premium price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Global Garbage","review":"This collection of articles is a poorly edited collection of lesser known writings by academic authors, most of which border on incoherence. The articles contained in this edition reveal that the authors and their editors are sorely out of touch with the dynamics of the pop music industry in their naive view of global trends and styles. The articles are largely unremarkable, labourious to slog through, and filled with useless jargon that renders it neither suitable for academic nor lay readers. Save your money, as this volume is not worth the exhorbitant purchase price. I hate to offer even one star's endorsement of this sad excuse for a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jugger","review":"Richard Stark (aka the late Donald Westlake)hits another bulls-eye in the brilliant Parker series.

This is pure hard-boiled nihilistic noir at its very best!

It's hard to get into any movie that doesn't have a plot. The effects were shoddy, the story was lame and long-paced, not even a 2 minute appearance of Pinhead himself could revive the decrepid storyline. Even though the acting was somewhat acceptable, not even the Nightbreed guy could save this movie. Please, Hollywood, give us one last Hellraiser, fill it with blood and ripping bodies, and end this series on a good note, not some made for video fiasco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time","review":"If you are a true fan of hellraiser you will notice that this is not a hellraiser movie, is just some dumb director tried to use the hellraiser formula but it didnt work, is just a waste of time.

I will never again trust amazon ratings. This movie went no where. The first 3 movies had a good pace and plenty of things happening throughout them. Great stories and wonderfully messed up ideas.That was not to be in this film. Nothing worthwhile happened on until the last 15 minutes. I'm sorry but if I wanna waste an hour and a half for things to pick up I'll watch the Ring. This movie was incredibly dull, and at no point did I care for the characters, and I wished the whole time for that man's death.Watch Hellraiser 1, 2 ,3, 4 and 6 for good hellraiser movies. I wish I could get that time that I lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a reminder...","review":"The entire Hellraiser series is very confusing, unless you see the first one and then the movies that follow in order, this one probably won't make any sense as neither did any of the others until you saw the first, and in this case the other 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot's gone to HELL!","review":"...The effects are brilliant, I liked the occasional 'made-yer-jump' bits, but it does not feel like a 'Hellraiser' film. The direction is well done and made rather trippy and Pinhead became a background-baddie (as in the first film) but the plot loses itself in confusion. The characters are unlikable, and even Doug Bradley didn't put much effort into his much under-exposed role as Pinhead. Perhaps he's had enough, I know I have, this once brilliant saga of films has now become tiresome and empty, I think this could be the final nail in the coffin.

Torture, blood, flesh ripping terror! A step into physical pain at it's most gruesome! Whom do we associate that all with? Pinhead and his sennobites! The monsters from without that know no mercy!What this movie gives us instead is the monster within a human! Pschological horror! Pinhead makes only two on-screen appearances! You can't even feel sorry for the main character because he is a 'bad cop' and really deserves his own self-inflicted hell!This movie proves that, although a few good sequels CAN come out of the first film, it is not always a good idea to suck an idea dry! This movie was an insult to Pinhead and all the sennobites and Hellraiser fans! Learn to leave a good thing alone! Take a page from Buffy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible movie not even directed by the original director","review":"This movie is horrible, the legacy of the whole hellraiser series is left behind int his movie, everytime someone opens the box the cenobites have to be sent back to hell or else they remain on earth, this movie never shows you what happens after the box is opened, instead something stupid happens, and suddenly pinhead is just interested with one person for no reason at all, my advice, whoever directed this movie, you should stop right now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"Hellraiser Inferno is not for fans who just want a lot of Cenobites and blood. Mind you, I enjoyed Hellraiser 2, 3 and yes (shudder) 4. But each movie had its own distinct reason for being a fun flick. Inferno takes us back to the flavor of the original Hellraiser.Yes, the Cenobites do not get a lot of screen time, perhaps less than even the first movie (I did not time it), but that makes their presence all the more effective when they do appear. The new Cenobite designs are cool, and one is reminscent of one of the fan favorites: Chatterer.Any Hellraiser fan who read the Hellraiser comic book series by Marvel (not the Pinhead and/or Harrowers series, the ones that preceeded those) will enjoy this movie since it follows a very similar premise with focus on the people, utilizing the Cenobites as well placed plot devices.The acting is not Oscar caliber, but it is sufficient to move the movie along. Inferno is a fun ride, but it's not for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Bloodline, this one is horribly underated, Its awesome!!","review":"I don't care what anyone says, this was one of the best in the Hellraiser series.

This film is wonderful in my opinion (as compared to the horrible 8th entry called Hellworld). I loved this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"This film is surprisingly good. It's stylish, thoughtful, and quite unpredictable. Certainly a departure from the other Hellraiser films, but without a doubt it's the best made of all the sequels. If you want typical Hellraiser schlock, it may dissapoint. But if you want to see an intelligent and creepy horror film that goes beyond the franchise and even farther beyond the current trend of teen slasher pictures, then this is the film for you. I thought it was terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outer Limits Maybe..","review":"This was totally not in the realm of the previous Hellraiser movies! What little screen time the cenobites got was devoted mostly to a pair of \\"twins\\" that look more like residents of Who-ville than demons. Pinhead only makes a cameo and could have been replaced with Rod Serling [and the story would make a lot more sense]. There was nothing shocking, scary or even the least bit engrossing in the whole movie. The characters talk about the \\"carnage\\" at murder scenes and then we see a blood-spattered body. So? We can see that on the news. That is not carnage. The entire story is better explained by the main character's drug abuse rather than the puzzle box & cenobites.This would have been an okay episode of the Outer Limits or Twilight Zone, but it is not a Hellraiser."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very good movie","review":"i rented this film, and i must say that the plot is really not very good. one would expect that the pinhead would be slashing, and sending his evil henchmen to attack the mortals, but since the first scene the film is just a bore and there is too much of run around. a plot builds to another plot that leads to nowhere from my point of view. this movie was under the new releases, and it had on the box cover mentioning how good it was.this is an important message to all horror film fans \\"if the movie does not make it to your theatre it probably aint worth to see at all\\" hell raiser inferno is all hype. there are no star actors at all. not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to Hellraiser fans!","review":"I'm having a hard time describing the disgust i felt when I was through with this film, not because of the usual gore, but because they totally ruined a perfect series!!!

This movie not only lacked a story line that stayed together, it lacked the \\"charm\\" of the previous Hellraiser movies. Why was Pinhead \\"counsiling\\" this guy? He is to be the pain and torturer not the philisophical metaphoic therapist. I can't believe they called this a Hellraiser movie. Ignores the facts laid out in previous installments and goes off on a ridiculous tangent about nothing.

It was almost as if the director had a super limited budget, and Doug Bradley only had 2 days to be on the set. You barely get to see pinhead! I don't know if anyone else noticed, but in the first Hellraiser pinhead has a cool powerful and deep voice.Over time it seems to get higher and more raspy. I personally liked his voice in the first Hellraiser a lot better than his voice now.All and all this movie is a Hellraiser movie, but it could have been much much better.Parts 1-4 are great, try those out if you haven't seen them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm, Did someone say this is a Hellraiser Movie?","review":"Okay, I've watched this movie twice now, and although I don't think it is bad....I just don't get the feel of this being a Hellraiser movie, I think the positive reviews on this movie are misleading to people who haven't seen it. I'm sorry, when the name is Hellraiser I DO expect to see Pinhead more than just a few minutes. This is NOT a hellraiser movie, nor will it ever be.

It is so bad, I actually wished that someone would put me out of my misery as I was watching it.

Pinhead now puts himself in the place of God and judges people's souls? This movie just straight up sucked. The acting was atrocious, the characters were paper thin, and the 'star' of the movie, \\"Mr. I'm a happily married detective who likes cocaine and prostitutes\\" is just aggravating to watch.

There is no linear form taken in the unraveling of the story, but that's what allows this film to work. The idea of technology taking over man has been a staple of Sci-Fi since Lang's Metropolis (1927), but in Godard's hands it all becomes an odd, cerebral journey. Godard used great locations in Paris that look futuristic, and the absence of special effects only heightens the films unwillingness to be normal. The performces are good, and Anna Karina's face can say or mean just about anything it's so beautiful and mysterious. The cinematography by Coutard is good as always. Alphaville is to Sci-Fi, what A Woman is a Woman (1961) is to the musical; it's Godard's own unique take on a genre, and that's always worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Wave films the movie equivalent of modern art?","review":"Alphaville in this reviewer evokes a reaction similar to looking at certain examples of modern art, a painting by, say Ad Reinhardt. Although I can not argue it is \\"great\\" or even good, for some unexplainable reason I like it. As Picasso once remarked \\" If one tries to \\"understand\\" a painting he is barking up thr wrong tree\\". I am convinced this argument can be made for almost any art form (and perhaps other things as well). And if one likes it, is that not all that matters?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate film for quintessential pseudos","review":"A silly, ugly, pretentious, inept, embarrassing, shallow, dreary film that was dated the day it was made."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG ! Logic is like soooo bad !","review":"This movie is based on the supremely absurd premise that logic and science lead to a society where all emotion is outlawed, people get shot for crying, individuality is outlawed, there are neon signs saying \\"E=MC2\\" everywhere, and everything is decided by computers. This premise is so disgusting and ridiculous that no possible movie could save it, and certainly not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrific waste of time...","review":"Over 100 minutes of the most boring, pretentious, pointless film ever shot. Incomprehensible, muddling dialogue that sounds as if it was dictated by a drunken, homeless bum. Uninteresting, somnolent characters. Atrocious film editing, and a non-existent plot.How DARE someone create a movie like this, and call it art? How DARE the dilletantes who give this pile of steaming cinematic offal five stars defend it?The only film I can compare this to, in terms of utter pointlessness and sheer boredom- is the fifteen minutes of unexposed film that I accidentally fed into a projector back in my junior year of college.The Emporer wears no clothes- and Alphaville needs to be consigned to the scrapheap of cinematic disasters, where it so richly deserves to lie, moldering and forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great after all these years!","review":"Godard made this movie over 30 years ago and it remains fresh. It is timeless, the hallmark of a genuine classic. There are no fancy special effects. Godard used the Paris of the 60s to delineate Alphaville, a metropolis of mechanized people. He blends pulp fiction, film noir, sci-fi, comics, poetry and philosophy and the result is unusual and dazzling. Eddie Constantine is the perfect grizzled private eye and the sublime Anna Karina gives a poignant performance as Natasha Von Braun. Raoul Coutard's cinematography is a milestone in moviemaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the Moon about this movie","review":"A sixties time capsule if ever there was one.

Touchy folk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-fi in the real world.","review":"Godard's \\"Alphaville\\" isn't a sci-fi cartoon, or even afuturistic fantasy: it is a comic-strip meditation ontechnology and man's place in a world which embraces it --the precursor, as it were, to the Unabomber Manifesto, albeitone which doesn't take itself so seriously. Godard's words,indeed, are as bombs in this all-out attack on thedisintegration of emotion, language, and love in the modernage. He is famous as a film director, but his directionwas often casual and hurried; what makes his films moveare the quickness of the ideas and the verbal slapstick ofthe dialogues.

But beware! Chances are you will find this film unwatchably dull. It looks like it was made for about $1000, with actors hired off the street. Special effects include long scenes of people walking thru steam tunnels, and an evil supercomputer consisting of a lamp set behind a slowly turning electric fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"One the century's ten worst movies!","review":"I do not understand why all those other reviews are so positive about this movie, because it has to be the most boring movie I have ever seen. It is slow, the story does not make any sense whatsoever, and contains countless conversations about the meaning of life. Just Plain Stupid. This would only appeal to Hardcore French movies lovers, i.e. 1% of the population at best (I happen to be French, by the way). If you enjoy US Sci-Fi movies, then do not watch this because it is so different that you will probably stop watching after 10 minutes. I almost did, and afterwards I wish I had.

And then he meets a pretty girl but she just kind of walks around in the movie really bored until Mister Lemmy says, \\"Lemme introduce you to the director. He is French!\\"And then Lemmy talks to a light bulb. A really big light bulb. And the light bulb talks back.Well Lemmy tell you this! One star for the pretty girl.

Just plug it into a DB-9 on your computer and configure the unit via any terminal application like Terra Term, CRT, or Hyperterminal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value; does it's purpose - Cables included!","review":"These items are pretty hard to find. One word of advice is that this product actually already comes with the 25-pin serial to 9-pin serial adapter, so you don't need to buy it! This was not mentioned anywhere in the listing. This product does not come with an Ethernet cable, but they're a dime a dozen. There is also another listing of this product with similar part number, and cheaper, but this one here comes with the universal A/C adapter (the other one is just a US A/C Adapter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific progressive acoustic Jazz","review":"Is it just me, or are women taking over Jazz? Maybe it's about time. Myra Melford is a formidable pianist with interesting ideas. Like a TRUE Jazz player, she understands the tradition without apeing it. She has worked with some greats, including Henry Threadgill, and you can hear his influence on her work. I also hear a fair bit of Cecil Taylor in her playing, but her style is more lyrical and less percussive, and I dare say she has better chops than the old master.I like her as a clever composer and a leader as well as a pianist, and the other players on this eclectic album acquit themselves very well, but it is principally for the beautiful flow of her playing that I listen to it. That said, she does a fine job of balancing improvisation and structure, and that is non trivial (John Zorn does this extremely well, as does Threadgill), and so the ensemble aspects of this album are well worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dart Throw Line","review":"Ordered a bud light and a bud throw line, instead received a bud light and a generic throw line.

I thought I was buying a handy little decorating book to take with me when I shop, but that isn't what I received. This book is an encyclopedia of decorating and furniture terms. That's all it is. There is nothing in here that is helpful to me as I shop for decorating products. If I need a listing of terms, I can go to the dictionary, for heaven's sake. So, this isn't a Pocket Decorating Guide but a Pocket Dictionary. How that is supposed to help me decorate my home, I can't imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"I can see that this book would be a nice little reference for designers or students of design. However, it is obviously aimed at the rest of us who are simply decorating our apartments or homes. For that broader audience of ordinary people, this book is not very helpful. I agree with the reviewer who said this is a dictionary or encyclopedia but not a decorating book. There is no help or advice here. The book is filled with one design term after another with little definitions. Frankly, I don't care about that information and find it worthless, to be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"No color photos, no advice, just an illustrated glossary","review":"I just bought a gorgeous hard-back color book on The New Cottage Home, and I'm in love with it. Great photography, lots of good information. It's dreamy, and I know I'll use it a lot as we plan our new home. It cost a little over $20. On the other hand, with that new home in mind I also bought this Pocket Decorator, and I was so disappointed with it. For about the same money, the Pocket Decorator is small and has only a few no-color illustrations of furniture pieces in it. It's a kind of illustrated glossary of furnishings. How can one publisher afford to give me so much for my money while another one gives me what amounts to a glossary for about the same money?

I bought this myself, and I doubt I'll use it much, if at all. It isn't a very good value. Such a dictionary of terms, as at least one reviewer has put it, would be fine as one chapter of a broader decorating book. But as an entire book it's pretty much a ripoff. To be honest, I can afford to throw $20 away, but that doesn't make me happy that I did it. I really thought I would receive a handy pocket decorating guide versus a glossary!!!!!!!!! I don't blame the other reviewers for expressing anger over this kind of publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pocket Dictionary for Those Who Know Nothing","review":"This book is nothing more than definitions of basic items. I mean basic. The part of the book on ceilings gives short ( a couple sentences) definitions for 4 different types of ceilings - cathedral, tin, tray, and wood-beam. The rest of the book is equally basic. A better title for the book would be \\"A Pocket Dictionary for Those Who Know Nothing about Decorating\\". And don't let the \\"illustrated\\" part mislead you. Only half the items in the book are illustrated. The chapter on fabric has not a single illustration!! Don't let the other positive reviews fool you like they did me."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"I should have read amazon reviews before I bought this. The reviewers are right that this isn't a pocket decorating guide but a rundown of decorator's and designer's terms.

I think so","review":"I have to concur with a reader who questioned whether the authors were writing their own positive reviews. One positive review of this thin little book says refers to his or her often-used, \\"dog-eared\\" copy of the book. The book only came out in mid- to late June of this year -- a few days ago. How could it be well-used and dog-eared already? I picked this up at the book store and put it back after leafing through it. I can get this info from the encyclopedia that's built into my computer.

The Pocket Decorator is a clear reference book of interior design terms, especially helpful for a decorating hack like myself. It shows things like the difference between styles of windows, which if you're renovating or building OR want to impress your home depot guy, is very useful information to have! There are smart design tips here too. For example, wall mounted lamps should be mounted 42 inches off the floor (Who knew?) and it also tells you how much clearance to allow for ceiling light fixtures over a table. (Like I ever would have even thought to think of this?) Because of this book I now have pink light bulbs in my boudoir. What more could a girl ask for? This book rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweeps you into another world","review":"This recording features the wonderfully elemental music of Nikolai Medtner's 2nd and 3rd piano concertos.

The built-in pillow cannot be adjusted, of course, so you end up with a really stiff neck from it being bent upwards. The fabric which the bed bag is made of is very slick so you end up sliding around and almost off the mattress all night. Not only that, it has an unpleasant, clammy feel to it, so it's not too great having it against your bare skin. It makes for a very uncomfortable night and you wake up sore and tired. Just get a regular air bed WITHOUT a built-in pillow (use your own) and put a regular fitted mattress pad and/or sheet on it. You'll be a heck of a lot more comfortable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All in One - overnighter - great for kids!","review":"We have had several of these over the years and think that these are great.

The pillow part is not quite as comfortable as your bed at home, but these are not meant for that. These are great for campouts, sleepovers, extra guests at your house, etc. We have not had any leaking issues or zipper issues. The sleeping bag can easily be removed for washing. If for some reason you do not like the sleeping bag part - remove it and you'll have a regular old areo bed - add your own sheet, blankets and pillow.

Smith or any of the other mass produced Christian/pop music artists. On all of his previous albums, even though he changed his sound slightly, it was still generally very acoustic and Bebo-ish. This album sounds nothing like his previous music. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it all day long.","review":"I love this CD. I have another Bebo Norman CD that I listened to once and never again because it was terrible. But this CD is a joy to listen too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up for Mr. Norman!","review":"This is one of the better CD's in my collection. Congratulations Mr. Norman! I would recommend this CD to anyone! I have enjoyed this CD thoroughly! Give it a listen and you wont regret buying it. You'll be patting yourself on the back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped","review":"I love contemporary christian music, especially praise and worship, but I was a little disappointed in this CD. I've heard Bebo Norman before and like some of his music, but I had only heard one song on this CD. Besides that one song, there was only one other that I liked. It probably just isn't my kind of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Romantic Frolic from Wong Jing","review":"This film has some very strong comedic performances from Carrie Ng, Cheung Kwok Bong, and Roy Cheung among others. Each romantic tale is quirky and funny from the Christy Cheung's superstitiousness about whom she dates to Sandra Ng's metomorphous from lover of women to devoted wife and mother-to-be despite her fight against it. I think this film is one of Wong Jing's better efforts. It has less un-PC aspects to it than many of his other works. For my part, it is the strong performances, wit, and chemistry between the cast members that make this film worth seeing for some escapist fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Family's Travails During the Civil War","review":"MANASSAS, the first volume in James Reasoner's The Civil War Battle Series, introduces us to the Brannons, a farming family from Culpepper, VA. The family consists of the widowed matriarch, Abigail, her five sons, Will, Mac, Cory, Titus, and Henry, and her daughter, Cordelia.MANASSAS is more of a prelude to the War, setting the stage for troubles to come. As county sheriff, Will Brannon, the eldest, has to deal with the trouble-making Fogarty clan. His problems with the Fogartys will follow him into battle at Manassas, as the war begins.The book is fast-paced and well-researched. This is a novel, and, as such, will not necessarily please those historical purists who insist on complete accuracy. However, the story is gripping, and the violence sometimes graphic. For anyone interested in the time period, or the War itself, this is very entertaining reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good fun read. Leaves the reader waiting for more.","review":"Manassas was a fun book to read. Wish there had been a little more focus on the battle of Manassas as the title indicated, but the story leading up to the battle is well written and enjoyable. The characters are fairly vivid and one really gets into their lives. The end of the book is spectacular and made me want to order the next in the series, Shiloh, right away. I am now half way through and find it even better than Manassas, but would not want to read it without having read Manassas first. I am looking forward to the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction","review":"This book is the start of a truly outstanding series. The hard core arm chair history buffs wont care for it because it doesn't pick apart the battle only. Well fine who cares there are to many of those types around as it is get a life!!! This is the on going story of a family during yup you guessed it different Civil War Battles of course remember how close the battles were together, perfect markers for family stories. Thank you Mr. Reasoner for another truly great series. And if you really like these books check out the Wagons West series you may find another series to transport you to another time and for you Arm Chair history buffs that are experts for only 5 year blocks of American history go to the library and read the COR you wont like the Wagons west series"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment !","review":"I had high hopes for this series but Book 1 was pretty much a waste of time and I won't even look at the next. Mr. Reasoner needs to stay with his westerns. Obviuosly he knows little or nothing about Virginia and little about the Civil War. Culpepper didn't have several \\"saloons\\" in the 1860's, maybe a tavern or two, there weren't gun fights between the sheriff and bad guys, Confederate flags didn't appear the first day Culpepper heard about the war, abolishinist gangs didn't attack or threaten Southern rallys in Richmond, etc. He also needs an editor to correct the story lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted to dance","review":"I was given this book about 3 years ago by my Grandfather. I was searching for it to try and buy it as a gift and found that no review had been written. A book this good needs 5 stars. My husband and I met dancing so it was very appropriate. It is tender yet also very happy. It also ends with a very good moral about dancing, singing and laughing. The watercolors are beautful and I enjoy the unique size of the book. A must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not very helpful.","review":"One good thing about the book: it doesn't take long to get through it. Out of 125 pages, only 25 contain helpful content. The rest consists of 2 practice tests and answers. There all also very generous margins and wide spacing. Overall, there just isn't a lot of book here. During those 25 pages, the author explains the solutions to the \\"before\\" test, which does make it likely that you'll do better on the \\"after\\" test. I was hoping for generalized rules and strategies that would show one how to attack the sort of problems that crop up in an IQ test. There were some, but not as many as I had hoped. Also, I don't know how representative these questions were. Overall, I found the book somewhat helpful, but disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a helpful aid","review":"This was helpful in that it describes some of the strategies used by test preparers to invent questions. For instance, in the 'how are these words alike' type questions, I always thought about MEANINGS of words, like the SAT-type thinker I am. But there are other ways the word problems are designed - for instance, simply by the length of the word, or the position of the vowels. Those sorts of analogies never even occurred to me to think about. Worth its reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pessimistic","review":"This book thinks that I have an I.Q. of a 120 and that I may improve it to a level of 132. I probably better not believe what the book thinks because I usually fall flat on my face in an embarrassing place when I believe something or someone who tells me something like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great....But something's missing","review":"Well, well, let me see, hmm. It was a good book in that it increased my IQ by about 15 points. And I advice anybody that is about to take an IQ test in school, to read this book before taking. As the person who commented above, lots of space are not used, and much of the book were tests, rather than techniques taught. I also have another problem with this book. The author emphasizes how unbiased he liked his tests to be. But it seemed as though his vocab section was kinda culture-bias. Most of my errors were in the vocab section, and this resulted in the decreasing of my IQ score by about a 15 pt difference from my IQ results in school. Thus, in total, the book didn't increase my IQ. However, it was fun while doing it! Anybody who's anybody should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing?","review":"I had trouble understanding this book. I'm not sure exactly what was going on. What was real and what was imaginary. I'm not sure what the author was trying to say either. I felt like I was missing the message but I'd have trouble reading it again. The plot (?) started well and the story kept me interested simply by the fact that I was hoping I would figure out what was going on. The ending still left me confused and wondering."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I started reading Jonathan Lethem with _As She Climbed Across the Table_ which I thought was funny, sharp, tho small . I've sense read ALL Jonathan Lethem books in hopes to finding an equal or better book. I found nothing but acid trip/opiate dream garbage/drivel. All overly detailed and quite boring, lacking in story. Stupid stuff. The only book of Jonathan Lethems I'd recommend is _As She Climbed Across the Table."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH???","review":"This book IS going to have a sequel, right? Right??? It makes absolutely no sense otherwise!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, incomplete, with racist undertones","review":"This story is really ridiculous. Not only is Chaos not interesting and completely shallow as a character, but the actual story is a big snooze fest. Letham hints at a lot of interesting ideas, but never really pulls through with anything. I didn't find Chaos believeable at all. Come on, how many times will he beat around the bush about asking questions about his life? He is like a meek little sheep you takes no control over his actions... until the unexciting end. Finally I find it strange that the author mentions the ethnicity of every non-white character. The young and black Vance, the black women, the Mexican. He never says, the white Gwen or the white Cal. This is an example of subtle racism as far as I am concerned. As if Lethams readers should just expect all the characters to be white.This book stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"readable, not fulfilling","review":"I would have put this book down early into it if I had known how poorly it concluded. Forgive my need for closure, but I think its almost universally appreciated. The denouement wasn't the only aspect lacking; the writing was sub-par. Granted, the characters were interesting, and some of the ideas were original, but not everything original is worth putting to paper. Lethem lacked flow. This novel was selected for what looked to be promising escapism literature, a world that I could be sucked into to forget my own for a little while. However, it wasn't much of a world, and was difficult to hold onto. Other reviewers have praised the dream-like structure of it, claiming that its lack of flow was in keeping with the characters' fragmented dream-like state. Less than dream-like, it was more like a poor night's sleep. I rarely give poor reviews, but I just want others to be forwarned. If your time is valuable, then spend it looking for a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ultimately unsatisfying","review":"When I started reading this book, it seemed really interesting to me. I thought the ideas that were being dimly outlined were intriguing, and I wanted to delve into them. Unfortunately, the longer I read this book, the more frustrating it became.The actions of the main charcter, Everett Chaos Moon, were nonsensical at best. He is perpetually confused, but barely manages to ever muster up any interest in really figuring things out. He comes off as a someone who doesn't make sense, because on the one hand he's trying to understand himself and the world, and on the other hand he's never making any effort to do just that. He just kinda floats along in the incoherent world pointlessly.By the end of the book, I was disgusted and irritated with the whole thing, and I felt like the ending gave me absolutely nothing for me efforts. This is the only Lethem book I've read, and it seriously discourages me from wanting to read any others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, but VERY loose ends...sigh.","review":"It is a shame really. I picked up this book for a single dollar at a discount bookstore, and although I thought that the read was quick, interesting, and sucked you into the lives of the characters, I really would *not* recommend this book to anyone. The book, hardcover, is a stunted 247 pages. What it needed was an ENDING. I was in the last 50 pages wondering, like I usually do, \\"Okay...here's where it all comes together...where he/she/it/they do such-and-such to cure the ills of the world, or at least to escape.\\" But no such escape is possible, for the ending not only left EVERY character hanging on by some macabre silken string from a tapestry poorly woven, but also never really concluded. It was like Lethem fell asleep, and never bothered to write the last chapter. Well, I fell asleep, too. Sorry, Jonathan, but no more reading your work for me until you wake up."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment after \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\"","review":"Lethem had me in stitches with \\"Motherless Brooklyn.\\" After reading this, I found I had two more Lethem on the basement bookshelves. Chose to read \\"Amnesia Moon\\" next. Quite a disappointment! While I do get into sci-fi, this was a major let- down. The characters were not interesting to me, the situation was not novel, and I found myself drifting off to the other book I was reading (tending to put off this one). I'm going to give him one more chance \\"As She Climbed Across the Table\\" hoping that he redeems himself. I want to like him. Maybe then I can buy \\"Gun with Occasional Music.\\" I am a novice at sci-fi (Neil Gaiman is my hero) so maybe I am not a trustworthy reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing and bizarre read...","review":"This is my favorite Letham novel, and one of my favorite books. His imagination perplexes and amazes me. This man is truly creative, and his amorphous take on the apocalypse is a fine example of his work. you may want to read it twice, once just to enjoy the scenery, and a second time to pay attention to the point (which is delivered surprisingly clearly given the context)."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 short stories loosely knit together","review":"This is little more than 3 loosely associated stories cobbled together with an unreasonably unexplained set of circumstances and a hasty bad ending with too many unanswered questions.Hope the author isn't banking on selling the movie rights....Pass on this one - wouldn't waste my time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Lethem's book is an odyssey of discovery in an America gone wierd.Chaos is on a quest for the truth, but truth exists only in the subjective reality he creates.

This is basically the same thing, but a poor copy. It is about a boy, or in this care two boys and a girl, turning into fish. The rest of the story is about how they try to get the potion back from the evil fish so they can turn back to humans. All before the potion makes the evil fish more human and more evil. This movie has a weak story, jumps all over the place, is filled with sterotypical charaeters and horrible songs.

It is not horrible, I did actually finish the whole book. But in my opinion, it is just not written very well. When I am reading a really good book, I get wrapped up in the story, the characters come to life. When I read this book, I noticed every painstakingly pointless description of what characters looked like and what they were wearing, and how sexy they looked in whatever they had on. Yes, I know that character description is important, but it should be seamlessly written into the story - I shouldn't cringe while I am reading it. It was awkward writing - just not very good.

The three main characters are strong, but do not over power each other, ensuring a cohesive unit.

This device, if a bit cerebral, could in itself be touching but in this case it left me cold.I wanted to feel for the main hero, his lost lover being another man should have helped me identifying, but I simply could not.It seems to me that Ms Lynn was absent minded while writing this story: while retaining her usual skill she was not and could not move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch Order!!!!

Unfortunately, just as others have noted, you may need some luck on your side to get these to arrive without being in pieces. The 4 bulbs get packaged in a carton and along the way, it is likely they smash into each other. I ordered 3 boxes and two of them were completely smashed on arrival. I had also ordered the 60 watt variant, but the packaging on those is the vacuum plastic type and those survived without problems. I would think twice about ordering these with the sole reason that they will likely arrive destroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy them at a store","review":"I have no problem with the bulbs, but they were shipped loose in a box with some Fill-Air on top. Needless to say, many of them showed up in pieces. Broken glass was falling out of the boxes as I picked them up. Not good. I assumed they would be in clam shell packaging like the ones you would buy at Home Depot or Lowes, but that's not the case. It'd be easier to just go to Home Depot or Lowes and pick them up.

I've had it for about a month and the paint's already chipping off. The device is longer and thinner than normal pendrives, so I always feel like it might snap in half or something at the slightest provocation.

Without asking first, he invites this young man to stay with him at his niece's home much to her disapproval. She feels this person is below her standards and can't wait for him to leave.

I am still learning the ropes with Photoshop, and appreciated that Wacom included the more \\"consumer-friendly\\" version of Corel Painter.I haven't quite mastered reconcilling the 4 X 6 inch screen with the real estate of my monitors, and am wondering if there is some way to establish the boundaries of the tablet to synch up?Overall, I think I purchased the right product to take my artwork to that \\"serious amateur\\" level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!...mostly.","review":"I have long desired a graphics tablet, I finally sprang for this one.

It never skipped a beat in recognizing my dual monitor set up, and even functions with my GIMP (open source image editing program). I half expected it to only work with the more \\"uptown\\" programs like Photoshop.Impressive indeed.The one drawback, and it's not too big of a deal, is that I cannot use my Optical Mouse (which I MUCH prefer to the one included with the tablet) at the same time. It causes web pages to have something akin to a seizure.

In the process of my troubleshooting, I found numberous complaints from Win 7, 64-bit users about the drivers crashing or disappearing.

There was a little of that, but overall this was a disappointing book because of its strong bias toward the defense's theory of the case. Taubman apparently bought into the idea that the venom-spewing woman on the stand was \\"emotionally abused\\" by her ex-husband and his new wife to an extent that made murder expected and understandable.

Whenever I have needed to design simple samples, I consulted the book finding it very useful to refresh my memory about the subject. Recently, after I must have lent the book to somebody I do not remember, I needed to consult it and I felt I could not accept not having it at hand, thus I bought it again!

I had been a fan of Mano Negra since the early 90s because their incredible mixture of French and Spanish music. After they split up I was quite curious to see what Mano Chao would do. My first impression was not the best, I thought the album was very strange and in some way repeating itself without having fast rock songs like the Mano had. But then I noticed that I was playing the CD again and again even singing the lyrics at work: this record is like hypnotizing you, the mixture of latin sounds is terrific and also the melancolic texts of Manu are full of meanings. My favorites: Desaparecido, Mentira and La despedida."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravissimo","review":"After being the lead singer of the Mano Negra, Manu Chao decides to go solo and to travel around the world. From his trip to Latin America, Manu brought back a beautiful album that mixes flavours from Mexico, Brazil, and the Revolution. With thoughtful and poetic lyrics, sung in no less than 4 languages, and beautiful music, Manu Chao gave us an amazing gift. So far, I have not met anyone yet that did not totally love it. And by the way, this album has already been a hit in France for the last year or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums of all time.","review":"This is quite simply one of the best albums of all time. I have never met anyone who does not love this album. It is perfectly suited for every possible use. Party, car or home, it fits perfectly. It is so great that it has made me study Spanish so that I can understand it better. Simply a must-buy. The fact that it came out in 1998 and is still second-place on the French rock list says something of its quality. But do not buy it expecting to be immediately blown away by it. No, it is an album that grows on every listen. Every song is a classic. It is just absoloutley, stunningly, superbly, genuinely great. Just buy it now. You will not be disappointed. Guaranteed."},{"rating":"2","title":"green card for clandestino","review":"Manu Chau put together a superb album with a series of epic sentences linked up brilliantly within an obsessive and enchanting rhythm that goes through the whole work following few basic notes. From' Clandestino' to 'Desaparecido' he mixes the latin joy of life with the themes of sadness and uncertainty of the race discriminated. Caustic and realistic he shows that everybody can take his chance in this world, may be just as a little 'king of bongo bong' and can stand up proudly for his own dignity in the melting pot society that it's ruled by institutions and corporations. This album it's somehow hypnotic and, even if words and lyrics are often repeting themselves, you can listen to it endlessly, enjoying all the fun and the music. But there's something more below the surface.

Hope to hear more great stuff from Manu!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest and arresting global view of music.","review":"World music takes on a whole new -- and truer -- meaning in Manu Chao's first solo record, \\"Clandestino.\\" In this highly inventive and adventurous recording, the singer-songwriter presents his musical and social interpretations of visits to Latin America, Spain and Africa with cleverly crafted sounds and politically relevant lyrics. Chao, formerly of the Spanish-Franco punk-rock band Mano Negra, places the 16 Spanish-English-French-language tracks into a single articulate current. His compositions, which he wrote and recorded on the spot during a global trek, speak to the universal themes of cultural isolation, unwanted immigration and social dissonance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"That's al you can say about this CD, the first LP from the leader of Mano Negra is one of the best ever latin music LP's. Songs full of catchy beats, sense of humour and concerned llyrics, a beautiful mix of music styles and languages (there are songs in English, Spanish and French)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Amazing.","review":"I tell anyone who will listen that this is the best CD of the past three years. When I first heard it, its mixture of world-weariness and hope; of melancholy and frivolity; of chaos and serenity; of anxiety and defiance; of darkness and light - it sounded like all the world talking at once; it sounded like the distillation of humanity at the end of the twentieth century, and its motifs of the clandestine and the disappeared applied everywhere.It's like watching a Fellini movie; it's like looking at The Garden of Earthly Delights; it's like What's Going On gone global; it's like Odelay with a conscience; it's like Highway 61 and The Sagrada Familia and a tornadic short-wave train around the world. It wicks away moisture. It will not harm your pipes. Its colors linger on the palate."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Lyrics","review":"Manu Chao's music is truly enjoyable because it has great Latin American rythms and sounds. Nevertheless, the lyrics may confuse those who are not familiar with the Mexican political landscape. The EZLN is not a political party, but rather a group of armed anarchists who wish to produce economical and political instability in the region by appealing to noble causes. An example of this is how the Subcomandante Marcos viewed the strikers at the National University (UNAM) as having \\"legitimate demands\\", when in reality they were asking for the lowering of academic standards and were a minority group rejected by the academic community. Having this in mind, we can continue enjoying the rythm of Manu Chao's music. Excellent album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly politically interesting, but extremely dull musically","review":"I read all the glowing reviews of this album, and all I can say is that it must be the case that you have to speak Spanish to enjoy it. Judging by the merits of the music itself, there is not a single song on the entire CD that ventures outside of an elementary and predictable 3 chord progression - 1-4-5-1 (or for the minor songs, which almost all of them are, - 1-6-7-1). It's as if the composer had a single musical idea and used it to beat his listeners to death. Even the somewhat unusual instrumentation become maddening after hearing it for 16 songs in a row.I can understand how someone might enjoy the overall style and rhythm, but that by itself doesn't make it high quality. In my opinion, if this weren't considered \\"World Music\\", it wouldn't have achieved anything near the apparent success it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it a joke?","review":"I have bought the cd Proxima Estación: Esperanza: I like a lot.So since it is Christmas and my brother in law wanted give me a present I asked a cd from Manu Chao.I got Clandestino and what was my disappointment when I realize that in the cd there are 3, I say, three songs for a total of 7:33 minutes!!! For my understanding there would be more than 3 songs.Where are they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"(NOT ONLY)MUSIC FROM THE SOUL","review":"Hola!\\"Clandestino\\"is not only a music cd.It is a theory or a philosophy about life.I think that Manu Chao is one of the better singers and song writters ever.From the past(when he was at Mano Negra)he had wrote very beautiful songs with meanings of life.

Friendly,Nikos."},{"rating":"2","title":"The CD for Travellers","review":"I was working in Shanghai, China, when I heard Clandestino for the first time courtesy of a friend who'd discovered Manu Chao while backpacking through South America. Shanghai was blisteringly hot and the local police were giving me trouble, but with Clandestino playing I could easily transcend the everyday hassles of life in China and imagine a place where everyone is full of smiles and ready to dance.

It's definitely an experience, a compilation of melodies and flavors from different countries. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Breath of Fresh Air!","review":"In these times of over-processed, soulless pop music, Manu Chao's Clandestino has given me hope. A friend brought the CD back from a recent trip to France, and it quickly replaced the schlock that the radio stations spout between commercials. Forget the Song of Summer, this was my Album of Summer. The album is much like the paradox-filled world that Manu Chao sings of - fun, yet serious; seemingly simple, yet deceivingly complex. Almost every song fades or builds into the next, providing a virtually seamless body of work.

If you were like me staying up a good part of the night to solve the puzzles, you were totally drawn into the nightmare experience with the addition of Fatman's music for the game. Even after I had finished playing for the night, I could still hear the main theme song for 11th hour in my head as I lay in bed alone in a dark room. I give huge props for The Fatman composing and creating this music that I love to hear so much, it pretty much compelled me to buy the cd. It is sad that Trilobyte went down the dumps and never released or started a 7th Guest III. I am sure that The Fatman would have been close by to spice up the game with his orginal music.

More a love than an espionage story, it attempts to emulate the intricate world of disinformation but misses out. The plot is confused but my main gripe is the constant music in the background which changes with every scene - and they change often. To begin with I thought the constant 'music' (reminiscent of what might come across in an elevator) would go away as the introduction developed into the plot, which I could not follow as the background noises were so distracting. I reckoniIf you want to have a deep spy plot at least give the viewer the chance to follow it!So this is a confused product: it wants to appeal to the average viewer who does not want to think too much about what is going on, and the viewer who wants something more.

If you enjoyed the simple beauty of Cristofori's Dream, Heartsounds, Nightfall and Return to the Heart, this new CD by Lanz is a disappointment. Lanz's once intimate, sparkling and introspective piano is now lost to the pop and orchestral themes he has pursued on this release. The drums and rhythm section add to the misery of this album, failing to bring life to what are mostly unexciting piano pieces. Save your money, and instead check out \\"From the Heart\\" - the last great release from this new age pioneer."},{"rating":"2","title":"East of the Moon","review":"He has done it again, better than Skyline Fire Dance which was my favorite previous to the release of this work.

The narrator is a clever, curious, observant Scottish girl, about 9 years old, who describes life on her family's WWI-era farm in odd but poetic language that I found fresh and amusing. The main plot centers around the Miss Boyds, six \\"old maids\\" who settle into the nearby village and create havoc with their loud, indiscreet ways. It's not really a book for children--it's not a Scottish \\"Little House on the Prairie.\\" The plot takes a few twists that, while not extremely graphic, are a bit more young adult. This is the first in a fairly extensive series of \\"My Friends\\" books, and I think it is well worth searching out if you are interested in something a little offbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Story","review":"I recently read this book.

I doubt that any Zen story's opening line should be translated as \\"Once upon a time there was a...\\". I also very much doubt that a Japanese woman would insult an old man like this, \\"What do you know, baldy?\\". However, it does not seem as though this is just an attempt to make the stories understandable to a Western sensibility.

Buyer beware! I bought this rather expensive book thinking this would be a great resource for review before I take graduate school placement exams ... wrong!! The accompanying CD has examples played on a synthesizer, and they DO NOT follow the progression of the book as one would seem logical. The CD includes ONE set, or \\"transcription\\" for each unit, and does not have ANY of the examples from the book recorded onto it AT ALL. In addition, these transcriptions seems to be mainly of a synthesizer or of a guitar (and synthesizer). This is not really suited for serious college music students, at least (I am guessing) without the teacher edition.

He uses the idea of the \\"Final Girl,\\" the last person left who confronts and overcomes the killer, to combat the charge of misogyny frequently leveled against slasher films.Whitehead also admits that a lot of slasher films are junk. Some of the films he covers, like Nightmare on Elm Street, aren't really slashers (at least in my view).

And it's not that interesting a drive.When not scooping the Loop, Paretsky takes the reader down a tortured and twisted Nazi Germany survivor side plot that isn't very diverting and comes into 21st Century America in a very confusing fashion. But through it we learn more about V.I's physician friend Lottie.Still, learning about Lottie at this late date is too high a price to pay when she becomes the only character in the decades-old series with any depth.And if Sara Paretsky continues to introduce parallel plots, she'd do well to make sure that she gives V.I. as much of a life as she gives history a voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This story was by no means a mystery .

The connections are at best coincidental, and the first teo stories are unconvincing and frequently dull. I did, however, really enjoy the third story (which makes up about 20% of the book) and found it very touching.One other thing. I didn't read the book but listened to the audio tape.

I like characters who seem to be so unreal, but so close to people you really know. Nothing suprising in this book at all. And the book just fizzles at the end when the killer and motive are revealed. Even more unvbelievable is how VI gets \\"even\\" with at least some of thos evil entities listed above. If you like to read about the plight of the poor and how evil the world is, be my guest and get this book, everyone needs to make a buck, even Sara. If you like real mysteries, skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Women Rock","review":"Sara Paretsky has once again written another good book. I always look forward to V.I.'s escapades. I've always been interested in the Holocaust and Paretsky portrayed a very personnel aspect of it. Warshawski is the tough/lovable woman detective that all of us would like to be like. She's savvy and resourceful and vunerable at the same time. I keep waiting for another movie to come out. Kathleen Turner is a wee bit too old to play V.I., but I'm sure there is someone out there who could fill her shoes. As long as it's not Uma Thurman or Angelie Jolie. Soooooo ugly, both of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is Terrible!","review":"My first and last book by this author. The writing is horrible; the dialogue is simply awful. The plot is just stupid and the character development is unbelievable. The detective commits so many crimes herself in this story that in real life she would be charged, tried and convicted in about 10 minutes (but this author would stretch it out to 100 pages). If you want real writing, look to Stuart Woods or Michael Connelly. Don't look here, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"A muddled read","review":"I plowed through this latest VI Warshawski book. It was hard concentrating on the story itself when I kept trying to figure out how Paretsky tied all the threads together in the first place. Lotty is brusque as usual, but this time she is also just plain miserable. Carl is miserable, Don is miserable, Calia is miserable - in fact everyone in this latest disaster is miserable. The only goodness comes from VI and Morrell, but it's not a \\"good\\" goodness. VI has changed. No more fighting, fuming, or chasing. The down-on-her-luck, tough as hell VI seems to have disappeared and has been replaced with this gentle soul who has found true love. BLAH! Couple this with the fact that we're treated to Paretsky's (and I guess VI's) political views on the Holocaust, slave reparations, and even the Taliban. I liked VI so much more before I found out she was a liberal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I am not me, den who da hell am I?","review":"If I could give this book no stars, I would.

It's a statue. Let's just start calling it what it is. It's only good for a single pose on its partial diorama and has no articulation at all.For all their skill at sculpting - which is considerable - the engineers employed by McFarlane should explore how to marry that talent with the option of creating a figure that can actually be POSED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Not much more can be said from the already stellar reviews.

Her promoters say she's a genius and some people need repeated listenings to \\"get\\" her. I have listened to this record at least a dozen times. She can't write a melody. Her playing has no groove. The pieces have no dynamics - no tension, no breath, no lyricism, and worst of all, no emotion. Her guitar sounds like a cheap, brittle, dime store guitar.You could program a robot to write and play guitar music better than this.I didn't even bother trying to resell this CD. I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"aquired taste","review":"with many great artists, their work isn't appreciated upon first listen. so when i first saw kaki king play on conan o brien, i wasn't sure what to think. the unique finger style to her slightly jazz tinged folk instrumental certainly kept me fron changing the channel, but did i want to buy the album? would i go see her live? i decided i didn't like it that night, but the next day, i kept thinking about it. so i (don't tell the riaa!) downloaded a few of her songs and decided i did indeed love it. the next day i went out and bought everyone loves you and i'm proud to say it's still in the changer, brightening my morning each day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Metheny? Bensusan? Hedges? Kottke? Don't be absurd!!!!","review":"I'm not trusting these reviews anymore! It was hard to stomach this CD even once, but after giving it a few more tries, there is no doubt in my mind that this album is devoid of any musicality. I defy any of these reviewers comparing her to Pat Metheny and Pierre Bensusan to hum or sing back a single melody from Kaki's CD! \\"Good\\" guitar playing is making \\"good\\" music, otherwise, what's the point? And no, Mark in the Middle, I'm not a jilted boyfriend or annoyed by a review I never read, this album just gives acoustic guitar soloists a bad name! The latest solo albums by Pierre Bensusan, Alex De Grassi, Pat Metheny are absolutely amazing! Kaki's music, quite frankly isn't really music at all --- it's just noodling around on the fretboard mindlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"music that spoils the whole day","review":"I found this CD to be worthless. Kaki King's guitar playing is amateurish. It's sloppy. It displays all the skill of my 3 year old's finger paintings.The songs just wander aimlessly, go nowhere, and say nothing along the way. As a listener, they leave me exasperated. Usually musicians have to try really hard to create music that makes me angry - but Kaki King has done a great job of making a CD that irritates me to no end.And then I read reviews that compare her to everyone from Stravinski to Segovia, from Hendrix to Hedges to Satriani, and I wonder if these people have lost their minds! Segovia? This CD is the work of a third-rate remedial amateur.If you're looking for proof of the decline of civilization, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't See What The Big Attraction Is","review":"Kaki King isn't that great. People have been praising her and praising her. She just isn't anything to write home about. She isn't even in the same leagues as Adrian Legg, Michael Hedges, or Leo Keottke and frankly never will, because here songwriting is lousy. Hey, I know she's young, but that's just an excuse. If she wants to continue to make music, then she music realize the importance of melody, harmony, and rhythm, because without it she's got nothing. She's just another Preston Reed or some other wannabe who can't play the guitar. She needs to take some pointers from other acoustic guitarists like Adrian Legg, who not has an unbelievable technique, but also is a fantastic songwriter. In other words, he is something that she is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing guitarist!","review":"If you love unique sounds and intricate acoustic arrangements - - this CD is for you! Kaki King is amazing and her music is nothing short of amazing itself. The style is like none other - a mix of blues/jazz/folk/classical and is a delight to the ear. If you are a fan of Tim Reynolds, then you will absolutely love Kaki King as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK, but give me a break","review":"Obviously no one in these reviews has ever heard of Preston Reed. Kaki sure has as most of her music is a straight \\"lift\\". I do like her song Carmine Street as that sounds original. Please listen to the true master of tapping and the \\"over the top\\" technique , Prston Reed, before you crown her queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lump of coal in my Christmas sock","review":"Reecived this as a gift on Christmas. Never heard of Kaki King before.Can't make any sense at all out of this sound (can't even bring myself to call it \\"music\\"). It's just a lot of aimless, unfocused, and shapeless sound. Sometimes she gets a rhythm going, but then she loses it, and the entire piece falls apart. This happens in several tracks.There is not a single melody anywhere on this CD. How can anyone record an entire CD with a complete absence of melody? What is the point of that?It's like writing a novel with a lot of loose words and phrases, but nary a complete sentence. Just lots of words, but no story, no characters, no plot. It's pointless.This CD is pointless.There are so many truly fantastic acoustic guitarists out there. This poor girl is no match for any of them. I much prefer Muriel Anderson to Kaki King.This is a very weak effort. This music should never have been released. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bed-fast shipping","review":"We bought the dog bed on Friday morning and received it on Saturday. Talk about fast shipping!

I expected to get a comprehensive, well-organized book. This 189-page book does not fit that description. It does contain a compilation of games, drills and tips, but often they don't list a purpose or objective. I was left wondering why or when I would want to do them. Also, much of the information is not new, gathered from such sources as Tennis Magazine and Tennis World.The book appears to have been hastily written. It looks more like a first draft than a finished book. It is filled with typographical, grammatical and punctuation errors that were very distracting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we read the same book?","review":"First of all, the book is filled with TYPOS! I can't believe any publisher or editor would let this book hit the stands in the first place. Most of the drills require more than two players (often difficult to come by) and it is geared much more towards the tennis coach than the every day player. I would only recommend this book if you don't mind typos and are coaching fairly large groups. There are a couple of decent drills."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very poorly edited and difficult to use","review":"I found this book to be very unprofessionally edited.

I agree with one of the previous reviewers that were I to begin with a \\"Flashman\\" book, I would not begin with this one.

Lucky Duck!","review":"The Flashman series is one of the unalloyed treasures of reading: hysterically funny, immensely informative, unfailingly entertaining, and even, at times, moving. These adventures of the 19th Century's greatest poltroon never fail to amuse-- and I've read them all many times. This new volume is a treat (though not in my top 6), and deserves your attention.THAT SAID: don't start here. If you haven't read, at the very least, the first volume (\\"Flashman\\"), you'll be doing yourself a disservice. These should be read, and savored, either chronologically (in terms of Flashy's life and crimes) or in order of publication, as you prefer. Your appreciation of the character will be enriched by the proper introduction, and you'll get more out of this and all the others. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another rousing episode episode of the Flashman Papers","review":"What can I say except that Flashman delivers again. This story has all the characteristics which we have come to expect from the series - a distant and exotic locale, a mad emperor, Englishmen in distress and a gallant British army to the rescue and of course Flashman. A Flashman who has matured, who is wiser and more assured than his youthful self, but who at heart remains the same lecherous coward, bully and all round rogue.But what really make the Flashman series special is that the events described - the British Army's Expedition to Abyssinia to free a group of hostages from the clutches of the Mad Emperor Theodore -actually occurred and have been rigorously researched by the author. So read this tale and you will learn about a fascinating but largely forgotten event in Victorian history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashman on the March","review":"After a couple of disappointing outings, Fraser and Flashman finish off in vintage fashion. The book is Fraser's salute to a time when Britain thought no cost was too great to preserve its dignity. It's up to the standard of Great Game and At the Charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going through the motions","review":"This was a disappointing entry in this series, as most of the earlier books have been quite entertaining. The author seemed to be going through the motions of writing his style of book, but he was basically cutting and pasting a scene here and a scene there from previous novels. You had Flashy with the lovely but dangerous women; Flashy in mortal peril; fearful Flashy abandoning others to save himself; Flashy looking bluff and manly but inwardly quaking; and Flashy's presence at crucial events being misinterpreted to his favor. It was all very rote and leads you to believe that the author is getting tired of it all. The historical wrapping was different from the other books, of course, but it came across as generically Foreign and Exotic; it seemed as if the author had run out of interesting adventures to slot into Flashy's timeline and so chose this one as a second-best option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foghat Rocks!","review":"This recording, consisting of songs from the bands most recent video release from 1997, rocks.

This DEAN ackwoods has given me both. Mine was playable right out of the box and has been hard to put down since! I am having a ton of fun with this instrument because the learning curve is greatly reduced versus me learning to play a 5 string banjo. Each time I play it my technique and sound improve. My friends think I paid 8 to 9 hundred dollars for this because it looks so good and sounds so good. My next move will be to install extra light strings as suggested by others however I am in no hurry as this thing is booming as it is. My experience is 100% satisfaction; you don't need to spend 800 plus bucks; buy this instrument!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Instrument","review":"I am a Guitarist of 7 years and I got this \\"guitjo\\" as a piece in our folk-punk band. With metal finger picks you get a nice banjo sound, flat-picking is kinda difficult because if you go too wild you hit the head, but with some practice you'll overcome this. In open G with a slide sounds gritty, dirty, and glorious. Great with open chords, bar chords sound good up to about 8th/9th fret but I might need to adjust the bridge a little because the action is a bit high. The workmanship was decent, a few nicks and scratchs in the rim, but I'm not a fan of clean and pristine anything. Do your research, learn how to set-up the bridge, The internet is a wealth of knowledge. Keep in mind this is not a bluegrass instrument. But if your a guitarist looking for a new sound I highly reccomend this instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned a shipping damage; cautionary tale","review":"Be advised when buying instruments: you never know who is shipping or how. Ordered a Dean banjo well before it was needed (TG) and received it on time. Opened the single corrugated wall cardboard parallelogram box it was shipped in that felt more like a case interior package than a shipping carton. Inside were three pieces of low grade styrofoam styled packing and a partially tensioned banjo - in two unfortunate pieces.The banjo snapped from the heel to the 18th fret in the classic axe-handle split. While I could have glued and proceeded (some repair skills) it was a gift and I wasn't going to do that. Returned the 'jo and got one locally that I could see. Who knows how many inexpensive instruments shipped out of case are damaged/destroyed at the dock like this but I would think sturdier packing and more padding would be the norm in a delicate musical instrument. Sad; not offputting from Amazon's sake, but a lesson nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hasn't left my mind for two years","review":"I have a masters degree in writng and this book was assigned during the intro-to-the-writing-program course. It changed my perspective, entirely, about what I'd planned to do after graduating. It changed my opinion of writing programs and of masters degrees in writing. The book makes a valid point.That said, the real world hasn't caught up to this little gem. We still need our degrees, unless we get lucky and publish something best selling, lavishly reviewed, become famous some other way, or some such thing.But this notion that MFAs in Writing beget teachers in MFA programs in Writing is a powerful one. Academia is insular; we knew this already (this isn't my first advanced degree), but somehow that the most important element of my degree is that it's the qualification to teach in my own program is a powerful lesson.

Some of the assumptions (for instance, that any poet with an MFA can get a job) are no longer true. Its argument that universities have replaced the patron-based support of writers is marginally convincing, but one can't help but feel that the writer has a bit of a chip on his shoulder, as much as he tries to sound even-handed.If you're deeply interested in the history of who taught writing when and where and how programs have grown, than this book would be worth a read.

If there isn't a black line going right down the side of the dvd, then the other dvd's that look flawless still have flaws. I pretty much have those shows memorized, and from what I saw, they cut one scene which can be seen on tv in the syndicated version. Along with that, there are several other mistakes from music that was different in the original to misprinting on the box (the colors for the printing on the box are very difficult to read) about what show is on what dvd. Some dvd's you can't even play. I waited so long for this series to come out, but I guess I'll have to do without it. I wish I knew which company to call to complain about this.

The book has one short chapter on the reconstruction of the Olympias, the trireme currently operated by the Greek navy, and most of this was devoted to technical information of the most basic sort. I was hoping to read an account of how the project came together and what it was like for the people who participated. The title seemed to promise this. Nope.

Having seen so many bands from the middle 60's through the 90's there really is no such thing as a bad live concert, like beer, some are just better than others.

Time has not tempered its many flaws. The humor is broad and at times overbearing, abrasive. The lead character is a nitwit, obnoxiously stupid. Oddly enough, this is the only character played for laughs, the rest are deadly serious in their intent (none more so than Oliver Reed as the villain, one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary enterprise). The effect is quite jarring, as though they forgot to inform Michael Crawford that they had changed their minds, the piece was now a gritty spy thriller. Unfortunately, it's never as funny as it should have been, and not serious enough to work on any other level.This is not a movie I'd ever want to watch again under any circumstance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Condorman!!!!","review":"James Bond comic book style by Disney.

I would have wanted my $.50 back.Kids will probably enjoy the film and possibly those who are really young kids at heart.

Much of the movie are scenes with clone troopers and battle droids blasting each other. We're given some very old characters such as Jabba the Hutt and Yoda. Anakin though has lost his character, but Obi-Wan, even though he's voiced by James Arnold Taylor in this movie, he sounds a lot like Ewan McGregor. Christopher Lee is back as Count Dooku, and Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu. The movie is a lead-in to the new series on Cartoon Network, but it's a great movie. I don't like Ziro the Hutt though.

I was definitely not disappointed with my purchase.Pros: Lots of adventure and action, but without any gore. It sets the stage nicely for the series coming after, which is full of good lessons for kids.Cons: It is definitely geared toward children, so that may be an issue for some.

George, what was the point of this film? Where in the timeline of the series does this movie fall? Why didn't we see Anakin's padawan in any of the live-action films? Why have plot and character been sacrificed at the altar of the aciton sequence? Granted, this is an animated movie, which usually means a kid's movie, and with their short attention spans, things have to be kept moving, but understand their parents are the same people who saw Episdoes 4 - 6 when they were kids themselves and are ruining it for them.

They repeatedly stated the plot verbally so many times that a 3 year old with ADD and an IV drip hooked up to a bag of sweet tarts dissolved in sprite couldn't lose track of what was going on. Sure, maybe kids will like it, in the sense that kids like a lot of trash, you can show kids other better things and they'll still like them.

The background music plays, general movement sounds are there, but when the characters talk, their lips move and no sound comes out.... It's baffling to me- I don't know how this is possible, but it makes the movie practically unwatchable with no dialogue whatsoever... I suspect I may have gotten bootlegs or something?

Twenty years ago is a long time in the nutrition field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"This book is by far the absolute worst book ever. Please save your money and invest in a much better book.The author is clearly very one-sided, and takes a very strong defensive stand. His strong negativity comes out starting in only the third chapter. He says that malnutrition is impossible in the USA and that no one living in the USA has any nutritional deficiencies. This is obviously false and the author is very ignorant towards homeless people, poor people, and the elderly which can very easily and quickly become deficient in various vitamins and minerals. After reading that in the book I simply could not trust anything else he wrote, and was very happy to burn the book.If you want a good, complete nutrition book, I highly recommend ISBN-13: 978-1592574391. It's the book I purchased after this one to learn all the fundamentals of nutrition (and exercise)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated info and research... good for 1995 but not 2010","review":"I was very excited when I picked this book up in the bookstore. It had great reviews on the cover and seemed very comprehensive.However, once I got home and looked at the publishing date (1995), I was alarmed. I realize that a lot of new studies have been done since 1995 and feared that the book may be dated. I learned my lesson that I should always check publishing date before I buy another book \\"based on science\\" again.After spending just 30 minutes of reading the book, my fears were confirmed. Much of the book is outdated and has old studies. (for i.e. sections on Omega 3 fatty acids, the RDA, vitamin supplements, Vitamin E recommendations, etc)This book would have been a great resource back in 1995 but useless for 2010.The book was so useless that I returned it back to the bookstore the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is outdated, biased, and more opinion based than fact based.

If you believe that there is a magic herb, vitamin combination, etc that will relieve your need to understand how what you eat impacts your long term looks and health... seek guidance elsewhere (AM radio is full of such information).

Includes nutrition specifics those with special dietary requirements."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a book I would recommend.","review":"This book was written by several authors, but they had two things in common--a lack of footnotes and a condescending attitude toward the reader. It was also disturbing that some authors seemed to find certain serious illnesses amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, stay away from this one!","review":"I purchased this book because it had a section on nutrition for infants, but it turned out to be a very long book with no detailed information. (Over 800 pages, but the recommendation for infants aged 1 - 2 years included a suggestoin to feed \\"Sweets to meet caloric needs\\" with no definition as to what these caloric needs are. (I admit I was suprised to learn that I was supposed to feed my infant sweets.) Victor Herbert also spends a considerable amount of time looking down his nose at anybody who would sell Vitamin supplements. He believes that any vitamins, such as a multivitamin, or vitamin E or C supplements are completely worthless. His references for this information appears to be the many articles he himself has written over the years. He apparently makes quite an income on dubunking other nutritionists while offering absolutely no scientific evidence of his own. This book is 800 pages of his opinion - I wasted my money - don't waste yours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly the future","review":"If you're looking for innovative computer-generated graphics and a thumping dance beat, look somewhere else. For a video that should pride itself on the clarity of the graphics, they are grainy and uninventive.

We used it for the first 5 1/2 months with the car seat attached and then when our daughter could finally sit up we started using it alone. Now the stroller works horrible. If the driving surface is smooth at all the right front wheel just drags and you can't steer it. The frame is very weak and it squeaks loudly every time you turn a corner. Also the wheels are made of the cheap plastic and they wear down very quickly. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you only want to use it when your baby is little."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Chew","review":"Our shih tzu Piper had dental surgery to remove four broken teeth. Her dental surgeon vet blamed hard chew treats for the broken teeth. In hindsight some of the chews were so hard that I had to use a saw to cut them in half for sharing between the two dogs. The vet advised us to use the bend test. If the chew isn't flexible, don't give it to your dog.The Nylabone Healthy Edible passes the bend test. Looking at the bone-shaped treat, one would think it is a hard object and a long lasting chew. Piper and Gabby both like these chews. Depending on the dog, these treats can be long lasting without jeapardizing the teeth of the dog.Being a spudophile, I'm pleased that ingredient number four is potato starch. Despite the Nylabone name, these chews contain no plastic. Also lacking are sugar, salt, preservatives, and gluten. The ingredients are natural and it is edible and highly digestible as advertised. Our pooches give the American made Healthy Edibles their barks of approval."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable at all!","review":"This bone is nothing more than a very expensive dog biscuit. My dog consumed the entire thing in less than 20 minutes. He really enjoyed it, but there is no way I'm going to buy another one. There are a lot of more durable bones that cost the same or less than this one. I do not recommend it at all.My dog loves Nybone products. All the other ones seem to last a long time. I guess this \\"Edible\\" line is just made for eating and not chewing. In my opinion, the price is way too high for what you get. I highly recommend other Nybone products, but steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasty but not durable at all!","review":"I purchased this nylabone for my 4 month old teething puppy. I figured she'd enjoy a tasty chew toy. She's quite the chewer so I was thinking the bone would last a day or two at best. However that was wishful thinking! In less than 20 minutes, she had consumed all of it but the bulky end (which we threw away). We couldn't believe how quickly she chewed it up! Definitely not worth the $8."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very special treats","review":"Boy our dogs go crazy for these treats, I buy the regular sized ones and cut them into thirds, they are easy to cut and our dogs are small Yorkies so the third portion is perfect for a treat. They are good for their teeth too. We have one 12 year old and her teeth are perfect. They are one of our dogs favorite treats that we buy. Your dog will love the flavor and they are made in the USA. Can't beat that, just wish they were a bit cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for hardcore chewers","review":"I bought this product for my 9 month-old, 30lb puggle. She is a crazy chewer so I figured it would keep her busy for at least a few hours.After 5 minutes, she had chewed a few tiny chunks off of one end. After 10 minutes, maybe half an inch max was missing from the same end.After 15 minutes, 90% of the bone was gone. I don't know what happened but she must have figured out a way around the chewing. For the next 24 hours she was obviously in discomfort as her body passed the chew, and she drove us crazy acting out because of it.This product is nothing more than a really expensive dog biscuit. DO NOT BUY if your dog is an intense chewer. Light chewers may be able to make it last, but honestly I wouldn't risk your dog's health. Stick to original nylabones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive & made my dog puke!","review":"My German Shepherd is incredibly picky when it comes to treats... So I was incredibly excited that he was finally happy about a toy I had given him.I, however, was not happy that it only took him 8 minutes to eat the entire thing.I was also not happy when he puked the entire thing up (and his dinner) 12 hours later at 4AM... Customer reviews are pretty consistent that this product is too expensive for what it is, and is making the dogs sick.I would never recommend this product to anyone, and will be informing my fellow dog rescue colleagues never to buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste","review":"I wish I had read the other two reviews here. I picked this up at a local store for about 6 bucks. My dog just ate half of it in 5 minutes and would be done with it now if I had not taken it away. And he is only 5 months old...so an older bigger dog could destroy this even quicker. I can't believe they actually sell these...at that price at least. He absolutely loved it and is quite mad I took it away...but not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't last very long","review":"As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile. I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist). It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess. If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster. So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product. It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I do NOT recommend these. My six month old Golden Retriever, who is not a strong chewer, devoured this in less than five minutes.

If it's an edible chew toy though, I've found nothing that can stand up to her jaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST ANOTHER DOG TREAT","review":"This bone is nothing more than a big dog treat. I have a 2 yr old Pit who ate through the souper in 5 minutes. After reading other reviews I took it away from him and will save the rest for a later date. I was hoping for a bone that would last a little bit longer as a chew toy and not just be eaten like a treat. Will not be buying this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my dog throw up bad","review":"Our 14 lb Mini Schnauzer easily started splintering this bone in a matter of minutes and being an 'ever hungry' dog he just swallowed these pieces. Seeing this I took the bone away after he ate about a third of it. Less than 24 hrs later when it was time for his breakfast at 7:30 AM (his standard time) he refused to eat! This was the first time he ever refused to break his overnight fast!! But after a few minutes the hunger must have gotten the better of him; he gave in and ate almost all of it (usually he cleans up his little bowl) and about an hour later he threw up all of it in FOUR rounds of puking!I could see small, softened yet still relatively firm pieces of this Healthy Edible \\"bone\\" in his vomit.

Then it builds static optimizing theory. After these simpler parts are clearly explained, the calculus of variations and the dynamic optimization is introduced. The last part is numerical techniques for finding optimal control.In my opinion this book explains, for example, the deriving of Riccati equation in the best way I have ever read.

This isn't one of them. First, it's full of inconsistencies. Do people's minds travel among parallel universes, or their bodies? The answer: both, with no reason given for why it's sometimes one and sometimes the other. Second, the basic plot is mostly hackneyed. The one original twist is a heavyhanded allusion to TV channel-surfing that isn't enough to sustain a novel. It might have worked for a short story. Perhaps that's what this book is: a short story stretched into a short novel. Anyway, I left it feeling cheated, an experience I have never had with a Barnes book before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great work- if it had been finished","review":"The first thought I had after closing the book was that it was a great work- Well, would have been, if it had been finished. The ending was the worst I've read in a long while. It wasnt really an ending, it was more of a stopping. Not to mention the whole thing was a stretch of imagination. Tolkien wove more believeable tales than this. In the end, I felt that the two dollars I paid for it at the Dollar General store was a buck and two bits too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A brilliant writer takes a dive with \\"Nazi's in Space\\"","review":"I've been a big fan of John Barnes after reading his wonderful novel \\"Mother of Storms.\\" He has a wonderful knack for adding special elements that kept the reader interested, as well as establishing believable characters and well woven plots. His collection of short stories, \\"Apostophes & Apocalypses\\" (Dec 98) was also superb.So what happened? This novel contains one of the most overworked themes, chopped up storylines and only glimpses of his usual brilliance. Maybe it could be hacked together as a \\"Nazi's in Space\\" b-grade movie for Hollywood--but even that would take some doing.If you are a die-hard Barnes fan, you may find some satisfaction here. I'm sorry to say that I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clone of another book -","review":"This book, which looks interesting on the outside, becomes a different animal once you start into it. This one involves multi-universes, existing (? ) simultaneously and our ability to jump from one to the other. In plot it is reminescent of the TV show, SLIDERS, but in style and text it is a clone of The Man In the High Castle by Philip K Dick - but without that author's flair.As usual we are given his fascination with both nazis and communists (communist victory is a common thread in more that one of his books). The story grows slightly confusing and the ending is obviously botched (endless possiblities?) but for a diversion it will do. As other reviewers have noted, it suffers by lacking a historical setting as a base. All worlds are alien and different. Please read The Man In The High Castle for an excellent treatment of this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing...unsatisfying","review":"This was one of the most confusing books I've ever read. Now don't get me wrong; I love books with plots and suspense and foreshadowing and all of that good stuff. I guess the problem I have with this one is that the plot and the ending aren't \\"worth\\" all the confusion in the first 3/4 of the book. While I admire the author for not falling back on a perfect little \\"happy ever after\\" ending, the ending he does give just isn't satisfying.Actually, the style of this book reminds me a lot of the movie \\"Twelve Monkeys.\\" If you don't adore twisted mind benders in your SF, don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Lame as \\"Mother of Storms\\"","review":"This is only the second book by Barnes that I've read, and as was the case with the first one, Mother of Storms, I enjoyed his writing when he was dealing with the science, but found it very lacking in everything else. While the characters were better developed in Finity, they were still not very compelling, and I had very little sympathy for any of them. Also, it's a pretty predictable book, and the while the science of alternate/parallel universes was well done, it's hardly a brand new idea.I probably wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, except maybe just to pass a couple of hours on an airplane, without having to pay too much attention to what you're reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Schneider is a genius!","review":"First off, tracks 1 and 5, Blue Skies for Everyone and Round and Round, respectively, are by folky popster Bob Schneider, NOT Lonely Land!!!And these tracks make the album worth every cent!

Who can resist something so fresh as a little opera singing layered with poprock on Round and Round?!Also, Sandra Bullock's mom sings opera on the last track...cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"For tom waits lovers","review":"This is not a collection of tom waits songs but rather a collection of songs that sound a bit like the whimsical, whispery, tipsy stomps like in tom waits songs but with more harmony, varied vocal styling, and more lyrical nature. Tom waits has one song on it and he assembled the collection from different artists and styles. Even some funk and disco on this. All the songs are full, real songs, not some movie fillers.

You probably figure most people will not return item because it is so bulky; you are right in my case but I will remember not to purchase anything that comes from Outward Hound again for fear of it not being good quality.

She is 5lbs, and this is nice and roomy for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy The Life and Times of Steve Marriott Instead","review":"Everything on this DVD is available on ASIN B00004Y57A. The only difference is that the footage on that one is punctuated with the faces of aging rockers giving interviews, and perhaps a little truncated. Despite those aesthetic blemishes, however, the Life and Times of Steve Marriot is just a better product.Incidentally, if you *must* purchase this, one of the cool things about it is the DVD jukebox feature, which is 10 videos from Leon Russell, Jack Bruce, Procol Harum, etc. That may be worth the price of this DVD alone - however, most of the footage is from the later years.

Guests dropped in coins which totalled their age (a penny for each year)... then guesses were made as to the amount in baby's \\"college fund seed money\\"... winner won a door prize and parents-to-be took the bank home full of coins.I searched and searched for a coin bank that would allow coins and dollars (some guests must look exceptionally young for their age)to be inserted that also had a plug for accessing the funds without literally breaking the bank. This was a very reasonably-priced item and the quality is good. High-quality banks were outrageously priced and designed to be door stoppers or significant accessories to a child's room. This Noah's Ark bank is the perfect size for sitting on baby's dresser shelf.

Any wind over ~10mph will hold the door open as the magnetic latch will not reliably catch after a pet goes through.I have purchased three, the last one of these doors just gave up, after about 10 months use by our four dogs. The first one that we purchased was several (about 7 years) ago. It lasted nearly five years with continuous heavy use by three very active terriers. The hinge pivots finally wore out and let the door jam against the frame. I noticed that the replacement (same staywell model) was much lighter and of different design. The new design lasts about 6 to 10 months.

I never even heard that these songs existed.These are 10 unknown songs by Townes Van Zandt, and don't be afraid of the word demos on it, except for a place were the voice fades a bit, these are very good recordings from the 60's, as good as they come. Most songs are only played with guitars, a few have a band.The songwriting is as good as Van Zandt always is, his voice is fuller than what we heard in his later recordings and in some cases he sounds a bit like Rodney Crowell (he was roaming with him at the time in Nashville) and you can hear that Townes is still searching for his \\"grove\\".This cd is highly recommended for Van Zandt fans, aren't we a bit tired of new releases with old songs? only \\"new\\" songs here, but I doubt that even someone listening to him for the first time through this cd will be disappointed.Thanks Jeanene and thanks Townes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Townes kicks ... from the Beginning to end.","review":"What a breath of fresh air!

These people are the reason that concerts aren't as enjoyable any more. As for the \\"Host\\" of this disaster, this guy needs a razor and a shower. The shots of James drunk outside of a club were just unneccesary in light of his new sobriety. You can tell that this was an \\"unauthorized\\" biography, if it could be called that. The scenes with the host \\"interviewing\\" a couple of fans looks so staged it is pathetic. I have been a fan of the band since '86 and own every DVD Metallica has put out. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because it IS about Metallica, and that is the ONLY reason. True fans should skip this and stick to the authorized DVD's the band puts out."},{"rating":"1","title":"leave this one on the shelf","review":"I got this from a discount store, very cheap (less than what it costs with shipping and handling online here), and I really wish I had the money back. It is a underground documentary that that is supposed to be focused on the fans of metallica, trying to be heavy metal parking lot. However, this is a far cry from it. The folks this movie shows are either tweeking on meth or too drunk to carry on a meaningful conversation. After the first two interviews with drunk people, the novelty wears off, and there is no funny left. Sure there are a few appearences by big stars such as Rob Halford, but not really worth puchasing this disc for. There is no insight, nor redeaming quality this movie. It is almost insulting to Metallica and their fans, and me being a fan, I wish they would have had a bigger cross section interviewed to show how broad the fanbase is, and how productive and insightful we can be. Let this movie sit on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable!","review":"Marilyn Monroe by Katherine E. Krohn, in my opinion was very enjoyable. The book focused on all of the major parts of Marilyn's life, from her childhood of being an orphan through her years of fame and stardom, all the way to her tragic death. The book was fairly easy to read and made for a teen reader. I think that for a person who is looking for a main overview of Marilyn's life this is a perfect pick. It gives all of the major happenings but doesn't go into great detail, which I particularly enjoyed. Yet, for a person who wants to know all of the little details this book is not the best choice. The author did a good job of characterizing Marilyn correctly, as a driven and unique woman .Overall, I thought the biography was very enjoyable and would recommend it to any teen who is interested in Marilyn because it is easy to read and does not go over the edge with detailing. It does a great job of showing Marilyn Monroe as the iconic person she truly was."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This is a wonderful movie.... highly recommended.

The stroller rides extremely smooth-it's easy to manuever, the car seat isn't too heavy, and the stroller isn't overly huge, so I don't feel like I'm pushing a bus! I don't exactly LOVE the fabric design, (the reason for my 4 stars, although it's not bad) but it's good for either boy or girl, and again, this was by far the best stroller for the best price.

Like the Tao te Ching, it's emphasis is on the yin or gentler aspects of leadership. It's good to balance this with a more yang book (Good to Great, Leadership is An art, etc.) to get a rounded perspective on leadership.However, since most leadership in Western culture is very yang oriented, this will provide a good balance and deep insights that will assist most of us in becoming better leaders."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tao of Leadership","review":"Really good book, teaches you how to be a good person in a leadership position.

He seems to think that pulpit witticisms constitute doctrine. I can't get a real feel for anything he believes theologically. Instead, he's substituted tepid politics for church talk. If I wanted this, I would read a book by William Clinton instead of William Coffin, and it would probably say the same things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get It","review":"I'm not sure what I'm supposed to get out of this book. Usually after I read a Christian book I either walk away inspired to follow, or challenged to change, or urged to obey, or something like that. I walk away from this book thinking \\"Coffin really thought he was clever.\\" In fact, though, there's not much take home value to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and unfounded","review":"Credo represents the collected sayings, most likely extracted from sermons, of a pastor who must have been popular in teh 1960's. He now seems out of touch with the realizties of today. Diversity awareness of this sort has created nothing but children who can't tell right from wrong. Coffin seems like he hasn't read the newspapers in a while, or at best only hears what he wants to hear. This is what happens when hippies get ordained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Try?","review":"Coffin's collection of (somewhat scattered) thoughts seems to boil down to the basic idea that the world would be a better place if people were gracious to each other. However, one wonders, if God is such a small part of the picture all along, what is the reason why people ought to be gracious? He seems to pull the carpet out from under his own feet. Why should people honor one another if God is just a farce that we have put on to soothe our consciences?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a DBA handbook","review":"This book falls far short of being a DBA handbook. It is more useful to someone who needs to \\"get by\\" for a few weeks while their DBA is away.It is ok at showing you how to \\"do things\\" in some cases (hence 2 stars). But, if you need to work backwards (i.e you might want to query dictionary tables to find out where something lives and why) then this book is almost useless. I am an experienced Oracle DBA and decided to write this review after referencing this book 10 times in the past week and not finding any help at all from this book in each case.

I had labs to do that involved setting up user accounts, giving/revoking permissions to tables, etc. THe \\"Complete Reference\\" didn't have the necessary information--some but not all. This book--the DBA Handbook--had more complete information that quickly gave me me the information that I needed to answer the questions. I must admit that I shyed away from it at the beginning of the course because I read all the negative comments here. But I am glad that my desperation (because the Oracle product documentation was absolutely no help) pushed me to go to nearest Borders to check it out before purchasing it. I am happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This in NOT an Oracle9i new features book!","review":"You should only consider buying this book if you do not have a good Oracle8i book already or if you are willing to read it completely. There are only a few references to Oracle9i and you have to search them in the index (which means that you have to know the new features BEFORE even reading the book!). It looks like time-to-market has played a key role in the conception of this book.The one star is for being a pretty good book for Oracle newbies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good offering, but does not represent.","review":"This CD doesn't really represent what these guys do live, but it has some interesting moments.

Emphasizer strikes me as a great representation of where modern groove jazz has come to, performed by some of the players most responsible for bringing it here.

He fuses traditional Japanese culture, art, and stories with intricate and modern patterns. There's tons of color and each print can be viewed over and over again with different images appearing each time. In other words, this man's art never gets old and he's created a style all his own. Definitely worth purchasing. My only complaint here is that some of the prints were small and it would be better if a few more pages were devoted to single images and not serveral at a time. Downsizing limits detail. However, this is still a beautiful book that can be enjoyed for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMANO fans only","review":"The book is well put together and has great image quality, but unless your a big Amano fan than this book is probably not for you. Honestly I wish I could truly give this book 5 stars because I love his ink designs but some of his fairy concepts is not my cup of tea. As for range this book delivers like few art books do and you truly get a feel for his style and what he's about.If you got the change to spend and love art books than this will make a great addition to your collection. Otherwise I would go to a store and flip through it a bit to see if it is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to my expectations. . .","review":"I've seen his work on the Arts channel and am impressed, but when I looked at this book I was disappointed.

Yet, good artbooks do cost a lot when compared to other books. Fact of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommendable","review":"This book is a perfect artbook, an wonderful edition, with an excellent paper, and high quality images.

While wrapping it I read the whole book cover to cover during a summer I was busy downsizing my home and moving into a small apartment. The delicious photos of healthy, happy infants and toddlers, the inviting styles combined with the instructions in the friend to friend voice of Elanor reminded me of the fun I used to have knitting. I moved my needles from the \\"give-away\\" pile and started a swing coat and hat for a baby a neighbor is expecting. I am so grateful to Elanor for writing this book so that I and others can benefit from her knowledge and creativity.

Several baby blankets are also included and a few toys. Print and binding are fine and babies are very cute.

Take one poor, lonely boy, one giant gothic library, one greedy relative, and one mysterious hidden treasure and mix well for an action packed, fun book. Spooky, but not too scary. Lots of kids will identify with the hero, a lonely boy from the wrong side of the tracks who befriends the librarian at the castle-like library. He discovers a clue to the treasure that was rumored to have been hidden by the library's builder, the mysterious and strange Alpheus Winterborn. Winterborn's greedy nephew is on the trail too, and it makes for a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book!","review":"I loved this book, it's fun to read and the characters are welldeveloped and very interesting! The Anthony Monday character featuredin this story is not quite as good as the Johny Dixon character in some of John Bellair's other books (like the Curse of the Blue Figurine) but he is still enjoyable. This book has great action (floods, struggles on rooftops), and is appropriate and entertaining for ALL ages! This book might look like a childeren's book (what with it's large type and all) but I'm 15 and i still love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story!","review":"This is a good story and it's written very well. A thirteen year old boy, who is desperate to help his family out of their money troubles, searches for a treasure that may be just a practical joke. I didn't like the beginning of the story where Anthony is having trouble with his parents fighting all the time about money, but that's because John Bellairs wrote it so well.

That's quite something and praise indeed for her literary abilities and writing skills! It's not often that I've come across an author that delivers a winner with every book that's published. I've read just about all of her books and The Mentor was virtually the last on Amazon's list. This book is every bit as good as her others. It centers around the intrigue in a law firm and the political undertones in the US Attorny's office and a militia group. Fast paced, and full of twists and turns, it's a really good read at a really keen price. Highly recommended: you'll probably fall in love with her writing. Like I deed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing by an excellent author.","review":"Rebecca has the writing ability to keep readers asking for more, more, more. This book, I have claimed it as my favorite, had me reading until the wee hours because I could not let it go. The Mentor, a very loving and honest and respected judge has taken time to mentor two young people he truly has deep feelings about. His wife had passed away and not ever having children of his own has taken these two people to teach, help and love. The story is compelling and the two people he mentored both become lawyers. They soaked up his intelligence, patience and love and went into the working world to use what he taught them. One took advantage and one became the spirit of his honorable self. I cannot get enough of this authors writing, she is more than an author, she puts humanity and justice into her novels. This book is a must read for every reader.

I used my own tools and was successful at that point.

Two problems: The straps are too cheap. I've broken two of them by just tugging on them a little too hard while trying to make them tight enough. And the nails need to be tapered. As they are, they quickly fill up with debris as you walk around, making you have to stop and clean them. I think they would self-clean if the nail was a little wider at the top than at the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The idea is great, but the product isn't. You need to have very large feet and large work boots to wear these. I have a womens size 10, and they didn't fit well. The straps were as tight as possible and the shoes continued to wiggle loose. To use, I had to pull a foot out of the ground, then push it into another area, working one foot at a time, that is with dry hard soil. With soft soil, it was a challenge to move at all, it felt as if the ground was sucking the shoes into it. Too much effort to use.

Tightening the back strap sufficiently to hold is a dangerous idea, because the flimsy plastic sinch will snap.My workaround solution was finding a now disposable pair of shoes, and using liquid nails to bond them permanently to the aerators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap buckles","review":"I bought this because they looked heavy duty. I spiked about 10 square feet of my yard and the buckles became loose. When I went to tighten, the buckle snapped (very cheap plastic). I did not pay much for these so I guess I can't complain much, you get what you pay for, but I would have hoped they lasted longer than 10 square feet.

The sandals are sturdy, and the spikes are able to penetrate into my soil. But being limited to ten minute intervals is a big bummer.

Any resistance while walking will pull the strap right out of the buckle.I tried modifying the straps with velcro after cutting off the buckle, but I now think that a better quality buckle combined WITH velcro to reinforce, might have made these work.Velcro alone is still too much resistance and pulls apart. I'm think that it needed a total of 3 straps.* The heel clip needs to be much higher and perhaps wrap more.

Bottom line, when I did get them to fit and stay attached, I had to walk very carefully to avoid them falling off completely. The average person is not going to want to deal with it.

I then tried to pull one of the straps tight and broke the plastic buckle. My last attempt was to just tie them around my shoes and I managed about 5 steps and thought, \\"hey, this is pretty cool\\". Just at that moment, one slipped off, I tripped over it and almost impaled myself on the 12 spikes. I wish I could have seen myself because it was probably a pretty comical scene.

The few steps I did take, they seemed to be doing a nice job."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MATERIALS","review":"These \\"shoes\\" are anything but. The look like they should work in theory, but as many have already pointed out these things are worthless. If you are light enough and small enough to wear these tightly then you are too light to actually spike the ground. On the other hand if you are a big guy like me (6', 200#) you can expect to pull these \\"shoes\\" right off your feet with practically each step as the spikes will become stuck as you try to balance and move.

I can confirm the most of the reviewers opinion: the straps are the worst part. They are way to long and need a design improvement.

Using both soles at the same time needs some walking practice. Do not forget a stool to attach them to your shoes and start walking - Moist dirt sticks to the soles stay in gras areas.Now using them for 6 months I had to replace the complete attachment straps because the buckles broke.

However,upon the first use, both of the plastic clips broke on one of the shoes. Its just a thin plastic that is supposed to hold the strap tightly to the foot. The spikes are going into the ground and have to be pulled back out before taking the next step.

The buckles on the straps provided are also incredibly flimsy and shattered easily; I resorted to feeding the strap through the loop sewn to hold the buckle.

I've connected an HDTV cable box via HDMI, progressive DVD player via component input and TIVO through S-video. So far the TV has performed extremely well, no problems to report. I've also been very impressed with the sound this TV produces. It's so good that I don't normally bother to run normal TV through my AV receiver.Standard definition looks better than I expected for both straight cable broadcasts and through the TIVO recorded on medium quality. DVD look very good, but the true HDTV sources really shine with this TV - the Olympics were amazing!The display is bright enough that I actually watch it with the bulb in \\"reduced\\" mode (even in the day) to extend the bulb life.I've had no problems, and as suggested for anything projection systems I've got the TV hooked up to a UPS in case of power failure, and I did spring for an extended warrantee with bulb replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey Out of a Living Hell","review":"My heart goes out to Marie Osmond. As a man, there is absolutely no way that I could possibly fully understand what she has gone through. No man can. Her story is absolutely horrifying in that she was forced to endure so much suffering without any visible help being available. Ms. Osmond writes with candor as well as humor and I feel confident that readers will benefit from her sufferings. Dr. Judith Moore adds a very informative section at the close of the book that brings much needed knowledge and help to a very serious condition. I hope that more men will read this book so that they might be of some help to the women in their lives who will go through this devastating illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her journey to PPD but not too much detail of getting out of it","review":"The book was just okay for me. She spent most of the time writing about her experience of being severely depressed and how she was just barely surviving day to day, hour to hour. She seems to be a bit \\"ANTI\\" anti-depressants. I would have liked her to spend more time on her journey out of her depression; how it effected her husband and children, and how she was able to heal those relationships (she mentions that her husband and her seperated for 6 months, kind of as a side note). Also, she talks about questioning everything in her life and her motivation behind everything she is and does, but fails to mention any changes in lifestyle that made a difference in her healing process. Was it only her green manure tea, bubble baths with candles, and going on Oprah that healed her??"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Startling Journey of Recovery","review":"Hard to believe that someone so gifted could suffer from depression, post partum or otherwise. Yet that is the story shared by Marie Osmond. The world saw her smile, sing, dance, act and host shows with her talented brothers. She appeared to be on top of the world as she embraced marriage and motherhood. Yet behind the professional smile and demeanor was pain and unhappiness. She writes the book to help other women who suffer similarly and who are unable to articulate their feelings. There is a surprising chapter on the abuse she experienced, and has identified as a causitive factor in her own depression. Writing the book was cathartic for Ms. Osmond. Women and their husbands may likewise gain insight into this illness and how to help each other and their marriage by reading this book. Candid, honest, and revealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"True and Honest","review":"In her story, Marie Osmond gives a true and honest revelation about how she felt after giving birth. The person going through this is a \\"regular\\" human being not a star. Marie is realistic about how she has access to some \\"star\\" treatment, but what she was going through were honest to goodness emotions. Any woman can relate, especially someone who has givin birth. There are so many things that women must deal with on a daily basis and some have more than others to face. I applaud Marie for coming forth and being so honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"FEEL HER PAIN!!","review":"This book is nothing more than a Victim Seeker's Bible. Are we supposed to feel sorry for her? She is using a sickness for personal glorification and a reason to sell a book.

This CD has more songs that offer a different sound from their previous releases. At first the listener might find the vocalist annoying(he has a weird pitch between sometimes too high/low plus I have no idea why he tries to sing at times)) like I did,but it kind of grew on me with time. Also the guitar work is excellent on most tracks with more varied riffs unlike their first 2 releases which was nothing that notable. Standout tracks are(BREAKING BOURDARIES,H.B.F SUICIDE,DESTROY LIFE,MY BLOODY RAMPAGE)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressive","review":"This book is one of a series dealing with the cuisines of various cultures. I have bought two so far and I am not in a hurry to buy any more, although I do note that the different books have different authors, so perhaps some of the others are worth the money. This particular book, I have to say, is not very good. Other than the section on the medicinal use of foodstuffs in China (which is not bad), most of what is presented can easily be found elsewhere. Most of my Chinese cookbooks give background information about food and cultural practices and cumulatively they cover just about everything I read in this little book. I also note that there were several factual errors in the text. I have to say that, when I come across something in a book that I know to be wrong, I am disinclined to take that book as being an authority on anything else.

Personnaly, I have not heard other interpretations and I ignore all critics based on interpretation. It is useless to do so because that is a question of taste. Think about it: on what can we base ourselves to critic interpretation? There is only an answer: on ther other we heard. Which in particular? The first one. We get used to the first recording we listen to. Thus, any recordings that comes after is simply... not the same. Personnaly, I find this CD quite good, singers are perfect, sound is good and the selection is impeccable. All songs are incredible. A Welcome Song is just so lyric and Lullay My Liking so unforgettable. If I just give 4 stars it is because I cannot assume that ir is the best recording ever since I did not heard other ones (safe for some songs on other Holst's CDs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Terrible cd .Please do not buy it i do not recomend. qulaity is terrible and so is selecto=ion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow instructor","review":"My 7 year old son found the video easy to follow.

The ilustrations are square and dry as so his way to write; I mean, if you read this you must realize how BORING this is on the first part of the book. The way Hunter Ross gimmick both GCPD and Batman is good though, I'll give him that, but he's more into the secondary characters story that from time to time you can't avoid to flip pages in order to check if Batman is in the story at all.The book have a couple of good things, but I personally regret of buying this.

It starts off with a two year old (Nathan) telling his friends in baby talk (that the adults are not supposed to understand) that he is going to get a daddy while on vacation with his mom (Marissa). So they go on vacation, with his mom clueless to his plans, he grabs a jogger on the beach, and the jogger (Jack) breaks his leg and fingers. Marissa feels responsible to help him out, so she does. Nathan starts calling the man daddy right away. After a week they are both in love with the other, but do not want to admit it because of there past heartaches, especially Jack.The story itself is basically about the things that Marissa does for Jack, and the past that is haunting Jack. And it is all wrapped up way to fast at the end. Just when you think that the story is going to start its over. There was so much more that the author could have explored with these characters and it was disappointing that she didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"THis hint guide is really good, but the fact that they don't mark which trainer is which is confusing.

This stuff has returned them to their original thickness and they are even longer than they were before! I'm talking Diana Ross long!

NOT!3. Amazon stated if I ordered another product within 90 minutes orders would be combined saving shipping charges. That didn't happen either.4. Product is not as powerful as claimed. Barely shreds 5 sheets.5. Safe Sense bar is more annoying than useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shredder","review":"Best shredder I've ever had. It shreds credit cards with no problem. It takes a while for the bucket to fill (unless you're catching up on six month's of junk mail or clearing out a filing cabinet.) Taking the shredder off the bucket can cause some of the shredded paper to fall on the floor. If you close the flap on the bottom of the shredder as you take it off the bucket, you can prevent this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definite No","review":"The machine shreds well when it works. More often a red light comes on telling you it won't shred. It is sensitive to movement, touch, any contact. The top is heavy often difficult to fit into the container. If the fit is not exact the red light is lit and it doesn't work. Most often the red light is on and I have to battle for a precise fit of the shredder onto the basket. If the basket breaks, chip, cracks the machine won't work. If you like frustration this is the machine to buy. I have had it less than a year and I am about to junk it and buy something that hopefully works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shredder","review":"This is an excellent shredder. It is definately worth paying a little more money for one that doesn't jam every two seconds. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shredder!!!","review":"This is a great shredder.

I wish, however, I had paid a bit more to get one that would shred CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowes Powershred PS-67C","review":"The Fellowes Powershed has plenty of power to handle all your shredding needs.

Amazon, as always, is reliable and quick on their shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service","review":"After two years of a three year cutter warranty the unit and minimal use. It worked except for the left side in approx 25% of the cutter. Contacting customer service the individual stated let me hear the the shredder......after placing the phone to the cutter and starting it she stated it is the ball bearing and the cutter is not covered by the warranty, in other words too bad, so sad.For the money spent on this unit and the minimal amount of use it had, by far the worst. Better items out there for the expense and headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowes Shredder","review":"Good product - however, this is the second one I've purchased due to paper jamming frequently.

I have used it for about a month and I have been extremely pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I did so much research on shredders prior to chosing this one. Well, so much for that idea. I ended up returning it the VERY SAME DAY I received it. This shredder jammed so many times that I decided no matter what.... I was not keeping it. I never even put more than 8 sheets of paper into it. So disappointed, that I went through all this hassle for this item, and repacking and shipping it back was no fun. I ended up spending more money and ordered the Fellowes Intellishred PS-79ci shredder and I am soooooooo glad I did it. NOT ONE TIME has it jammed. It is also more pleasing to the eye, easier to empty the trash can and I love that it has wheels. I would recommend anyone to look into the upgrade proir to ordering this particular shredder (unless you have extra time in the day to deal with constant paper jams). I comment Amazon for such fast shipping. On both items, it only took 3 days for free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confetti Cut? Not Quite","review":"Got this today and while it does do its job as far as shredding, not jamming too often and holding a good amount in the container I don't know why they say its confetti cut when its more like strips. I was led to believe that it cut up the pieces smaller (into actual confetti or crosscut small pieces) then what they are. The cut is about 1 inch in length which to me isnt as secure as a true \\"confetti cut\\" would be. So for those of you who are expecting this to make actual confetti, it wont. If you want a sturdy shredder that shreds and doesn't jam up, then try this one out. So it still gets 4 stars for its performance (so far) but no star for its cutting technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain to use","review":"This item requires a lot of \\"jostling\\" of the shredder head in order to align the shredder to the sensor in the basket or else it will not work. It is very frustrating, to put it mildly. Once you get it in the right position it shreds well, but if you move it even a little bit while it is shredding, it loses the contact and stops. I don't recommend it at all -- there are much better shredders out there to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A Confetti Shredder","review":"I looked at some shredders at Office Depot, and went through 15-20 reviews on Amazon, and a few more on other sites. By the time I got to this one, I wasn't paying enough attention. I saw the high ratings and the words \\"confetti\\" shredder.So, it's my fault for not paying enough attention to the specs. But it's also Fellowes' fault for claiming that the output can be called confetti. Two inch strips are not confetti. The shredder seems to be ok as a strip shredder, from the small usage I've given it. As some others have noticed, that shredder head is heavy, and you need to take it off the capture bin to empty the bin.Time to find out how to return this to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked properly","review":"I have owned mine for a couple of years, and it's never worked right. The \\"Safe Sense\\" technology has always detected jams when there aren't any. I have always had to fiddle with it to get the green light on for shredding. The switch to disable \\"Safe Sense\\" is not functional. For the past two months, nothing I seem to do can get the green light. While I invested in a better shredder for my office within months of purchasing this one, I've kept this one at my desk as a personal shredder. It's now going to get thrown away. I guess I got a lemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shred it good.","review":"I like this product because it is so much better than the one that has a barrier between the slots.

Personal mail and documents, documents for my business...I put shredders thru the paces. In fact, over the last year I've gone through 2 shredders...I wore them out. I decided to go with a Fellowes because of the other reviews that I read, I wanted to make sure I purchased one that would last. So far I'm impressed. It does what it says it's suppose to do! I love the confetti shredding on this one, previous one's I've had simply shredded my documents in long shreds. This one seems to have the power I need to get the job done. I love the saftey feature that will stop the shredder if my hand or fingers are by the opening! It's a bit larger than I thought it would be but still a very adequate size for my home office. I'm hoping this one will be with me for several years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowes Powershred PSCs Shredder","review":"This shredder is great.

But it all works out anyway...In this book, Ashley get's in a fight with her boyfriend Ross because of a magic-trick, And Ashley didn't know you can't open the magic-box from the inside, so when Ross walks away from her, and she's going to practice by herself.... well she get's stuck in the magic-box, but at the end Ross saves her!!!

Imagine crossing stoner rock with progressive pop and you're almost there; definitley something you can dance and sing graciously along to.Why then did it only get two stars? Well, if you're new to QOTSA then it's a good start, but for those like myself who've listened to their whole discography (and maybe even Kyuss)this single had little to offer. Not only is the single on the album, but the two live recordings, \\"Do It Again\\" (off Songs for the Deaf) and \\"Regular John\\" (found on their self-titled debut) are badly produced in comparison to the superior \\"Song for the Dead\\" on the first \\"No One Knows\\" single.Shame really as \\"Go With the Flow\\" is one of the strongest tracks on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Windows 7","review":"My son bought this classic game because he LOVES it, but his old copy got scratched when he played it on his old desktop.

Although I was surrounded by folks who had spent hundreds more on their scopes, I was excited to discover no real difference between this scope and the nikon, bushnell, telestron, etc. that they had and my Alpen. I was watching animals from distances between a mile and a few hundred feet and was never disappointed. Even in winds of 30-40 mph I was able to keep the animals in focus at a mile away.(Don't forget to brace your tripod in any wind!) I use this scope on a Slik U9000 tripod and backpack with it. The hardcase is an added bonus for traveling with it. A great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Affecting prose by the master of the novella","review":"I really enjoyed these carefully crafted novellae. I particularly like 'Swami & Friends', which reinforced the universal forces that act upon children -- loyalty, belonging, and love. I also thought the 'Dark Room' was an excellent work, contrasting the response of an upper-class Indian housewife's ultimately failed attempt at rebellion with her husband's lack of appreciation for what he has. I highly recommend Narayan's work -- a window into Raj and post-Raj India with few peers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oops!

At first, this album crept through my delicate veins, bludgeoning them with sharp sticks! And shattered pottery! But soon, I realized that each member of SPAM is like the Planeteers: the five elements being mastered and controlled by rings on their fingers! Also! One is French! SMAP often reminds me of a boy band from the future! You know, when boy bands will be composed entierly of robots with such perfect singing voices, that there are no pesky minor chords!

It touches on what I would assume to be classic folk songs or just songs associated with specific countries around the world.

If you don't already know these songs it will introduce your family to some great music that, frankly, maybe we all should know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Alouette??","review":"If you can stand the unbearable overperkiness and artificial constant excitement in the \\"children's\\" voices, it's a nice intro to music from around the world. Kids don't seem to mind and love it.All expected country stereotypes are duly reinforced, without a mention of any of the issues many of these countries are also associated with. Fine, it's a sugar-coated Dora world.As mentioned before, especially given the mickey-mouse speed at which they speak/sing (CD length is achieved thorough over-repetition), lyrics & translations might have helped.Or not: The French song selected, \\"Alouette\\", is an extremely CRUEL song about plucking a little bird's feathers, body part by body part... rendered in Dora's excruciatingly upbeat way. Sigh. Couldn't they have picked any less gut-wrenching song, e.g. \\"Sur le pont d'Avignon\\", \\"Frere Jacques\\", \\"Au clair de la lune\\", ...?? We're always skipping \\"Alouette\\" because I just know too much French to bear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so custom","review":"These floor liners do not fit very well.

It has come to the stage where I must collect all her movies. This is why I was so excited to find this 1983 movie at Amazon. My excitement turned to disappointment when I played this tape. Obviously Tai Seng must have recorded this with dirty video heads.The picture is smeared & lacks focus.

A fan for many years, his compositions still generate a spirit of praise and rejoicing. In 'Journey' he gives his audience a cornucopia of music interpreted by artists from different genres (R&B;, classical, gospel, etc.). All interpret the music differently and simultaneously bring it to life with the majesty and panache the compositions deserve.His presentation of the original Richard Smallwood Singers and the Hawkins Family were particularly special treats.

It has a superb beginning in the portrayal and history the Confed. But the excitement goes down when Blair walks matter-of-factedly into the realm of the Border Worlds with apathy as if switching college roommates. The lack of surprising element in Blair and the other crewmembers especially troubled me when the star port vet and Towyn were brought onboard without foreknowledge. Major inconsistencies with the game, such as the elimination of Vagabond and Catscrach as major characters, and the very unnatural romance between Blair and Sosa reduces the enjoyment a bit. The novel still brings you unexpected adventures, and I recommend it as an excellent companion to the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom","review":"The book that is based on the game is really good.

But it is still a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many liberties with the storyline","review":"This book simply butchers the story. Blair was a hero and a tough guy, not some weakling, who just about gets killed at the beginning. Furthermore, the idea of a full Colonel, who is over forty, having some sort of romance with a Lieutenant, who is not only his subordinate but about half his age, is simply disgusting, not to mention having nothing to do with the actual story. Avoid this book, if you have any concern for accuracy in the Wing Commander universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light weight tackle box","review":"I have been buying this type of tackle box for the past 30 years.

Sure, wheels on the bus is cute and fun, but it's mainly in English. What's the point??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD - my kids loved it","review":"The kids loved it.

Almost all of the unique representations of the songs have been taken from Laurie Berkner's \\"Victor Vito\\", with no mention or thanks to her anywhere, and the French is pretty minimal, to boot. I was really disappointed. We have way overlistened to \\"Victor Vito\\", which is nobody's fault but our own, but we were looking for something really different and didn't get it. A disappointment to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not that good.","review":"This CD is okay for parents who want to teach their children French. But Jean Rene's voice sounds like that of Chuck E Cheese. Mr. Rene probably dressed up in the costume to record this album, so I am not a fan of it. I do not recommend this album to parents who do not like taking their kids to Chuck E Cheese's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"While I am sure the book would have made sense in the nineties this is just WAY outdated today. 90% of what the author suggests would never work in today's organizations.

I would recommend the kindle version ( cheaper ) if you really feel curious ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conflict and Silence of the Heart","review":"This is two movies on one disc.

The characteristic of most of these natures is that they abound in old Germanic heroism, that they revel in the dim past, axes, spears and shields, but that in their own essence they are the greatest imaginable cowards. For the same persons who wave about toy swords, carefully manufactured in imitation of old Germanic style always preach for the present time only a spiritual battle and quickly run away. I got to know these people too well not to feel disgust at this miserable comedy. They make a ridiculous impression on the broad masses. Despite all proofs of their total inability these people pretend to understand everything better than anybody else, especially in regard to the so-called religious reformers of the ancient Germanic type."},{"rating":"1","title":"This deserves 0","review":"This is the worst excuse for a 'composition' by any artist and a complete rip off by any standards. Black metal is about guitars+drums+vocals+synth. I read somewhere that count Varg is not allowed any instrument, barring a syth in jail. Still, how can you get away with producing repetitive, tedious, and boring 'melodies', which some others have described as 'hauting'! Hauting, probably because they never thought they would pay $16 for this!Please avoid at all costs and if you want to buy something Burzum, try ANY of the other albums, which are worth much more than what you will pay for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Death of Balder","review":"Here meaning The Death of Balder, this is the first black ambient album made in prison by Varg, telling the legend of the Norse God Balder.

Not a dry earnest folkie effort that tries to teach lessons, not a goofy jokey thing filled with mediocre musicianship, not a rehash of all of the old standards (thank God, no \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider\\"). Fresh new words (for the most part; at least one of her books comes recycled as a song), and inventive music across several genres (R&B, funk, dance hall, straight Brill Building numbers), including perhaps the first ever turkey on the make pitching woo via the blues. Adam Bryant's singing of these songs could not be improved upon even in one's imagination, and the arrangements are sprightly and appropriate. A masterpiece; brava, Ms. Boynton, you've done it again! Can you do no wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Tapping Songs, Let's Hit It!","review":"My 33-month toddler has outgrown his nursery ryhmes. If you have an active toddler who has a sense of humor, you may want to try this out. His favourite tunes are definitely \\"Tickle Time\\", \\"Lonely Peas\\" and \\"Rhinoceros Tap\\", but most of all, he enjoys all the songs, including \\"Turkey Love\\", \\"So Long, Doggies\\" and he will shout at \\"Horns to Toes\\" etc.Catchy tunes, witty words, funny creatures with really fun songs, my son's rhythm tapping is getting pretty steady. Though it's a bit more to pay for this audio book (as per our currency exchange), I couldn't find any other children's songs as creative as this ONE! See the way my son tapped along with the songs, I knew Sandra Boynton had it all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Fun","review":"This CD is fun for children and their parents and the book is a plus.

Being generally very literal, small kids will think this is a song about how bad babies are. This is in my view a real problem. I ordered this item for my preschooler but I won't play it for him now that I've listened to it.I found no such problems with either \\"dog train\\" or \\"Philadelphia chickens\\", both of which are excellent, and so much fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with this one","review":"We bought this CD for our 7-year-old son (he already has \\"Philadelphia Chickens\\" and \\"Dog Train\\" by the same artist), but \\"Rhinoceros Tap\\" just doesn't have the charisma as the other ones by Sandra Boynton. The tunes just aren't catchy. Some of them remind me of old jazz/blues music, which I enjoy and appreciate, but the melodies are more on the somber side and it's hard to work in words that are suitable for children. As a result, my son loses interest after about the third or fourth number. The other CDs by Boynton are wonderful and we've just about worn them out, but somehow \\"Rhinoceros Tap\\" doesn't quite make the cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and fun for kids and grownups alike!","review":"My son got this as a gift as a toddler, and I immediately filed it away, figuring it was probably just another cheesy kid's CD (I am a total music snob and can't stand most music marketed for kids). Somehow the CD made its way to the player one day and WOW! The songs were actually quite ingenious and musically charming! The production is pretty basic- it's pretty much one guy singing with a synthesizer providing most of the instrumentals. If the songs weren't so cleverly well-written, I would probably have a hard time with the somewhat limited production value. The singer, and Sandra Boynton, score major music geek points with me for pulling off so many different styles of music on one CD. And of course, the lyrics are silly enough to entertain even the most stoic of adults- not a small victory when you're trapped in the car with a little monarch who wants you to put on the same music EVERY SINGLE TIME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and Playful, and Adults Won't Hang Themselves","review":"My 3-year-old daughter LOVES this book & CD. She's always been a Boynton book fan and she would have this CD on 24/7 if we'd let her. And we almost do. Like all truly good children's works, it appeals on a basic level to the kids with the pictures of the cute animals and the silly situations, but it also has just enough under-the-radar puns and allusions that adults won't go stark raving mad on repeat #118. The music is really well written and perfectly satirizes the various genres it shoots for. Adam Byant's vocals are fun and camp. Nice job to the whole crew who put it together!

I'm well pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"For musicians and Sondheim enthusiasts only","review":"As a musical theatre composer myself, this book was dead on as far as its intricate dissecting of Sondheim's scores. However, non-musicians take note: This book may not be for you. Banfield employs deep theortical analasys of Sondheim's work, and most readers without a background in music theory will find some of this book difficult to understand. As far as Banfield's analasys goes, it is right on target. He explains the various schemes and tecniques Sondheim uses in his music to make it sound exactly like what is being expressed. Banfield also does an excellent job in explaning the various actions that drove Sondheim to write his shows and the reactions that came from the critics. All in all, this is a wonderfully written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Wonderful, Fabulous *but* .....","review":"Immediately before beginning this book, I read Stephen Sondheim : A Life by Meryle Secrest. (I recommend Secrest's biography). The two books together are powerful. It is will help to have an interest and some knowledge of musical harmony and piano, as I myself happen to have. Reading this book may well be as close as most of us will ever come to what it must have been like for Sondheim, when he was 16, to spend an afternoon with Hammerstein being taught the essentials of writing a musical comedy. Sondheim has always been generous with his time and energy to help up and coming musical comedy composers...Sondheim helped this book's author by providing comments and insites concerning the manuscript. Sondheim has never forgotten how greatful he was, when he was starting out, to be helped by many other people who helped him for unselfish reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Male tigers care for their family","review":"Until Thapar's observations, there was not much information about the family life of tigers. Generally, male tigers were known to be totally indifferent fathers, sometimes even a serious threat for their own cubs. There have been many hunters reporting about male tigers killing and eating cubs. Valmik Thapar's observations in Ranthambhore tell the opposite. In a more or less stable natural environment, without the constant persecution by hunters and poachers, male tigers meet their family occasionally for eating, resting, and sometimes even for playing.From 1986 to 1988 Fateh Singh and Valmik Thapar could observe three tiger families, mother father and cubs, resting, eating and playing together. Some of the cubs could survive into sub-adulthood within two years, but even then, there were no signs of any conflict with the resident father.I enjoyed reading this book from the beginning to the end, and finished it within a single day. It is a very informative story too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great art toy","review":"My 2 yr old daughter loves stamps and these are her favorite - they are great quality and the ink easily washes off hands and clothing.

Theres no lid, which means with kids, no chance of keeping all of the stamps together. The stamps are cute enough, quite small impressions, rougly half an inch. I gave them to my son and his cousins (ages 4, 3.5 and 2) and they played with them for one session and then were bored. we've already lost a few stampers, the ink pad is pretty much dried out and the kids say no when I ask them if they'd like to stamp again.

The brightness is outstanding. My living room was flooded with light to the point that I replaced 2 off the 60 watt bulbs to calm it down. So they are brighter than I expected. The only downside I can say is that the light produced is bright white, not a soft white or any tone like that. It kind of makes you feel very 'instutionalized'. I wish they could put a warm glow on these bulbs but maybe that is a technical challenge and that's why I give 4 instead of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever Free","review":"This item fell apart before I even got to use it.

I could not glean any useful information from either book and would not recommend them to anyone that I know.

If you are looking for a good, easy to read surival book for wilderness survival I would recommend this book. If you are looking for disaster/urban survival i would recommend \\"when all hell breaks loose\\". Both books are superb and I would recommend both without a doubt, but I would recommend reading them in sequence, \\"98.6 degrees first\\", then \\"when all hell breaks loose\\" if you get both.

Some of it looks like it was a cut and past job from other books. Redundancy, bad information a waste of time and money there are better books out there, most military type books seem to be good.

Not only gives you what to pack in a survival kit but why you should have it and how to effectively use it. Must read for anyone going into the wilds even for a short day hike. I would recommend it to anyone. Information is centered on how to stay safe and alive for short periods of time. (The time it would take for a search and rescue operation to find you) Included are very valuable ideas to help rescuers find you faster. It does not go into long term primitive living skills such as food collection or how to build log cabins. It does give you all you need to know before going anywhere that has potential for getting lost or stranded and be able to get back out alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"full of useful info","review":"This book is easy to read and understand.

Kirk Fordice was NOT the governor of Arkansas but of Mississippi. Being from Mississippi myself, I take issue with this glaring error. What if I wrote a book saying that John Kerry or Ted Kennedy or Mike Dukakis were from Connecticut? How would Massachusetts readers like that? What this author has done is unfortunately a typical example of liberal elitism gone awry at our nation's premier institution of higher learning.

She has a great deal of background in this area, and reminds you of this background throughout the entire book. It is filled with stories of her travels, and her extremely one sided arguements. Although she makes some great points, the stories are overabundant, and the book is completely redundant. If you read the prelogue, and the first chapter of each of the three sections (Islam, Hindu, and Buddhism) then you will be able to answer any question someone asks you of the entire book, yes it is that redundant. If you enjoy reading the same thing in a book more than 15 times this is the book for you, but if you are on an actual search for knowlege and want to learn something without bias, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"This was one of the texts that was required for a world religions class that I am taking this semester.

However sore that is, to lose money over a horrible book, I'm glad others at my college won't be tortured by it.I would only recommend this book if someone wants//needs a lot of examples about various religions (Islam, Buddhism, etc.) blooming up in the US and the hardships they had to overcome/impressive places of worship."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Read","review":"While Marcia's writing was quite literate, this was actually one of the worst books I've yet read on the subject of ocean cruising.

This one is active, drawing a little power from the batteries, while the original is passive.Since the performance is the same, the main benefit to this antenna is cost: about $20 instead of $100 for the original Garmin antenna. So while it didn't meet its claims of superior performance in my old GPS, it performs on par with the original while costing significantly less which makes it a good value.P.S. the latest version of this antenna does NOT have removable magnets. I called Gilsson, they told me they changed the design of this antenna and no longer offer removable magnets, and they swapped mine for one of their last ones that did have removable magnets. Thus this antenna can no longer be used by pilots mounting it above the panel near the compass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pediatric pathology","review":"This book is somewhat improved from the previous edition, but the very poor illustration quality and many typographical errors detract greatly from its overall quality.

I invested my pennies and sent off to Amazon for a copy, thinking I would be stunned by the genius on display. Having listened to the disc about three times, I am sorry to say I really don't like it. I don't mean to insult them, I know they have legions of fans, but the production sounds messy, the songs aren't melodic or distinctive, and the whole thing isn't to my taste at all. What they do have going for them is energy, and apparently they put on darn good live show.

How about the really tough questions? Like infidelity? Or financial stress? Or substance addiction? Or major health issues? These are all real-life problems that couples struggle with - not just deciding which social events to attend (a topic the writers discuss at length).Maybe the book was just meant to be a sweet romp through a picture-perfect marriage.

Found it to be tasty, fresh as can be and very pleasant. Not only is it pleasant tasting it is packed with every vitamin and mineral known to mankind and many 100% of the RDA. The candy bar doesn't have artificial sweeteners that can be dangerous (almost went blind on aspartame and sucrolose is no solution)The candy, again is very tasty and fresh with only 290 calories for a bar, twice as big as most candy bars with only 50 fat calories.

They label them \\"Natural\\" which leads people to believe they are getting a healthier product - which isn't always the case.Thats the case with most of Tom's products. This toothpaste for example only has the natural label because it doesn't contain artificial sweeteners and color.Be advised, this toothpaste contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate, a known irritant and carcinogen. Something that every single other natural toothpaste won't have in it.

The router works great with my PPPoE connection from AT&T DSL; I have it setup to login over PPPoE instead of doing that at the modem. I'm using the router's dynamic DNS registration feature, so whenever the IP address changes I can still find my webcam. Coverage & strength of the wireless is great. Have only tried b/g so far, have not tried draft-n.

What it explains is not detailed enough to do you much good.Just say no to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order","review":"My biggest complaint with this book is that functions are listed in categories instead of alphabetical. The one thing I love about the Programming Perl book is I can flip right to the page I want and see the syntax, examples, etc. of a function. With this book here I am spending 5 minutes trying to find the entry for the function. By that time I could have gone to php.net and found the info there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even helpful as a reference","review":"The book is simply a listing of commands, organised by the same categories as the on-line manual, but missing an index and also missing the explanations and exmaples of the on-line manual. So unless you know in which category to find a command, you might spend ages to find its reference. Even if you do find the reference, the information is so brief that it is useless. If you've used the command a few times before, you'll know already (even if you have a lousy memory) the things described. If you haven't used it before, what you find is not enough to know how to use it. Rasmus, I thank you for inventing PHP, but I consider this book [not worth the money]."},{"rating":"1","title":"List of functions, but wheres the beef?","review":"Like many others are saying about this book it has two major flaws, the first is that it lacks an index, while it does have a table of contents, if you need to look up a specific command you can't. The second, and more important, problem is that this book doesn't describe the functions in a usable fashion. In fact the printing of the function is sometimes longer than the description itself, they rarely go beyond 5 words. While some functions do not need a lengthy explanation, others do. This book isn't all bad, earlier on it does explain (in full sentences/paragraphs, wow!) about form handling, database integration, variables, bolean, and the basics like while/do and if/then. Like every other O'Reilly pocket reference, these mini books are only good as a reference, not as a sole learning tool so if you purchase this book, I sure hope you bought a full sized PHP book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"What went wrong? I have many of the O'Reilly pocket references and I bought this one on the assumption it would measure up to the others. It doesn't.Starts out promising but once it reaches page 34 the remainder is unorganize junk with no examples, no hint of what you would use it for.Shame on O'Reilly for putting this out under their name; they have done their faithful customers who buy on their name's reputation a disservice.You need a no stars category for this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Don't buy this book; you won't use it. The function explanations are rarely more than a sentence, and worst of all they are many times self-referential.\\"string urlencode(string str) - URL-ecodes a string.\\" The function name makes that clear, but what does that mean, if you don't already know? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of referring to a book for clarification?\\"array pathinfo(string path) - Returns information about a certain string.\\" Does that description clarify anything beyond the function name?They should have trimmed out more functions and included more information about the most important ones. Sadly, this is also the book used in Dreamweaver MX 2004 for online help, which is frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is O'Reilly still offering this?","review":"I just bought this and I guess I should have been more diligent at looking at the description. Seeing 2nd edition I was thinking this covered PHP 5, but it was last released in 2002 and it now covers PHP 4. Book is somewhat useful I guess but why are they still asking $10 for such an out dated book, especially a tech book whose active shelf lives rarely last more than three or four years.Publisher really needs to get this updated to at least cover PHP 5. Of course by the time they release it PHP 6 will probably be the norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really worth it","review":"it seems like a handy thing and all but if you have an internet connection open when you code (presumably, since you're doing web development), the php.net documentation is much more helpful... not sure why anybody would use this. not even sure why i really bought this. i guess it looks good with all of the other little o'reilly guides that i own but it really was a waste of 5 dollars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless","review":"This book will fit in your pocket. That's about the best thing that can be said for it. It lacks an index, and the long lists of functions are listed without any meaningful description, nor are the parameters to these functions described in any detail. To make matters worse, the layout and typography makes it hard to find what little information there is. Save your money and buy a more complete reference and hope somebody comes out with a PHP quick reference that's actually useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"He may have written PHP, but...","review":"...if this is the best technical writing he can do, I understand why people complain of a lack of PHP documentation. This book is 90-some percent a list of PHP functions and their input and output types. However, it fails to give indication of what any function does, what the input means to the function, or what the output means to you. The rest of the book is a very basic PHP overview which states about twice a page that if you want any real information you need to visit the Web site. I can still see a use for this book, despite its utter lack of information: if you already use PHP and you know programming in general and you have a good idea of what kind of function you need but have no idea what it's named in PHP and don't want to spend hours on end trudging through the online manual, you can use the book to flip through function names 'til you find one that looks like it may be what you want, then search for that function online and see if it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"If you want to learn PHP, there are other books on Amazon that actually teach it. If you want a good reference, php.net is the best place to go because it's up to date and each function reference includes user/developer comments. PHP changes so often that this book was probably outdated as soon as it was published. On top of that, it's really just a list, with no index. Although I'm a big fan of these O'Reilly pocket books, this one was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date & needing improvement","review":"O'Reilly must sell a ton of these. Why not get a new author willing to do a good job of updating and improving. We all owe Lerdorf a lot for starting PHP in the first place. Having said that, O'Reilly needs to get an author who can update this and make it a useful reference. PHP is now on version 5.2 and this book is on version 4. It is nearly useless. I try to use this book from time to time, but never seem to find the information I need. Ie: Each function in the reference section needs at least two sentences of explanation, not a half sentence.PHP needs a couple of good current reference books. Where are they?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, don't be fooled by the famous names on the cover","review":"This book is a rip-off. Only 35 pages of actual writing which are more of an introuduction to PHP rather than a dense, terse reference to aid the memory. In other words, it's equivalent value of Chapter One of any beginner's PHP book. The rest of it is just an alphabetical listing of the PHP functions with a 5-10 word description that doesn't add much to the function name. So disappointing especially since other items in the series like the Python one and the SQL one. Also, it does not covers PHP 4, but PHP 5 has been the standard for several years."},{"rating":"1","title":"It worth's nothing without an index!","review":"If I knew it has no index (except from chapter 1) I wouldn't buy it for my Kindle!For me, it was supposed to be a reference and cannot be so as long as there is no index on it.I wish O'Reilly or Amazon will provide a solution for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for young readers (and adults)","review":"It has been years now since I read the Graveyard School series to my kids.

DONT BUY THIS YOUR WASTING YOUR MONEY INSTEAD BUY THE WAR DISC FROM ICE CUBE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong guy, wrong beats","review":"This is my first Snoop Dogg album, so I really don't know what he sounded like before No Limit. However, something's just not right on this album. One of the major problem are the beats. You can't really bang your head to it. Also, the lyrics are kind of strange too. Snoop's lyrics almost sounded like Silkk the Shocker. This is a very dissapointing album(again) from No Limit. The track \\"20 dollars to my name\\" is one of my favorites. It does have a good beat and better than the other songs. Also\\"Still a G thang\\" a snoop solo, can become a classic. 2 good songs for 14 bucks is painful for a rapper as talented as Snoop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a crutch","review":"Here's the bottom line, Snoop can still bust on the mic, but No Limit's Beats By the Pound can't find the beats to match up with his g-style, playalistic flow. Please Snoop, call Dre, beg him to hook you up with some sounds, and sell 1 million again."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't hang with master p and his gounz","review":"this album is a total f*** up what a shame he is not even trying,damm....feel sorry for those who wasted their money,hahahaha"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoop is better than this.","review":"Positives: I'm hard pressed to find positive things to say about this record. Snoop is one of the greatest and Doggystyle proved he can make premium rap music.Negatives: This album proved Snoop is also not afraid to fall flat on his face. I don't know where to begin on this album. Any tracks that aren't \\"No Limitized\\" are just too soft. Snoop has that kind of soft flow but tracks like \\"Show Me Love\\" & \\"Doggz Gonna Get Ya\\" are not his patented gangster rap norm. I don't know how I managed to stick with Snoop after this attempt. Every other record Snoop has ever and will make is better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhere between pretty good and very good","review":"One of no limit's best after C-Murder's life or death.It is true that the beats do not blend with Snoop's voice,but still there are certain tracks on this CD that alone make this a classic.To name a few,Slow Down feat. Mia X,Woof feat.Fiend and Mystikal,and especially See ya when I get there feat.C-Murder and Mystilal.Bout it and Rowdy feat. Master P is typical No Limit material.People who are not fond of no limit will probably not like this album,but those who are fans will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Snoop Dog thinking signing with NO LIMIT?","review":"Man, I'm sorry, but this album was a HUGE disappointment. I liked much of Snoop's earlier work, but after he came out with this album and \\"Topp Dog,\\" his second No Limit album, it ruined his career. It left me with only one belief: Snoop Dogg is falling off. He's lost his 'bounce to the ounce' and funky rhythm that he once had. I'm sorry, as much as it pains me to hate on Snoop Dogg, I have no choice...he didn't show me nothing on this album besides the fact that he's losing his edge in the world of hip-hop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep this sh*t up and SnOop wont b worTh a pennY!!!!!!!!","review":"look main, i'm from the dirty south(deep dirty south-New Orleans, Houston, etc.) so u know i b'z down wit NO LIMIT. but on the forealla, this is the most wickkity-wack bullsh*t sNoop doGg haz ever released. if i could take away thaT 1 star i gave this CD i would wit da quickness. this alBum iz so bad it does'nt deserve a tiP of a sTar. the production iz str8 boo-boo. and sNoOp somehow, someway managed 2 fu*k up all his cLasIc hits like \\"gin & juice\\" \\"still a g thaNg\\". if i wuz Dr. dRe i would'nt wAnna work wit SnOop's dumb azz no moe. this cd iz str8 GARBAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i'm glad i didnT buy this cd and if u dId, i guess snOOp ran his so-call \\"GAME\\" on u."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to hear from the DOG!","review":"I'm so glad snoop finally decided to drop some fat tracks.

PLEASE!!!!!!!!!","review":"This has got to be the weakest production I have heard Snoop do in my life. I was so disappointed in the entire cd that I gave it away. All you NO LIMIT fans out there can keep this one to yourselves. By the way, why does Master P sound like Scarface on one track and Tupac on another.

He use to have the fresh 213 style we all found tizzite with strong lyrics and even stronger beats from the legendary Dr. Dre. But now he's a no limit soldier with limited lyrical impact with no bite and no bark. The only tight track on the lp is \\"Gangsta Gansta\\". Of course, it was produced by Dre himself. Go back to Dre and you DPG N-ggaz and find yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"da bomb","review":"the new snoop dogg cd is da bomb and is the best 1 yet.hooking up with and the no limit soldiers has been the best thing yet since death row records and 2 pac and dre.dont forget his upcoming cd \\"Top Dogg\\" in 1999. -5 stars,-brilliant release since the doggfather!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it one star, but I love Snoop, so it gets two.","review":"I must be honest, I love Snoop, I mean Doggystyle was a classic. Also, I disagree with what people say about The Doggfather because it had those playful, bouncy vibes to it. I really loved The Doggfather. But this album? Snoop comes well on it and everything, but the production is not that of Doggystyle, or his very best album, Smokefest 1996, which had DPG guest appearances. Snoop has some good songs, like \\"Still A 'G' Thang\\", which has a good G-Funk beat, \\"Hoes, Money and Clout\\", the very best one, that was produced by Daz Dillinger and Soopafly, and \\"Payin\\", which featured Big Pimpin'. Those tracks all have a DPG feel to them, but the rest is not good at all. \\"Gin and Juice II\\" is nowhere near as good as the one from Doggystyle. Snoop must get back with Daz and Dre, he's great with them both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoop's worst CD by a mile","review":"---------- was one of the greatest albums in hip-hop history, and Tha Doggfather did not live up to its very high standards. Da Game Is To Be Sold... was a bad mistake. There are about 5 good tracks. My favourite is \\"Still A G Thang\\". However, No Limit fans may appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd was c**p","review":"This cd is possibly one of the worst cd's of all time. It is not on Doggystyle or Tha Doggfather's level. Where is Tha Dogg Pound? Snoop claims DPG, but the only song that they make their presence felt is Hoes, Money, and Clout, which is the only song I can listen to because all the other songs s**k. This cd proves that No Limit is c**p. Compare this to Top Dogg. That cd was tight because Snoop worked with other producers like Dre, Ant Banks, and DJ Quick, and he was allowed to work with artists like Xzibit, Warren G, Nate Dogg, and Sticky Fingaz. If u like REAL rap, do not pick up this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth having","review":"This cd was pretty cool. If you like no limit, than you should definately buy this cd. tracks 3, and 13 are reason enough to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion","review":"I have owned this cd for a while now and I am still enjoying it. Snoop's lyrics in this album are like they were never before when he was with Death Row Records. This whole new NoLimitRecords deal for him is really making an improvement. He stated quote in an interview with Mtv that \\"It is more like a family than just a record company\\". In my opinion he is right. Already planning and working on another album \\"Top Dogg\\", Snoop is really getting at this NoLimit deal. Like the colnel, Master P once said,\\"There ain't no limit to what we can do\\" this especially seems to be what Snoop's attitude is."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"CHOKE OFF DA ROPE, DOGGY GOING BROKE.\\"","review":"CLEARLY A SHINING STAR AMONGST A LEGION OF ONE HIT WONDERS,OL' BOY SNOOP HAS SIGNED HIS OWN DEATH CERTIFICATE.THE SOON PASSING FAD OF THE NO LIMIT SOLDIERS HAS DRAWN SNOOP TO ITS INNER CIRCLE.ONCE A MASTERMIND OF RHYMES THAT WE'D NEVER FORGET,THA DOGG IS DIGGING UP BONES HE SOON WILL REGRET.IF NOT FOR CHARLIE WILSON BEING EVER SO GOOD TO THE GAME,ONE STAR WOULD BE ALL THIS REVIEW WOULD CLAIM!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is TIGHT!!!","review":"This recoerd is Snoop's best yet.The best career move he has ever made was switching to NO LIMIT Records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you buy this here me out.","review":"Snoop Doggy Dogg is a talented rapper,but, he is no longer in touch with the street.

They are a promising young band with excellent songs. Loaded is undeniably great and 25 years too late isnt as good as Loaded but manages too poke fun at new [bands] like Sum 41. Satelites is an epic Guitar track which is unlike any other Rev's song. It is the less punk side to them and shows how versatile their music is.

Corinne Bailey has a sweet breathy schoolgirl voice in places (Like a Star) and her range goes from vulnerable to powerfully sexy (Breathless).You will be in love from the first note and lilt in her voice. Sweetly sexy and dreamy with a sigh of comfort and unique poetic lyrics, every track is stunning and leaves you a little high. Get out the expensive headphones for this sensual neo-soul dream! I love the way she sings \\"Choux Pastry Heart.\\"\\"I get so breathless, when you call my name,I've often wondered, do you feel the same?There's a chemistry, energy, a synchronicityWhen we're all alone,\\"~Breathless~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I first heard of Corinne Bailey Rae on SNL last week, I just happened to change the channel just as she was beginning her song.

She will for sure be collecting Grammy's."},{"rating":"2","title":"No shortage of reviews","review":"But I'll add my 5 stars anyway. This album deserves them all. My wife kept telling me she wanted to get this new CD from an English lady she'd heard. She finally got it and the next time we got in the car she said \\"You've got to hear this.\\" I just rolled my eyes. I'm a grey beard, and although I like lots of different music, there's precious little mainstream new music that interests me. But I instantly fell in love with Rae's. Track after track, just plain great music. There's no filler on this CD. Every song makes you glad you have her CD.Note: If you order this CD, make sure you buy the full album with all the songs, and not the CD that has just one or two songs.Favorite tracks:1.

She has a voice and style similar to Norah Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatiful, soft, unique","review":"Corrine has a very fresh, distinct voice.

What a talented young lady. When I think of Corinne Bailey Rae, she defines CLASSEY. Her performance in person speaks volumes. We didn't have the best seats in the house, however, if she comes around again, we will be sure to see her. BUY THIS CD, you will really enjoy it. She is like a breath of fresh air to the music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"New favorite","review":"I awoke to \\"Put your records on\\" on the clock radio in London and couldn't get it out of my head. I loved it at once, and as soon as I got back to the states I started trying to figure out what the song was. Had to go to the BBC website and find it on their playlist. Thank goodness they had it listed or I would have gone mad trying to find it -- it's a great song, a new classic, and every other song on this CD is just as good. This is my new drive-with-the-sunroof-open, clean-the-house-with-stereo-at-full-blast, remember-the-lovely-nights-we-had-in-London CD that I'll play over and over and over.

Track 3 is a radio hit, and so lyrical. Check out the chorus at :50. Great groove, great harmonies.A CD full of excellent, original songs. Great vocals, great arrangments, great harmonies. Driving grooves.\\"Till it Happens to You\\" is another notable track (4). Nice vocals and harmonies, jazz voicings on the elec. piano. \\"Breathless\\" is also excellent. \\"I'd Like To\\" (track 9) is pure summer fun.The group is excellent live. In 2006 they toured with a full band - drums/bass/guitar/keyboards/2 backup singers + Corine. And in a small venue. A must see.-L."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOM!","review":"I could listen to this CD over and over. Corinne Bailey Rae allows me to relax in this fast-paced world.

She is beautiful, poised, graceful, and talented. I listened to her CD this morning on the way to work, and I am impressed! While not a vocal acrobat or powerhouse, she has impeccable phrasing. She not only sings these songs, she owns them. My commute was definitely enjoyable this morning.I have a lot of difficulty with other reviewers' insistence to compare her to Nelly Furtado. They may sing in approximately the same range, but their styles are totally different.Ms. Rae, I will see you at the Grammies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I am thoroughly pleased with this CD. When I heard the first track I thought I was listening to Erykah Badu for a second. Corinne has a beautiful voice. I recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Breath of Fresh Air!","review":"This self tilted album that Corinne Bailey put together is outstanding! With the lyrics so real and convincing I actually believed those things she was singing about were actually about her & people & life! I especially love \\"Choux Pastry Heart\\". It's about her falling in love. All those other singers with fake stories in their songs are just like \\"deasel fumes\\" (metaphoriclly of course!) but this is a breath of clean fresh air.... No dirty launguage. It's just plain music with a contemporary pop vocal. Great instrumentals too! Bottom line is I highly reccomend this item! GREAT CD!!!!!! I'll give Corinne Bailey her chops. PLEASE GO OUT AND JUST BUY THE CD!

She deserves more exposure","review":"The first time I heard Corinne Bailey Rae sing, I was surfing the channels and I stumbled upon her video \\"Like a Star\\" and her raw singing immediately reminded me of Sade. I was determined to purchase her CD. Unlike most new artists with only a couple of hits on their CD, Corinne's CD is the bomb from beginning to end. The words of her songs would touch anyone's heart no matter who you are or what you're going thru. There's only 1 or 2 songs out of the 11 that Im not too crazy about, but overall it's a great listen and it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I received this product quicker than anticipated.

Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"corinne bailey rae","review":"Absolutley enchanting voice. Well crafted lyrics and music. It's sometimes difficult to compare music of other artists, but I respectfully would say it's almost like a cross between Sade & Norah Jones only a little more up beat,happier and sweeter. the music is an Aural massage. Real music lovers will appreciate this artist. It's too bad the radio station programmers won't put it into rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Till it Happens to You","review":"Corinne Bailey Rae's self-titled cd is perfect to listen to after a tiring day to help you relax or if you are in the mood for a little smooth jazz. The first four tracks of her cd are my favorites and overall I greatly enjoy this first debut by Corinne Bailey Rae, however I must admit that after Track number 5 \\"Trouble Sleeping\\" I find that all the rest sound pretty much all the same. The beats all seem to run together and there is no distinction between them. But overall, it is a really good cd and I hope to hear more from this talented singer, but I hope that on her next cd maybe she'll spice it up a bit more. So based on this I can only give this cd three stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corinne Bailey Ray","review":"This is a great CD. Reminds me of Norah Jones. Love to hear Corinne sing.

So, GO PUT YOUR RECORDS ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply ...wonderful","review":"To be blunt - there is not an \\"average\\" track on this CD.

I really like her voice and I think she has great potential, but I just think alot of the music is empty and cheesy. I don't feel alot of depth in the music or her voice on most tracks. Maybe she just needs to mature a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grown Folks Music","review":"I don't know how anyone could compare her to Nelly Furtado. I don't see it. Bailey, combines folk, jazz, and r&b and comes up with a wonderful CD. If you like good music you'll enjoy her work. This is music that dosen't need a elaborate music video, pirotecnique's at a concert, or undo hype in order for you to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put this record on, it's really good","review":"What a throaty but delicious voice young Corinne has. I heard her on late night TV recently and I was surprised that I really liked how she sang, not only that, I liked the songs she was singing too!I loved the song Put Your Records On, it was so charming and surreal and Trouble Sleeping was equally as good, not only that but both the videos were eye catching and very 1940s to 1950s to look at with bike rides in the country and visits to a basement jazz hall by a sultry looking Corinne who reminded me of a 21st century Nina Simone.All the songs on this Album are pretty good, Corinne has done very well for one so young, and I look forward to watching her mature, I just hope she doesn't become too full of herself, I think if she does, she will loose some of the sparkling charm which makes her a cut above other artists of a similar ilk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Lyrical and Sweet","review":"I LOVE this cd. Her Voice is amazing and so moving. She takes your mind off to a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, Sweet Voice","review":"Ms. Rae has a tiny little voice, that is a pleasure to listen to. Many have compared her to Billie Holiday, and I agree. Soulful, yes. Blues, of course. Oh yes and that ever present R&B.;Though the Grammy Awards snubbed her, hers is a voice that is worth listening to, and in the future only promises more delightful releases. She is and will be a force to be reconded with as she continues to produce more, music with her very unique sound. Give this young lady a very serious listen, I do not believe you will find disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"First love","review":"Well I must say I have truly been deprived from ms. corinne bailey rae.

I am very happy that I did. I love the entire CD. A very pleasant surprise. Highly recommend it for anyone who likes R&B soulful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corinne Bailey Rae","review":"This is a great album. If you purchased the single disc album you might want to reconsider purchasing the double, import CD. It contains two extra songs not included on the double, deluxe album: (\\"I Won't Let You Lie To Yourself\\" and \\"Enchantment (amp fiddler remix)\\"). The music is very soulful in an eclectic way. It differentiates itself from being classified as \\"Rhythm and Blues\\" or \\"Pop\\". She defines her unique style in her rendition of tunes originally recorded by Led Zeppelin (Since I've Been Loving You), Aretha Franklin (Daydreaming), and Bjork (Venus As A Boy). You will probably enjoy the entire album if you can vibe to the previously released singles, \\"Put Your Records On\\" and \\"Like a Star\\". Her vocals are hypnotically soothing to the ear and this album will be remembered as a classic. It will withstand the test of time because it can hold up to repeated play. I am satisfied with this purchase and I will continue to enjoy this album in future listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensual delight","review":"I heard this artist on Saturday Night Live and knew I had to get the album.

I was, figuratively, blown away by Rae's mesmerizing vocals and had to hear more from the young artist.I'm glad that I opted to buy the double CD over the original release because it offers the listener the chance to really appreciate Rae's diversity, as she tackles a variety of styles, from R & B to jazz to \\"torch\\" songs.Corinne Bailey Rae's voice is reminiscent of so many vocal stylists like Billie Holliday and current favorite Erykah Badu; However, she is painting her own place in the musical landscape and this double-CD - especially on the covers on disc 2 - is the perfect introduction to a singer that's destined for a long career in music."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fan","review":"One of my friends left Corinne's self-title album in my car a month ago and I haven't stopped listening to it everytime I drive anywhere.

I tried listening to see if they would grow on me but nothing came.."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit of Macy Gray,Norah Jones which =Boring","review":"Corinne Bailey Rae vocally doesn't do much for me. the Off singing style in the vein of Erika Badu or Macy Gray with a pinch of Norah Jones with a smoothed out vibe of India Arie&Alcia Keys doesn't hold my attention fully. some of the material is cool in places,but she ain't worth all the hype she is getting. now She is a Fine Foxxy Mama on the real,but Musically i gotta keep that Singing on Mute. every other year or so there is a Artist like Rae that has the same presentation&vibe.nothing new at all. I just ain't into the off singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed....","review":"This performer should never again be mentioned in the same breath as Billie Holiday. I was very disappointed with this CD - \\"Put Your Records On\\" is the only song worth playing. The rest of the tracks are a boring blur, and frankly, her voice is not good enough for the ballads. Too bad. The only redeeming quality to this experience is that I didn't pay full price for the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been bamboozled, hoodwinked, and led astray!!!!!","review":"I bought this CD because everyone was raving about how good it was and how Corinne was so talented. I was truly disappointed. She definitely has a different vocal sound but she sounds like she's just learning how to sing. The music sounds good, however, her voice is soooo very annoying. I'd hate to hear her in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"What??????","review":"I haven't recieved the CD yet !!! I ordered it at the first part of January and I haven't seen anything yet.

Corinne Bailey Rae fans will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Norah Jones, but not as good as Beyonce","review":"I'll say this much: this gal is more interesting than Norah Jones, whose last 2 CDs are among the WORST albums of all time. But Corinne is not as good as Beyonce. For one, Beyonce can dance, sing, and perform much much much much much much much much much much much much better than Corinne, who has no charisma, energy, or spunk. But I'd rather take this over anything by that overrated jezebel Norah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented","review":"Her voice is a sweet twist of Nelly Furtado and Billie Holiday. You've gotta see this girl perform live, it's amazing how natural and comfortable she looks. Her lyrics are endearing and she uses thoughtful comparisons, \\"like oil in my hands\\" and \\"blue as the sky, sombre and lonely\\". Standout tracks: 'Til it Happens to You, Choux Pastry Heart, and Put Your Records On. Her songs touch on acoustic, blues, pop, and folk with gorgeous melodies and dulcet high notes. Tender looks, a posh British accent, and angelic voice, I can see this girl going places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Refreshing","review":"Very refreshing, if for not reason other than it passes my new conditional criteria - not rap! Hey, I started listening to rap with Grand Master Mel and the Furious Five - Sugar Hill Gang stuff and LOVED it but that was maybe 18 years ago. Since then, music lovers have been robbed and raped by a bunch of shXt. She kinda reminds me of Jazzyfatnasty (with a touch of Erica Badu). Soulful gal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro Modern Vibe","review":"I love this CD! It's a mix of Billie Holiday, Macy Gray, Sade and Fiona Apple. Love love love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Real Musican and Singer","review":"I just discovered Corinne Bailey Rae and I was really missing out. If she comes to Tampa for a concert I'm going this is my type of music. She has a truely unique style, that nobody should compare her with anyone. Mellow, soulful, and don't forget lyrics that have meaning. You won't regret getting this CD. I enjoyed every song! Haven't experienced this since Alicia Keys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album wasn't Grammy-nominated for nothing","review":"I first found out about Corinne Bailey Rae last year when she was spotlighted as a VH1 You Oughta Know artist. While I jumped onto her bandwagon immediately afterwards, somehow I never got around to listening to her full-length self-titled album until just recently. But I'm sure glad I did.By now, I'm sure everyone's familiar with the singles \\"Put Your Records On\\", \\"Like a Star\\" and \\"I'd Like to\\", but there are even more great songs to be found. \\"Call Me When You Get This\\" is a funky change from her usual fare, and \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Breathless\\" are beautiful in their own right. And although I'm not sure what \\"Choux Pastry Heart\\" means, it's also a highlight.In fact, every song on here is a highlight. I know it's been said a few time before, but when it comes to Corinne Bailey Rae, do what her debut single instructs and put her records on.Anthony Rupert"},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the year!","review":"I hate to compare, but she sounds ole skool like Phoebe Snow or even Carly Simon. The most beautiful voice. I first heard about her when I was in Germany this summer and her picture was blasted all over. Then a friend sent me a copy that I received on the first day back and I've been blown away ever since. She's not heard much on radio because it's hard to categorize her (a good thing.) The voice and the lyrics are haunting on \\"Like A Star,\\" \\"Enchantment\\" and \\"Till It Happens to You\\" and \\"Breathless.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"That says it all. I play disc 1 on repeat, random repeat, anything just so I can hear her voice. It's like listening to warm syrup; sweet, comforting, yet complex and interesting. Lyrics are thought-provoking and comforting. Disc 2 is ok, but could just as well have been left out. Seems like it was an early recording when her voice wasn't well-developed. Disc 1 rates an 11 on a 1-10 scale; disc 2 rates a 5, the only thing keeping this review from being a five-star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Jazz Bubbles","review":"I had no idea who Corinne Bailey Rae was until I stumbled upon one of those \\"free\\" concerts on Pay Per View. I could not change the channel. Not only is she just pretty to look at she has a voice that is just as sweet. Her songs have depth but her voice and simple arrangements keep everything breezy. Somewhat deceptive as she sings of heartache and longing. She is really a Jill Scott meets Alicia Keys. I enjoy listening to the CD when its more alternative, jazz lite and not so pop as in the track Breathless. Its another debut where the artist's talent is evident but their distinct voice has yet to be found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"Great music from a refreshing voice. If you like Norah Jones or Alicia Keyes, you will love Corinne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up and coming...","review":"I think we'll be seeing and hearing more about this artist. She has an absolutely beautiful voice, purse and natural, and soulful music and lyrics. Go to her website and you can hear a clip of \\"Go Put Your Records On.\\" This is the song that got me hooked. Definitely worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice change of pace.","review":"FINALLY a cd with someone singing and you can actually understand what they're talking about! The \\"Star Searching\\" of the music business has been its downfall, screeching and riffing your way through every single song is not singing, neither is shaking your booty so much that you have to lip synch your way through every live performance. A real singer can put a mike in the middle of the stage, stand in the spotlight and people will pay attention, few people can do that, Luthor Vandross, Patty Labelle, Streisand and Sinatra to name a few were and are capable. The ones that need the smoke and mirrors to distract from the fact that they can't are too many to mention (i.e. a certain OVEREXPOSED singer from a now defunct girl band).Good lyrics, a pleasing voice and great delivery, perfect for those times when you just want to kick your feet up and relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful.","review":"Easy listening.Delicate, soothing, soulful voice.Beautiful lyrics and melodies.Corinne Bailey Rae is talented.She is going to be around for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Lots of times when I get a new CD I have to listen to it a few times before I begin to appreciate it. This CD had me hooked from the first note. It is one of the best I have ever bought. The lyrics sometimes are a bit sophomoric, but the melodies are addictive, and I love the fact that she is the writer or co-writer of all of the somgs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't play on a PC or iPod","review":"My wife purchased this CD expecting to use it on her PC to put it on her iPod and we were dismayed to discover that the copy protection prevented us from using the disk. There was nothing on the packaging to indicate the presence of DRM mechanisms that would prevent this standard and reasonable use of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to listen to","review":"This mellifluous (but glib) collection is completely narcissistic. It creates a mood ideal for indulging one's narcissism. Needless to say, we all need to do this from time to time. If you want music to help you feel, here's one that works. If you can feel something on your own, get something else. This one won't make you uncomfortable by urging you to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"inventive","review":"A really enjoyable collection of songs by a fresh and inspired singer who brings a breath of fresh air to the world of pop. Pay special attention to the unique selection of covers. This collection is so cool because there are such great originals and covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look out for this artist!","review":"Good album. She is definitely an artist. I mean she started her album with \\"Like a Star\\". Anybody else would have opened with \\"Put Your Records On\\". When she starts singing \\"Like a Star\\" I was like, \\"Okay...LOL\\" ...But by time she got to \\"I don't argue like this, with anyone but you...we do it all the time\\" I was totally captured. Beautiful song! Her songs have more mood than melody to me, but that's not a bad thing. You could play it in the background and then your ears get caught in a beautiful arrangement like I was with \\"Like a Star\\". Anyway this album would make a good gift for lovers of neo-soul, smooth R&B;, and lyrical pop.Oh and also check out Jill Scott's new album \\"Jill Scott Collaborations\\" (best soul/R&B; album of the year so far)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Smooth","review":"Listening to Corinne is like sipping on a warm cup of chamomile tea. This songbird has a voice and demeanor that is out of this world. Her words are like poems (words to the songs are included with the cd). I love her two most popular songs right now. \\"Put your Records on\\" is a song for the girl that feels like she doesn't fit in anywhere. She's telling her to just be herself and don't care what others say. Her other song, and my favorite, is \\"Like a Star\\". This is the most beautiful love song that I've ever heard. Buy this cd. This is the best cd for those days when you've had a hard day at work and just want to come home, drink a glass of wine, and relax. Great cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I bought this CD for just a few good songs I had heard from her on the radio, but the other songs on the CD are GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly great soulful stuff but with a few so-so items","review":"Corinne shows great promise as a composer & vocalist.

This one is worthless. It appears to be a hastily written collection of his personal stories which may or may not be applicable to you.

I purchased these nipples yesterday for my son who is less than two weeks old. The vented nipple is a great idea, in theory. This evening and into the morning hours we found that these nipples tended to gag him due to the inappropriate fast flow of the nipple. His reaction was to gasp for a breath then cry just after removing the nipple from his mouth. These nipples flow twice as fast as any we have currently. What is Gerber trying to do, drown infants here? Why would these be labeled as a 0-6M slow flow? They are obviously not. I have to say that based on this experience I will think twice about purchasing any further Gerber products, and the nipples will be going back to the store in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent nipples","review":"My babies were 9 months and I still was using the medium flow nipples, so I decided to replace them with fast flow nipples and they're excellent, my babies can drink they bottles faster now and they didn't have any kind of problems with this change.

The guitars are both incredibly heavy and melodic with no shortages of solos which are probably the best i've ever heard. same with the drumming. theres enough blast beats to cave in your head by the end of the cd.it also seems like there is constant double bass pedal. yet the bass still goes un noticed.the tracks that stood out to me were dechristianize and devoured elysium.if you consider yourself a death metal head, or hardcore person, this cd is for you. no key boards. no females. no bitchy whining about drug addictions or child abuse, just face impaling satanic metal.I hate fred durst #1 fan. he doesn't know what real metal is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satanic and dark","review":"Vital remains is a band that recently discovered.

Certainly no worries that it wont hold someone if they are heavy. I only found a few downfalls, but nothing critical. The storage of the chair is a little clumsy, it only folds in 1/2, so it does take some good organizing to fit it in your trunk or to fit it in amongst your tailgating items. The padded arm rests are nice also, but they do make it a bit difficult to sit in the chair at first because it tugs at the side of your clothes (rubber padding on cotton pants doesn't slide all that well).

Certainly among the greatest concept albums of all time, the listener will laugh out loud and be horribly offended repeatedly within a single (and almost any) track.

For example, having worked through Book I and half way into book II, i turned to an original greek text and suprisingly i was able to make sense of it. I reccommend that one gets the workbook component so that one can look up their answers in the answer key, as the book alone does not contain answer keys. This might seem like a problem, but once I worked my way through the Book I workbook (which has an answer key) i became confident enough with greek so that i did not need the workbook with this second book in the series. i also recommend \\"All the Greek Verbs\\" or \\"Tutti Verbi Greci\\"; this book will help with parsing verbs. Obviously memorizing the stems for each verb in each of its voices and moods would be the best, but this is an arduous task...\\"All the Greek Verbs\\" helps with those tricky verbs. My last word of advice is to MEMORIZE THE VOCABULARY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly educational and enjoyable","review":"This book made learning Ancient Greek attainable! It includes a smattering of various exercises to strengthen one's understanding of the language (including English to Greek sentences, stories in Greek, vocabulary exercises, sentences in Greek that illustrate new grammar concepts and more!). It also made the stories in Greek progressively more complicated, but not enough to confuse students. New grammar is introduced gradually and the vocab presented is used frequently in \\"everyday\\" conversation. Also included with this book are phrases from ancient authors and even Bible verses (for those students interested in Coinae Greek).After one semester of using this book, I am able to sit down and understand some of the Bible and other ancient authors! This book is definitely the best way to gain a solid foundation in Ancient Greek!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect introduction to Attic Greek.","review":"Without overwhelming the beginner, this book provides an excellent format in which the language is gradually explained. The novice will easily be able to begin reading the texts, and with careful study will quickly progress to the more difficult text level at the end of the book. This is the perfect text for an individual who is confident in a self-taught language setting. If this text is used in conjunction with volume II, one will be able to comprehend simple classical texts with the aide of a lexicon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"The book has many texts in ancient Greek, including old versions of the New Testament.

The Greek is still given out piecemeal and chopped up, as in Book 1, and as there, it still makes more confusing a language which is already complicated enough. The appendix and charts here are no more helpful here than they were in Book 1, and again there is too much emphasis on illustrations and \\"relevance\\" over clarity and fullness of explanation. This book is an abysmal failure, and damages the poor students upon whom it is inflicted (amongst whom I was one). I despise it and cannot tell against it strongly enough. What a shame I cannot give it zero stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: This book will self-destruct your intelligence","review":"Aside from the grossly historically inacurate translations, the grammer is introduced backwards. THe book gives you a translation with something new and expects you to guess the rule for the rest of that section. After the translation is done, then the new grammer is introduced. I'm taking Greek I in college right now and every body in the class is failing because the book is incomprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demeaning and Confusion","review":"This is my first year of ancient Greek, and though I can't say it has been deplorable, it certainly has been less than interesting. This is due in no small part to our text, Athenaze. I and my classmates find the stories about Dicaeopolis and his family, although humorous, puerile and insulting. The exercises are repetitive to the point of being monotonous, and the layout of the grammar notes leaves something to be desired. Seeing as I have nothing to compare this book to, it might be the best book for Ancient Greek, but I and the Classics department head (who is not teaching the course) agrees with me when I say I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for classroom use","review":"After reading previous reviews, I would like to point out the fact that an excellent instructor makes this book and its grammar descriptions sufficient. After going through both books in two semesters I was ready to read Biblical texts (with the aid of a dictionary because the vocabulary is very different from Attic) and I could read unaltered excerpts from the classics. Its explanations are a bit sparse, but that's where a good instructor comes in.

ALthough some might argue that its silly passages and bizzare teaching style draws in a readers attention and makes greek more interesting, I say its over 230 pages of badly organized text. Its so completely out of order that I almost went insane trying to put it together, I mean WHO puts the 2nd aorist before the first? And WHO teaches words in chapter one that you don't learn to decline untill chapter 15? Its ridiculous! Perhaps the authors don't know how to count or lost there common sense.

Our entire first year (and 1st semester of 2nd year) Greek class hated it. It's organized very poorly; e.g., all the principal parts of a verb are not presented at once, in a mistaken belief that it's easier to memorize them piecemeal. It isn't, it's very confusing. Also, the stories in each chapter are terrible, really uninspiring. At some point in the second volume they paraphrase a bit of Herodotus. It was so dull that I avoided Herodotus as long as I could. When finally confronted with the real thing, I was amazed at how great Herodotus was and appalled at Balme and Lawall's shoddy retelling. In short, this text book (both volumes of it) is great only if you want to discourage a student from studying Ancient Greek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok along with other books and a good tutor","review":"This book is good as long as you also buy Workbook I and another grammar book and have a tutor who can fix all the trick questions they ask. It is designed to not give you all the answers and force you to think (get frustrated) and then ask the teacher. If you're brilliant you can figure out some of their trick questions by looking in the back or a chapter or two ahead. There are no answers to any of the exercises, so if you're doing a self-study without a tutor good luck figuring out if you answered correctly.If you have the time to devote to it, get Workbook I (which does have the answers)and have a tutor to help explain the answers to the trick questions, and have a complementary and better grammar book you can refer to,then this is a really good book; but by itself- nada.Of course, you could also just buy the teacher's version and get every execise correct... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult, too early","review":"I am studying for Greek GCSE in England, and Athenaze II becomes very difficult after the relative simplicity of book I; around chapters 18/19, the grammar diverges from the syllabus and covers many irrelevant topics which may be of use to American students, but the UK edition is really still geared to the US course (it certainly isn't appropriate in large chunks of grammar and vocab for UK courses).Book I is extremely useful to those starting to learn ancient Greek, however book II is likely to provide quite a shock to those thinking it is of a similar difficulty to book I: it hikes up the level of comprehension and grammar needed very quickly and to the student's disadvantage. Many segments of grammar are far too complicated for the age range at which Athenaze II is aimed, and some are just totally unnecessary, and serve only to complicate the language.The difficulty of book II could quite possibly put students off continuing with their Greek courses."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a class by itself","review":"If you're taking a class in Attic Greek, the one to take is the one using Athenaze as a text. It's excellent, especially if you have a teacher. The problems arrise if you use it on your own -- it's not really accurate in pronunciation, and it doesn't explain all the uses of grammar when it introduces them. On the other hand, it's not as if anyone out there speaks Attic Greek as a native language, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eucharisto","review":"This book helped me more than I ever expected.

The lamp needed to be replaced about a year ago and since the TV is on for hours at a time it was no great expense to buy a new one. Now I have found out that the blue that has been creeping along the bottom of the screen is due to an optical block issue that Sony has been aware of for quite some time.

I still haven't finished it yet but I will someday...Bottom Line: Play if you want to run around with a lightsaber, be on the light/dark side, shoot/slice Bad guys/good guys (if our a dark jedi), and generally have a good time, then play this excellent game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment....","review":"Huh, probably most reviewers won't agree with me on this one, but I found this game extremely boring. I'm a Star Wars fan, so I can appreciate everything w/ a good story, decent visual, etc. I know this game is fairly old, but I still play old games (even ones from the early '90-s), so old graphics really don't disturb me that much. But the storyline should be MUCH better, that DF2's: I never felt any interest in the game, playing it was almost like playing Quake 3 Arena: pointless.Acting is almost horrible in this one - they should've gone with graphical cut scenes inseat of live actors: acting is actually so bad that it hurts. Most of the B movies have better acting than in this game.I'd say avoid this game at all costs, unless you're a really big Lucasarts/Star Wars fan. I got the game for a bargain price but still feel fairly dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"graphics rock, but story jumps","review":"now, this is a good game as far as gameplay, but you start out not knowing anything and have to improvize. most charachters have no distinguishable intro. you really have to improvize through the first 3 levels, but the the game heats up. you start dueling with lightsabers, and stormtroopers get into it. when you beat the game as a light jedi, it has an ending which leaves much to be desired. it is impossible to beat as a dark jedi."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"This game is the best that\`s out there for Windows 98.I\`m only 9 and I love it more than heck.This game is awsome because the lightsaber battles.The coolest Jedi to battle is Boc and Gorc and Pic.This is a must buy for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An overlooked gem if there ever was one","review":"These are wonderful performances, and the clarity is astounding. It sounds as if I'm there at the recording session, sitting right alongside the pianist. In addition, these two concertos compliment each other quite nicely, just as the Schumann and Grieg make an excellent coupling on disc.Argerich, Van Cliburn and Horowitz deserve the many accolades for their mastery of Tchaikovsky's First, but I hope reviewers will also give this one a chance. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT .","review":"THIS IS DEFINTLY ONE OF MY FAVORITES. THE END CAME TO SOON I WANTED IT TO GO ON AND ON!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was one of Ms. Steel's better stories.","review":"The Ghost was a typical Danielle Steel story about a sensitive thoughtful male who had been hurt by an equally sensitive thoughtful female, who just happened to fall in love with someone more sensitive. I enjoyed it because everyone communicated and there were no long drawn out \\"I can't tell him/her my story yet.\\" I especially enjoyed Sarah's storyline, although I wish she'd had the opportunity to confront her husband. I thought Charlie and Francois's story was a little sketchy and needed more depth. Not bad though for Ms. Steel. Some of her books are a little hard to read. This one was easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow !!!","review":"This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"What a disappointment! I always look forward to reading a new Danielle Steel novel, but I have to say -- this one was not up to her usual standards. Charlie is so sappy that I don't blame his wife for choosing an old man. He whined and \\"cried\\" throughout the entire book. Ms. Steel should have stuck with the story of Sarah and Francois -- it was the only reason I finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"I am a big fan of Danielle Steel and have loved so many of her books,so this really surprised me. I honestly couldn't stand the \\"hero\\" Charlie. He drove me crazy!! I thought he was so wimpy. I had no respect for this guy halfway through the book.. I found it hard to believe any woman would really be interested in him. Was it not for the introduction of the story between Sarah and Francois, I would not have had any interest in finishing. Danielle should have just written a story about them,I loved their story."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GHOST","review":"DID D STEEL START THIS BOOK AND HAVE HER 5TH GRADE NIECE/NEPHEW FINISH IT FOR HER? THE STYLE IS PATHETIC!

Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ghost","review":"I love this book. As usual Danielle Steel keeps you reading from page 1. I have enjoyed all her books from the beginning. Her style is predictable but is an excellent read.The story line was different but truly enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly book","review":"As is usual of Ms Steels, the story contains romances between couples who are generations apart (tho i dont understand why the females neccessarily fall in love with male antiques) It is a tear jerker to the core & is soppy reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy title","review":"I didn't actually read this book. I am rating it low because it goes on my list of \\"Worst titles for books\\". If you want to find this book you can't because there are so many other books with the same title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egad, what bad writing!","review":"She can tell a good story, but she's writing too fast. Third person voice? Passive verbs? Past tense from start to finish and ALWAYS inside the guy's head. However, I didn't really get disgusted until I read, \\"...homespun wooden cradle..\\" What? Homespun is fabric -- what idiot editor let that one slip through? Because of this error and other really dumb actions, like driving a coach through a dark night on frontier dirt roads makes it obvious that neither she nor her editors know anything about the era. And, it would seem they don't really care about their reader's intelligence either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Love story I have read in a very long time!!!","review":"The Ghost is one of those Love stories, you just can\`t put down. One becomes lost in the story and you are so moved by emotion that you can\`t wipe the tears away quickly enought. Life teaches this main charater every emotion and how she handles her ordeals keeps you wanting to turn to the next page. I could\`nt put this book down for hours on end, and look forward to reading more of Danielle Steel\`s works."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much more can a person take??","review":"I've been an avid reader of Danielle Steele since the first book I've read written by her, \\"Perfect Strangers\\". And my last one will be \\"Ghost\\".

I couldn't give the book anything higher than 2 stars because of the disgraceful number of grammatical errors and the fact that the first 100 pages was actually painful to get through. And I can't give the book anything less than 2 stars because the subplot of the book (Sarah & Francois) was really captivating. My verdict? The Ghost is an interesting read, but I am at a loss to understand how it could have been so poorly edited."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ghost by Danielle Steel","review":"The narrator was excellent and keep you on your seat. This is a great story, would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interruptions","review":"Was this book edited?! Too many run on sentences for me, I could barely follow the story because I was so blown away by the errors. The amount of sentences that began with AND or BUT were too many for me, it was distracting. This is the first D.S. book I've read and I would like to read more but if this the case all of the time, I'll pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lesson of Perseverance","review":"The ghost of Sarah Furguson appears in this inspirational story of hope. Of course no Danielle Steele book is complete without a beautiful romance too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful blend of modern and historical romantic adventure!","review":"I haven't read many of Ms. Steel's books, but this one has caused me to purchase more of them. I was engrossed in the story of Charlie and the diaries of Sarah. There were places where I cried, and laughed out loud, and I sort of fell in love with Charlie, too. Who wouldn't? Read it with a nice cup of tea in your favorite comfy chair. It is a gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a must read for Danielle Steele Fans","review":"From the time I opened the cover i was in love with this story, it kept me spell bound, i just couldn't put it down. It is definitly a very emotional moving book. I just got caught up in the story myself. If you love Danielle Steel as much as i do you have to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing she's written in 5 years.","review":"I've been reading Danielle Steel for 11 years now, reading everything in print. The last 5 years worth have been somewhat disappointing. I felt compelled to read The Ghost and couldn't put it down once I started! I didn't want the story to end. I loved Charlie, I found him to be a sweet man who just got dumped on. Gladys was his saving grace, by encouraging him to stay and loaning him her treasured chateau. This is the first book in many years that I felt the characters were feasible as real people. I've been trying to read another one of her books this week and have no desire to pick it up after having read 50 pages. The Ghost I will pick up, again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit strange","review":"This story is a bit of a strange one, as you're reading you're kind of thinking, \\"what is this?\\" It's different, and yet that's what makes it good. However, I don't think Steel quite pulled off this topic & I think her writing in this novel left something to be desired. If you're looking for an exciting & suspenseful story by Steel I'd recommend: Secrets, Kaleidoscope, Vanished, Malice, Jewels & Message from Nam."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO!","review":"This is without a doubt one of the best books that i have ever read. I read many books, and this one had me in it's grasp for three days straight. The beginning of this books is VERY slow...so slow that i put the book aside, until i was told by a friend that i HAD to finish it. Once you get past the slow start, you will not be able to put this book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ghost","review":"This book was the best book I have read in a long time. Every time I had a minute of spare time I found myself reading the book. She had answered all the questions I had going through my head while I was reading the book. I knew everything was going to change once she had Charlie go to New York and he wound up in Illinois. He forgot(not totally) about his ex-wife in London and met someone new that he spent a lot of time with. He also spent a lot of time reading journals from a lady who lived in the house that Charlie is staying in. He felt like he knew her just from reading all of her journals."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"This is the first Danielle Steel book I've read, and it will be the last for sure! It was so boring that I had a hard time even getting from page to page. If you want a good love story set in the past read the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon. Those books are excellent and keep you interested through over 3500 pages! Don't bother with Danielle Steel though...she sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love lost-love discovered!","review":"This book was fantastic. I don't usually read Danielle Steel, but I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it. If you are a timeless romantic, this is the book for you. I believe the writing needs a little polishing, but the story was wonderful. The parts about Francois and Sarah were fantastic and kept me wanting more. I also like the way Danielle Steel ties in the story of Sarah and Francois to the relationship between Charlie and Francesca. The parallel between their lives is fantastic. I didn't like the references to the love lost between Charlie and Carole, and, truth be known, I didn't much like Carole! Even with it's short comings, I think this story is definately worth reading..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I just kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but nothing ever did. This is only the second book of Steel's I have read and both have not interested me. I will not be reading any more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A no-brainer, poorly written, poorly edited book","review":"I usually stay away from cheesy novels, but after some heavy reading decided to try this. I was frustrated through much of the book with the inconsistencies of characters and places. I couldn't help thinking that Ms. Steel just \\"whipped this one out\\" and didn't bother to re-read or edit her own creation, nor did anyone else. The plot was interesting, yet predictable. This was not worth my Sunday."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ghost","review":"Danielle Steel writes an interesting novel that flips between the past and present and teaches an important message of hope and healing. Charlie Waterston has recently gone through a divorce that has totally devastated him and he needs encouragement. After he loses his job in the New York office, he meets an elderly widow on his way to Vermont who is full of life and vitality. She teaches him the meaning of living life to the fullest despite life's hard knocks. She allows him to stay at her old Chateau where he can spend time alone contemplating. Here the ghost of Sarah Ferguson appears to him with more of life's lessons. Charlie then finds Sarah's detailed diaries in the attic and a beautiful love story unfolds that gives Charlie the hope that he can go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"read this book!","review":"If you want a good read, and a very detailed and lifelike story, read this. This is my favorite book, and it amazes me how much she can pull you into the story and make you feel like you are watching everything that is happening.. your emotions run high, just like the characters! This is an excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"When you read more than one of Ms. Steel's books, its like deja vu, the same story written with different names! This was no different. It just seemed like the same old story with no new adventure or romance.

He loves it and figured out how to use it right when I put the batteries in. It isn't \\"fun\\" in the conventional way but he loves learning so it was fun to him. He does keep putting it on level 8 which is way too difficult for him (135+___=196) but the lower levels keep him entertained and it will be something he can use for a while and grow into it. Highly suggest for someone who enjoys learning. It doesn't make learning fun but if they enjoy math anyway, it would be great for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational Insights Math Whiz","review":"We are not impressed with the product.

Now I am out the money and my child was dissapointed.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for Money, but Math Shark is Better","review":"I have an 8 year old and an 11 year old. I ordered this and the Math Shark. The Shark is about twice as much, but both of my children prefer the Shark. The Shark appears to be more challenging and cover a wider range of problems.

How can I calculate vectors when there aren't even trig functions!This is the reason American children can't compete on a global marketplace. This \\"tool\\" of education is more of a tool for procrastination for the American public. L'Hopital would turn in his grave! Newton would have an aneurysm!Such simplistic mathematics is best left to those whom the toy's description excludes - three year olds and below.For just a slight amount more, you could get an old yet durable graphing utility which would increase the amount you could teach your child by a factor of 10!In conclusion, there isn't enough here to warrant a buy.

It had awesome special effects, but everything else was a little shaky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Fantastic Awesomeness!","review":"If you don't buy this, you are probably saving your money for food, because that is the only reason not to buy this; you only have enough money to eat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I saw this in the theatre when it first came out and then rented it on Amazon for family night. I'm a fan of pretty much all of the comic book movies, but this was was extra good! Plenty of action, just enough humor and a good story line to hold my interest. Worth watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great special effects - tied together all other previous movies nicely!","review":"great special effects - tied together all other previous marvel movies nicely! can't wait for sequel/prequel whatever they have in mind to continue the series ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"i like this movie but its real long ...and it needs more action,the super heros take too long too get involve..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Marvel!","review":"Marvel has a way of turning cartoons/comics into something quite entertaining and this was done pretty well.I'm looking forward to a part 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent but not inspiring","review":"I give it 3 and a half stars. It's very good for it's ambitions: comic book action figures brought to the big screen. It's entertaining, and that's fine, not much else there from the standpoint of cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Our whole family loved the movie! We did a movie night with some of the kids friends and we all watched it. Kids and adults alike enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Joss W. did a fantastic job of bringing all the characters together. Also the story and presentation felt true to the spirit of the original comic books. RDJ is amazing and does a fantastic job. Also... Hulk Smash... yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best comic epic I ever seen","review":"It's excitement from the start. Great story line. Graphics are supurb. Action all the way through, non stop. I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was first class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blockbuster","review":"Don't expect amazing dialogue and character development. In fact some of the plot reminded me of the comedy \\"Mystery Men\\"...only they weren't trying to be funny. Still, this is super-heroes smashing things up and beating up bad guys and they did it well. 4 stars for being exactly what I expected it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Marvel movie in years","review":"I love what Marvel has done here. You have to see the individual movies about each of the characters first. Having seen them, you'll have the back ground to watch the Avengers. One of the best movies of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video quality","review":"The Video quality was bad.We love the movie. but would like to have a better picture.thank you very much. one more word."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Movies","review":"It was better than i expected from the avengers. In my opinion this movie was way better than all the individual movies. I greatly enjoyed it and watched it 4 times in thearters and once i get the movie ill watch it as many times as i can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome fun!","review":"Saw this movie opening weekend... twice! The last time I walked out of a movie thinking I just HAD to go back to see it again was in 2005 when I saw Firefly, another Joss Whedon creation (only much more his own and catering to a much smaller audience) and before that in 1999 when I saw The Matrix. The Avengers was just much so fun that built on the six movies that came before and led up to it. Amazing to see all these characters juggled so well in a film that balanced action with wit and science as well as comic and mythological legend. Thought about it so much during the week that I saw it again the following weekend and plan on going next weekend, too. Such awesome fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to catch up on my comic characters....","review":"I have to admit, I don't know all the comic characters involved in this movie, but that didn't keep me from enjoying the story. Several character, Iron Man, Thor, Captain America had some very funny lines. I think the characters were cast to perfection and each of them played off the other perfectly. I like how the movie showed them coming together as a team and not being perfect when that happened. Emotions, egos got in the way, but in the end it all worked out. Not to mention all the butt kicking that happens eventually. I hope they make a sequel to this movie so we can see how the Avengers work together without all the character development involved that came with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 reviews for the price of one","review":"My husband loved this movie but he is a real DC Universe type guy. I found it Meh. Then again I am a Tim Burton Batman type of gal and frankly thought Black Widow could have been more sinister and murdery. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE FOR ANYONE'S COLLECTION","review":"You can't go wrong with adding this movie to your collection. It is timeless and leaves you feeling charged and hopeful that good will always triumph over evil. The cast is incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"Movie was entertaining. All in all, You have to know what you're getting. Not Oscar worthy but good. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price cut on four-disc version trumps this version!","review":"What burns me about this order is that the price dropped on the deluxe set AFTER I pre-ordered this version; the four disc deluxe version with digital copy dropped its price to the point that it was only about 2 dollars more, and I had already ordered this 2 disc version! Needless to say, I WON'T be pre-ordering again; I'll wait for the price drop that I got screwed on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I really do not understand the big deal about this film. Yes, it was a big blockbuster with a \\"great\\" cast but this thing bored the heck out of me in theaters and on Amazon Instant video. Too much ego tripping going on in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many heroes","review":"The biggest problem with movies like this is too many heroes all vying for screen time. I loved Thor, loved Captain America, and loved Iron Man. These heroes need to have their own movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvel Does It Again","review":"Excellent! Excellent! Brings back the excitement of superheros. I loved the characters even the villain Loki. Definitely a satisfying fantasy film that takes you away for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"the avengers","review":"I just love this movie I can't really say anymore, but to say I loved this movie so much I had to get the indiviual movies of each mega stars movie yes I bought the hulk, captin america, iron man 1 and 2, and thor so I can see where they all came from to mess into this great movie a must see if you love marvels heros."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Saw it in the movies. Almost as good on TV with BluRay. Should give lots of enjoyment in years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This movie is fantastic, my boys and I saw it in the theatre and loved it. As soon as Blu-ray came out we bought it and have seen it at least a dozen times. As for the disc itself picture and sound is excellent as any new Blu-ray should be. I haven't checked out any extras so I cannot comment on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 3D movie","review":"Love the movie and this 3D version is good. Great in some scene to add the the comic book feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"They sure avenged it","review":"This was a great movie if you liked Iron man, Thor or Capt America, you will love this. Rent, watch, enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avengers continue the fight","review":"Loved this film in the theater and I love it even more on Blu-ray. While I bought the film on blu-ray entirely for the film, the extras are thoughtfully done and add to my experience. Needless to say, if you are an Avengers fan, you will find this more than satisfying. Whether you get it for the 3D or 2D experience, I tend to prefer 2D, but the 3D is as good as it gets. Happy viewing to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is excellent in 3D!","review":"Saw at the theater in 2D and loved it! We thought we'd check it out in 3D at home and enjoyed it even more. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Service","review":"Awesome film. Favorite lines - You may be a demi god but we have a Hulk and Puny god. I received the Blu-ray/DVD on or before the promised date. I bought 2 copies one for me and one for a gift. I can't say enough good things about the sevice I consistenly receive from Amazon. I would highly recommend using them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love super hero movies. This is a fun movie to watch. It has a few places that made me laugh because of a surprise gag. I especially enjoyed the scenes with the hulk. Marvel rocks. They know how to make great hero movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised!!","review":"I was surprised that I enjoyed this as much as I did. Lots of action and it actually had a somewhat believable story line. The operative word here is 'somewhat'! LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Super-Hero Movie","review":"After seeing The Avengers 5 times and still liking the movie, I finally purchased a copy. Before the first viewing, I couldn't imagine how a movie could use all those super heroes and do any justice to a decent storyline. After seeing the movie, I was impressed by the acting, writing, and the special effects. The editing of the film was superb. I would see it again (in fact, I have!), and I would invite my friends over for a movie night to see it together. The Avengers was a fun action film, full of surprises, and what is not to like about a happy ending?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with a not so great release","review":"You've read all about how great the movie is. That all stands. It's great.The Blu-Ray and digital have a terrible mix. If you make it loud enough to hear the voices you'll go deaf from the explosions, fighting and various other sound effects.Video is excellent in digital and Blu-RayAlso, Blu-Ray 3D seems like a waste. I'd like to see more options in what formats I can have together. Right now the addition of Blu-Ray 3D seems like a way to get you to pay a few extra bucks for something a small percentage of the buyers will use. On the other hand this went down to 19.99 during pre-order so it's a non-issue if you were lucky enough to pre-order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie","review":"Great movie. Action packed.

There was not one minute in it that you can miss.My favorite part? Near the end when the Hulk confronts Loki in Stark's penthouse. Small scene but awesome. And there is a scene following the credits. Don't miss it. Funny.If you haven't seen this movie, you should. Other awesome action movie of the year: The Dark Knight Rises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie","review":"Awesome movie loved all the different \\"Heros\\" even the Hulk which is a change Mark did a wonderful job and well they all nailed it cant wait till the next one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"While I somehow didn't realize the bonus features were all on Blu-Ray and am a little disappointed that that is the case, I am pretty satisfied with the purchase of this product as it arrived relatively quickly after I ordered it and it was in great condition."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],B={key:0},N={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(E,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-74872f23"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/52.md","filePath":"glossary/52.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/52.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
