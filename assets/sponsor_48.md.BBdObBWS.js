It basically has a little tab that locks it in place: in one position it fits through a slot, and a half turn or so rotates it past the notch. The problem is, this tab is a tiny bit of weak plastic. After replacing the battery once or twice, it snapped off and now the cover doesn't go on any more. I was able to continue using it, somewhat, by holding the battery in place with my thumb--a fiddly exercise to be sure, because it would only work if I managed to keep it in just the right position. Then my girlfriend decided to wash it, and game over! It may be water resistant with the battery cover on (there seems to be a gasket), but it certainly isn't without. It could have been a good thermometer but the weak battery cover is just a fatal flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Things Are Awesome","review":"I originally bought an older version of this thermometer for brewing beer.

The price is also affordable compared with another ultimate thermometer recommended by Cook's. Overall, a very good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"reader","review":"Unfortunately, this book doesn't tell the story we've all waited for. It is like taking a journey down a pipeline with blinders on. You get to through the story, but there is not much substance. You are left to wonder why, how, where, where did the characters get where they are, where they've gotten their ideas, WHY they are doing what they are doing, sometimes you wonder WHAT they are doing! The book leaves out most of the main SW characters, and deals badly with Jania. It was a disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing writing style","review":"As an avid fan of the NJO series, I would have to agree with other reviews that this was a dissappointing installment. I found that I had to reread several passages to figure out what was happening. I felt the writing was not as strong as some of the other books in the series. However, I must admit that I was caught up in the suspense and anxiety of whether or not Jaina would start to turn things around. I would also agree that this book could have been stronger with more allusions to Jacen's fate and to Luke and Mara's efforts. Here's to a better installment next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst one yet","review":"Some of the previous NJO books have been rather boring and I was getting to the point when I didn't really care when the next book came out and then I read Star by Star and I really enjoyed it. So my expectations for Dark Journey were rather high. I read the book in a day but that was just to find out if they mentioned anything about Jacen. I have never really like Jaina so a whole book devoted to her was rather boring, although the change in Kyp was nice to see. The writing style was what really got to me, it just didn't draw me. I would recomend that people just get the book from the library and read it because it doesn't really further the story, in fact I could have missed this one and would not have very many problems following the story in the next book. I hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheesh","review":"I have read most of the books in the star wars universe (there's always new ones it seems!!!) and this booked ranked at near the top of my \\"dissapointment\\" list. I thought this was the weakest NJO book to date after a strong showing in Star by Star. This book is what I would call an afterthought book. Jaina's \\"descent\\" into the dark side was almost laughable in the context of one book and the deeper heartwrenching struggles that Kyp and Luke went through is like comparing mountains to Jaina's molehills. It would have been nice to have this story play out over several books instead of one 300 page book. It felt cheap.It was nice to see Kyp be featured ,and it seems they may try to develop him more than just the \\"jedi rogue\\" role.This book was a short story that really didn't seem to advance the overall plot of the NJO universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I felt compelled to share my disappointment in this book. Normally, I am writing about how good they are.This book was a big letdown after Star by Star. It had a very start and stop feel to it and barely even scratched the surface of Jaina looking towards the Dark Side. More just like Jaina having a really bad day.I am also very disappointed in Anakin's funeral. It was treated like an afterthought and was very poorly written. You would think that Luke, his uncle, and the head of the Jedi would have had something major to say. It really seemed like this author barely understood the characters. Anakin was such a great character and it was just glossed over.I really hope the next book is better, the fans deserve much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Boring, Just Not Star Wars","review":"this was by far the biggest bust in the whole NJO series. There's barely any action, and without Jacen and Anakin, it's not a good book. Although Elaine Cunningham is developing Jag and Kyp to fill the role of the two lost jedi brothers, the book is just dull with Jaina being taught how to be a lady by the queen mother on hapes and really lacks a strong male presence. Also, Han and Leia are not mentioned enough and the book just stinks! It's pretty obvious that the author is a first time star wars author who should never write another book in her life!!! I only hope the next books are better. Bring back Zahn, Stover and Allston!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elaine Cunningham the Master of Fantasy Suspense","review":"Elaine has done it again with this novel. She takes a two characters that have been through great tragedies and writes about recovery. Jaina has watched what she thought was both her brothers cut down by the enemy and now much like her father is going to make the Vong pay. What better person to show her that revenge is not the answer than Kyp Durron. Who even though being controlled by Exar Kun used revenge against the Empire. He ended up completely destroying the Carida solar system with the Sun Crusher. This book brings back some old faces and integrates them well into this book. I think it has been the best star wars book focused on a few people since I Jedi."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst of the series.","review":"I really didn't like this book. So what that Jaina goes to the darkside if for at least a while, and then comes back? Where's the real action?

Star Wars has become a poor, ... excuse for entertainment. I prefer not to waste my time reading about weak incompetent chartacters,like those in NJO. This series could have been so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a completely satisfying NJO novel!","review":"Jaina becomes the lead jedi after the fall of her siblings and treads the dark side. Deciding to take the fight to the Vong rather than being a jedi pacifist, she takes on unexpected allies and action. Features the surviving stars from the YJK series, Lowbacca and Tenel Ka, plus Kyp Durron, Jag Fel, Han Solo and the Princess all seek shelter on the Hapes Cluster after the fall of Coruscant. Refugees overcrowd the system and the presence of Jaina make the Hapes Cluster the next target in the war with the Yuuzhan Vong. Great writing, with exciting new developments in many of these characters, plus some great space battles, a little lightsaber action and a good ending make this a very satisfying read compared to the so far mostly upsetting NJO series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is left?","review":"Star war books used to have an ending or at least a semi-ending if a two book series. Tha last books 9 and 10 have no endings and it seems the authors are on a kick to kill off all the main characters. It would be good to have at least some good endings left at the conclusion of the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"NJO: Dark Journey","review":"I have read all of the published NJO novels and Dark Journey is the worst. A character's wants create the action from which a well-written story line flows. Star by Star establishes why Jaina Solo turns to the dark side of the Force. Dark Journey does not add anything new. There is no answer to this pivotal question in the story: As a Dark Jedi, what does Jaina do, say, or decide that makes a bad situation for the New Republic better or worse? Instead, Jaina spends most of the novel snapping at other characters and working upon the Trickster. Furthermore, the story line does not explain how or why she reaches her turning point--the return to the light side of the Force. The story lacks action, character development, and a climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats going on?","review":"I don't understand the direction this series is going. First they kill Chewy, and then Anakin who was the biggest character. Now this book deals with Jania leaning to the dark side. Thats it, for 301 pages all it's about is Jania's struggle with the dark side. It's nice to see Kyp do some good for a change but we will see if that lasts. I really expected more form this one. One last note. I thought a jedi knight was suppose to dissapeer when they died? They did'nt even get that right. Save your money and lets hope the next one is a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I liked it.","review":"I find most of the more negative reviews of this book tend to rate so poorly not for good reasons, but simply becuas things didn't happent the way they wanted. Now, Jedi's have gone close to the dark side before and come back! Luke himself did so, twice, without immense time having to go around psycho. Rather, we see Jaina's slow deteroriation untill, reaching the crossroads at emotional rock bottom where she either had to go up or down, she went back up. Okay. So she didn't become a dark Jedi. It'd have been cool, but it didn't happen. Get over it pepople. As to the suspence, we dont' know what the hell happened to Jacen. I think that THAT was the point!This book is an aftermath book. Star by Star change a lot of things, and rather then going right into the coutnerstrike by the rebellion, Dark Journey takes the time to actually deal with some of the subjects that have occured. I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this really an NJO book?","review":"Don't get me started on how horrible this book was. I was appalled that this could even carry the title \\"New Jedi Order.\\" This is the worst book in the entire New Jedi Order series. It was all about Jaina and only about Jaina. There was almost no noticable plot and I think Jaina is a little old for being such a child. You think Anakin and Jacen are dead, that's no reason to regress to a child! This writer captured grief all wrong for starters.Secondly, a book just about Jaina doesn't appeal to EVERYONE. The general idea is to make a book as appealing to all audiences as possible and Cunningham failed miserably.The book is not fit to follow Star by Star and would be better off as a very long side story.The only somewhat notable thing that happened was the discovery of the Yammosk signals and the ability to jam them. Aside from that it was pretty much a garbage book with nothing happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universe gone wrong","review":"The last review I wrote was after Vector Prime, I'm sure you can see where this is going. I want to know what has happend to this universe that I used to love to escape to? What were they thinking in Star by Star by killing off Anakin? I was under the impression from an earlier book, That Anakin and Tahiri had some pre-determind future together. I thought they had a purpouse? Has everyone forgot about this? Anyway, back to this book. I think it was poorly written with major loss of the characters pesonalities. They have turned this universe up-side-down. Hardly anyone is who they were or acts like they used to be or who they were made up to be. I want to be reading about this universe til I'm old and gray. STOP KILLING OFF ALL THE MAIN CHARACTERS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cunningham could have done better!","review":"I haven't fully finished reading this book (skip part of the Vong sections.) What I have read so far, sucks. I mean parts of the story dont even make sense. I didnt like Anakin's funeral, he definitely deserved more. How does Jaina go \\"bad\\" and then \\"good\\" in one book? Luke and Mara are barely mentioned. I really didn't like it, thats my opinion. Go out, get the book and then form your own opinion. But no matter what you have to admit it made no sense and I really expected more."},{"rating":"2","title":"DARK JOURNEY INDEED","review":"Great Title, fits the book to a Tee.

First they kill off Chewie, which in itself is an outrage, but I continued to read the series feeling that it would have to redeem itself in some way. However, to the contrary, it has progressively gotten worse. ...Then to have Jaina struggling with the dark side, ridiculous. The plot in this book was small and not very well written. The only redeeming point for this book is the further knowledge of the YV technology. This is my last NJO book. I have no further interest in seeing how the next ...[book] will decide to destroy the real SW saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very human feeling","review":"Ok so this book takes place during the end and after the Myrkr mission in Star by Star and its focused on Jaina.So the strike team has completed their mission but at a terible loss and Jaina is left grief striken and the story is about her obsessed with revenge against the Vong and her journey to the dark side and back. It is a book full of emotion and as you read it you begin to realize who Jaina Solo is and who she will become.I would recomend to all readers that can handle the NJO writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"After looking forward to the next segment of this series, I was extremly disappointed with this book. The writing and story line left much to be desired, the book before this was wonderful, full of action and left you really wanting more. Unfourtnatly I wasted six dollars and the time it took me to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, not a lot of depth","review":"I like Jaina Solo, and I have an interest in what a person thinks and feels as they walk that line between dark side and light, I thought this book would catch my interest, but sadly it didn't. This is one of the few books I have had to force myself to finish.There is a great story in this book, a story that could have been told better. The plot is great, but the author's portrayal of it falls flat in may ways; characters are lacking depth, scenes are skimpy on details, and there was no emotional envolvement for the reader.There is a scene in this book that should have been deep, and moving and powerful, and perhaps dwelled upon a little longer, it was a funeral for crying out loud! Yet like most events in the book, it is skimmed briefly, and then passed by.This author has written some great short stories and novellas, and that is what this book felt like, a short story or novella stretched out to fill the 300 pages of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"This book [was not very good]. The writing was atrocious and the action left a lot to be desired. I read this book hoping Anakin would be brought back to life because he is by far my favorite character. However, I was greatly disappointed not only by the fact that he is truly dead, but also because his funeral was really [bad]. Elaine Cunningham could and should have done a much better job on the final farewell of the hero of the series thus far. My new favorite character, Jacen, might be dead, leaving me grasping for characters to look forward to reading about. Hopefully, the next book will jump ahead about fifteen years so that Ben Skywalker can become the new hero and saviour of the galaxy like his father before him. Otherwise, I see no reason to continue reading this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Journey, a wasted opportunity.","review":"As a long time reader of the Staw Wars epic, I was pleased to see a book offering insight into Jaina Solo, as she has been the least explored of the Solo children. Sadly I feel this episode fell short of that goal and did little to advance the overall NJO storyline. And Most objectionable to me was the continuing decimation of the pivotial charaters of the Skywalker-Solo family. Leaving Jacen's fate in limbo at least leaves some slim hope of his survival. Of Jaina's swing toward the dark side I think it offered few new insights into her true personality. The explaination that grief, or extremity often cause good people to do bad things is getting a bit thin. The writing felt awkward at times, and as I've observed in other SW books whose authors are new to the Star Wars Saga, their grasp of the charaters and storyline seem tenuous at best. This book left me hoping the Next author and book are better.. MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE!","review":"Cunningham's book can be skipped. After Star by Star, this was a total let down. She tried to dramatize Jaina's journey to the dark side, but it was about as dark as an episode of \\"Spongebob Squarepants.\\" Not a good read. If you keep reading it, don't be surpised if you go cover to cover waiting for something to happen.The back cover of the book gives you all the info you need to move on to the Rebel Stand books. NJO has been great so far, but this book could have easily been left out.The best part about this book was that it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad Cunningham only wrote one book.....","review":"My first two thoughts upon finishing this book were: \\"That's it???\\" and \\"I'm glad this author only wrote one book and not a trilogy, I don't think I could stand 2 more of these.\\" Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe how I feel about this book... This book was hyped as a Jaina-goes-to-the-dark-side book, and it is sort of, but all she really does is take Kyp's view and expand it a little. She doesn't turn into Darth Vader or anything. Just goes on the offensive. And by the end of the book she sees what she has done and comes back to Luke's POV. Oh, yeah, the reason I didn't give it a 1 rating is that you get to see more about Jagged Fel and the Chiss. Kind of cool in those parts. Otherwise, not worth the $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk! . . .","review":"She may not look like much kid, but . . . well . . . she REALLY doesn't have it where it counts either. Let me start off by saying that \\"Dark Journey\\" is easily the worst Star Wars book ever writen. I thought Troy Denning's recent offering was bad, but this book makes \\"Star by Star\\" look like \\"War and Peace.\\" From the very beginning the reader is thrust into the frustrating, stale actions of Jaina Solo and her band of Jedi rejects trying desperately to escape from a Yuuzhan Vong Worldship that they had absolutely no business being on. This little escape lasts no less than half of the book, until the team finally finds their way to the Hapes Cluster. From there on out, Jaina and her friends perform strange unexplained acts that are only mildly impressive, while Hapan politics take the front seat of this unimaginative plot line. Hey! Shouldn't someone be worrying about the Vong taking over the galaxy! Oh well, maybe they'll just go away or something.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no way out!","review":"Talk about addicting!

The plot developed slooooowwwwwwly, the coolest scenes were brushed over.For example, at the end the story climaxes with a great battle, commanded by Jag Fel himself. Cool. Only we never even learn what happens. No play-by-play, no strategy commentary, no command decisions by the kid,.... NOTHING.No offence, but women authors write boring Star Wars books.

I was expecting a sort of research text on the deer. It actually is much more than that--it's part travelogue and part personal journey on the part of the author as well. He relates to us strange stories of bizarre people he meets in his research, thoughts on reading, various bits and pieces of history, and an ongoing story about trying to find a secondhand bookstore in Cairo. As I read it, I was enjoying it, but it felt rather fractured...up until the last few pages where he brings all the threads into the book together into one common theme, making me shake my head at the control he had over the various stories all along."},{"rating":"1","title":"It seemed to be more about the writing OF the book than the writing IN the book.","review":"I got about halfway through this book before realizing that I was just trying to get back some of my time investment. I hoped that it would become spellbinding and hilarious any second. I kept hoping and hoping, until my next requested library book became available and I realized that it was more appealing than the book (this one) that I had already started.The author really did seem to be just listing all the ways he got around writing a book about these nearly extinct deer.

Too bad, too, because his tone was enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, honest novel","review":"Furhman writes about youth without indulging in trite sentiment or nostalgia.

Overall a funny and poignant story, made more so by the unfortunate loss of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I've now made it one of my favorites. It was hilarious and tragic all in one. I laughed out loud several times, which I do not do when reading. The language used, in dialog especially, captures the true voice of being Southern. I should know, I'm a life long Southerner. I could feel the desperation of being bored in the South, maybe because I know about it personally. It made me long for junior high school again. It is sad this is and will be Fuhrman's only book.

It is a lot bigger than I thought - that's not a bad thing. It is extremely easy to use... just fill up and push the on button. The instructions are very simple. One thing I like about it is that it is ultrasonic (it uses a metal diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency to create water droplets. It is not loud, and also produces a cool fog.). No extensive cleaning needed, no adding bleach to the water, etc. It does the job great. There is one little thing that bothers me... the on light is green (it turns red if it runs out of water) and it is very bright at night. I like my room to be dark and this tiny light really lights up a room. I did cover it up with some electrical tape and now it doesn't bother me.

I ran it 24 hours, and neither they hygrometer directly over it nor the one across the room registered any increase in humidity.Well, I thought, the living room is kind of big... although you'd think at least the hygrometer only 3 feet from it would have gone up... so I put it in my 10x10 bedroom. 24 hours later the humidity had gone up a couple of percentage points - still only 25%.

The photographs are rarely seen and in my work I use them in a display to share in Civil War workshops to those who have never seen the reality of American history in school books.The brother with his foot cut off holding books on his knee is as strong a message one can have on the value of education and freedom!

Kudos to the librarian for suggesting this one to us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Climbing Daddy Mountain","review":"I would use this book with 2-3year olds and preschoolers. This book is about a little girl who takes on the adventure of climbing up her daddy to sit on top of his shoulders. I think that many children would be able to relate to the adventure of climbing to the top of their loved one's shoulders. The pictures are simple. The little girl is draw with pencil and looks like she is colored with colored pencils. Daddy Mountain is a shaded picture of a man. The author/illustrator does a great job showing the struggles the little girl faces on the way to the top with the expression on her face. I think that Jules Feiffer did a great job showing the height of Daddy Mountain with the colored fold out page and the picture of the little girl looking down at her mother.

My 7 year old, who reads on a 3rd grade level struggled with the line \\"I have to be careful and go not too fast.\\" I'm a graduate writing student and I had to read it a few times for it to make sense. There should be a comma or \\"not too fast\\" should have been made its own sentence (yeah, yeah I know it's a fragment, but at least it would make it more understandable.)

A lot of stuff happened outside New York and Chicago. In the mid-to-late '20's, the Birger and Shelton gangs rivaled Capone's Chicago beer wars in terms of both publicity and body count. Spectacularly so, with not only machine guns but armored trucks and even the first aerial bombing in U.S. history. What Gary DeNeal did for Charlie Birger, Taylor Pensoneau has now done admirably for his rivals. Birger was hanged in 1928 but the Shelton boys continued to prosper, in bootlegging, gambling and labor racketeering until the late '40's, when their story came to a violent end and this well researched and highly readable account tells the whole story. Read up, Hollywood--the Sheltons deserve a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Illinois History At It's Best","review":"Our family moved around the state of Illinois and I was fortunate to experience life in the southern part of the state in \\"Bloody Williamson County\\" for several of my youngest years.

This author has really put all of the pieces of the puzzle together. Prohibition, the Klan, politics, crime, religion, et al. I studied and taught Illinois History and even Robert Howard's fantastic book on the history of the Land of Lincoln did not have much to say on this subject.

That is also the law in many states. Children younger/smaller than that are not nearly as safe in a booster as they would be in a harnessed car seat. And, in answer to an earlier review, all carseats and boosters expire - the length of time they last varies from 5 to 8 years. After that date, the plastic starts to break down and the seat is no longer safe.That being said, the Compass is a great option for school age children and the folding option makes it especially convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Car seat","review":"Good design although a 3 point harness would have been great as younger children can escape while driving.

Overall, quite a boring show."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and over-rated or atleast the dubbed version","review":"I've only seen the dubbed version, but the fighting was lame and bland. Ekin Cheng is an OK actor. His lacks grace, power, or beauty in his movements. I am a huge HK martial arts movie fan and have been watching this stuff since I was in kindergarten. There are far better movies out there. The special effects are lame, even for time period. The statue of liberty shots were pixelated and the action totally unspired. Any Lau has made some good movies in the past, but this one isn't one. If you feel mindless and just want to watch something, it might be half way entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid film","review":"This movie is a good film, not great and not terrible, but somewhere in the middle. There really is not much fighting in the movie, so I would not consider this a kung fu movie. I liked the love story and it was pretty sad at some points. The spot where the film fizzles is in terms of hero's son, that aspect of the film having to do with his son lookin for him was kind of weak. This film was not too difficult to follow so don't be fooled by the other reviews. I found the storyline a refreshing change from the staight forwardness of most action oriented films. There are two different time periods going on in the film but it is not hard to follow. I would recomend this film as a break from straight forward kung fu movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"not on dvd","review":"the movie is excellent. my problem was that you have it only on vhs. i don\`t want another vhs copy. when and if it comes out on dvd i will be the first to snap this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!

My friends all shrugged me off when I said this is one of the movies that would refrain you from watching The Matrix. Man, they didn't even see this movie yet! SFX is great except for some fake looking parts at the ending, story is sad and I guess was meant that way. Ekin Cheng is my favorite HK movie hero along with Nicholas Tse (Ekin's son in th movie)!

I have never seen this many elements from different genres thrown into one film in a truly bizzare mix. I mean, battling it out with brutal magical powers in the streets of new york?

These songs are strong, independent, and have a rugged beauty. Vocals are sensitive when required, but quite powerful at other times. The melodies are clearly in the country or bluegrass genre, but they pay homage to the established styles rather than falling into cliches. The acoustic instrumental playing is of the highest calibre, with excellent contributions from all concerned. I'd recommend this CD.

This book is about how he just say what he thinks is in his mind. I really appreciated what he have done and shown. I have always thought he was a great player. After reading the book i felt like i even know him more and better. He was describing his life and later on helping children. He was saying how he want to make life better in Alabama. Very good book. I would recommand this book to anyone who likes to read bigraphy and people who enjoys hearing the truth. All those he said was just to the people who don't know the truth. I was glad that he said what he thinks was right and can help others. Very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barkley is a Moron","review":"After reading this book and the many \\"opinions\\" espoused by Mr. Barkley, I can fully understand while Charles was a basketball superstar and not a scholar. I for one could not recommend this book to anyone. You could likely get more insight at your local pub or barbershop. Charles - - - stick to sports commentary and try thinking before you speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was going to be funny, but I doubt it.","review":"I guess I should have investigated this book a little more before buying it. I thought it was going to be about Charles' life in the NBA. He is so funny, but in this book, it is only his political and racial opinions and I am not interested in that. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Barkley I hoped for...","review":"I love Charles Barkley; his insight and wit on TV are terrific. I had hoped that I would get to read even more of his thoughts on the world today by buying this book, but I was disappointed. If you like reading mainly about his basketball career and not much else, then you'll like this book. I enjoyed reading some of it, but was hoping to read something more \\"deep\\" from Charles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least.......","review":"I agree with most of the other reviewers in the fact that Charles repeats himself over and over and over until you want to scream: \\"I got it, racism is bad!!\\" It's almost as though Charles and Michael Wilbon (who I think is a fantastic journalist) struggle to make this book longer that a Sports Illustrated feature article. Simply put, the book is terrible in every aspect......thank God it was so short!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book, no doubt","review":"What a waist to buy and read this book. In three pages Barkley could have made his points, but instead he keeps repeating himself all the time. Great player, bad writer. He should have sticked with writing about basketball and not about how great an opinionleader he thinks he is. No doubt it's wrong to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I bought this book for my daughter, she loves Barkley. I started to read it and decided to order another one.I thought I May Be Wrong But I doubt It was an incredible autobiography.This Book is a must read for any sports fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHARLES KEEPS IT REAL","review":"Love him or hate -- you've got to respect Charles Barkley. This book is written in true Barkley fashion -- To The Point. He takes on subjects that too few athletes or men of prominence are afraid to tackle. The book is exactly what I expected -- providing his opinions on today hottest topics. It is easy to read. The reader feels like Sir Charles and he/she are having a cocktail and talking. If you aren't prepared the answer, don't ask Barkley the question. One thing is for sure -- Charles calls it the way He see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as mind blowing as Barkley thinks it is.","review":"Chuck figures he's blown the lid off by stating the obvious about racism, poverty, politics.He hasn't. At best, he's shown he paid attention to the world surrounding him. It doesn't make him special. And it doesn't make his book any kind of epiphany.Barkley spends the opening chapter bemoaning reporters of the sproting genre who just didn't care about his worldviews. The reason, painfully obvious, is that they didn't care about his worldviews. His aren't the original theories he figures they are -- they've been around for, oh, 50 damn years -- though they may be original for the 21st Century athlete.Barkley's better off striking a posture and leaving it that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I could not even get through the first chapter, Charles is not as good as he thinkes he was. I would read bootlegger's boy by Berry Switzer famous coach of the oklahoma sooners if I were looking for a good book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be serious","review":"This book, along with TNT's decision to provide an on-going forum for poor stand-up comedy in the way of clownish \\"analysis\\" is yet another example of society's continued willingness to elevate non-threatening style over substance Let's be serious. Bill Russell, Jim Brown, John Thompson, Julius Erving, Magic Johnson and many others represent the very best of what Black atheletes offer society....courage, intelligence, commitment AND gifts of analysis. By contrast, Barkley is an uniformed clown...a comic self-indulgence sustained by those same interests who have exploited African-Americans for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm positive. You are definitely wrong all the time","review":"I never read this book and would not take advice from a player who has never won an NBA championship and plays golf like Corky from \\"Life Goes On\\". He has always had a big mouth but as it turns out now he has nothing left to back it up with. At least he got a show where he has a reason to have a big mouth. I'll give him credit for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanley 18 Gauge Nailer","review":"I am very happy with this brad nailer. It is light and small. My wife has no problems using it and it is small enough to fit into relatively tight areas. The depth of the nails is controllable by adjusting the air pressure from the compressor or by turning the dial on the gun. The nail holes are small and the non-mar tip does a good job of leaving no marks. If filled with matching putty, the holes are scarcely noticeable. The rubber grip makes for a secure and comfortable feel and the low nail visual indicator is convenient, although more often than not, I am surprised when I am out of nails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent nailer for it's class","review":"This Stanley SBN200K 18 guage nail gun works great if you use it within it's limits. 18 guage 1/2\\" to 2\\" T-head brads (nails) are common so replacement nails are easy to find. It needs oil! It's not meant to run dry. Generic O-rings will fit if you do blow a ring. I ran mine dry after 6 months & blew an O-ring (located in the top black head) and replaced it with one I found in my \\"1000 O-rings for $9.99\\" Harbor Freight packs. It's not meant to nail hardwood floors - this is for finer work. I'm building picture frames and display cabinets to sell at home and ebay. Going on 1.5 years and still working great for it's price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stanley Brad Nailer","review":"I found the nailer easy to use. It had more driving power than I expected. I would recommed this for all medium to light trim work. It was light weight and durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Titanium Link Biker Chain","review":"This is a beautiful bracelet but it only comes in one size. Most jewelry stores will not size this bracelet due to the degree of difficulty. One was willing to try but did not promise good results.Manufacturer does not make different sizes and is unwilling to re-size-probably for the same reason as the jewelry stores.The vendors selling this bracelet are excellent to deal with. So if you want to try the item out at least you have the opportunity to do so without the hassle of return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool enough for my brother-in-law/biker-in-law","review":"I bought this for my brother-in-law, a hardcore Harley fan. It is cool, since it's a bike chain, and it has an upscale look. The titanium has a nice lustre and is lightweight. I am not worried about resizing the bracelet for him, as he is incredibly handy and will do it himself. Nice bracelet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Fitness Video of 2010!!!!!","review":"Bipasha Basu is a great actress. And this workout video is sure to help many.

I have 5 children all under the age of 13 and they can all follow and do the basic workout. The warm up is concise and you can feel yourself warmer by the end. They do a great job of explaining what the individual exercises do as well as keeping you motivated. It is easy to follow without getting lost. The mix of cardio and strength training together makes it so if you get tired just pause and pick up the next exercise. Wonderful video"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout video","review":"It is a very good workout video. It has 2 levels, one for beginners and one for advanced. Each workout is is like a circuit training. The timer on the screen is a great feature. Narration is apt. You can listen to Bollywood music while working out which I am not sure is very synchronized with the workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"I bought this book to learn ASP after reading all the positive ratings. This little book starts with the examples and then give you only hints here and there. If you have no knowledge of ASP beforehand you simply get lost in no time. This may be a good book for experienced webdesigners or tutors to use as a tool. For beginners it is not on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples OK but CODE is an embarrassment","review":"I have been out of coding for a few years, so picked this book up to teach myself ASP. Did it teach it to me? Yes. But considering that he has been teaching for as long as he claims the coding standards are _shocking_. Any programmer with half an ability knows that the bad old day of few comments and zero indentation are a thing of the past. I found following the code near to impossible, I have not seen code this badly formatted and written in twenty years since I first started coding. Robert B Mellor should be embarrassed, I am for him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent teaching text book","review":"This book has been adopted by us (and other colleges) because it is an excellent introduction to ASP at the beginner level, for 1-credit courses. The book is well built up, pedagogically correct and at a price that suits the students pocket. It covers ASP with both JavaScript and VBScript, inc files, IIS, PWS4, ODBC, SQL, Access, the object model and contains a useful capter on debugging. Recommended for all teachers (and students). Why is this book not in amazon.co.uk?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful introduction!","review":"By using this simple book you too can get a toe into the ASP waters. Keep in mind the fact that this is a beginner's book. However, sometimes assumptions are made that might not be accurate for a beginner.Nevertheless, an excellent book. It is small enough to be fully read (and exercised) in a weekend. At the price, it's a real bargain. And while I'm not the \\"book learnin\\" type, I found the sparse yet understable text to give me the information I needed. It's no bible of info, but just an introductory course..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ASP: Learning by Example","review":"I've read other ASP books, but this book showed me alternate ways of using ASP, making me understand the subject more, in a way that you can not find in other books. The author explained and showed a complicated topic in simple terms. He summarized the subject into topics that really mattered and in an organized way, much like how a computer instructor would summarize his notes as preparation before delivering the subject in a classroom. I'd recommend the book to instructors, students and to anyone who would like to grasp the subject of ASP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start Up Book","review":"I just started to learn ASP. I have programming experience so it was relatively easy for me. This book has great, easy, PRACTICLE examples for what you would use in a real-life application! It delivers that reasonably well. In addition, explanation of ASP basics done very well. On the other hand, I wish the code examples could have been formatted better for easier reading; for example, perhaps the keywords could have been in a different color, and use of indentation inside loops, and If..Then..Else statements, would make for easier reading. Overall, great book, great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tonsils Out!","review":"I bought this book for my 7 year old grandson, who was scheduled for a tonsillectomy. He read it with his mom and said he was not so scared after they read it. He did great through his pre-op and post-op experiences. He knew exactly what to expect and his anesthesiologist said he was his best patient ever. He did everything he was asked to do. This is a great book for parents and kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help","review":"My five-year-old grandson just had a tonsillectomy. This book was very informative and reassuring. He knew what to expect and was not surprised or shocked at anything. We did have the \\"Good-Bye Tonsils! party, which made him feel very special. I strongly recommend this book for preparation for youngsters' surgery. Very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read this book, be prepaired fro the kids to expect gifts!","review":"I ordered this book for my almost 5 year old. We have talked a lot about what will happen when she get's her tonsils out but I thought it would be helpful for her to ahve a book about it as well. The book arrived today and she was very excited. While reading it together we talked about every thing that will happen. In the book the little girl get's gifts after her surgery, even from her friends. Of course this excited my daughter, and now she assumes that every one get's gifts if they have there tonsils out.This book is simple, talks about what will happen with out giving to many details to make the child scared. Although we have talked about all the details so she knows exactly what to expect, and that unlike the book parents are not allowed to go in to the operating room at all and the IV will be started before the surgery when she is still awake. Atleast it gives kids the general idea of what they can expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good-Bye Tonsils","review":"This is a great book for a child about to have their tonsils removed. We read it again and againbefore her surgery and it made it easier for her to relax when it came time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book","review":"This was a cute book. It was right on with all that happens to prep for the surgery (cherry drink before surgery, bracelet with name on it, gas mask, etc.) However, it was a little unrealistic about the recovery part. It makes you expect to be back at home by noon and totally better within three days. Anyone who has had their tonsils out, or their child's, will know that this is not true and you can expect to miss at least a week of school and have a terribly sore, raw throat again in about 5-10 days after surgery. Fortunately, my child was only 3 1/2, so she didn't remember that Julianna was better and back at school by the fourth day. But all in all, we like reading the book, and still read it occasionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work","review":"Tried everything humanly possible to get this thing to work with no success.

After 1 and a half year the product started failing (bad sectors), and after 2 years I got more bad sectors. I can't even format the disk. The warranty of this product is 1 year, and the only advice of their customer service is to buy a new one. They told me that to repair the product would cost more than buying a new one.

The rest of the cuts on this CD I don't listen to but these songs are such gems it is worth buying the entire CD.Ambrosia is a passionate group, highly under appreciated for its time.

This great cover of Magical Mystery Tour, which featured also the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, should have been included in this anthology as should a few other tunes, most notably the great song \\"Make Us All Aware\\" from their first, self-titled LP.

Snow Flower and Lily have a lifelong bond which is indescribably intricate. Lisa See is a tremendous writer and I am looking forward to reading more of her novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This was a book I was asked to read for a book club. Given my impression of the books topics, I wouldn't have chosen it myself...but once I started the book I found it was a page turner I could not put down. The characters and plot move quickly along and leave you constantly wondering what will happen next and saying \\"no way!\\" to the things that do happen. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Look into A Different World","review":"What I thoroughly enjoyed about Snow Flower and the Secret Fan was becoming engrossed in the time period of the novel, learning about a culture I knew little about, and coming to understand the role of women in the Chinese society of the day. The friendship between Snow Flower and Lily was very well drawn, but the relationships between all of the female characters in the book was intriguing. This novel proved to be an excellent choice for my women's book club!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Fiction","review":"This novel set in 19th-century China is fascinating not only for the story of friendship, but also for the insight it gives into the Chinese culture at the time. The story is beautifully constructed, the characters authentic and compelling. It is a book that is not easy to put down and one you won't forget when you have finished reading. It is a treat for anyone who enjoys historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb characters and enduring lessons","review":"From the horrid foot binding tradition, to the unshakable superstitious practices, to the intriguing secret language only women understand, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a captivating visit to 19th century China. See's writing flows nicely and carries us along the story of two unlikely friends from adolescence to death bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Book Clubs Everywhere--Read This Next","review":"Our neighborhood book club assigned this book three days ago, and tonight I have the pleasure of finishing it! It was so well-written and absolutely captivated me the entire time. I read the words in gulps and still wanted to read more! I even researched \\"foot-binding\\" on the internet because I just had to see it for myself. During the \\"foot-binding\\" scene in the story I broke into a sweat, as I had no idea what it was all about. Every woman will enjoy reading this story as it paints a picture of 19th century Asian culture which is so unique and based on rituals and customs which are no longer permissible. I felt Lily's pain, and I rooted for her throughout the story. The characters were well-developed and compelling. Hats off to Lisa See--I hope you are writing as we speak. Touche'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes! Yes! Yes!","review":"I hadn't heard anything about it, but I picked this book up on a whim while traveling. I finished it in no time at all and was not the slightest bit disappointed. How Lisa See gets a lifetime's details into what seems like a few short pages is beyond me, but the historical insights are riveting as well. I was inclined to looking up \\"foot binding\\" on the web to learn more about the seemingly inhumane practice and its roots. To then read the stories of still living (though aged) women whose feet were bound when they were young was as enlightening as it was gut-wrenching. Foot binding was practiced in some parts of China as late as the 1950's. Intrigued? Read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This book was just a beautiful story. The imagery of the chinese wedding customs of the time and the horrific descriptions of foot binding were amazing. The connection between the main characters and their need for love in a world in which women were considered worthless was powerful.This is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan","review":"This is an immensely readable book that tells a story of human frailty woven into a study of 19th Century Chinese culture. Anyone in any culture can relate to the kinds of misunderstandings that harm a friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story!","review":"I LOVED this book! This story shows how women's relationships transcend cultures. Women love each other through all kinds of pain both emotional and physical.Snow Flower and Lily are two young girls whose lives are very different but are brought together by a special contractual friendship. They share many major chapters in their lives from footbinding to marriage to children. However Lily keeps a major secret that leads to betrayal and misunderstanding.A wonderful story for anyone who loves to read about relationships, history, other cultures-really for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan","review":"This is a lovely presentation of the world of Chinese women. It is the Red Tent of Asian women."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of friendship...","review":"While I do enjoy books about friendships, this book was kind of off putting. The characterization was quite shallow, and the supposed friendship of Lily and Snow Flower had was not very deep or emotional. If friends have known each other for as long as Lily and Snow Flower have, they would have made an understanding and tried to work things out for the better. Plus I don't think that Lily and Snow Flower would have been kind of like lovers to each other.A lot of the history facts were wrong. I don't think that farmer's would have had their daughter's feet bound, epecially when Lily came from a very poor family. If I remember correctly, most of the time it was the nobility and the rich who had their daughters' feet bound. With that in mind, most of the plot of the book wouldn't have happened. I also find it quite odd that no actual Chinese names weren't used in the book, expect for the ones that don't have a translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Nauseating to get Through","review":"I had interest in the friendship concept and it was the first time I had heard of laotong so I wanted to delve into the book. However, the opening chapters telling of the mental abuse of these poor children and then the detailed physical torture of them for pages with the foot binding made me so nauseous and sick I could not read any more. Perhaps if it had been more abbreviated in the beginning and gradually brought in more details I could have stomached it and persevered with the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"The author wrote a great story enriched in history and culture. I received CD Set as a gift. I intitially thought, I am not sure if I am going to like this since I am one for mysteries. Within the first two chapters, I was hooked. I couldn't wait to get to the end to hear how this story ended. The person reading the book did a wonderful job as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This was a book club pick for me. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I loved learning about the lifestyle and traditions of China in the 1800-1900's. It is a sad, touching, beautifally written story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed attempt","review":"I have a habit of finishing a book I start. However, this was one of the very few books I stopped reading in the middle. I am not Chinese and I can not claim I know a lot about China and its history. But even with that small amount of knowledge I could feel that an author has absolutely no understanding of Chinese culture. Lisa Lee used her European mentality to explain to a reader mentality of an Asian person which gave a very distorted view of the East. I admire Lisa Lee's attempt on getting to know Chinese culture, on effort she put on collecting the information. She really tried. But she failed. She failed as a writer and as a historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery personified","review":"This book gives a lot of descriptive information on life in China in the early 19th century, but there just was no joy in the book for me at all. Women had miserable lives and were powerless to do anything about it. The book was very well written, but I just was not in a place in my life where I needed or wanted to read this book--it was a book club selection.

Opinions ranged from \\"absolutely loved\\" to \\"just OK\\". I thought it was pretty riveting - knew nothing of the foot-binding tradition before I read it. Definitely easy to read and well worth the time. Highly recommend. Gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because it was not the caliber of Kite Runner, Glass Castle, Memoirs of a Geisha and others that have stayed with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"I am not a big fan of historical fiction. This book actually taught me not to just dismiss a book because it falls into the historical fiction category. Snow Flower and Lily's story is a compelling tale that spans a lifetime. It is full of the ups and downs of womens lives during that day, or any other day for that matter, full of misunderstandings, secrets and lots of love. It is also very informative but not in a schoolbook way.

It's not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan","review":"China is an interesting country and one that Americans don't know much about other than that it is on the other side of the world and we like chinese food. This book gives you an inside view of family life in China and the role of women in the 18th and 19th century. It doesn't make judgements of what was right or wrong, but lets the reader see the situation and decide for himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"great insight into chinese culture","review":"I absolutely loved this book! it was so inspiring and indelible. The characters really move you. I was sad to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done Tale of Frendship","review":"For lovers of historical fiction, this book is a must read. Lisa See provides insight into a little known, but historically and culturally significant, practice. At a time when a woman's world did not extend far beyond the confines of her home, and when social mobility was almost impossible, Lisa See creates a fascinating story of the friendship and intimacy shared by two lifelong friends. The friendship between Snow Flower and Lily is borne of deception and necessity, and even though both suffer mightily from the misunderstanding that develops between them, the relationship ultimately benefits both women greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRACE, STYLE AND SUPERBLY WRITTEN NOVEL","review":"\\"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan\\" is an enchanting, touching book drawing on the permanence of friendship and culture. For me, oriental culture is as deeply fascinating and breath-taking as waking up in a land before time. Lisa See paints pictures with words, rich with history and tradition, arranged marriages, superstitions and human emotions. She has the unique ability to capture words as if taming a wild bird and holding it in her hand for the rest of us to see.Lily marries above her status and Snow Flower beneath. The two friends are separated and exchange \\"nu-shu\\" written on a fan. The years do not diminish the love and closeness of the two women and only in Snow Flower's last days are the two united. The book is beautiful written in a graceful, poignant fashion and the message runs deep. The book flows like cool water from a stream giving the reader a clear understanding of Chinese culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and vivid with details","review":"This book was well written. The story was very vivid, with lots of detail. I could visualize the places and things described very easily. The story was pretty fast paced as well. The story is multifaceted and has a lot of different things to mull over, more that I've covered in this short review. I felt for these two girls turned women, but in the end all of what they endured was a direct result of the world they lived in. Sad and unfortunately, but it is what it is.Check out my full review here: [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very endearing book about Love, Loss, Triumph,Abuse, Family","review":"I was given this book to read from a friend thinking it was only about footbinding...I found it from the very first page engrossing and fantastic, sad and very interesting.I like to read about other cultures as I find them fascinating but until my friend told me about footbinding I had never heard of it..When I started to read this book it was amazing how the mothers treated their daughters and sad how they were of no value..I knew that in China men were held in high esteem but this was heart wrenching...I enjoyed the book and it is a good read...It basically covers every aspect of their life back them.."},{"rating":"2","title":"bittersweet","review":"I enjoyed the book, but hated the treatment of women at that time and place in history. Reading this gave many things to be grateful for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Enjoyed It","review":"I really enjoyed this book - it was easy to read & hard to put down. The author does a marvelous job of educating the reader in Chinese culture, mindset, and traditions. I really learned a lot, which was what I was hoping for, while enjoying the story as well. I loved the first half of the book - the author takes her time to introduce the characters and their motives & understanding of their place in Chinese society. The second half of the book skips over a lot & moves too quickly, and I found myself wishing she would have kept the same depth and pace as the first half. I also thought that it would have been interesting to switch to Snowflowers' point of view for the second half. But all in all, I loved it, and look forward to reading other books written by Lisa See."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye opening","review":"I was so intrigued by the tradition of foot binding in China, I just had to go online and research it further after reading this book. It opened my eyes to a time period and a culture I don't usually read. This book came up for our book club reading and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think I was more fascinated by the culture of the time more than anything. The characters played well into understanding the time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written Chinese historical novel","review":"The gritty horror and implications of footbinding are dealt with in this book in a matter of fact way. The author introduces us to a world so far removed from our own that you sometimes have to remind yourself, that although this is a work of fiction, the customs, and many of the events did actually occur. I found it hard to reconcile the effective enslaving of women, by binding their feet, with the recognition of formal female relationships, which struck me as quite pragmatic and enlightened!This wonderful story is a mut read for anyone interested in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I can honestly say that this is the first book that made me sob uncontrollably in the end. The tale is heart wrenching yet beautifully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being that I am Chinese/ Mix, I still enjoyed this story!","review":"First of all, I believe full Chinese Bloods would have negative things to say, because the story is just that.. A Story... BUT.. The creative mix of how woman needed each other in those days is a Great tell of the story...Chinese people are to criticle to redicule details in a story because they lack the creative mind...If you are Chinese you might as well not waste your time even reading this story, you wouldn't understand and laugh at it.I believe that it has the full affect of a womans relationship with another, and even shows sides of women that aren't usually displayed in stories.. Well Done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable read.","review":"It was great learning about Chinese culture. This is the kind of book that you plow through, and then get disappointed when you finish b/c then there is nothing else to read. This is definitely an easy book to recommend, I feel like almost anyone would enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waited and waited for it to get better....it didn't","review":"Like a few others, I don't understand why this novel is getting so many positive reviews. Perhaps I was spoiled by \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" and \\"The Good Earth\\", but I found the writing lacking and the dialogue boring. Great plot line on paper, but I don't think the author did it justice! Couldn't wait to just get through it and be done with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Wonderful novel about women in pre-revolution China. Interesting look at a very different way of life. I've always enjoyed Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, so it was interesting to see what a more genteel life might have been like. Graphic descriptions of foot-binding, not for the weak stomach. Otherwise a wonderful tale of an interesting life. I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the story!","review":"I had never read any books by this author and decided to read it after hearing about the movie. I must say that I was so happy that I did!! I haven't cried so much from novel in a long time! Great story that I think any woman or mother can relate with."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Emotional Roller Coaster","review":"Lisa transports the reader to China in the early 1800's. There, you are introduced to little known Chinese customs and rituals of that era. The characters come to life and take you with them through their journey. It's an interesting, educational, and very emotional journey through the trials of China's ancient way of life. Captivateing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside Chinese Women's hearts","review":"This is a beautiful novel yet harsh as it opens our eyes on women's fait in China in the early century.

A very nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Book","review":"Lisa See makes the book real with so much of the Chinese culture. In Snow Flower and the Secret Fan we follow two little girls on their journey to adulthood. The lessons that are learned about friendship and responsibility will help us to look at life in a whole new light. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Both Delightful and Disturbing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this historical fiction novel of two laotang life-long girlfriends in 18th C. China. I found the story both delicate and devastating. The misunderstandings, good intentions, and ultimate change within Lily and Snow Flower's relationship were historically and socially fascinating. The tragedy that ensued between the two of them was an achingly familiar form to many (most?) of us as women, but unfolded by Lisa See in a logical, beautiful, and fragile way that made me crystallize my determination to nurture enduring friendships like the treasured gems they are.The descriptions of mother-love footbinding of young daughters was more than a little disturbing. I felt like I learned much about the social mores of this period in China. Lisa See made reading completely effortless. I swallowed this interesting and thoughtful book up in 2 days. This book was a refreshing surprise after a couple of \\"Bleh\\" summer reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"So intriguing","review":"Just loved this novel. Intriguing as it told a story as well as shared knowledge of another culture. Lovely story telling and I will recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Another Good Book by Lisa See\\"","review":"I ordered this older book by Lisa See after reading Shanghai Girls and Finding Joy. I wouldn't rate it quite as high as the two later ones - a little less well written, I think, but it was well worth reading. I learned a lot more about another historical period in China from this very readable novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of the foot binding","review":"In each of her books the author devotes at least a chapter, if not more to the history and discomforts of foot binding. This particular book was a good history lesson and one can see that her writing is well researched but, the graphic images she paints of the pain is more than I anticipated for a fiction book.Otherwise, it was a great story about coming of age in China during a time when women were considered commodities to be traded for an uplift in society. Good solid historical fiction, not for the squeamish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest book","review":"One of the best books I have ever read Could not put it down once I started it. Felt part of the story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, sad story","review":"A definite education into the lives of Chinese women who experienced foot binding. I found See's descriptions to be vivid and sometimes too much to bear. The primary story of the two women and their love/jealousy relationship is the core of the novel, albeit entwined in their relationships with their mothers.I recommend it for anyone who wishes to learn more about what Chinese women have suffered at the hands of their mothers, while reading about the trials of a young friendship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovley story of deep friendship","review":"A very indepth, well researched portrayal of life, traditions and superstitions of 19th century rural China, but even more so of the love and heartbreak loving someone unconditionally can bring."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable story","review":"This is a beautiful story unlike any other that I have ever read. With tragedy, loss, betrayal, and friendship, this is a story about a deep love. This book was picked to read in my book club and everyone in our club loved this book too. Snow Flower and The Secret Fan incorporates interesting and historical stories about foot binding in rural China, which was interesting in and of itself but the real treasure of the book is the story of the two friends that grow up together, enduring the similar tragedies and life experiences. Their lives will leave you breathless, captivated, and wanting to hear more.Buy one copy for yourself and one for your best friend. I loved this book because I completely identified with the characters, even though the story is set in China over one hundred years ago. Lisa See is an amazing storyteller and I am so thankful to have read this wonderful tale. My favorite book of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"What a relief to find a writer who knows exactly what she's doing, and who executes her vision with such style and craft. This is an enormously moving book, written with grace and intelligence. The vast scope of her research never overwhelms the story, but instead adds depth and weight and texture. It is a very sad account, sometimes oppressively so (just when you think things can't get much sadder, they do), and my only tiny complaint is that that aspect of the writing becomes repetitive after a time. But that's a small thing compared to the experience of the entire book, and I'm very grateful to Lisa See for her competence as a novelist, and for this beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender and Heart-Wrenching - A Lovely Story!","review":"A tender, heart-wrenching story of the love between two friends in 19th century China. Ms. See shares a wealth of information about the lifestyle of Chinese women in a style that is easy to read and engrossing. The reader truly cares about these women - their pain and joys and strengths and weaknesses.The story is a study of contrasts and the ending will have the reader contemplating how they wish to reflect on their own life. Such a lovely story, but a caution: if you cry easily, be certain you have tissues handy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Gem","review":"When you can feel a character's anguish. When you can rejoice in their triumphs. When you can feel sadness with their departure. Then an author has done her job. I finished reading Snow Flower several days ago yet the characters and their lives have continued to fill my thoughts. Lisa See has successfully brought the lives of young women in a distant society straight to the doorsteps of the modern day, independent woman. The differences are startling but maybe not so startling as the similarities. There are so many lessons in this novel that I think most of us will be able to take something away from it.My only problem with the story was that the end seemed rushed and not befitting of the other 90% of the book. Nevertheless it was a pleasant, page-turning read."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be I was expecting something different...","review":"I had very high expectations from this book but unfortunately I was very disappointed. The story is narrated by the main character in the novel after she becomes an older woman. This poses difficulties for the author of the book to allow the narrator of the story to empathize with the readers. Thus, the reader often finds the narrator and the other characters distant and unemotional. On the other hand the readers are presented very detailed information about how it would feel to have to go through foot binding. The author also provides information about nu shu, the secret written language of Chinese women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe more than you want to know about foot-binding","review":"If you've ever wondered about the practice of foot-binding in China, this is the book for you. This book also has a main character who is not entirely sympathetic, but that by the end you like despite her shortcomings. This would be a great book for a book club!"},{"rating":"1","title":"~just a gal","review":"I felt the author was not able to capture the delicate restraint inherent to chinese culture. I did not really enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"I have to agree almost verbatim with Tatjana Kazan's review (second from top). Based on the book jacket's premise, which prompted my purchase, I expected a lot more than See was able to deliver. The historical aspects of the novel were interesting enough to keep me reading, but the plot was loosely woven and the characters uninspiring. Many times it seemed the author had simply taken an emotionally challenging episode from her own life and written a story around it. The syntax was at times so distracting and poorly executed that I actually reread sentences to make sure they hadn't been misprinted. It all made for a very distracting read; I honestly don't understand how this book merits so many positive reviews. This is my first experience with Lisa See's work, and it will be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"One of my favorite pieces of historical fiction. Beautifully crafted characters in a flawless plot. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This book was fantastic. It was a fascinating look at a vastly different culture, with so many details that I felt as if I really became familiar with that time and with the characters' difficulty of life. However, it was also a most affecting story of friendship and love. I was afraid at the start of the read that it would be nothing more than a historical novel, but it truly was a moving and universal story set against a vastly different time and place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Novel","review":"I love historical novels where I learn about another culture and time. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan was heart wrenching. It's a wonderful story of female friendship, betrayal and how one navigates in a restrictive cultural system. My book group loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE disappointment!!!","review":"After reading other reviews I was very excited to choose this as the first book for our book club this year. My first sign that something was wrong was when the author contradicted herself 3 pages into the novel. It just went down hill from there. The contradictions continued and the characters were one dimensional and not thought out. The story line kept me reading the book but not the poetry I was promised. This is a don't bother book.Perhaps Amy Tan's excellent book, \\"The Kitchen God's Wife\\" ruined me for cheap knock off's."},{"rating":"2","title":"female friendship","review":"Not only did I experience another time and place that was as foreign to me as could posssibly be, the strength of female friendship was the most memorable theme in this book. The women endured so much that was only tolerable because of those realationships - even though they were arranged for them...powerful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"entrancing","review":"I read this book years ago, thought I had reviewed it... apparently I did not. The threads of the lives between the two women, woven into the fans...well, they were exquisite. This is a tale to be read again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bond between two girls","review":"My dear friend moved away a few weeks ago and emailed me to suggest that I read this book with her. Every few days we compared thoughts and feelings about the book via text or email. As I read, I was moved by the strength and bond that the Chinese girls shared, their shared suffering and the challenges that everyday life brought. Every few chapters I felt I needed to let it simmer a bit so that I could adequately process the story and the message the author wished to convey. How unfortunate to be born female during this time period. It was sad but there is definitely a clear message in the book that is rewarding and fulfilling.Snow Flower and the Secret Fan: A Novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time!!! Also I've read most of Lisa See's books and this is my favorite of hers (but most of them are great too!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I'm pretty sure I've read something by this author before. I've always liked novels that also teach us about history, or make us understand other cultures. I like how she writes, how she weaves a story. An enjoyable read, but toward the end it felt like the story faltered, the fallout between the friends didn't quite flow like the rest of the story. Nonetheless a fascinating look at Chinese customs from the women's perspective. You wonder how the foot binding could take such a hold for such a long time, but we keep repeating abusive patterns until someone has the courage to heal and break the pattern.I rather enjoy partaking of every day existence, it's quite a skill to make that so fascinating that we keep turning the pages until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I loved this book! Its an easy read, I only read it in four days. It's a great story of friendship and hardship of two young girls that grow up to be friends for lifetime. I also enjoyed a look into the role women played in China. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Flower is a winner!","review":"I am partial to reading about eastern Asian culture. This novel did not disappoint. I loved the relationships established between Snow Flower and most every character. My first Lisa See book and I love that there are so many more of her novels out there for me! Who doesn't love a secret language between women !! So amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan","review":"This is not like your typical Asian book about women in the Chinese culture. The character depht and the easy way of wrinting makes this book an different kind of \\"page-turner\\". Any woman can relate to the different kinds of love described: filial, motherly, spouse and friendship. Even when reading about a culture that remote from the Western Modern world, Lisa See makes it easy to relate to the women in the book and makes one draw parallels to your own life.Good reading also for a Book Club as it enables a smooth discussion and triggers some passionate views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read!","review":"Although I expected the story to be different, it was still enjoyable. This is the third Lisa See book I've read, and plan on reading the rest of her novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Flower - an interesting book","review":"This book was very interesting, especially if you like historical fiction. There was a section that was a shocking and horrific description of the foot-binding process. I have known about foot-binding in general but had never read about it in such detail.The story itself was told very well. There was a lot of detail about everyday life in the time and place. The conflict seemed a bit contrived but that may be a cultural bias. All in all I would recommend the book as a good story about friendship between girls and women."},{"rating":"2","title":"History and culture explained through friendship","review":"This novel is beautifully written. Lisa See takes a formal relationship established between two girls as a vehicle to explain some of the culture and traditions during this period in China. The story is engaging and well presented and will hopefully awaken an interest in some to explore China's history and traditions further. While the novel is primarily about women, and the role of formal societal hierarchies, it is not just *for* women. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Familiar","review":"This book is similar to several other books in that it goes through the life of a traditional Chinese family life and the difficult role of a women in the older Chinese society. The novel aspect is that the story is conveyed via Nushu, which is a secret style of writing only known to women of that region of China, which is historically accurate. Lots of tragic moments, and some surprisingly tender moments between two sworn sisters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought several copies","review":"The highest complement I can give to a book is to send a copy of it to my mother.

It follows the everyday lives of these women from age 7 into womanhood as they learn \\"nu-shu, the secret writing of Chinese women, share their secret dreams, and confront the day to day challenges of being wife, mother, daughter-in-law in a culture where women are prized not for their intellect or talents but for the size of their feet.

I am very glad it was picked because I am not sure I would have read this on my own. The book is about two girls, who become \\"same olds\\" or friends, in 19th century China and remain friends as women despite all the obstacles (distance, marriage, motherhood, socio-economic differences, peer pressure, Chinese customs, in-law interference, etc.) their friendship faces. Even though their friendship took place in a different culture and century, I could still relate to some of the issues these women faced. I was fascinated by the footbinding details and was glad that Ms. See weaved some real Chinese history into her novel. This book made my laugh and cry- just like life and friendships. This is the PERFECT book to buy as a present for your sister or best friend for a birthday or holiday! I will definitely be reading more of Ms. See's books as she is an excellent storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"chinese culture insight","review":"My readining group discussed \\"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan\\" and the consensus was overwhelmingly positive. However I recently read another novel steeped in Chinese Culture which rivals \\"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan\\" and actually surpasses the breadth of Chinese cultural insight. \\"Rabbit in the Moon\\" by Deborah and Joel Shlian, both physicians, offers the reader an in depth look at Chinese culture in the guise of a medical thriller. Quite extraordinary. I recomment both these insightful books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan","review":"Lisa See has a good story here with lots of cultural information, especially in the area of foot-binding. Her writing, though, has much to be desired. She lacks the eloquence that other writers in this genre have mastered. The audio book version of this book is very annoying as it displays an over abundance of insincere sounding drama in the narrator's deliverance."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that research shows--far too much","review":"It's obvious the author did a lot of research & used it as the shaky framework on which to build a very flimsy plot. It's poorly written as well; the foreshadowing couldn't be clumsier, the descriptions are cliche-ridden, the characters are mostly stick figures, & the character development is non-existent--Lily's change of heart at the end is the exception that proves the rule. My book group's opinions were split, but we did have a very good discussion about women's roles in different cultures & how culture--including our own--controls people's lives.

If I didn't have to work for a living I would have read it all the way through in one sitting! I learned more about ancient Chinese culture in this story than I ever knew and that's part of the beauty of it - you are learning about a culture while enjoying a wonderful story. I was fascinated with the process of footbinding, mesmerized by the secret language and the special relationships between the women. As a woman of this day and age, the concept of having that kind of deeply committed friendship with another woman, in a non-sexual way, seems very fulfilling and rewarding. This is a wonderful read and I encourage anyone to delve into its depths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan","review":"Excellent book.

It was such a fascinating fictional re-creation of a woman's life in rural China (as well as an exploration of a little-known\\"secret\\" language) that I not only bought the book for myself, I bought it as gifts for friends and family. Lisa See has done a wonderful job of illuminating a world it is difficult even to imagine from the perspective of 21st century America, and the characters stay with you long after you've closed the covers of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read","review":"The genre is fiction. Yet, the author tells the story from Lily's perspective drawing the reader into the scenes. Once started, I could not put it down until the last word. Very few books rank that statement. It sparked lengthy discussion at our book club meeting and was unanimously loved by all members."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointing Read","review":"The raves over this book give me cause to wonder about the level of discernment among American readers. I must admit my own book group loved it. Perhaps I was at a disadvantage, as I read Pearl Buck's The Good Earth just prior to Snowflower and the Secret Fan. Simply no comparison!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow flower and Secret Fan movie","review":"I absolutely love this movie though it veers from original book,script, I love both. A timely movie about the secret life, traditions , and hardships, of Chinese women never before so well depicted. It includes a twisted to compare with modern day Chinese young women... As we often learn in history we are not always so different. A touching story about the Chinese ways, but also about the heart of a woman, her need for friendship and sisterhood. Does include subtitles. I recommend reading the book as well, to grasp the full meaning behind some things the movie just can not include in time allotted time, A MUST SEE I know this will be on my top 10 list for many years to come. Beautiful, authentic scenery, props, and costumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!","review":"This was a book that was selected for my book club and we all loved it. It was a super fast read and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honor Thy Woman","review":"This book was a wonderful novel written in the early nineteen hundreds. Lily Is writting about her life from her earliest years when at six yaers old she became matched up with another girl named \\"Snow Flower\\" and they became life long friends. This is a story showing how the Chinese cultured women were only wanted so as to please their Fathers, Husbands as slaves and to birth son's for their husbands. They withstood so much pain and torture and probably wouldn't have survived if it wasn't for the women sticking together. A strong friendship bond between women of the early 1800's and culture of another. A beautifully written book By Lisa See. I never realized women had foot binding to keep their feet small and dainty for their future husbands. The love women had towards each other gave them the stength to survive their pain. I recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Didn't much care for this book. Found it boring and tedious. Other than the chapter of foot binding, this one put me to sleep. I know I'm in the minority, because all the women at work loved it. Oh well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it","review":"I wanted to like this book. It seemed like I would like this book, but I didn't like it at all. I put it down halfway through and didn't even finish it. I wasn't crazy about it early on, but then when something awful happened to one of the 2 main characters and I DIDN'T CARE, I knew I was finished with this book.Although I did find fascinating the whole foot-binding tradition and how Chinese women lived then, I was very disappointed in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book... quick read","review":"This is a book club selection for us - it's a quick read - great for summer. Once you start, it's hard to put down. Beautifullt written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Literary Soap Opera","review":"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a very engrossing story about two women growing up in rural China during the days of the emperors. I'm not sure how factual the descriptions of Chinese culture in this book are, but even if there is only some truth to them, they made me glad that I didn't grow up as a peasant in imperial China.The story moves along quickly for most of the book, following the lives of two women from age seven all the way to the point in time that their grandchildren are nearing adulthood.(Spoiler Alert) The plot of this book reminded me a bit of a \\"Lifetime\\" movie or a soap opera in that everything from drug addiction to physical abuse and exile to a refugee camp plagued these women. There's nothing that didn't happen to these gals over the courseLike a soap opera, this book hooked me and didn't let go. I wish that it had ended differently, maybe in a less melodramatic way, but the ending fit the trajectory of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of two families","review":"Another heart-rending look into a family's tragedy. The cultural setting of the book was fascinating and felt somehow familiar, not at all as if the author was educating me about the nuances of pastoral China. I winced when the girls' feet were bound and I cried when I understood that they would follow different paths. This narrator reminded me of Amir, who narrates The Kite Runner, and his love-hate attitude toward his almost-brother Hassan. Emotionally and morally complex, this tale grips the heart and mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!!","review":"Lisa See does a great job of painting the ins and outs of a traditional Chinese household.

Keep the tissues handy for the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan","review":"I received excellent service to order Kindle books through Amazon. The book reminds me of Amy Tan's work. The story is a wonderful account of 2 children's tale from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparable to \\"memoirs of a geisha\\"","review":"This book was a great view into the life of women in China in the 1800's. I would compare it to \\"memoirs of a geisha\\". The book really showed why women had to and choose to go through the things that they did.Before this book I could not imagine why women preformed foot binding. The way that the book presented it make me realize why it got past down from generation to generation. Also why women would want this done to themselves.The other thing that I took from this book was, the real feeling of why women were seen as worthless in this culture. Women were seen as slave housekeeper and baby factories for the men. One saying that showed this feeling of women was the saying that a woman obey her father when unmarried, her husband when married, and her son when widowed. A woman was never responsible for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story","review":"The story takes place during the time period in China when the binding of feet to make girls more beautiful took place. There are some graphic descriptions of this disfiguring custom. This is a great book for book clubs to read and discuss current types of disfigurement we are willing to do all in the name of beauty. This was a beautiful story of relationships between girls growing into old women, as well as the role of women in their families and husband's families. It made me reevaluate my own demands on friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"My sister sent me this book and we both loved it. It was so beautifully written.

The feature I wanted the most was buttons for each individual number. It is very hard to find a product that has this. The individual buttons make it so much easier and faster to set. With other models, you have to hold the Hour, Minute, Second buttons down until the number you want displays. I was also looking for a timer that had a magnet on the back so I could attach it to the refrigerator at eye level. The product description does not mention the magnet for this product.

To see a supposed master walk through a kata rather than display proper form is shameful. Seiuchin kata performed without bent knees, some stance changes pivoted around a stationary leg instead of stepping through, Naihanchi kata walked through with back turned to attacker at times... too many mistakes to even list.my qualification? ni-kyu, many years of doing these katas with a 7th dan who insists on perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Considered To Be A Particular Need","review":"\\"This book has been written to satisfy what is CONSIDERED TO BE A PARTICULAR NEED.After teaching vascular plant morphology at the university level for the past seventeen years and finding no recent book written in sufficient detail and depth to serve as both a text and a reference, I found it necessary to attempt one.....\\"[from the book of the preface by D.

If this had been a well-done movie, instead of a mediocre melodrama, it would have had rises and falls of angst, heartbreak and would have posed serious questions about morality and love.

It makes an unwanted fashion statement, and the metal logo scratches anything painted it comes in contact with. I carefully pried the logo off and the two small holes it leaves are an improvement over the original look.I also think the belt clip positions the phone too high, which makes it uncomfortable to wear when sitting.If you need a slim case, this may be the best choice, but the cheesy logo and the bad clip position makes this a disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOEL GALLAGHER ON DRU","review":"I have not heard this CD.,but it has OASIS songwriter NOEL GALLGHER on drums.....WHO HAD HEARD THIS?

While the Amazon synopsis for the film isn't entirely accurate, what is true is that this is a movie that will keep you in suspense until its unpredictable finale.Cali, Colombia native actors Óscar Borda and Marlon Moreno both offer great performances as criminals Eusebio and Victor (respectively). Despite only having a strong career in Colombian television, Borda shines as the intense but likeable hood that falls victim to something much more mysterious than street violence.If you enjoy thrillers with a healthy dose of gangsters and black comedy thrown in, this is a great DVD to own.

After having been through three 1738's we are switching brands. When accessing remotely, we do not get messages that are there on the machine when returning to the office. Extremely unreliable and counterintuitive compared to excellent past AT&T units. What's going on, AT&T?"},{"rating":"1","title":"AT&T 1728 - Do Not Buy This","review":"I needed a backup answering machine and bought one of these. I had read the reviews but was not really concerned about poor sound quality, etc. since it would only be used as a back-up. I hooked up the unit as directed and all of the lights came on and stayed on. I tried the on/off switch as directed with no change. Pressing the set-up button caused no change. I read the trouble shooting section in the directions but nothing there helped. I then tried the website address that was provided. It was no better than the written directions. I then tried to call the 800 line but could not dial because there was no dial tone. I eventually discovered that the machine was causing the line to act like it was busy. Several minutes with the 800 number provided nothing but an acknowledgement that the machine was defective. It now resides in my trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total piece","review":"I have had one of these for 4 years and it is a total piece of cr@pp. Using it remotely is worthless.

I often had to listen to messages several times. Messages coming from cell phones were usually impossible to decipher. The extra background noise added to the already poor sound quality just turned the messages to complete garble. Today, after two years, it just stopped answering. I turned it off, to see if I could reset it. It would not turn back on again. I unplugged it and plugged it back in.

However, the prompt voice is a little insulting in that it talks to you like you have never touched a piece of electronics in your life and will never understand the technology.As for the voice quality, I was going to replace my 15+ year old Code-A-Phone tape-based machine with my new AT&T; machine until I heard the announce voice quality from the new device. It sounded as if you were trying to talk through a pillow! Needless to say, my old Code-A-Phone machine will be seeing a lot more service until I can find a solid-state machine with voice quality worthy of my use.For some reason, the transition from the earlier Lucent machines (I also have a Lucent A560 with excellent voice quality) to the more recent AT&T; machines has caused a degadation in the voice quality. It probably has something to do with profits."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MUST MISS","review":"This answering machine is, if nothing else, reliable. Reliably pitiful in the sound quality - yes, consistently so. The sound will hearken you back to that TV commercial in which the lady goes to the fast food drivethru and talks into the clown head, only to be unable to comprehend a single syllable the man taking her order is saying. You know the one I'm referring to.Well now you, too, can sound like you've got a mouthful of seaweed and rocks. But, not to worry. Your garbled outgoing message (which will sound like you are talking from inside a deep cavern - and underwater) will be equally bad as the incoming messages that leave you wondering 'Was that call for me?' My advice? Buy a carrier pigeon to get your messages. Less frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy it again","review":"For the many years I have had an answering machine, it has always been AT&T. Even though some of the reviews for this machine were not great, the price was certainly good. Since the others all seemed to have drawbacks as well, I figured I couldn't go wrong with AT&T. What a mistake! The sound is worse than I've ever experienced with an answering machine. Many who have left messages, have asked if my machine is broken. My advice, spend a few more bucks and get a machine that is not as annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Kirk goes to court","review":"In \\"Court-Martial,\\" Captain Kirk has to go to court after he's accused by a little girl of being responsible for her father's death. He is given the death penalty unless he can find a way to prove that he was not responsible. Kirk later finds out that the prosecutor that is against him on the case is a woman he was once involved with.I recommend getting \\"Court-Martial\\" because it is one of the best episodes of the original series and it will keep you interested while you wonder if Captain Kirk can get out of this case alive. It has many memorable scenes such as Dr. McCoy using the heartbeat device onboard the Enterprise and when Spock figures out something that might help Captain Kirk with his case. The lawyer that defends Captain Kirk makes one of the best speeches ever in any TV show.

Then, in the interest of completing my collection, I order this title. Granted, taste is subjective, but if you are buying this thinking you are adding to your collection of New Order/New Order-esque titles, you will probably be disappointed. My primary beef with it is that neither the overall quality of songwriting nor the quality of Gillian's vocal work is up to the standards of the New Order catalog, or the other side project albums. Specifically, the songs are mostly lacking in melody and depth of structure, and the vocals are thin. Then again, I'm not sure any female vocalist would \\"fit\\" the expectation of a New Order sound.

The first night I put this out (used on original Mouse Away solid packs) I caught a mouse in a snap trap right next to it. So, it didn't repel. Continued catching mice for the next 4 nights-probably the same family? Since then, I've left the Solid Mouse Away packs out and haven't seen a mouse. Perhaps it's repelling new families of mice? We've gone all out though using a terribly smelly garlic spray outside of our home, glue traps in the garage and crawl space plus snap traps in the kitchen above the garage. I'm continuing to keep the Mouse Away around b/c I feel it smells good and is safer than anything else I could use with kids around. May be worth it depending on what you're trying to repel.

It picks up light poorly aswell and the flash just didn't work. Distorted color.... The camera photos turned out nice... but once again without a flash it was hardly worth what I paid.

Even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre.

It's really only a 2mp camera, even with that, pictures came out grainy and distorted. Mp3 playback was lousy- mine only played back out of one side. The flash never worked properly, pictures were always too bright, and it ate up batteries like nothing. And rechargables didn't have enough juice to fire the flash more than once. To top it all off, the screen stopped working within 90 days of purchase, and is currently in for repair. It was ridiculous, but mine was an early unit.

The first thing you should do after purchasing this product is to test the \\"voice recorder.\\" I like to call it the \\"noise producer.\\" You cannot understand the playback for the recording you just made. You hear mumbling against static. Try out the flash when taking a photo. It has to charge first; that's just like a one time use camera.<br /><br />When you're satisfied with those two features, the next one for testing is the video camera. Wait. It has a video camera? I couldn't tell.

He saturates the text with unnecessary details, which make the book almost impossible to read. Thornton is very knowledgeable and includes a lot of good information in his book but he needs to learn how to write. He just lists fact after fact without providing enough information on specific events or people.

However, in astrological terms and usage, the information here is next to useless, and something of a joke in the astrological community. The book attempts to raise a minor aspect into the majors, and it simply won't wash. It's a puff piece for Tyl in a way, and really, astrological students would be so much better off reading the works of John Frawley and other cutting edge astrologers.

About the 3rd shot with the original batteries the camera battery light was flashing red. I flipped the battery door open ripped the batteries out, put them back in and it said 2/3 strength again. Last night I had 2/3 of a battery, tried to take a shot and it just died. The screen went black, the lense was still extended and that was it. I've gone through about 4 sets of batteries in 45 shots. I used to shoot with an SLR and know what I'm doing but I can't seem to get a clear picture even holding extremely steady. This was my first digital and I'm looking to replace it soon.

I had the same issue with the short battery life and found that using regular alkaline batteries worked better. It seems the batteries drain even with the camera turned off. I verified this by removing the batteries after every use for a time, finding they lasted much longer by doing this. I don't recall indoor picture quality, but Canon isn't all that great indoors either.

You can probably find a better value for your money elsewhere. I just wanted something to take out to the bars and get pictures with my friends, and it was always a hassle getting it to actually take the picture. No matter what setting (night was the worst), you need to hold the button down for 2-5 seconds before it flashes. Everyone would end up breaking their smile by the time it took. Also, not it's fault, but I didn't realize it took AA batteries; it wasn't a Lithium Ion battery. If the camera was NOT EVEN ON, it would drain the batteries. It would literally drain the batteries within a day if they were in the camera, no matter if it was on or off. I did a workaround by placing one battery in the wrong way. As you can imagine, going to the bars and constantly flipping one battery was not my ideal camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"E500 Battery Drain and inconsistent focus","review":"Do not buy this camera.

There are two main storylines: cracking the enigma code before a shipping convoy is destroyed, and discovering the motives and intentions of the mysterious Claire Romilly.Both these storylines revolve around the main character, Tom Jericho, a cryptanalyst working on breaking the german naval enigma code.'Enigma' starts off very slowly, and after 90 pages, I was about to put the book down and move on. However, Harris really starts getting to the heart of the action about this time, and the book really takes off. Perhaps he could have condensed the first 90 pages and made this book five stars, but taken as a whole 'Enigma' is quite entertaining.If you enjoy books about wartime codebreaking, you will definitely want to read this book.

Or somebody exceedingly eccentric, finding patterns everywhere: Fibonacci numbers, Penrose tiles, Pascal triangles, and other mathematical phenomena.

I consider myself to have above average mechanical skills and tools since I am a former mechanic with a major airline. I read the instructions before starting the install. Th 752D at least 50% quieter than our previous garage door opener. The wall switch has an IR sensor that illuminates the opener light when it senses body heat walking by it. Great when we enter the garage at night since the light automatically turns on. Another bonus is that the opener light is also activated when the garage door is open and somebody walks in the garage. This is a great safety feature so you can see where you are walking and not walking around a dark garage. I strongly recommend this opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great unit, highly recommend it.","review":"Bought to replace an ancient Chamberlain unit that was still working, but the door had been upgraded at some point to a heavier insulated unit and we could tell it was struggling to lift it. Plus we had only one remote opener that was the old flip the code numbers inside style, so that was a pain to find a second opener that worked. So...we decided to get a 21st century unit. We love this opener! Many nice features, especially the safety features for small kids that could get stuck underneath a closing door. Also the indoor control has a motion sensor that turns on the light when you step into the garage. The old door lift had none of that. Taking down the old unit and doing the new install was 4 1/2 hrs. That was with myself and a handy friend. We both are fairly good at doing odd jobs, very adept, so to those that said it was up in an hour...hats off to that! But I can highly recommend this opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose a DIFFERENT product.","review":"Missing Keypad, the installation was a NIGHTMARE, brackets were missing and didn't fit correctly, the unit itself does function well, just the hardware and such as well as instructions are incorrect.

It's so quiet compared to our old one! It took about 6 hours to install and my husband is very, very handy. I read the (very thorough) directions - it took him a little longer than is should have because he didn't want to read so closely before I got home to help! (Also - he thought the sensors from the old door should work so he spent a bunch of time trying to figure out why the door wasn't working while I kept saying we should just install the new sensors - when we did the door worked immediately!) The moral of the story is read and follow the directions and it will be easy enough! Door is super fast and really quiet - we wish we'd installed it years ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mtv Unplugged","review":"Para los que nos gusta la musica medio latina, medio gitana y medio pop, alejandro llena todas las espectativas y con este disco nos da a sus fans que lo hemos querido tanto tiempo, nuevas versiones que nos llenan de emoción al oirlas, comprelo que no se arrepiente y seguro las oira y reoira todas una y otra vez."},{"rating":"2","title":"LO MEJOR","review":"ME PARECE QUE ESTE ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES ALBUNES QUE ALEJANDRO SANZ HAYA PODIDO HACER EN TODA SU CARRERA.

He clearly blows away his contemporaries with his talent for writing and composing his own music (and his guitar playing isn't too shabby either). I had the pleasure of seeing him in concert this summer and it reminded me very much of this \\"Unplugged\\" CD. I will admit I am not always a big fan of these \\"unplugged\\" releases, but with Alejandro Sanz it doesn't matter.

Other 5.1 has green being front, black being rear and orange being sub/center. But this card doesn't follow the standard color code. It also has confusing labels as SPK1, LINE, MIC, SPK2, SPK3 starting from the game port. Sound comes out from center speaker no matter I plug the rear wire in SPK2 or SPK3.

I have been pleased with this case in that it did protect the phone from several drops and fit the phone well. All the holes were in the right places, etc. My complaint stems from the facts that after about 4 months, the spring clip that holds the phone to your belt began to loose its ability to keep the phone secure. It fell off the belt several times while seated. The chief complaint is that the material that hides the actual spring metal of the clip has started to unravel at the seam and has left the metal exposed. This is due to the wear of placing the phone on your belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protection? What protection!","review":"I bought this case for one reason. And that reason was to protect my phone. Yea, sure it worked for 2 months, MAYBE! Then after that, I looked at my phone to make a call and the screen was cracked. And that was WITH the case on. The reason I gave it two stars instead of one was because it fit tightly around my phone and I was able to get to it guickly when I needed in an emergency.

I've liked everything else I've read so basically I'd recommend anything but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring","review":"Didn't think Laymon was able to write a slow paced, boring book until I read Blood Games.

Don't waste your times with this one, when Laymon's written so many fun, creepy, and fast paced novels such as Island, Bite, and In the Dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"While reading this I realized that Blood Games holds the dubious distinction of being the worst book I have ever read. Forget for a moment that it is not scary and is in fact BORING-Laymon wrote this book as if from the point of view of a hormonal 13 year- old boy in the 1950s who wants to be a writer when he grows up but doesn't know yet that he has no talent! These grown women (college graduates) do and say things I've never seen or heard any other woman do. They talk like men (or perhaps 13 year old boys) and use language I haven't heard in atleast 25 years. I was bored to tears by all the talk about their bare body parts (no-these were not sexual situations.) No, women do not frequently hang out naked together for no reason, No, we do not walk naked in the woods because it's TOO HOT to wear a tank top, No, I did not finish this book and No I will not try another Laymon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just when horror couldn't get any campier...","review":"No, that's an innacurate description. True horror is far from campy. Richard Laymon might be highly acclaimed overseas, but I doubt he'll receive that reception here. This is, by far, the WORST book I have ever read. Someone mentioned that it was fast paced..what??!! The only fast thing about this story is the speed in which all five females remove their clothing. The way Laymon describes the constant nudity is more sickening than any of the gory scenes in the book - which are humorous at best. B movie fodder. The dialogue is totally unrealistic, the relationships are unrealistic, the flashbacks (all 8 million of them) are just plain ANNOYING and not even worth reading. This book is not worth the $6.99 cover price. Had I already read it, I wouldn't have accepted it for free!!

I was expecting some fun, some chills, some scares and it really only gave me goosebumps thinking of the fact that I paid for this when I could have gotten something better to read for the price I paid.Don't get me wrong it had some scary moments but was overall it was a flop. Much of it was boring - especially the flashbacks which went on for chapters. The ending felt forced and rushed.And oh man did the women in the book run around naked a lot. C'mon even when you are being pursued by a madman you cover up!

Ever since Homer, or the book of Judges, war poems have been written to tell us what happened, to whom, why. Richard Marius's fine selection, with his introduction to it, opens today's reader to the Civil War's horror, pathos, loss, and the emotions which are easy to forget, or worse still, to romanticize. It's a broad selection, from \\"John Brown's Body\\" and \\"Dixie\\" to today's meditations, in Derek Walcott's \\"Arkansas Testament,\\" on the legacy of hostility toward blacks, North and South: the Civil War, to Walcott, is still to be won.

It lacks Metheny's usual melodic vision and Mehldau's usual proficiency. The album is muddled. Many of the tunes are merely noodling, and go nowhere.These two are individually great artists, Metheny ranks as one of the all time jazz guitar greats, but this album was not a good idea. Either they were rushed and did not put their best efforts into the compositions, or they had a bad six months.I would NOT recommend this album to any Metheny or Mehldau fans, and I own nearly every album of Metheny's and have listened to Mehldau extensively.Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turkey of the Year Award 2006...

I tried to believe that as a jazz musician, I would be able to learn from this music. I tried to believe that Mehldau would balance out the guitar and I would actually enjoy this CD. I even listened to it more than once (more than twice) to see if maybe I started to \\"get\\" it or it grew on me.

This book chronicles the worlds of two distinct families that intersected in this city too busy to hate, the Dobbs and the Allens.Atlanta has become a hustling city of the south but it evolved from a quaint city which was a cross roads of transportation.This story is about family, race relations and the evolving south and how it's evolution into a metropolis was shaped by these two representative families.A beautifully written history of Atlanta and how it continues to rise as the symbol of the city, the Phoenix represents."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is A Great Way To Learn About Atlanta's History","review":"As a recent transplant to the city of Atlanta, I didn't know much about Atlanta's history.

The author skips, or lightly brushes, many events and periods important to the development of modern Atlanta. He barely mentions Reconstruction, prohibition, the impact of railroads, airports, highways, etc... The book is, however, a startling biography. As you might expect, he reports heavily on topics and events which were of particular importance to the development of the Dobbes and Allen families, and happened to be important to Atlanta as well. Though Pomerantz is a journalist, his writing style is lyrical enough to be interesting, but beware--this book is dense with facts. You're going to read a lot of numbers.

The writing style is very engrossing. The first 30 pages or so is on the dry side and filled with too many names and dates to keep up with, but it's definitely worth it to work your way through it. After the Civil War is over and Reconstruction begins, the book settles nicely on the lives of two key figures in Atlanta's history (one white and one black) and follows both families for several generations. BOTH stories are equally important and fascinating. The reader gets both a sense of what it was like to be considered a second-class citizen and have to fight relentlessly for rights and respect, AND what it was like to be a part of the white establishment and try to evoke change and maintain respect. This book is not just a book for Atlantans, like myself.

I have always known that Alli leaches vitamins and minerals from your body. They state very clearly on the instructions to take a multi vitamin at bed time because of this.I have always taken a multi vitamin at bed and eat a very healthy diet, however I recently went to the eye doctor because I was losing my eyesight. At 35 years old I found out that I have early onset of cataracts. Early onset of cataracts is frequently caused by a lack of vitamins and minerals. This is a frequent affliction for young People in very poor countries with inadequate and poor nutrition I put two and two together and realized what caused it. I immediately stopped taking Alli. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! IT WILL MAKE YOU JITTERY","review":"I took this for 3 days was fine those days, no symptoms....

Went to doctor, he said it was the Alli, after about 4 hours was better and no more of those symptoms! Didn't take it again and its been 4 weeks and none of those symptoms again so I know it was the Alli! The product doesn't even suggest those type of symptoms! It must be something hidden in the ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"it didn't work for me","review":"THE ALLI PROGRAM HAS NOT WORKED AT ALL FOR ME EVEN AFTER THREE WEEKS.

You would have a lot more fun and do a better job than Alli. The packaging and instructions are well designed, but when you read the fine print, you will find that you are advised to wear a panty liner to handle the \\"accidents\\" that most likely will happen to you. If you like gas and oil, then this is the pill for you! All this for a 50% increase in potential weight loss per month (about 1-2 pounds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alli experience","review":"I have discontinued use of this product because of the extreme change in bowel movement.

I remember taking Alli when it first came out years ago and it seemed to work then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"The side effects of alli are not worth it for taking this pill.

Even after all of that, I lost a measly 1 lb which I would've lost anyway without the Alli pills. My weight during that time went up and down +/-2 pounds.I am on the boderline of \\"normal\\" and \\"over weight\\" so I don't have a lot to lose but 1 measly pound is not worth the cost and trouble of having to count your fats and calories.The only thing I found Alli worthwhile for was as a constant reminder that I needed to watch what I ate and get some exercise. I get that from my conscience and it doesn't cost a thing.So, no more Alli for me. It was not worth the treatment effects (which subsided after a couple of weeks for me once I learned to control fat intake) nor the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I was not able to continue with this product.

I read all the reviews and felt that because of the gross side effect, i will be forced to be more careful what I eat. I started taking it for a month and did cut on my high fat food.A month later, I wasn't blown away with the result, my weight is pretty much the same. Also, I read Public Citizen's Health Research Group said Alli, has been shown in studies to cause pre-cancerous lesions in the colons of mice. And, because there are no long-term studies of the drug's effect on humans, it's really unclear what the long -term effect is. Fen Phen started out safe, right? glaxo will never tell you if it is unsafe.I feel there is no way I will risk getting cancer over sth not even that effective.

I am not fat, but gained 9 lbs. when I quit smoking and haven't been able to lose them. Alli specifies that you can eat no more than 15 grams of fat per meal--or 45 grams of fat per day. And Alli promises to block absorption of 25% of that fat--which equates to approximately 11-1/4 grams of fat per day. Do you know how many calories are in a gram of fat? I didn't, but I discovered that it was 9 calories ... yes 9 calories in a gram of fat. That meant that this new, expensive wonder drug was blocking absorption of 101 calories per day!! At that rate, Alli will help me lose one pound (3500 calories) every 34 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy again","review":"While I do see that the product reduces the amount of fat that is absorbed, I wouldn't really categorize it as a weight loss aid. You have to do much more than just take the pills. Also, you can get the same results, without any side effects, just by watching what you eat and cutting the amount of fat you take in. Reducing caloric/fat intake and exercise are still key to weight loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger go away from it *** update ***","review":"i removed my old review cuz its not worth itUPDATEthe starter kit was goodbut wen i order new one not the starter its not working for me ?! and even i cant go to toilet for 1-3 daysand i got sooooooo much gas .. i stop use it and the gas didnt go from me even i stop it more than 1 yr and am still with gas problemi even contact them so i need just an advice they told me sry we cant support u out US ?!!! really its just an advice of my used i need to know but thats good they didnt give me answer i stop it before i dieSTAY AWAY FROM ANY EASY WAY JUST STOP UR FAST FOOOOOOD AND DO SOME CARDIO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alli Weight Loss Product","review":"Did not Like this product at all.No loss of weight.I exersize regularly & walk every day to and from work and everywhere I go.I eat a well balanced, high fiber, nutritious diet & still experienced the disgusting side effects that comes w/this product.no thanks, I will pass on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!","review":"Me and my girlfriend wanted and needed to lose weight. We decided that she would take ALLI and I would just eat a low fat diet and exercize with her as ALLI reccommends.The results: After 1 month I had lost 6 pounds and she had lost 4 pounds. We both did the exact same thing besides she took ALLI for a month and I didn't.The kicker: She was miserable and was finshed with ALLI after the end of the month. This because of the continuous gas and oily discharge that happened if she ate the slightest bit of fat. It was absolutely discusting to think that people would endure these side effect for that little bit of weight loss.Not to mention I won! How'd I do it? I exercized 3 times a week by walking and riding a bike and I ate sweets only on Saturday. I cut the starches & sugars and cooked with olive oil plus ate wheat bread for sandwiches.Summary: This pill isn't worth it! You're making ALLI rich while they laught at your bathroom difficulties.

I have had none of the other, more violent side affects... no oily discharge or anything.And I know I ate some food with more than 15 grams of fat!That said, I am really on the fence. No noticable weight loss yet. I am going to stick it out since I paid for the starter kit, and only time will tell if its worth continuing.

The answer was very little, other than seeing many droplets of fat that I was grateful weren't on my thighs. I think I'd have to eat a whole pizza or a handful of doughnuts before suffering an accident.If you are taking this, read the instructions. Especially the part about taking a nightly multivitamin.

The company isn't kidding about needing to wear a maxi-pad because of the amount of oily spotting. It's not just a droplet, and it's bright orange in color. It's gross and it will stain your clothing and your toilet. You really have to watch what you eat when you take this drug, but then again, that's the idea!

I only lost 4lbs of water weight on the first day and then nothing else. The side effects were not as bad as I thought they would be, and I think it's because I was following the low fat diet closely. Needless to say if there was anyway I could get my money back I would.

Beware the extra flatulence and I'd strongly advise against taking it with any but the most fatty meals, and certainly never while on a trip because it can, \\"kick in\\" with little warning.However as of the date of this review, the company appears to be on the lam, supposedly they have lost the lease on their manufacturing facility and it's creating a shortage with prices literally going through the roof. Were it not for this I'd give the product a 3-star rating, maybe even 4. The current insane prices have convinced me this company is being run by idiots, therefore the 1-star rating. I am hoarding the few pills I have left and will try to find some kind of substitute along with modifying my diet and do without them.

I have increased my activity level to about 20 minutes a day at least 5 days a week. My calorie intake is about 1400 calories a day. This is a major improvement for me. So far I think I may have lost 2 pounds. Was I hoping for more results from Alli? Yes. Will I stop using Alli? No. We are warned that this is not a magic pill. I bought a 6 week supply. I will stick it out. I am hoping together with my motivation and Alli's help I can lose weight. In all I have about 50 pounds to lose.

As I am a little overweight at this point, I was looking for something that would help me get back into shape. As I understand it, Alli is meant to keep new fat from causing weight gain but not meant for old fat. It seems to do what it was advertised to do. I would recommend it. I didn't have all the nasty side effects that were previously detailed by other members, so I think it's a case-by-case issue (but then again, my case is not the norm).

I went to the publisher's website and listened to an audio sample, which was nice and slow (and relaxing), so, I decided to order it.After receiving it and listening to it most of this Bible is NOT like the audio sample on the website, the audio seems to be sped up and is NOT relaxing to listen to.The Bible version is great, but the audio quality is lacking for the reason mention above. Most audio Bibles I've listened to are similar to this one in that the CD sounds like the reader is speed reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good Narration - but very poor audio engineering on CDs","review":"E. W. Jeffries reading this version of the Bible is a great work. I wish the CD mastering and CD audio engineering were equally as good. On 3 CD's in the New Testament, the last few tracks simply can not be heard because of skipping and clipping. The white space compression between words and sentences is excessive resulting in last word in the spoken sentence not finishing. I understand from the Lockman Foundation that this CD set is being re-mastered to eliminate these issues.

The prose in these books is as sumptuous as the life seems to be--rich in detail, rich in emotion and rich in love for the place, the people and the food. Through Ms. DeBlasi's pen, we are immersed in tender moments, breathtaking settings and relationships of great depth, which brought tears and laughter and a hunger to share such a life. Most surprisingly, I came away thinking life can be more deeply appreciated no matter where we are.

Grunts and snorts, but grunts and snorts researched in chronological retrospect; from his vast knowledge of present-day languages, he traced language backward to its beginning sounds, much like he took modern-day Liverpool slang and projected it into the future for the speech in A Clockwork Orange (his admittedly worst and regrettably best-known book). He read and reviewed dictionaries for the London Times, always finding a lively and humorous way to present his serious content. This same man, as a linguist, produced a lively analysis of language in A Mouthful of Air. For anyone who loves words and language and the way they roll off the tongue, Anthony Burgess is a must"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This album is not worth it. I took my time and listened to all the songs it had, and they just weren't all that good. The music was strange, and not at all catchy. The tunes were not popular. I would say Ian Van Dahl's a much better artist for this kind of music, not Lasgo."},{"rating":"2","title":"hooray","review":"I was never that impressed with Lasgo. Their song \\"Something\\" was one of the first tunes that got me into this genre, but I lost interest in them after I heard DJ Encore feat. Engelina, Da Buzz, and E-type. So I was skeptical of this CD and I didn't really want to like it but I can't help myself. I don't care for the instrumental or their cover of \\"Hold Me Now\\" but other than that this album is top-notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good dance album!","review":"I heard Lasgo through a few dance compilations. They sound good on this effort. The album's diverse in that there's not the same kind of dance beat. The lead singer sounds superb in the songs' many chord changes. I like Surrender, Still, the remake of the Thompson Twins' 1984 hit Hold Me Now and others. There are a few '80s inspired songs within this album, but they balance out well with the 2005 modern songs. The male singer who sings only once does a good job with singing those repetitive 4 lines within spare sections of the song. The section where he processes his voice as if going through a tunnel is quite unique. Funny how these people can create these sounds in the studio. This is the first 2005 album I have gotten to hear and it is a strong way to describe some of the sounds of the new year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"recomended","review":"2day i just ordered this cd from barns and noble! cant wait til it comes in! i love the songs surrender and all night long! i also recomend the fallowing cds and artists,everytime we touch by cascada,a fever you cant sweat out by panic! at the disco,1on 1 by rupee,decemberunderground by afi,greatest hits by ace of base,flyleaf by flyleaf,sound advice by shapeshifters,and end of gray by decyfer down! buy them all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible......don't waste your money","review":"I was very impressed with their first album, almost every song was good, but this album was not worth purchasing to me.

When we got to our destination, we drove around and around the blocks listening to the book instead of going in. While I don't consider this the best book I've ever listened to, it has a way of engaging the mind that is provocative. There is a lot of sensitivity in the material and the reading of it. I'm 50 years old, so maybe this held more meaning for me. The mark of a good read is that it sticks in the back of the mind. This one definitely does so. I recommend this audiobook very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty Pop Rock","review":"This is a great collection of the music of one of the best singer songwriters in \\"Pop Rock\\" ever.

You may have heard some of her songs on movie or TV soundtracks, just not on American radio.This really is a very well put together best of collection and is a great introduction to her work.

I've just bought these creatures this morning for my pc but realized after the setup that touch sensitive volume buttons on little speakers are not working (It has fixed sound, I couldn't turn up or down the volume). There can't be any problem with my pc speaker connection because I was using cambridge soundworks (3 piece: 2 speakers + 1 subwoofer), and it was working fine for almost 6 years. In addition to that, speaker's connection with the subwoofer is so sensitive that with a tiny movement of the subwoofer the sound cut off. You have to turn it off and then on again (Needless to say, I checked the connections couple of times). So, as some of the other unfortunate critics say I believe this is a faulty product. Why 2 stars ? It's noting to do with the sound, it is for the cool design. If you still insist on that product, it's your choice but I would say try it before purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a contender","review":"Recieved these speakers last week. At first glance, they are esthetically pleasing. Operations and hookup is fairly simply,no different than any other pc speakers you have seen before.When I tested them out for the first time,the disappointment began to set in. The sound was barely audible no matter what options or settings I choose.At first I thought the problem might be my soundcard,but after testing two other speaker systems on my PC it was my conclusion that the speakers were definately at fault.Also,I would like to add that the volume adjustment buttons on the actual speaker seemed as if they were stuck. No amount of pressing would adjust the volume whatsoever.So I am now in the process of returning these for a refund and continue the search for a good set of speakers to complete my system,these obviously will not do the job.Sad.I gave 2 stars for ease of setup and looks, I just wished the preformace would have been just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed - NO MIDS!!","review":"Hello to all from a professional musician.

Many people reviewing the product on Amazon mention the \\"powerful bass\\" and \\"crisp highs.\\" Yes, these speakers have both, but there are practically NO MIDS! This is a *big* problem. It makes nearly everything sound empty and devoid of substance. Bottom line is, if you're looking to hear music sound good, KEEP LOOKING!

VERY LOUD if u want them to be. The sub is a great design and really rumbles if u put it up to full base. I love how the speaker volume changes as well, instead of being a turn knob on one of the satellite speakers, there is a plus and minus symbol on the speaker that u simply touch. it doesn't go in like a button, its like a static or touch sensor, it knows ur finger is there, and the volume goes up or down depending what symbol your finger is touching, its just kinda cool and high tech how the volume changes :-)but other then the fancyness and the coolness of the volume buttons, these are still JBL and along with that comes great quality, so all around I'd say these speakers are a great buy, I couldn't be happier for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bangin' Speakers","review":"These speakers are highly exalted above your normal computer speakers.

I thought a fuse was blown. I thought the pump was clogged. Pulled the pump out of the pool. It was smoking hot and NOT clogged. Let it cool down. Assuming it was \\"Thermally Protected\\" as the label clearly stated. In the end, motor frozen, pump useless, in the trash. THIS PUMP STINKS! Response from Flotec; \\"Out of warranty.\\" Run away!!!I have a very small marine 'Rule Automatic 500 GPH 12 Volt Bilge Pump'. Had it for 10+ years. Run dry many many times. NEVER fails. Think it was $50 on sale at West Marine. Moral of the story.

The variety of styles here--poetry, play, prose, short-short, dialogue--make it great for teaching form, as well as introducing any literarure or creative class to the genre of Russian absurdism. The introduction, written by NYU Lit. professor Eugene Ostashevsky, is a very clear (but not dumbed down) explanation of the Oberiu movement, their purpose and place in Russian history--if, like me, you're not qualified to explain it to students yourself. Also, the selection and pieces here are great. The Kharms especially. I'd never read Alexander Vvedensky before and now he's one of my favorite writers. (Check out \\"A Certain Quantity of Conversations,\\" which is a brilliant play, of sorts, in ten mini-acts). I'd rec. this book for anyone who's a writer (great for inspiration) or teacher.

The content of this putatively \\"absurdist\\" collection was such as my twin three-year-olds could readily pen without a moment's preparation. Noting that Kharms was among the authors represented, I expect to at least see something of the quality of his \\"The Old Woman,\\" but I did not. It seemed as if the anthologists sought high and low for the poorest, leanest possible representation of every participating author. Vvesensky (yes, that's the proper spelling) was a waste of paper.

This book, however, takes a different approach. It tells about situations that came up for pilots during actual flights where the courage and ability of those pilots, as well as others, were sorely tested. The actual emergencies chosen are real, frightning, and even scary to read. The author does an excellent job of holding the suspense as he leads you through the emergency, minute by minute. The chosen crisis are also hold-onto-your-chair, and nail-bitting suspense ridden as you read along. It is an excellent narrative, and well written. I highly recommend this read for anyone who wants to know what it is like to be a pilot, of any sized aircraft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it DON'T buy it !","review":"After reading the first two reviews I was willing to give this movie a try.

If you are the kind of person who likes bombing the enemy's base with Nuclear Bombs, and SCUD missiles, this game is for you! You can play online with up to 7 other people. You can choose from three teams - USA, China, and GLA (terrorists). All 3 are pretty equal in power and all equally fun to play as. I highly recommend this game!

I was hoping that Generals would be equally as fun for its time. However, with no fmv to reward me for my accomplishments, this game falls short. There is really no incentive to buy this game over anything made in the 90's, except slightly better graphics.The AI is gross as well. Having a group of tanks move in to take out a bunker is like pulling teeth. If there is a small obstical in the way, they won't move around it, and one guy will try to go in while the rest decide it's not possible.It's one of the many games that feels like EA just shoved out the door as quick as they could to make a quick buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest war simulation of all the times","review":"this is the greatest war game/simulationas much as i like first person shooter game i loved this game too because i got to be the \\"general\\" and instead of having just a sniper rifle or rocket launcher i can have all US army resourses. however it's not just enaugh have all resources.

It's not extremely imbalanced and the graphics are very pleasing to the eye.The reason I gave the overall game 1 star is becuase of the poor technical quality. The minimum system requirements are an 800 MHz processor, 128 MB of RAM, and a 32 MB video card (GeForce 2 or higher).I have a 2.4 GHz processor, 1024 MB of RAM, and a 256 MB GeForce FX 5500. Should be able to run the game smoothly, but even on lowest settings and resolution I get extremely poor framerates and occasional crashes to desktop. Usually 5-10 minutes into a game the fps drops to 5-10 and it's impossible to play. EA has stopped supporting this game so there are no patches to fix this issue that a lot of people seem to be having. Do not buy this game, even if your computer should be able to handle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"can get tiring........","review":"good, solid, game. but the AI isn't anything speicial. eventually you get tired of seeing the same battle happen over and over and over again.

I have every C&C game except for Covert Ops, Counter-strike, and Retaliation. Generals doesn't seem to fit in between C&C and Red Alert. It is years above Red Alert and a few years behind Command & Conquer, which doesn't make sense because the tiberian meteor was supposed to hit earth sometime then. And what happened to the Allies, Soviets, GDI, and Nod? GDI was formed before the meteor so instead of USA, China, and GLA it should be GDI against some other side maybe even GLA. It's a pretty good game as I said above but you would need a very, very fast computer to play without annoyance. I gave it two stars for a cool war game.

Not just in the racism, but many things about this game feel different.Also the system requirements for this game are ridiculous. It requires loads of hard disk space and a very fast machine.

There also was never any detail in the plot besides zombies running around (very fast, unlike Romero zombies) eating people etc. The acting was horrible, no improvisation. It seemed as though everyone was reading word for word from a script. The national guard actors were so funny. Being an army vet myself, I found it funny that the guys were wearing 1990 style uniforms with beards and double barrel shotguns for weapons in some cases.

The one big traffic jam scene was so horrible i couldnt tell which ones were the zombies or the humans.The lack of special effects/make up/costumes/acting made it impossible to tell who was who.There were 2 or 3 zombies that were made up pretty good but they just kept flashing back to them every couple of minutes when the attacks started.I wouldnt even recommend this movie to rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Rent It","review":"All aspects of the cinematography, writing, acting, everything was completely amateurish in my opinion.

It was a shock to most involved in the project that Miles was in declining health. That Miles found the power inside himself to play says more about the person than performer.If anything, the sound was \\"overproduced\\" due to the number of musicians used by Jones.

The only thing I wanted to find was how the heater control valve was actuated.

A must for the serious music lover and collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much new here","review":"Dave is a truly gifted drummer, but he never shows how he pulls off the complex rolls and grooves he plays, but only demonstrates how to hold and manipulate the sticks. He states that the traditional grip is better for soft delicate playing, which may be true for him, but the great Bill Stewart has no trouble playing soft delicate passages with the matched grip he always uses.The music on this dvd and on his cd's is written and arranged to demonstrate his speed and chops with non stop cymbal accents. It lacks the feeling and emotional playing of drummers like Bill Stewart or Jack Dejohnette. Dave needs to strip his drum kit down to the essentials and get in touch with the music again. Adding more cymbals, hi hats, and drums does nothing to enhance the music or improve the writing.The kit he plays now must be a nightmare for his drumtech/roadie.One can learn to develop technique much better by watching the JoJo Mayer instructional dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Helpful","review":"I got this book in order to refresh myself on the media planning process and it was very helpful. The different topics were clearly outlined and reflected a logical thought process.It even goes into non-traditional media which I have not seen in any other books.My only disappointment related to the way it addressed planning in markets which do NOT have exhaustive media information. I'm sure that was not the intent of the book anyway, so that's my problem.A good, informative read...must see for new media buyers/planners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!! Waste of Money!!","review":"This book is totally outdated, not detailed enough, and completely vague. I had to refer to other advertising books when I read this book because it was so BAD! Everthing in this book was really vague and the authors contradict themselves. One minute they reccommend a particular stragety--the next minute they say the strategy doesn't work--therefore it becomes confusing and not detailed enough. Do not buy this book because it is a waste of money and it is completely outdated--old school information, which is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Edition","review":"This marks my 33rd year in the media field and yet I found literally dozens of interesting and useful bits of knowledge in this excellent book. A key asset: it is remarkably current, for example discussing the impact of social media and other new touchpoints. But its real strength is in the basics, providing thoughtful takes on the planning process. It is also an easy read, not heavy-handed nor verbose. Charts and tables are grounded in real case studies, enhancing the text. What a pleasure to read (and scribble throughout) this highly recommended edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coconut Milk","review":"I bought this product and am sorry I did. I tried one can and it was nothing like coconut milk I have used in the past. There is a hard, greasy 1 inch glob at the top of the can and the rest is clear water. It has no flavor and doesn't even resemble coconut milk. If I want to return it, I have to pay the shipping and a 15% restock charge. Not sure it's worth it.

I am a big kid at heart, but collecting spawn toys for me was like kids collecting pokemon cards now. There were different paint variants, from gold,pewter, complete repaints. Now the new figures break easily though impressive I would rather see people by the first three series of spawn. They are easy to find and durable. I have them sealed and open, and I have played with them when I was a child and my daughter gets a hold of them, and they are still intact. You cannot beat old figures, they are just made to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"DUA is dynamite!","review":"It's not just the sophisticated chords. It's not just the impeccable harmonies.

It looked great and it had enough space for everything she needed to carry. The only issue with it, and it is a BIG issue, is that only lasted 5 months. The fabric just wore out - it is see-through thin in several places. I expect a backpack to at least last an entire school year. This one was a disappointment. I will not buy this brand of backpack again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Material","review":"The entire bag is made of sturdy canvas, except the bottom. The bottom material is a paper product and it ripped completely through after one and a half months of first grade use.

Why the designers did that, I have no idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made for Heavy use","review":"this product is perfect for use as a carry-all for toddlers or preschool aged children, but i wouldn't recommend it for children starting school. the zippers are faulty and the fabric wears out quickly. I purchased 3 (one for each of my daughters) and one of them only lasted one week before falling apart. My kindergartener and 2nd grader still use theirs sometimes, but there are holes and tears all over it... Not good for use as a school bookbag. better as a graduated version of a diaper bag, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction- don't waste your money.","review":"This is an adorable bag and my daughter was so excited to find a bag that had all her favorite things (pink, princess, butterflies, & hearts) all in one for her first year of school. She was crushed when after the 2nd day of school, it fell apart beyond any repair.The seams just opened right up, as though they'd never been sewn in the first place and the front pocket was about to completely fall off the main bag. It was definitely NOT from overuse or abuse, since she is just in Kindergarten and didn't have more than one paper in it those days and didn't even ride the bus at that time. I wrote the company and was refunded the cost of the bag but still severely disappointed as we wasted way too much money shipping this when we still had to go buy a new one before she went back to school the next week.Cute cute cute, but stay far away unless you want to have to replace it almost immediately afetr receiving it."},{"rating":"1","title":"purple back pack","review":"Well the back pack is starting to show wear on the bottom where all the books are in there so hopefully it will last till the end of the school year I would have thought it would have held up better but did not.

So I would not buy this again and would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper is a bust!","review":"Though the backpack is a great size for a Kindergartener, and I probably shouldn't complain because of the cheap price, but the zipper is a bust. It keeps getting snagged and is at the point of almost breaking. We can only zip it one way (it has 2 zippers, but one way doesn't work now). I'm purchasing a backup backpack to have on hand for WHEN the zipper does break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality!","review":"This backpack is adorable and just the right size for my 7 year old daughter.

Shameful."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"I must say that Cornel West is more suited to acting in the Matrix or singing on his rap album than he his as a 'scholar' or university professor. President Summers was right to justly criticize Prof. West, but of course in the Jesse Jackson-era of America (jump on situations to shill money out of companies, institutions, and individuals in the name of combating 'racism' but really just to line your own pockets...for an example, look at how Jesse and his sons burgled millions out of Anheuser-Busch), Harvard quickly appointed a diversity advisor and earmarked 50 million dollars u.s. for \\"diversity.\\" A sad reflection of the sorry state of our times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornel Prophesies","review":"This was by no means an easy read. I must say that there hasn't been a book yet to inspire and yet shape an entirely new perspective on the way I look at the world at large. Cornel is truly a scholar. He touched on subjects from the controversial Affirmative Action to the Arts. This book has opened a whole new world for me. Before I read this one, I was the typical fictional reader and on occassion I might have read a biography. I can see now that the world is a much better place because of the likes of Professor West. If there is any seeds of reformation in your heart, this bok will help to water and then shine the light needed for proper growth. Read seriously!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Renaissance thinker gets big points","review":"Cornel West's passion must be teaching or perhaps more accurately enlightening people. By presenting a collection of his works, he personally leads the reader on a crash course through the developoment of Western thought and how it structures our own thoughts and prejudices. He leads the reader through the consciousness of being Black in a land that doesn't value Blacks evenly with lighter-skinned peoples. He informs the reader of the challenges his Christian identity has in a society that integrates Western values as opposed to the more authentic prophetic voices such as MLK. His collection also is a good launching pad to continue pursuing topics, lots of references to other sources. I'm grateful to have been taken on such a marvelous tour of both the personal and academic Cornel West."},{"rating":"1","title":"i should've listened to their advice...","review":"i had heard cornel west speak his mind on a few television programs, and i thought to myself, \\"i have got to check him out!\\" i also heard the numerous negative reviews from other readers. i even voted one reviewer unhelpful (sorry). after reading the first eighty pages of this 600 pg. book, i decided to thumb through it. never before have i read a philosopher's work that was so self-contradictory as his. i should've known better when he described himself as a \\"chekovian christian\\". i might as well call myself a \\"shakesperean buddhist\\" or a \\"wildean puritan\\". the cornel reader will make a wonderful 600-page doorstop, but it will not make anything philosophicaly clearer. use it as a weapon against political ramblers. learn how not to be so consumed by your own egoism that you forget your own intellectual virtues...or follow in my footsteps, expecting more, and be dismayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying (fairly) High","review":"This is easily Erin McKeown's tightest and most coherent album. It flows consistently throughout and every song is good. Unfortunately it lacks the sparks of brilliance that lit up her two previous records--though to it's credit, it also lacks the clear misses that you find on those albums. Her lyrical confidence is as high as ever, and the musicianship on display is excellent. If only there were one shining moment on the album, it would easily outpace her earlier work, but its consistency is in part its greatest drawback. There's no arguing that McKeown's work is a cut above most of the music you'll find on store sheles these days, so you won't regret adding this disc to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"LoveLoveLove this","review":"We Will Become Like Birds is incredibly infectious. You can't help but sing along, and dance too. It's a beautiful depiction of the human spirit. So many feelings are evoked while listening to this: happiness, courage, honesty, sadness, independence, freedom. If I had to pick one, my favorite song is the last track, \\"You Were Right About Everything.\\" Every single song is amazing and stays with you though. \\"White City\\" and \\"Bells and Bombs\\" are fun and beautiful. \\"To the Stars\\" and \\"Life on the Moon\\" are excellent. I have all of Erin's albums and I love them all. Her latest is the best yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take flight with Erin","review":"Bright, tumbling rhythms stir this chipper call to arms from tender slumbering to optimistic righteousness.

Since I purchased it, I can't bear to take it out of the CD player in my car!! It's seems a little more personal and very true to who Ms. McKeown is.

I'm enjoying To the Stars and all of the other catchy tunes on the new disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite CD","review":"I have to admit, I have been waiting for this CD for quite awhile, even counting down as it got closer. I loved Erin's other albums, especially Grand and Distillation, so naturally I was greatly anticipating this one. It was worth the wait.And honestly, I don't think there is one track on this entire CD that I don't like. I can't even think of favorites, because I'd end up listing almost the entire CD, but here are some highlights: Aspera- Great opener, and I really love the Latin.To The Stars- Awesome syncopated drums, and an incredibly upbeat tune.White City- Really love the chorus.Bells & Bombs- If I *had* to pick a favorite, this might just be it.Delicate December- One of the tracks I was looking forward to the most, because of the collaboration with Mr. Peter Mulvey. I was not disappointed.I think that this could possibly be my favorite CD, at least so far this year.

I have read every novel that he has ever written, and enjoyed them thoroughly. The Day Gone By is helpful if you want to get inside of Adams' head and figure out how he thinks. After reading the work, I think that Hazel, a character from Watership Down, may actually be a model for his father, to whom Adams was very close.Other observations about Adams' works can be gleaned by reading The Day Gone By."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the dishes","review":"Great price on dishes, was confused with the shipping thing, but got them quickly and in good shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped","review":"EgdeCraft states \\"The pocket sharpener that really works...2-stage Diamond Sharpening for razor sharp edges!\\" I had high hopes.I tried the sharpener on numerous knives and the best I could get was a moderately sharp edge on wider knives, but can't even get a reasonably sharp edge on my slicing knife which needs a razor sharp edge.I bought this product in hopes of an easy portable way to sharpen knifes on the spur of the moment rather than using a stone and steel.

It scared me to read about all the terrible things that went wrong with other parents' babies, and I couldn't finish the book. However, there is a great chapter in the book that explains the feelings of a recently-made 'preemie parent' that I could really relate to, and a wonderful poem/prayer to the doctors and nurses of the NICU. It's a book that perhaps I can appreciate now that my son is home and doing well, but I would hesitate to give it to any new 'preemie parent'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed to read","review":"After my twins were born 3 months early, I felt really alone. No one in my family had babies like ours. The only people that I had to talk to were nurses and doctors, and the are not big on offering hope.I finally found this book and immediately found what I needed at the time, to know that other babies had went through this and survived.

One of the older preemies in the book. In fact this is one fo the things best about this book. It counts the feelings and fears of older preemie parents as valid too. From mirco preemie to just about term, the book offers the reader valuable insights into the road preemie new parents take. I have not read a better book on preemies. Since it is written in the parents voice, it is very comforting to read that others had the same emotions and fears as you did. The before and after pictures also give hope! This book is wonderful and I say that not as one of the contibutors but as a Mother of a preemie and a second low birth weight baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a box of tissues handy...","review":"This book brought tears of joy with every story. It's hard to believe what some of these couples and babies have survived -- they really are living miracles. The honest, detailed descriptions of the often difficult pregnancies, the deliveries, the time spent in the NICU and finally the trip home provide a clear, realistic picture into the roller coaster ride of having a preemie. This book would certainly provide encouragement to families in this situation, and for those who've never been through it, you'll be better able to understand some of the feelings the parents experience as well as some of the medical terminology common to preemies. God bless the parents who were willing to share their stories, their pain, their joy.

The range extender is obviously more expensive and complex than just a simple antenna change, but it really solved all my signal problems.

With the antenna included with the USB adapter I see on average 86% strength. I am in an environment with multiple wireless networks, and the signal got significantly worse on all of them, some not even visible with this antenna.I cannot recommend this antenna to anybody.

To its credit, the cushion did elevate my tailbone so there wasn't as much pressure in that location. However, the gel was so hard that it pressed uncomfortably against my glutes. The cushion is angled so it is slightly higher in the back than it is in the front, and while I'd guess this was done for ergonomic reasons, in my case it seemed to make things worse. I found myself wishing it contained a lot more gel. It didn't \\"give\\" enough to be a good cushion for my needs.It's too bad, too, because other than that the design is really great.

Not having a bread that she can use for sandwiches has been the thing she misses most -- all the store bought stuff falls apart if you use it for a sandwich. I like to bake, so I (recently) purchased this book to see I could make some breads for her that were better than the store bought stuff. So far I have only had time to make the Basic Four Flour Bread. This turned out so well that IMO this single recipe is worth the price of the book. I'm looking forward trying more of the bread recipes.My local Whole Foods store did not have the Garfava flour, but they did have Bob's Red Mill Garbanzo and Fava Bean mixed flour. I used this instead. Worked just fine. Bob's also makes the sorghum flour that I saw someone else was unable to find.

All of them have the same quality and reflective properties. One thing that I noticed was that when illuminated by a camera flash the reflection size dramatically increases. 1/4 looks like 1 inch! This provides added value to my motorcyling needs as we are required by the law to wear reflective clothing at night and this tape allows me to wear by leather vest all day and night without having to carry other vest. THIS IS NOT A BOGUS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing results for some expensive tape!","review":"This product is WAY overpriced for what it does. Although it does in fact reflect light, it does not do it well at all. It's a 3 part tape with a removable backing that allows it to be applied, and a removable covering that enhances the effect, if it can be called that. I used this as driveway reflectors on my solar lights stems, so I could see better on days when the sun does not charge the lights. Coming in the driveway with my HALOGEN backup lights right on them they DO NOT REFLECT back to me. I found out that in order to see any reflection from this \\"Scotchcal\\" tape, the light source and your line of sight have to be parallel, or else you will just see shiny black tape. Might as well just use black electrical tape. It's about 1000% cheaper and looks identical.

The tape I received is definitely NOT reflective and, yes, I knew about the plastic top film that needed to be removed. From reading previous reviews it seems that some orders receive Scotchlite and some orders receive Scotchcal.

The first set in the Antarctic, the second in Manhattan and Eastern Europe. In the first a narrator tells a story of a death aboard a Coast Guard icebreaker in the Southern Ocean. I thought the distance provided by the narrator was a wonderful device, and enjoyed seeing the clues into the narrator's own personality from the narration. The flaw is the ending which is one section too long. The second story of death and memory is good stuff, a near perfect combination of interior and exterior detail.

Most annoying are the voluminous footnotes, which appear on every page and sometimes taking up 1/4 to 1/2 of the page. If an author needs to quote something, then they should just quote and parenthetically cite. Citations and notes are far better relegated to the end of a chapter. Otherwise, the extraneous text on every page is merely distracting and is not conducive to study.The book is also written in a \\"chatty\\" fashion, sounding more like a lecture than a textbook. There are many anecdotes and other bits of information that may be interesting, but wander from the point of the chapter.I would consider this a book to read at leisure by anyone interested in law, but in my opinion it is not suitable for use as a primary textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moral Control is original and versatile","review":"This CD has a variety of styles on it.

Also, when I play a CD nothing shows up on the panel where it tells you what track your on or how long you are into the CD. It's blank and nothing shows up. And, the radio stopped working. I was trying to listen to the radio one day and it didn't work. There was nothing wrong with the antennae and I never dropped it or did anything to destroy it. It shows me the radio station but nothing plays, even though the volume is all the way up.Overall, this boombox is a piece of junk.

I'd been aware for years that the cause(s) of this accident, along with an earlier one in Colorado Springs, were unresolved - a deeply disturbing fact, given the fact that the 737 (a beautiful, durable, and seemingly reliable flying machine) was and is in such widespread use. Only recently did I learn that the NTSB had come to a probable cause determination, and this book is a thoroughly masterful telling of the unfolding of the accident and ensuing investigation. It reads like a mystery book, and satisfyingly explains what went wrong. One suggestion for any 2nd printing: some pictures of the crew about whom so much is written; their omission, while pictures appeared of one passenger featured in the book, was curious and unsatisfying.

This book shows the humble basis of a great man, a hero who brought this ancient teaching of kabbalah to the light of our world, for us to benefit from. All three -- Rav Berg, his teacher Rev Brandwein, and his teacher, Rav Ashlag -- are true heroes, humble servants of God who made huge sacrifices, and a huge difference in the life of millions of people around the world.

I was hoping for more footage of just Doc's lead without any accompaniment so you can sort out exactly what is going on. The slow examples that are played are a little faster than I would prefer, but they are helpful none the less. The tab was a little disappointing, for the money I expected a full tab in a book. The partial tab booklet that comes with the DVD is helpful, but be prepared to do it the old fashion way... lifting licks by playing parts of the DVD over and over again. It is extremely helpful to see Doc's left hand so you can know what position he is picking out of when compared to figuring out runs from a CD. It's worth buying if you're serious about learning Doc Watson's style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to watch Doc play, but he isn't teaching much","review":"Doc Watson is a great guitar player, and getting the closeup view of his hands as he plays is instructive and interesting. Great self-taught players who manage to be genuinely innovative, as Doc Watson is, always have some quirks in their technique, and Doc is no exception.The problem is that Doc doesn't really know how to teach what he does. Like I said, he's self-taught; I don't think he has much frame of reference for how to explain what he does. He plays everything too fast and doesn't focus on dissecting his more intricate runs.Still, though, you do get the feeling that you're almost sitting right in front of him and watching him play, and that in itself is instructive. You can learn from this DVD, but don't expect to come away from it a flatpicking master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Flat Picking Book","review":"I have really enjoyed this CD and book.

I was originally looking for the Cannon Ixus, but this was smaller, very light-weight, and had a 4.3 million pixel definition! The advantage of this is that you do not need to zoom with the camera. It will allow for a 2400x1800 resolution, so you can zoom in on a quarter of an A4 sized picture with the software whilst hardly losing picture quality. The Quicktime movie mode works well and is fun showing a webcam like video with sound. Finally, it is an MP3 player which is hardly bigger than the dedicated ones. Sound is good, the MP3 player alone is worth having, allowing you to do voice recording and pictures when necessary. Oh, it also looks very cool! Only drawbacks that I've seen so far are no onboard memory and the MP3 player doesn't take VBR encoded files. I say nevermind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The coolest camera I've ever used.","review":"The 40i is a truly amazing little camera.

The 40i is easy to use, the smart card media cards hold tons of pictures and the whole thing easily fits in my pocket! (It's about the size of a wallet). I have used the 40i to send pictures and videos of my baby to my family in Texas and Atlanta and they are always amazed by the quality. If you are considering getting this or the Canon Elph, get the Fuji 40i.

Also,the indoor photos have a redish tint and the quality of the photos fell far short of the Canon Elph 300.

If you look through the viewfinder, and your subject is only taking up a tiny fraction of the display, YOU're the one that's going to have to physically move yourself closer to the subject. The camera cannot do the zooming-in for you.And secondly, the shutter speed is far too slow. Trust me, you cannot take photos of, say, people dancing. All you'll get is a blur.Oh, and why Fuji neglected to include the AC Adapter as part of the package is beyond me. Supplying two rechargeable batteries, which take about 13 hours to charge simply isn't on...That aside, it is a good little camera. TV-Out is more of a gimmic than something you'll use regularly, as the pictures look very fuzzy, even on a decent TV. And it's very very easy to use, and produces very good photos.But personally, I'd think twice about going for this camera over, say, the Canon Ixus V."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Piece of Garbage","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA !

This is a poorly acted, poorly filmed serial from 1932. It was one of Harry Carey's last pieces of work from what I gather. In this story, Alice, the younger sister, is romantically involved with Maj. Heyward. There's never any inkling of romance between lovely Cora and ugly Hawk-Eye. Chingachgook is always called The Sagamore. I never heard Chingachgook. Now I watched the first 4 episodes and the last one. The jacket said this is 108 minutes. Nope. Try 3 hours and 43 minutes. The adaptation is also hard to watch. It flickers, is grainy and of poor quality. While I still love the story in general, this is a pretty bad example."},{"rating":"1","title":"heterophobia:","review":"As a woman and as a feminist I am dissapointed at how we are misinterpreted. I do not understand where people are receiving there information from but it seems to be from unreliable source. Before anyone speaks about feminism, it would be helpful to take a class in Women's Studies to trully understand what a feminist is and what we are trying to achieve: equality. Because I am a feminist, does not mean that I am anti man! Even if I was anti-man, it is still my right to feel and think whatever I want. I will heal when I am ready. If there is to be real change, we need to stop attacking one another and cooperating so that all people are treated fairly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignores the facts","review":"As some of the other reviewers have pointed out... there isn't a very strong \\"anti-male\\" sentiment on my campus... nor on some of the most prestigious colleges that I have had the privilege of attending (I will not speak for all US campuses as some reviewers deem themselves \\"experts\\"). This book is an insult to the 29 girls that a tenured professor at my current institution has slept with (while being married and formerly with a girlfriend in the department who was unaware of the situation). The man hasn't been fired yet... (SEX was mentioned and demanded, by the way). Where is this feminist conspiracy? Sounds like another excuse to pat oneself on the back for oppression to me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about less than nothing","review":"The author seems to imagine that the tiny, tiny, tiny handful of feminists who hold anti-male views somehow weild enormous power. She ignores real threats to both women and men, prefering to concentrate on a powerless group with fewer adherents than the Jews for Hitler League. She thinks that \\"passionate rejection of men\\" is the one thing that unifies feminists, and from such an absurd statement, one can not possibly take seriously anything else she says. She also seems to assume that \\"heterophobia\\" is some kind of looming menace, which is preposterous and insulting that any thoughtful person."},{"rating":"1","title":"More rightwing paranoia.","review":"Don't conservatives get tired of their own nonsense? Here is yet another book designed to say that feminists and liberal academics are conspiring to destroy civilization. Anyone who spends more than a few months on the average college campus or knows many people who support the goals of feminism already knows what garbage this is. I might add that anyone who has been sexually harrassed will be understandly offended by the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God - it's about time!","review":"Thank *you* Daphne!This book provides an excellent critique of a hypocritical, latently mean-spirited and anti-male industry.

So have many male and female friends, most of whom choose to stay quiet lest we be pilloried or worse as misogynists.

The phone looks good but the big complaint is that the speaker phone sounds very \\"tinny.\\" I ended up returning the phone and purchasing the more expensive 4-line model (ATT 974). It has more features (many of which I really don't need) but, more importantly, the speaker phone is clear and vibrant. I'd recommend the 974 instead of this model if you plan on using the speaker phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful phone, dialing barely even works","review":"I'd like to echo everything else said in these reviews: caller ID doesn't work, static, etc. I've also found that if you dial at a normal speed it confuses the tones and doesn't put the call through.

They never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"AT&T 992 Caller ID on Line 2 doesn't work","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. Caller ID only works on line 1.

So I took the unit back and exchanged it for onther one which did exactly the same thing. I am retuning it to Staples tommorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Purchase This Phone","review":"I bought this phone a few months ago and the 9 and 8 on line two do not work. I had thought it was sticking, perhaps the way that I hit the button but that is not the case. It hangs up every time I use it. VERY frustrating, especially when trying to transfer a call.

When I needed a replacement, I selected this supposedly similar unit. Big mistake.Lots of problems, but the major issue is the dialing. You have to dial at an exact speed, not too fast, not too slow, or your call won't go through. Incredibly annoying.It also makes a lot of random noises that are very annoying in a quiet office.This is another example of \\"features\\" prevailing over basic functionality.

Programing interface very confusing.Not sure if it is worth the trouble to get it replaced - especially after hearing the other reviewer's problems with tech support.btw - Don't be fooled by the \\"AT&T;\\" on the label - it has nothing to do with the old Bell System equipment (the \\"Touch Tone\\" and indestructable black rotary dial phones) AT&T;/Lucent Technologies sold off the consumer products business ages ago.

The user interface is reasonably friendly and the quality of the sound (handset and speaker phone)is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful speakerphone","review":"The speakerphone on this unit is terrible. The phone appears to interpret ambient noise to mean the user is speaking, thus muting the caller on speaker. The end result is that you can barely understand anything the caller is saying, as the beginning and ending of every phrase is clipped off. Stay away from this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and doesn't last","review":"Non-intutitive, inside out functionailty. Everything is there but nothing is logical -- even after using for months I have to hunt for redial, etc. And just try to dial the phone number on the caller display -- it's almost imorssible to guess which buttons to hit in which order. This is the third ATT phone of this sort that I have bought in the last two years (two for my father and one for me), and I would NEVER buy another. I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first two times I had problems, but three failed devices is a trend. Most recently, the LED simply failed, and the functions were made, if anything, LESS intuitive, to the point where they are now harder to use. If you have a few weeks to practice, practice, practice, and learn how to operate this phone (the redial button is on the left at the bottom of three rows of similar buttons, and is almost impossible to find), it may seem worth it. But then the LED will fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"great price until you get it home","review":"I bought the model 992 because I need the 2 line capability.

Probably 20 percent of my calls need to be redialed. Also, when using another extension in the house, this phone picks up and does not hang up...keeping the line in use when the extension is turned off. I have called AT&T; Their customer service is the pits. There is nothing wrong with my line or jack - this problem occurs on any jack in the house.Do not buy this phone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par Speaker Phone Capability","review":"I purchased this phone for two important reasons: Caller-Id and it's speaker phone function. The caller-id and phone directory worked well, however the speaker phone quality was very poor. Maybe it was just bad luck with this model, but I have decided to stay away from the ATT&T brand. I would suggest you look into AASTRA/NORTEL phones. I purchased the model 9120 which had the comporable features I was looking for and up to now it has performed flawlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but without manual","review":"I bought this phone, but came open, without the manual information.

I have tried all combinations of settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Before buying this phone, I read the reviews here. They seem to fall into two categories: It works fine vs. it is a piece of junk. I concluded there is a quality control issue and decided to roll the dice and buy one. For a home office, it happens to have exactly the features I want, including being able to turn one ringer complete off (the home line). I bought one, plugged it in, and immediately realized I had wasted my time. First, while on the phone, there is a persistent loud buzzing sound from the handset. I asked the first person I called whether she heard it and she said yes. Second, everyone with whom I've been on the phone today commented that my voice was distant-sounding. Some also remarked that my voice was \\"tinny\\" or \\"metalic\\" sounding (maybe it is?). I called AT&T and was told I must have a defective phone. Obviously so. But I'm not going to waste my time on another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible if you need 2 lines","review":"If there is a call or someone is using one line from another extension you hear the conversation on the second line and vice versa.

That defeats the whole purpose of muting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine is junk","review":"I would not take the chance and buy this phone. I bought 2 batteries for the phone as it always indicates the battery is low. Found out after further examination that the battery compartment does not fully close. I've tried all kinds of remedies including taping it shut. Nothing works. Now if I jiggle the battery compartment, the phone disconnects and \\"Power Failure\\" flashes. If I stand up or move the phone while talking to someone, the phone disconnects. Sometimes when I'm simply dialing a number it freezes and stops dialing. The red light indicating a new call has come in is always on. It does not flash when someone has left a message. It's going in the trash and I won't buy another AT&T phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Description is wrong.","review":"The description states that A/C power is not necessary with a fresh 9V battery installed; this is incorrect. The 9V battery is used to keep the phone's memory intact (caller ID/time) if there is a power outage. Using just the 9V battery (which does get drained VERY quickly), you do not get the backlit screen or a few other features. Speaking of the backlight, its contrast cannot be adjusted, it is either on or off. Aside from everything previously mentioned, the sound quality is very good and all of the features work as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the line reading, if you want a good healthy family","review":"This book is very informative, and makes so much common sense.

And helps Me as an adult how important time is and how to spend my time even if you live alone, you will rethink how you entertaining yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"careful the small type!","review":"I want to echo what Alan Naftalin says -- if this edition is only 688 pages long, the type has to be too small. The British edition is nearly 1200 pages long, and the type is a decent size, so go for that if your eyes don't want the strain. As for Gentle's other epic, Ash, I found the type in the one-volume British edition too small for comfort: in this case, one had to go for the American edition, which is available in four separate volumes. Worth getting the edition you can most comfortably read, because Gentle is a fascinating writer and once you've started a book of hers you won't want to put it down, even if your eyes are hurting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"10 min.

As mentioned, many of the examples won't even compile. But worse is that the examples show bad design decisions, confuse inheritance and composition, and aren't developed enough.The author spends so much time on polymorphism (deservedly) but so little on how to use it well. If you used this book to improve your C structures and modules, then you also miss the point of OO (and polymorphism)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Used as a Bad Example","review":"I keep this one in my library as an example of how bad programming books can be. I felt like I got taken halfway through it. When I read it, I was learning object oriented programming with Delphi and C++.

The only chance for a better life is to become a trooper and then to complete enough missions, and kill enough enemies-both those from neighboring towns and members of a shadowy resistance group-to earn enough credits to become citizens, and thus be allowed to move to the fabled city, where a supposed life of luxury awaits. This anime features cool action scenes and futuristic devices, as well as an intriging commentary on classes and the dehumanizing process of war, and the relasionship that develops between the title charecter and Nova, the female lead. The only thing keeping this from getting five stars is a cop-out ending. But see it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't what we were looking for","review":"We ended up selling it.

Although the book is quite old, the method the book uses to teach the language, is outstanding.German has a very difficult grammar. This book will make sense of most of the German grammar without overwhelming you.I have only found a few outdated words in this book. But, of course, this book will teach you standard German, not the slang that is spoken by young people in informal situtations.If you would like to learn this linguistically incorrect slang that young Germans speak among themselves, then this is not the book to buy.But if you want to learn correct German, and you don't want to embarrass yourself in front of a business crowd, buy this book!As to pronunciation, you absolutely need recordings, if you want to correctly pronounce the foreign sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sehr Gut!","review":"This book is very good. I am currently learning German with a friend and am a complete beginner. This starts off well, teching you feminine, neuter, and masculine tenses and throwing in vocabulary, and 5 new numbers a lesson. All the lessons are formatted around a theme. However, the pronunciation guide in the beginning is a little lacking and, if you are teaching yourself, you will need to get a couple other books. I also recommend Joseph Rosenburg's German: How to Speak and Write it, German in 10 minutes a day by Kristine Kershul, and a good dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not structured well","review":"The book does a good job of getting you into reading German. However, some things I feel necessary and helpful are not included such as rules for verb conjugation and a summary of vocabulary learned for the chapter. Also the sentence-by-sentence reading does not help much. There aren't many dialogues or paragraphs to read.

This book was one of her best works, taking the reader into a great story of love, deception, and adventure. She captures the reader in her epic tale of a women tring to keep her promise to her mother, of the family secret. Only in her does the story unfold.The only problem with the book is that it starts to fast and everything happens to fast, so reading the book 2 time will give the reader a better understanding of what the book is about.

I think my biggest problem was how fast paced it was. You know these types of books, after less than a week of knowing each other they are already madly in love and talking about marriage and babies. The \\"suspense\\" was pretty laughable in my opinion. I want a story that keeps me on the edge of my seat and keeps me up till 3 in the morning wanting to find out what happens next.

But this was disappointing even coming in with low expectations. The main characters were so unlikable, but the worst was the \\"hero\\", who seemed to have all the sexual self-control of a teenage boy in the midst of puberty. Did I miss a meeting? When did speed become a desirable trait in a man? This guy, literally, just can never get to 2nd base without ... losing his load...sorry what's an acceptable euphemism here?

She tends to develop the relationships between her characters better than most authors of the genre - enough so that you actually care about all the sex they're having <grin>.

It starts off really good with great chemistry between the hero and heroine. But begins to steadly decline through the book. You find out he is an ex seal & she is a interior designer. The author in the next 25-30 pages takes you through attraction, dinner, sex and immediate regret on the heroines part. They did not even make it to a bed or for the night! It then skips to someone sneaking into her house to kill her. She calls hero instead of cop bestfriend. It goes down hill from there because you do not understand this change. She goes into hiding but we never know the reasoning until the last chapter. Where the hero allows her to go into protective custody against his wishes. Not worth full price! Book 2 is a step up for author. Skip this go straight too book 2. Mo you will not be lost! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than T.V.!","review":"Yes, Walsh's book is a real eye-opener!

Yes, all this information can be found in other books, but can't that be said about any book in existence?

I thought I was buying a book that offered insight into crafting a story start to finish but instead got a God sized sermon masquerading as something useful. I feel duped and ripped off. The marketing team should be ashamed of itself. If I wanted a sermon then I'd go to church. Look somewhere else if you're trying to find objective information regarding storytelling. The only thing I'll be using this book for is to prop up the short leg on my wobbly, kitchen table."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Important Part Is What Was Left Out","review":"What the description does not tell the reader is that the author is a huge Bible buff. He uses quotes from the bible and even asks the reader to read the bible to do different activities in the book. This is not acceptable. It is not appropriate for a book to use this many references without informing the reader of the potential offensive material. A warning of this is all I ask. I'm not exaggerating, you can turn to virtually any page in this book and you will find a biblical reference or advertisement for Christianity. I felt like this book was trying to convert me, not teach me how to tell good stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Excellent Cover, but...","review":"The constant inclusion of the author's religious opinons dilutes the content and distracts any reader who may be interested in learning the storyteller's art. Any reader who indeed is interested in learning more about the reader's religous opinions would, of course, be delighted.All in all, the book would not be helpful to anyone other than a total beginner at storytelling and even for the beginner, there must be better sources.Paul Baum, Ph.D.Living Historyist"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book despite a narrow-minded review from Sweden","review":"After reading this book, you realize clearly that critics from Sweden exist in all manners of life and even though they need these books more than others, their blindness keeps them from recognizing how to see grace in life and share it with others.

I wanted to enjoy this book and possibly use it in my 17th century Ninja camp, but I found it difficult to see who was saying what and why. Too many panels were sloppily drawn, and the narrative text and dialog were either missing or choppy. The author needs a good editor to help develop ideas in an enjoyable format. Instead of this very disappointing series, I would highly suggest for middle schoolers through adults the \\"Usagi Yojimbo\\" series, and for high schoolers through adults these series: Samurai Executioner,Lone wolf & Cub, Okko, Samurai-Heaven & Earth, Akira, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (movie Red Cliff based on), Marvel Illustrated-Last of Mohicans, Garth Ennis-War Stories, Graphic Classics, and Vagabond by Takehiko Inoue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van Hagar Rocks!!! (well rocked anyway)","review":"If you don't normally like live albums, this one will change your mind. You'll love it.

A must have for any rock fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you other reviewers DEAF??","review":"The performances on this album are great. I would love to be able to listen to this album and enjoy it, but I just can't. I can't enjoy it. Why? It's because it sounds like it was recorded on a \\"My First Sony\\" tape recorder. The sound quality is AWFUL! This album should go down in history as the poorest quality live recording *ever*. It's muddy and all drowned out sounding. A concert recorded on professional equipment should sound far better than this does; I've heard bootlegs that concert-goers have captured on portable cassette recorders that sound better than this. I still hang on to it because I'm one of those guys that likes to have *everything* a band puts out. I haven't listened to it in years, though. It's *that* bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish","review":"This album gets 1 star because ZERO wasn't available. This is not the Van Halen I knew growing up. I personally think Van Halen should've tired after \\"1984\\" came out and when Dave quit. At least we could've remembered them as a good rock band. Now I have to defend Van Halen by telling people they were actually good at one point in history pre Sammy Hagar. Hate me if you want for writing this review- but you know it's true. This album sucks big time. Eddie and Alex don't even sound good anymore. Alex's beats aren't interesting anymore and sound all the same-SERIOUSLY!! I love early Alex and Eddie- but this is wack!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, bad sounding, corny","review":"The final death knell in my Van Halen fanaticism. I grew up loving this band, but with each susequent release, I realized how I had outgrown them and how they had lost their steam.First, the sound. This album sounds like it was recorded (porrly) in a studio and then a loop of a 500,000 person audience was played over it. Kiss Alive 1 was a more believable sounding live album.....and most of it wasn't live!! At not one point does it feel like there is any connection with the audience. This think makes Live Without a Net seem intimate.Second, Sammy. Oh, Sammy Sammy Sammy. You stink bro. Your between song banter is the most moronic I have ever heard. Your screams are forced and your lyrics stink.The guitar sound: Way too distorted. What the hell IS that crap? If any of you have ever heard the Pasadena 77 bootleg, you KNOW that this can't be the same band or guitar player. I don't care if it's 15 years later!!!In short, stay away"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Sleeper","review":"Too long on the Sammy and guitar noise although that is Eddie's trademark sound if you like a lot of it. Save your money for the earlier stuff with Roth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring,boring,boring","review":"I bought this CD, listened to it twice and then pawned it. Repeated listenings of this performance are impossible. It is so boring and stale. I also owned the live video, and never got through it once. Wait for a live Van Halen album during the David Lee Roth era. It's your only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live? I don't think so!","review":"Just read Sammy Hagar's autobiography and he states in that, that this album is full to the brim with overdubs from Eddie, Alex and subsequently himself. Granted, so have a lot of 'live' albums been notoriously in the past, but few have freely admitted to it. However, it's Hagar's word so clearly it's only one side of the story - but I happen to believe him. This, from a life long David Lee Roth & Van Halen fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good collection of Hagar-era material","review":"I was kind of dissapointed when I learned that the only live Van Halen album was all with Sammy Hagar. I don't despise Sammy Hagar like some Van Halen fans do, but David Lee Roth was probably the better performer. Still, this is a really good album. Even hearing Hagar sing the Roth-era classics(e.g. Jump, Panama) is really cool. Also worth noting is Alex Van Halen's Pleasure Dome solo. I didn't think much of Alex before I heard this, but that solo is incredible. It lasts about 8 minutes, and never gets boring. Of course Eddie is in top form throughout. The whole band sounds like they're having a really good time on stage. Any Van Halen fan should check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible album. A MUST HAVE!","review":"Wow, what an album. I got this one when it first came out, and loved it then. I recently pulled it out again, and realized how awesome it is. This album just rocks. Two discs full of great songs. All of VH's great hits with Sammy. Several of Sammy's own tunes. A couple of DLR-era VH songs (although, admitedly nobody can do Jump like DLR). If you like VH, this is an album you will want to have in your collection.Now that Sammy is gone, VH will never be the same. The third rendition of the band has a lot to be desired. Obviously, they will never be at the peak which they enjoyed when this album was recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the power of a live VH concert!!!","review":"Loud, powerful, driven, and ass-kicking! \\"Poundcake,\\" \\"Judgement Day,\\" \\"Ultra Bass,\\" \\"316\\" (which I wish they would label \\"316-Eruption...I mean the two are very different songs...Eddie led in to Eruption real good, but come on!), \\"Jump,\\" \\"Pleasure Dome (Drum Solo),\\"...all of them as great as their album versions, if not better. Hagar's vocals actually sound better on some songs (you gotta admit his voice is kinda annoying). His interludes in \\"Panama,\\" \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\" leading into \\"Give to Live\\"...at least it's funny and captures the essence of the show. This is just a great live album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Van Halen","review":"I know some people will disagree, but I did not care for this album. I thought I would be hearing more of the older Van Halen done with Diamond Dave. There is a good Who cover of \\"Won't get fooled again\\" but, overall I would recommend not buying the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"VH LIVE!!!!!!","review":"I think this album rocks!!! The song selection is awesome. Plus the highly anticipated effects-laden live solo from bassist Michael Anthony. Drummer Alex Van Halen takes an aggravated drum solo following Pleasure Dome. 316 has a great solo from Eddie. Sammy's solo hits are a great supplement. This is the best live album EVER!!!

I have to say when I first played this game on my old PSP which was the original when it first came out, I was frustrated with the d-pad to perform the moves because most of the time, it wouldn't recognize the input at times. Now with my PSP-Slim I have to say this game is great now because the d-pad is better able to recognize the special moves and now I don't have to pray on the moves being performed.The animation is nice and I have to say the soundtrack is awesome, I love the japanese voice-overs as well, giving the characters some nice personality.

Not Perfect, But Still A Lot Of Fun.","review":"I've been a fan of Capcom 2-D fighters since I can remember. That being said, Darkstalkers was probably the best title to pick for a launch game. They get to tweak the system for any future 2-D releases (could a certain fighter with the initials S.F. be in the works? We can only hope), plus we get to play around and get a taste of what the PSP is capable of. True, the controls could be a little tighter, but they work just fine, especially for a handheld. Even better, link up with a friend and take turns beating the $^!& out of eachother (with no noticeable slowdown! It makes an hour on the life cycle go by so much faster). Are there better launch titles? Yes. Is this a must buy? Only if you are a fan of 2-D fighters, or want to link up with a buddy for instant gratification. Like all fighting games, the replay value comes when playing against other players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad compilation of some so-so games","review":"I think I bought this purely out of some nostalgic sense of duty, as the professional review I'd read of it was unflattering. I should have listened to the pros on this one. This game presents nothing new to anyone who's played a Darkstalkers game in the past, the graphics definitely don't come close to other titles available for the PSP (which tells me the developers don't even care about this product), and some of the button combos that you are required to punch through are near impossible to accomplish. All in all, the only challenge I got from playing this game was to get the characters to do their more advanced moves, but even without them I could still win through and beat the game. Total waste of hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bow for money but needs clearer instructions","review":"It looks great, and is fantastic value for the price,but for anyone new toarchery this type of bow is couner-intuitive and needs to be bent in the opposite direction before stringing to get extra tension.

A littel too strong...","review":"Bought this as a Christmas Present for my girlfriend. Everyone was surprised by it, including her at the family party. Attracted a lot of attention and everyone wanted to shoot it! We were into the Hunger Games trend. The bow is, 30lbs draw. Stands pretty tall as well. When I got this bow, we have never taken lessons nor shot a bow in our lives and found that 30lbs is extremely difficult to learn on for beginners. But we are small people, im 5'7 she's 5'4 and she has a hard time pulling the string. Stringing was difficult for us, we had a friend with archery experience string it. Later, we took archery lessons and we used 15-20 bows where we learned some form and technique and coming back to this bow we knew that the draw weight was too heavy. Maybe a few more years of practice sessions at the archery range then we can gradually progress to this 30 pounder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good as Current Live Performances","review":"I recently (2009) heard Frederic Yonnet live over the radio at the Rosslyn, VA jazz festival and was amazed!

Couldn't get through the first 10 minutes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"I got this thinking that he could bring some of his comedy from the \\"Chappelle Show\\" to his stand up, and agonized to finish watching it. He spent the first 10 minutes saying, \\"I will not apologize.\\" I guess he knew he wasn't funny and wanted to let you know before you watched. His jokes were not funny, and when he did the Rick James vs. Charley Murphy bit, it came across as a reach.

YOU CAN START APOLOGIZING!","review":"This is an extremely disappointing set by \\"funny\\" man Charlie Murphy. The set starts slow and never reaches any momentum. The best joke is the last one and believe me, it's not worth sitting through the rest of this poor excuse of a comedy routine to hear it. I have seen Charlie in various shows before and I know he is capable of being very funny, but this set is more like a night of rambling chatter. It's one of the flatest comedy stand ups I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted to Laugh...","review":"I, like everyone else, was led to buy this DVD because I was a fan of the Chappelle Show, and in the show Charlie Murphy's hilarious! Unfortunately, this did not translate well into his stand-up routine.It just wasn't funny. I'm not trying to be malicious, but I literally cringed a few times during the movie.Maybe stick to sketch shows? Because stand-up doesn't really seem to be his thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was there","review":"I went to this show a couple years back at the Wilbur Theatre where it was filmed. I have not watched the DVD because I never want to relive that horrible night of absolute boredom! The venue was a dry venue to begin so on top of watching the worst excuse for stand-up I have ever witnessed, I was sober the whole damn time. Do not waste your $20 on this DVD. I paid $100 to fall asleep in the front row. Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable to watch","review":"Did not buy it but saw a portion of it on Comedy Central. Watched about ten minutes before I had to turn it off. It's never easy to watch a stand up comedian bomb especially for an hour. I don't know why Comedy Central even bothered to air the performance.

And \\"7-Miles\\" brings back memories of my grandmothers' place when I was young, innocent and inquisitive, and Cano's \\"Shame\\" is just quintessential Rock 'n Roll. It doesn't get any better. With this new album these guys are stretching their muscles and experimenting. There are even hints of Santanna and Pink Floyd in this offering, thanks to Chuck Harris' screaming jazz/rock guitar and Frank Poocha's tricky keyboard styling, and riding on Gatlin's driving drum beat and Montour's chest thumping bass.

The music is great, but the product has the most despicable little copy-protection feature.Essentially the first second or two of each song is incorporated into the end of the preceding track. What this means is you can only listen to the music on the existing CD and only in the order that the tracks appear on the disk. You can't play in shuffle mode, you can't use the tracks to make compilation CDs, and you can't import it into your iTunes library. I mean, you CAN, but you'll have an incomplete track.

The protagonist is an average bloke with failings that seem to outnumber his strengths, yet he is a quiet hero in his role of caregiver to a seriously ill lover. I am a reader who is in a position to be acutely aware of his mortality, and was quickly caught up in the main theme of this poignant story.Dufresne handles the basic plot with a serious tenderness, but in other subplots involving human trauma he seems to switch into black comedy. One wonders how Laf's sick lover is as well adjusted as she seems to be when her family is so full of strange people who are often either killing or being killed. Some of their antics were a bit jarring and at times tended to upset the mood of the book. All in all its a book well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, poignant and real","review":"A believable and very loving story about how love is born, and how it really impacts us in the least expected way.

This particular one was recommended first and we got halfway through chapter 7. At that point, I just couldn't put my children - or myself - through the suffering anymore. While it is very accurate factually, the writing was just plain dull and boring to us. The first chapter gave us great hope, but then it went quickly downhill from there. No offense to the authors, and I do believe the other books will get better (from researching on my curriculum's message board - many people felt this particular book was very boring).

The things I saw online made it look so cool. I'm a camera buff. Finally decided to order it, I even paid extra for next day shipping. I was excited to get home to try it out. As soon as I opened the package and picked it up, I realized how cheaply made it is. I loaded the film according to the directions, but the advance mechanism didn't work right. It would just tear the film at the little gripper hole things. I thought maybe it was my error or defective film or something. I went out and bought another 2 rolls of film to try. Same thing! The advance wheel feels so cheap and notchy. The design of the advance wheel is terrible also. It doesn't grip the film positively. I packaged the camera back up, and now am returning it. I guess I have to eat the extra shipping costs and cost of the film I bought to try it the second time. What a waste of money! Don't buy this!!! :( Look for a quality camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, is analog the new cool?","review":"OK, so the design really caught my eye. I couldn't wait till I could get my hands on my new 35mm film camera, that's right, film. Not digital. And when it came, it was all about presentation. Sadly, I haven't gotten the trademark Lomographic pictures that I wanted, partly because the flash didn't work at all on my first of now three rolls. Works with normal 35mm - I recommend 400 speed. Man, maybe it's too early to review this product, as it might be time as the main factor.

Unfortunately, so many seem to think that by simple buying and using these devices, they will make instant art. Now a whole slew of cheap hunks of plastic sold at inflated prices are flooding the market, feasting upon this followers mentality.If you really want to experiment with color-flashing, buy color filters (or scavenge for random tinted transparent materials) and experiment on the flash of a decent camera--or if you are into plastic, then get a holga. This process will not only teach you so much more about what processes produce what effects, but you'll actually create something new, you'll be using a creative process.

Along with a detailed history of Mr. Shaw's rise in history, the book gives you several touching and often humorous insights into his personality. Robert Shaw's career spanned such a long time period that simply describing the events of his early days is a walk back in time, back to the days of oil company sponsored radio shows and pre-television entertainment.

Instead it tells you everything about GPS, EXCEPT how to use it for land surveying. It talks about frequency, wave lengths, phase variance, time shifting, the ionosphere, and even Einstein's theory of relativity. Everything except how to use a GPS system to do land surveying. Even if you were interested in these technical aspects the short paragraphs are little more than interesting anecdotes.

My only quirk with the set up was that you could not unplug the camera input lines from the camera itself and with the two RCA jack plugs on the other end of the very long line you had to drill a fairly large hole (5/8\\") in order to fish them thru the wall and fish the entire length of the line thru the hole even if you only had to go 4-5 feet.

INGRAM","review":"Ingram is one of pop/soul's premiere vocalists, his silky yet earthy voice can wrap itself around romantic ballads or funky up-tempo tunes.ALWAYS YOU focuses on his ballad side, containing only one real up-tempo track.Of course, the ballads are excellent, especially the soaring emotional LET ME LOVE YOU THIS WAY and the poignant ALWAYS YOU. A BABY'S BORN cleverly mutates from straight ahead ballad to a funky gospelish number. The album's biggest hit, SOMEONE LIKE YOU, is typical smooth Ingram.There are some minor flaws----SING FOR THE CHILDREN is one of those mawkish anthems replete with children's chorus that would better suit the Carpenters in the 70s. And a couple more songs like the funky ANY KIND OF LOVE would provide more balance and explore Ingram's diversity more fully.Overall, though, ALWAYS YOU is good soulful music. Wish Ingram would record some new music soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Great photos and text from the Rosenfelds, photographers extrordinaire of the 20th century!

One point I really enjoyed was how down-to-earth the girls were at Hallowe'en. They made costumes out of regular clothes, nothing over the top or expensive. I appreciate that a lot!The holiday calendar made more sense to my daughter after we read this book. That's what a good story can do; teach you and entertain you at the same time.

Looks good but I am not going to risk it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This third (and perhaps final) installment of Sir Apropos of Nothing may just be the best book out of the three. Peter David maintains his hilarious (and painful) use of puns with the names such as Itso Isi, Hamunri, and Go Nogo (and many more which I won't spoil). The plot moves along at a steady pace, and any lulls in the action are used to further character development. And the final chapters in the book are so shocking and powerful that I am led to believe that Peter David is either a genius or the sickest man alive! If you read the first two books, buy and read this book ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read It","review":"Let me be perfectly clear.I have liked every other Peter David novel I have read with the exception of One Knight Only. I couldn't get into it and gave up.I think he's a great writer.But if there's one thing I can't stand and won't abide, it's ...Okay, no spoilers...Unless you're familiar with the way Douglas Adams ended his Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy series.Or how Terry Nation ended the TV show Blake's 7.Hint, hint.If you don't like down, gritty and dissapointing endings, skip this one.I wasted my money, AND I'm bummed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third in the Apropos of Nothing series","review":"Good, but Peter David breaks less new humor ground in this one than in its predecessors.

I got the feeling that the author got tired of the whole series and wanted to get everything wrapped up what in whatever way he could. It shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end to a wonderful trilogy","review":"Although the second of this three books series is my favorite Tong Lashing was a wonderful read. After getting to know Apropos from the first two the third brings in more conflicts that he must face. Twists and turns in the story kept me wanting to read the book the entire day. David's brilliant sense of humor I commend once again; he is always leaving me laughing and has the creativity to bring in drama as well, I applaud. When you thought Apropos has been through just about everything David swings a few more curve balls to boggle the mind and say \\"What the?!...\\" This is a book I'm sure you won't be able to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Great Cover Art","review":"This is my favorite New Order album, which will probably get me excommunicated. But I love the denseness here, with Stephen Hague producing in a Spectorish mode. The beats are more borrowed than previous albums, but the melodies are so lush that they overcome it - more pop-dance than dance-pop. And wow - songs like Regret and Special even have good lyrics! (Not the easiest thing to find in New Order). Oh and the cover art is beautiful too. Do I sound totally shallow yet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Regret\\"-ably, the end of the line","review":"Some bands define a decade (The Beatles in the 1960s), and some bands are defined by a decade, such as New Order was by the 1980s. By the time 1993 rolled around, New Order was like a fish out of water, and \\"Republic\\" regretably shows that. The album kicks off with the fine single \\"Regret\\" and then spins off to where no other New Order album had ever gone before--mediocrity. Nirvana and the grunge movement had changed the rock scene forever and the once cutting edge New Order no longer seemed relevant. Fortunately, they sensed this fact and made \\"Republic\\" their final album. Check out any of their 1980s albums instead, particularly \\"Low Life\\" and \\"Technique.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"New New Order Fan","review":"The general consensus i guess of New Order fans is that this is their worst work. Being a fairly new fan of the band (after buying Substance I was hooked), I almost did not even pick this album up even after seeing it in the bargain bin at the local used cd store because of the negative things ive read about it. All I can say is that im extremely satisfied with this album. World, Ruined in a Day, Everyone Everywhere, andLiar are my favorites. Also, never seen the \\"World\\" video before but after watching it, the song and especially its meaning resonates that much more. Buy It!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"has it been almost 20 years?","review":"When I think of this album, I always think of it as New Order's \\"new\\" release. Hard to believe it's been almost 20 years since it came out!Good album over all. If you're really into the earlier, more minimalist stuff, you may not like it. A little different than the earlier work as it's more polished. Sounds like it was made for radio, which I guess they succeeded with.This is probably in the middle for me, as far as New Order albums go. Certainly not bad though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pales in comparison to previous records","review":"Although New Order was uneven even before this one (Brotherhood is full of mediocre filler, and Low-Life has some bad stuff), the consistent quality of Technique created high expectations for the next record.This record didn't have even one song that I cared for, and I gave the CD away. New Order's best records, in my estimation are: Power Corruption and Lies, Movement, and Technique. All three are very different, but consistently great throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at all bad!","review":"I don't understand why people dislike this album so much. It's not half as bad as people make out! I admit it isn't their best album, it's a lot more subdued than Technique and PCL, but if they'd done another Technique they'd have been slagged off for that. Regret is a fabulous dance-rock track, one of the best tracks they've done, Spooky is a great techno track, as is Chemical. The rest of the album is quite dark and gloomy, but there's nothing wrong with that every now and then. The versions of World and Ruined in a Day on the album are inferior to the mixes on the singles, but still good. I recommend this album to any New Order fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this one alone","review":"I bought this album for the single \\"Regret\\". It remains one of their best songs ever. Up there with \\"BLT\\" and \\"Perfect Kiss\\". I kept this album for years for that song. (FYI: I do own all their albums also). But the rest of the album is lackluster and sounds like a solo effort by Bernard and eventually ended up in the used bin. If you want \\"Regret\\" get \\"The Best of...\\", if want a better album get Technique, Low Life, anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"New Order fans tend to hate this album. Well I am a HUGE fan, and I believe this is one of their best. \\"Regret\\" is one of their best song ever. True, some tracks completely outshine the others, like \\"ruined in a day\\". I can of feel like this is the last New Order album...\\"Get Ready\\" is a fine record though, but it feels a little out of the pack to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Order's Best","review":"This is the sound that defines alternative techno. Why this album didn't make the pop scene, I don't know because every song is pure gold, so far as I'm concerned. It has catchy rhythms, interesting lyrics, and some of the best synth I've heard in a long time. The other thing I like about this album, unlike some techno albums, is that every song has a different sound. Synth music albums sometimes gets redundant, but each song has personality of its own. If this were a vynil record, I would have put scratches on it from playing it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of New Order","review":"\\"Regret\\" is a great song, but after \\"Regret\\" the record really slides until the nadir of the second half. If you like bland \\"alternative dance\\" music that is neither alternative nor dance, nor interesting, this is for you. You can tell that someone has poor musical taste if they think this is New Order's best album. If you like songs like \\"Young Offender\\", \\"Liar\\", and \\"Times Change\\", and like techno this bland, you must not really like New Order. Sad downfall of Factory records and New Order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"The two wine glasses shown in the picture are NOT included as they are with other wine carriers.

I did my study.so for 22 magnification to work you need to have at least 80mm lens. it is simple math.you need certain amount of light to go into your eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"I upgraded to these from a cheap brand. It was like the weather changing from a cloudy day to a sunny day. I didn't know there was so much difference in optics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready for use out of the box!!!","review":"I am currently in Afghanistan and I purchased a pair of these. They are good binoculars and the zoom feature is an added plus. However, the higher the magnification of the zoom the more steady your hands need to be. This is the only drawback I have concerning this item. I usually leave my magnification or 10-12X and I don't have a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great optics, zoom didn't last","review":"I purchased these for my wife to look through on a camping trip to Yellowstone and the Tetons. Decided it was time to get a nice pair of binoculars, rather than using the cheap ones I've had since I was a kid. When my wife took them out to use, the zoom wouldn't work. Sliding the lever around did nothing. Don't know what happened to the zoom, but the binoculars were not dropped, mishandled, or anything, and the box wasn't damaged in shipment. Returned to Amazon for a new pair, and they work fine, hopefully the zoom will continue to work. Optically very good, does require some care to keep a steady view at full magnification, but definitely usable. Also, it does include a tripod mount, which is a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Binoculars worth the price","review":"As a backyard astronomer and novice Outdoor enthusiast, I find these binoculars just perfect. I know that a lot of text books and serious users will not recommend zoom binoculars. This is because zoom binoculars are unstable at higher magnification and having a perfect focus is a little bit of a pain (compared to fixed binoculars). I find them usable, though shaky hands are an issue once you reach high magnification (unless you are using a tripod). Nikon quality really proves itself here. If you are dead set on a pair of binoculars, and those being zooms, then I recommend these as your only real choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great image for the price.","review":"Got these on sale on Black Friday. Very happy with them. Super crisp image at 10 power. At 22 power the image is not quite as crisp but still very good. Better than any optics I currently have. You do need a tripod/monopod to get full use from the higher magnification, but they come with an adapter/mount. I don't think you can do better for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon Action Zoom Binoculars","review":"These work well and are much better than another pair I tried.

This book is a great example of that.

Some of his early crowd pleasers (\\"The Ice Worm,\\" \\"Growl,\\" \\"At the Dentist,\\" and \\"Teaching\\") are in here, but they don't have much depth on the page.If you want some quality Michael Brown poems, you're better off spending your money on his extremely well-thought out newer-release, \\"Susquehanna.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"Michael Brown offers up consistently bright poetry, whether in person or in written form.

Limey's narrative of his Viet Nam experiences as a LURP puts the reader out in the jungle, on patrol with the team. Limey Walker bares his innermost self over the tragic loss of a close friend and pulls no punches when describing his contacts with a deadly and fierce enemy.

The change in Stoner is also well-written, as he becomes essentially devoid of emotion due to the alien symbiote.The main weakness lies in too great a reliance on the magic of the alien presence.

They're impossible to use while jogging. They come disconnected from the phone if you leave it in your pocket. Finally, the mic sits about belt level, which is why you always see people holding their \\"hands free microphone\\" if they want to be heard.

A must-read for students 5th grade to 12th grade because of the positive and inspiring content. There is a \\"need\\" for this story to be read both in the schools and at home because being tough is not nearly as important or life-sustaing as the human need to experience goodness and kindness, no matter how small.

Born from the ashes of Morphine this band had me from the moment I heard 'Spinner' from their first CD. 'Sideshow' is lighter in tone but just as good. 'Twilight' is simply gorgeous, a jazz-tinged love ballad with a great melody; you'll be humming it all day once you've heard it. For me, though, the highlight is 'I Slept Through It', a terrific social comment on the way some people go through life. There is one forgettable track but you can't be perfect.

This one, however, is a beautiful collection of stories--each one often more stunning than the last. The stories are beautifully written, exciting, conventional and unconventional, and utterly surprising. What a read! I love it and am eagerly awaiting the 2001 edition.

You'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a DISASTER!","review":"OK, let's get this straight. 'Philip Glass' was previously on a CD compilation called 'Give Peace A Dance Vol 2 - The Ambient Collection' in the UK. But it really doesn't matter if it's been on CD before or not, because the track is not particularly inspired anyway. 'Breakdown' original version, though, has never been on CD, and it would have probably been better if it had stayed that way, since it is rather dreadful IMHO. Why was it selected for a 'BEST OF'? Should've included the brilliant second version instead. 'World Cup Theme' 7\\" version has seen its first time on CD, but who cares when the superior 12\\" version is already available on one of the two Colourbox CD's before?

Let's face it - how often does a band like Colourbox get the chance to release a cd these days? It is unbelievable that they should pass up such an opportunity to make the most of it, by incoporating material that represents their most creative yet accessible work, or maybe even something more challenging, dare I suggest. Any one or more of the following would have made this a less dismal effort at compiling a \\"Best Of Colourbox\\" : 'Say You', 'Punch' (both 12\\" single A-sides), Fast Dump, Sex Gun, Manic II or even some b-sides such as 'Keep On Pushing'(remix).

It follows a side story and is very entertaining, fun, challenging, and exciting. Plus it has a hilarious Forsaken Dance Party at the end of the game when you beat it. It works for fans of the series or just for those looking for a fun interactive game. You can even yell catch phrases during play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it Love it!","review":"I happened upon this game when I searched for a game related to the Robert Jordan books Wheel of Time series. I thought someone should make a game and someone did. Just a warning if you overlook the description this is a FPS not a RPG. However, that in no way detracts from the gameplay. As many reviewers have already noted this game is most likely not canon to the book series. However, it remains true to the atmosphere of the stories and I think that is what the developers were after.Anyway if you are Wheel of Time fan and video game fan you would do well to add this gem to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Ancient???","review":"I'm not sure if this game was a washout b/c it's software is incompatible w/ my Toshiba gaming computer, or what, but it just wouldn't work! Then, I couldn't get the sound of rain off of my computer until I uninstalled the download! Bad, bad, buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I purchased the Titanium T-Touch Tissot a couple of years ago @ FineBrandWatches through Amazon. Batteries have short life and after two years of careful use, the hands felt off!!! Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"severe stomach reaction","review":"I had a severe stomach reaction to this vitamin. After the second attack of severe, painful stomach gas and vomitting, I suspected my problem was related to this vitamin which I had just started taking. So, I didn't take any for 10 days. Then I took another to \\"test my theory\\" that it was this vitamin. As I sat by the toilet most of the night in agony, I kept asking myself why I needed to test my theory. I have never had stomach problems or problems taking multi-vitamins, but something in this is new to me, potent or contaminated. I'm surprised I\\"ve only seen a few reviews (on other versions of this vitamin on AMazon) that had similar problems. I'd say beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literally a Hard Pill to Swallow","review":"The pills are like small green bricks. I'm a fit, athletic man age 52 and I dread choking this thing down every morning. Will change once this bottle is finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these","review":"I had a hard time finding vitamins that didn't make me sick and finally I tried these. There great I have no issues with them. Love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multivitamin that is high quality and made from whole foods","review":"Best multivitamin in my opinion and because have iron in my daily food with meals (meat), there's no need for extra iron and this vitamin is iron free. Yes it is gentle on your stomach and works very well. I have been taking Rainbow Light Vitamins for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"ramblin' jack","review":"What can we say? Jack never ages. This CD sounds as fresh as the vinyl version I first got when I was young. Jack may have gotten older but his music hasn't. Jack's Young Brigham album is just as delightful and intimate a listen today as those days when he played The Riverboat, sitting and singing right in front of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good quality","review":"I didn't expect tht the DVD would look a 5 dollar bootleg DVD the sound and image are terrible, did not like it at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this book largely because I was interested in seeing some photographs of the Indians of the Southeast, and the description indicated that there would be some included. However, the book only has one photograph. The rest of the illustrations are drawings and paintings. Still a good book, just not as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"boyds bears (plush)","review":"I am new to the collecting world of boyds bears. I saw this book at a store that mainly sold boyds bears. This book was very helpful in showing me what bear was of value etc. They have a handy reference guide in the back of the book that helps you find the bear you are looking for by name. Its great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boyd's value guide by Checkerbee Publishings","review":"This guide is the best as far as I'm concerned I depend on this for my collection and my bids for auctions. The pictures are very lifelike, this guide is very informational. This guide is as close to complete as I've seen. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in collecting Boyd's Bears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly accessible to modern readers","review":"As a testament to its readability, I've actually read Curial and Guelfa several times. Although it contains some of the formalities and literary conventions of the fifteenth century, it's really a good read. Despite motives which might be alien to the modern reader, the characters display enough depth to make them real. In some ways, it's an expose of chivalry's seamy underbelly. More amazingly, some of it is quite funny, although that may say more about the skill of the translator. This book gives us an accessible window into the late middle ages in a fashion analogous to that by which Jane Austen transports us to the early nineteenth century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrongly listed item","review":"This item was labeled as the honeycomb cover for the HTC Inspire but was obviously made for another product. The cover is loose on the phone, has cut-outs for the camera on the wrong side of the case, and the Coup de grce...was greasy and somehow sticky at the same time.I realize this was a Boxwave issue so I have not dinged Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Buy OEM","review":"Well, the pass side hydrolic motormount went out on my zx3 so i decided to buy a whole new set of mounts and replace them all for piece of mind. The car has 160k on it and the mounts were original. With in 2 weeks during stop and go driving or acceleration i would hear a loud bang like the motor was shifting. I drove it to work all week and got it up on the lift on the weekend only to find the mount had been torn badly. The stock one was still in the hatch (glad i saved it) i put the oem mount back on and the car drove fine. So basically i wasted time and money buying this part. I hope the \\"Anchor\\" hydrolic mount holds up a little longer.... because the dogbone mount is more of a paperweight and less of an anchor..... :( Save the frustration and buy ONLY OEM FORD MOUNTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked 1 hour only","review":"I was so happy i installed my brand new rear motor mount on my ford focus 2002, i tested it for about one hour and was very good. what was my surprise that the next morning after 30 mins of driving, a worst vibration from the original i had was taking place in my car, i checked and the motor mount was shaking terribly. i needed to put back the old one, althoug it vibrates, is not that terrible as with the new one. really dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality","review":"I replaced the original engine mount with this on my mother's 2001 Focus. Three months after installing it the car would make a noise as if the engine was hitting the subframe whenever you accelerated from a stop or coasted and then accelerated. When I took this mount out to replace it, the entire center piece that connects this mount to the subframe was disconnected from the rest of the rubber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anchor mount failure","review":"The large rubber insert in this mount broke less than 2 months after installation. It is definitely an inferior product. I'd recommend replacing the rubber inserts with polyurethane in the original mount, which is much sturdier, if you have access to a machine shop. Otherwise buy the Ford mount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy OEM instead","review":"I bought this Anchor mount about 3 times. The mounts broke within a month of use. I would buy OEM instead - though it will cost more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor toaster","review":"I've used this toaster daily for a couple of weeks now, and the only thing it has going for it is looks and price. I read Amazon reviews for everything else, don't know why I didn't in this case.The first problem is that it doesn't toast evenly. Some of the \\"coils\\" don't seem to get hot (red), so there are bands in your toast that aren't browned. It has to be turned up very high to get the whole piece, then the rest is so hard it's unpleasant. Plus, that makes the cooking time much longer. Secondly, when the toast is finally done, the bread doesn't come out far enough so that for even a regular sized slice of bread your fingers have to touch the hot toaster to get the piece out.I absolutely do not recommend this toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst.Toaster. Ever.","review":"This toaster has so many problems it is hard to know where to begin. It takes FOREVER to toast even something small like an English muffin. Forget something solid like a bagel. It would be quicker to build a camp fire and toast it on a stick.The ejector doesn't lift small items (like the aforementioned English muffins) high enough to get them out. I have to slap the ejector upward and catch it in mid air.I gave this 2 stars, because as bad as this toaster is, it still makes toast.... eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes forever to make toast","review":"This toaster is fairly cheap but it takes forever to make toast. I just do not have the patience to use it anymore. Buy something else although it seems nothing works very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece O Junk","review":"This toaster is really bad and I should have thrown it out sooner. First the exterior.. It takes up a lot of space because it's big and bulky. Be careful how you clean the outside as the black plastic scratches easily. On to how it doesn't work as a toaster.. It takes forever to toast bread and doesn't toast evenly. I keep it up to the last setting on the dial just to get it to toast the bread. The slices don't fit down in it either. I found that the tops of the bread stick out. Also impossible to get smaller pieces out. Like an English muffin. I've had to buy wooden tongs just to get the bread out. If your a connoisseur of great toasted bread, don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes Forever! Stay Away.","review":"I used this toaster for almost 3 years and it always stunk. It wasn't until I went on vacation recently and used a real toaster that I realized what I was missing.This toaster is a time waster and it takes forever to make toast, I can't wait to throw mine away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made to last. Uneven toasting","review":"We've had this about a couple of years. It stopped holding the bread down. We had to bang the handle down and change the settings willy-nilly to get it to finally stay down. It has never browned evenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow and uneven","review":"We've had this toaster for 6 months. It toasts unevenly (one side always darker than the other) and takes forever to toast anything. By far the slowest toaster I've ever owned. I'm looking for another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine until it broke... one year","review":"I didn't mind the cord coming out of the front rather than the back (why do so many toaster manufacturers do that? Makes not sense at all.). Controls were great, and it toasted fairly evenly. The slots were wide enough for bagels.But now the lever won't stay down to activate the toaster, after only one year, so I'm buying a new toaster. Cheaply built (feels plastic all over) and obviously not built to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toaster Review","review":"This toaster fits the bill for my family. It's a perfect fit for a small counter area. Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"Had it for 3 years and never liked it. It never toasted even and one side always burned everything. It feels clunky, didn't pop toast up far enough, and the only way to cancel toasting (like if it was burning something) was to unplug it. Recently got a Hamilton Beach, costs $15 less than this toaster, and it works beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at the Seller's Description!","review":"I wanted to replace some worn parts on my 22 inch grill, and this seemed ideal at first. Then, I read seller information. It states:\\"This sku is the Triangular shaped bottom wire rack #90461 for 22\\" kettle grills which is part of the 3639 kit. No other parts are included. The 3639 kit came with wheels, legs & ash catcher and is no longer available.\\"The Amazon description for this item clearly contradicts this, and needs to be updated."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent artist","review":"I do love this artis a lot. I listen to her song and I do loved to have some of her record, but its so difficult to buy the record in the shop here. I will always love all of her song and rate her top all the artist I have known. hope oneday i can find her record to ad some of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Hold the Key","review":"If you are not familiar with Beth Neilsen Chapman, as I was not, she is a great find, like discovering Nanci Griffith for the first time. The great mystery is why isn't she better known because her voice is great, her music is great, her delivery... anyway, you get the point, just buy the darn album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for begginers but not an advanced level book","review":"I would not advice this book for somebody with advanced level of French. But it may definetely help out someone with a begginer level."},{"rating":"2","title":"good 4 fun","review":"I've bought this book recently and it suits me well,why?because I just wanted to learn french for fun,and not for some kind of exam of something,it helps u to get familiar with the language,and with hard work,be able to even speak it out!And...I might add it is very simple!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst language teaching book I've met","review":"Absolutely no good, I've thrown it away today after finding another book that does its work better. because:1. This book teaches French by repetition of sentences, with hardly any grammer or structure notes - the parrot way... 50 years ago, when the book was printed, it might have been the best option. now there are online courses which teach you speech communication way more efficiently, especially in French when prononciation is an issue. I'd expect a book to look deeper into how a language is constructed - not this one.2. The book is way, way outdated. it uses many words and terms of speech long gone from this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good way to explore more languages","review":"I started with Berlitz Self-Teacher Spanish. Having completed the Spanish text, I have decided to expand my study to French.Although there is no updated since 1949, this is still the good source of any language study. I like this series because French and Spanish texts share the same contents for many parts so I can compare words and phrases with both books. This is the good way not to forget (and not to be confused with) what I have already learnt.It would be nice if we could get the CD version. Any update would be more appreciated. But this book definitely works for the purpose afterall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but flawed","review":"Bachmann's 4-4-0 locomotives look great but have problems. The tender carriage is so low that it will not clear some switches and crossovers. It constantly jumps track. I have had this problem with two different locomotives. The wheel assmebly on the tender also comes apart easily. I have had to use glue to keep it together. The two locomotives have also had other problems. The wormgear that drives the wheels is bad about hanging up. It causes a squeeling sound and the loco flips to one side. Both locomotives did this right out of the box. Another problem is that the motor is actually in the tender with a driveshaft to he engine. This makes the engine itself too light to pull much weight. If you want a better 19th century locomotive get an Atlas Mogul 2-6-0. Would run up the wall if asked to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice N Scale Steam Engine; great for Disneyland layout!","review":"Bachmann has a great corner on the affordable model train market; they know which trains are the classics and do a great job of making models that the average modeler can afford. However, with affordability comes compromise; there is no working headlight on this model, which if on here, probably would have added to the cost. Still, it has a good amount of power and will look great on your N Scale layout. If you're a Disneyland fan, with a little repaint, this one could stand in nicely for the CK Holliday train at the park. Just remember that N Scale is very small; best for adults, not little children."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Book I've Read by M. J. Rose","review":"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect of this book, but I really enjoyed it. I read it in one sitting! I liked the way she presented an inside look into the life of a call girl. How it wasn't about sex so much as the men feeling accepted, unquestioned. I think Rose shows deep insight into the nature of human sexuality as well as marriage through Dr. Snow's character.I also liked that she developed the characters more fully. Showing us not just Dr. Snow's professional life, but her personal one as well and the struggles with her teenaged daughter.The highest praise I can ever give a book is that it was worth the money and the time to read it -- and this one was! I will be looking for the next one in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fortunately, it was a Kindle freebie","review":"You shouldn't be able to guess well before the end who the bad guy is, but it's glaringly obvious--well, except to our heroine, Dr. Morgan Snow, who's not the brightest. Actually, she can be super smart when it serves the plot and super stupid for the same reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Previous Hard Usage","review":"I usually buy very good or better quality. I would rate this book acceptable at best, at least two steps lower. It had numerous cracks in spine, cover was banged up around edges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good chic lit","review":"I like reading murder mysteries and this was a good one. Interesting characters and situation. The victim's profession added to the intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Halo Effect-Really Good!","review":"The Halo Effect (The Butterfield Institute) by M.J. Rose is a real surprise for me. I have been looking for a well written suspense thriller and I have finally found one. At first glimpse the book appears to be the typical serial killer type book. But the plot is not the only thing I found so intriguing about the book, as good as it is. Ms. Rose pulls the reader into the story. Her ability to make you feel, hear and see what you are reading.t is a rare ability to be able to write with an eye for details and for the reader it is literate, shocking, intelligent and just exquisitely done. This is a very gruesome murder suspense thriller but somehow Ms. Rose also tells a beautiful story, compelling us to care about the characters. Dr. Morgan Snow is a perceptive therapist and a newly divorced mother, an expert in sexuality and because she cares for her patients she must has become an amateur sleuth. [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful psychological suspense","review":"MJ Rose has the rare gift of engaging her reader in a touching story, bringing out an empathy and tenderness for the people who inhabit her fictional world as she skillfully weaves a chilling plot. This unusual balance makes \\"The Halo Effect\\" an unforgettable read. Erotic, deeply psychological, and written with spare and often lyrical prose, this expert novel explores the underworld of both our city streets and our own unconsciousness. A tremendous piece of suspense writing from a gifted story-teller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"I cannot believe so many people gave this book 5 stars. I found the book very uninteresting. The main character was a complete turnoff and so annoying that wished I could grab her and knock some sense into her. By the end of the book I was skipping paragraphs so I could say I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I had trouble putting this down. It was a little creepy, but quite enjoyable anyway. I willbe reading more of this author I'm sure"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"This was a lot better than I expected - I think I got this one for free. The characters could have been a little better developed, but all in all, it was a story I could sink my teeth into and I didn't figure out \\"whodunit\\" immediately. Even though the story involves prostitutes, I don't know that I would exactly call it an \\"erotic thriller.\\" But hey, if it sells books, whatever. Not fantastic, but definitely better than a lot I've read lately. It's worth a read, and I'll probably check out others by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Halo Effect...will not disappoint","review":"I really enjoyed this book...had a hard time putting it down. The premise of the book was fresh and not overdone by several others. I will definitly be looking for more books done by this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands out and stays with you","review":"One of my litmus tests for a good novel is that it be memorable. A novel can be well written, but if it plows the same ground as dozens of others, I won't remember it for very long. This novel was different from most crime fiction and will stay with me a while. To begin with, a story told from the point of view of a sex therapist is certainly a different twist. The characters are richly drawn and complex--the sex therapist who hasn't had sex in a long time, a prostitute who can't perform with the man she loves, a macho detective who gets emotionally involved in his cases. The setting in New York City is expertly weaved into the background of the story. Unlike some other reviewers, I could not figure out the serial killer until the end. All in all, the book was engaging, entertaining and above all, memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5--okay writing, interesting premise","review":"This was a mostly enjoyable read, the first book in a thriller series, although M. J. Rose's voice is always problematic for me. In some books it grates so much that I have to stop reading, but I was able to get through this one.The heroine/narrator spends an awful lot of time in early chapters explaining herself to the reader--and not all of it is relevant to the story. The heroine also does some rather stupid things which mostly seem to be more for the author's convenience in moving the plot along rather than a genuine outgrowth of her character and motivations. But the story starts cranking after awhile, and there's an interesting hook up between the heroine and another character. I wound up enjoying it enough to buy the next book in the series.However, Ms. Rose clearly did not do sufficient forensic research on blood coagulation. Perhaps only a forensic nerd like myself would give a darn. If I could give this a 2.5 I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have some free time","review":"then this is the book for you. I read it in a couple of days even though I should have been working on office duties. Yes, there is some pretty vivid sex but it is really a part of the story and the suspense of what happens and why. I have ordered two more books by M. J. Rose and am excited about reading more of her work. I understand that some of the characters are in these follow-up books so I'm looking forward to see what happens to them. I began to have a hunch as to who the villain was about 3/4 of the way through,but couldn't be sure until the very last pages. If you like mystery, serial killer stories and interesting characters, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little plot movement, unengaging characters","review":"I read 200 pages and then donated this book to the library without finishing it. The characters weren't engaging, and there was very little plot in the first 200 pages -- just a lot of thinking and talking by the main character. It certainly wasn't enough to make me think that the second half of the book would justify the time spent reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acidic beer book but with acidic market price","review":"So my first thoughts on buying this were why is this great book out of print? Is a $13 book worth the now hyped up $45- 55. It's a great book. It's focus is more to the wild Lambic/ Gueuze style beers, with little on the Oud Bruin and east Flanders red and Brown sour beers. Hopefully it will come back into print, for the masses, certainly with the sour beers becoming more and more popular. With this in mind, if it does not go into print again, it may only become harder and more expensive to buy. Maybe buy \\"Wild Brews\\" by Jeff Sparrow, this aslo is a awesome book, but at a fair price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad its out-of-print","review":"Excellent book on the history and chemistry of brewing Lambic beers. Unfortunately it is out of print. Too bad it looks like Brewers Publications isn't ever going to bring it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"saves my carpet","review":"these came in as promised look and fit very well ... plus with 2 kids these save me from a lot of extra cleaning.. when you go to the car wash, they just get sprayed off and look like new again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A writing toolbox filled with tips","review":"How can writers produce better stories?

The worst thing is that they charged my credit card. I have been contacting customer service but after 1 month I have not received any solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I'm pretty happy about the watch so far. It's my 3rd TAG, and the other two still work great, even though I bang them all up pretty good. I don't think anybody could ever say something bad about a TAG, can they? They run forever, they look good and they're pretty sturdy. The price was great, specially considering that I'm a European buyer and the final price in Euros was less than half what I would have paid here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Excellent, UPS blows","review":"The good: Product as described, packaged well. The bad: Ordered with UPS 2-day delivery. On scheduled delivery day, received automated telephone call advising me of delivery between 8 AM and 7 PM.

He followed it with \\"The Abolition,\\" which expanded the same themes and added some new information. But it wasn't essential. Now he's written this short volume which adds nothing new.He tries to find a new angle by tying the threat of nuclear war to Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" But the analogy doesn't work; it just isn't there. I was disappointed by this book. If it wasn't so short, I would have quit after 50 pages. But don't let this stop you from reading Jonathan Schell's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not have enough variety","review":"It did not meet my expectation, it did not have enough variety. there were no replacements that fit the old broken zipper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy!","review":"If I ever figure out how to use these I might be a genius.......The instructions were not very helpful and I failed to be able to fix the little bag I was trying to repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for clothing","review":"I bought this to repair a broken slider.+ Provided the parts to repair, but these only include zipper sliders and stops- I didn't receive an assortment of zipper colors, and only got *gold* stops, so when all was said and done my jacket had a gold sparkly piece at the top (the rest is white with a gray zipper).- The instructions are worthless.

It's not something I can use and I wish I had researched it better before I ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I purchased this item to in order to repair a hooded sweatshirt and a jacket, to my surprise none of the included parts fit either garment. The kit contains the following: Four pairs of zipper sliders which allegedly fit the most common types and two pairs of zipper stops for zippers with missing or damaged teeth, not very helpful unless the damaged or missing teeth happen to be at the very top of the zipper. The kit is overpriced for the contents provided and I believe the inclusion of some zipper boxes, the rectangular piece located at the bottom of the zipper, would have been helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Hoody!","review":"I have a favorite hoody that I never tossed away hoping to salvage. Somebody at my church told me about zipper repair kits. Although sceptacle I decided to invest in one. Wasn't very expensive and boy did it work!. I have my hoody fixed. My son also wears out zippers before pants so this was a major savings. It took me seconds to fix my hoody and the zipper works with ease. I would recommend this kit to anyone who has zipper problems. This kit has a variety so you can pick just the right zipper part to fix your problem.

I was searching for something after I was done watching Cowboy Bebop and I found it - Coyote Ragtime Show. The storyline is pretty good and the characters are well developed. My only quarrel with this anime series is just that, that it is a series, a very short series at that. Other than this, this DVD is a must watch/buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album!!! \\\\m/","review":"This is pure home grown Black MEtal with a strong message unlike music today which has no message or depth. Amazing riffs, killer VOX, great drums and just an awesome album for any Black Metal fans to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best from Judas Iscariot","review":"In the style of raw underground black metal, Judas Iscariot use droning and repetitive riffs to achieve moods of isolation which are destroyed by authoritative and violent patterning. More cohesive drumming and focused songwriting make this EP the best work from the band so far. Songs indulge faster riffing and allow melody to rise in ultimate minimalism from a thrashing chromatic mess of rhythm riffs. Developing songwriting technique and growing aesthetic knowledge unite in as clear a statement as is possible of the beauty and loneliness of alienated black metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor - Drawings very dark","review":"I LOVE Dore's drawings. He is one of the absolute masters, and the Dover Book of his biblical illustrations is wonderful; however, I cannot say the same of this book. Yes, the drawings are Dore all the way, but they are dark - very dark - for the most part. The front panel is the opposite of what one sees inside. Almost all of the prints are gloomy and dark. Thus, I cannot recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuanced, yet simple.","review":"Carson has a way of bringing common sense exegesis to what seems to be a familiar text. Through his lucid teaching, the S on the M becomes more nuanced. What makes this a more thorough study than some, is that Carson deals with the S on the M (Matt.5-7) and the aftermath of this teaching on its first listeners (8-10). I just finished this, and I am sending it as a gift. If you want to have a better grasp of the practicalities of Jesus' S on the M, get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail to Chief Dallek","review":"Robert Dallek is one of my professors at Boston University.

Although labeled \\"A Primer for the Layman,\\" the book's style requires that the layman involved be willing to struggle through densely-written prose that takes a great deal of unpacking. To his credit, the author seems to realize this, and has provided both a glossary and study questions for each chapter. When concepts are introduced, they are often accompanied by a fable or story to illustrate, and this serves the purpose well.The only serious drawback for me was the transliteration of Hebrew terms, which were only given in Ashkenazic pronounciation. This is the most commonly used amongst Chasidim, but other Jews [and non-Jews who have learned Hebrew] may stumble over the differences, and showing the term in Hebrew in the glossary might have helped.All things considered, although it's not an easy read, \\"Demystifying the Mystical\\" delivers what it promises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected for the price!","review":"I am a hairdresser that specializes in weddings and I was very disappointed in this book. When I purchased it there were no reviews, unfortunately. It was beautifully put together but the hairstyles were really unflattering and unattractive. There were hardly any I would even show to a bride as a potential, they were too out of date. The instructions were not detailed enough for a beginning hairstylist (I'm assuming that was the target reader group). I would recommend Martin Parson's \\"Hairdreams\\" instead of this. Although you can tell the authors worked hard to make this a lovely book, they took some serious wrong turns in the hairstyle picks and instructions. I wouldn't be so harsh if this book wasn't so expensive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautful Cover Deceives You...","review":"I expected the whole book to be about hair and have a wealth of hair styles. I really didn't need all the advice the first part of the book gives. I also expected the book to have more updated styles.

This gorgeous young lady is the real deal! I love her smokey voice and her phrasing is beyond words. The arrangements could be a bit better.

The jazz treatment of Stevie Wonder's \\"Rocket Love\\" may be my favorite on the disc with her vocals soaring, swooping and burning, \\"You took me riding in your rocket, you gave me a star, and a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back down to this cold cold world.\\" On the classic \\"Make Someone Happy,\\" Milman seems to settle into a lovely slow groove headed by Paul Shrofel's piano and Cameron Wallis' wailing saxophone solo. The light bossa nova sung in French on \\"Reste (Stay)\\" bubbles joyfully. Back several decades, I loved \\"Undun\\" by the Guess Who. Songwriter Randy Bachman guests on guitar on the track that shimmers with this swaying jazz treatment highlighted by Wallis' flute. The Rodgers & Hammerstein classic \\"It Might As Well Be Spring\\" sparkles with Milman's upbeat arrangement. \\"So Long You Fool\\" is also a strong track. \\"Make Someone Happy\\" lives up to its title.

What you get is a very enjoyable listening experience. This compilation even has two tracks from their first and often overlooked album, On Through the Night. All of Def's albums are well-represented in this set. I particularly like how they dig somewhat deeper with tracks such as BILLY'S GOT A GUN, and DIE HARD THE HUNTER. I love the songs, MIRROR MIRROR, and TOO LATE FOR LOVE, too. This set also features a cover of Badfinger's NO MATTER WHAT.

Nothing else is quite like it. The exquisite flavor not only adds to any mouthful of food but also wakes up the flavors of everything else you're eating. Best mustard to go with prime beef.

A little goes a long way, and you feel coddled whenever you have some.We used to live near a gourmet food store where we could buy this whenever we ran out.

Write your Senators and Reps-- I just picked up two jars in Paris at an overpriced shop there-- at under 10 Euros each!If you can't wait, though, for the wheels of government to grind this mustard fine, exceedingly fine, then pony up the extra dosh and get some.

We all have houses that we love to visit, especially family members, and if the house is situated right, you pass by a window to get in. In this story, the window represents so much more than just a window to pass by. It represents all that visiting that house means to the little girl visiting her grandparents.The book truly captures the love of visiting a beloved family member and the moments that last a lifetime. The little things that mean so much more than a new toy or a trip to an amusement park. It's all about the human connection.The illustrations are not typical but that's what makes it so unique. I don't think all children's books should look the same. I think a child might relate to the colorful scribbly type of pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illustrations not my cup of tea but story wins out","review":"Let me say this up front: The artwork is not my favorite. It is almost Fauvist (or maybe some other \\"ist\\"); in any case, perhaps the failing is my own immature art appreciation. But the story is sweet without being sappy, and much better than I initially gave it credit for. I particularly enjoy how it is told from the child's perspective. My favorite part is when she reports that \\"nothing happens\\" while she is napping; true enough, as far as a kid is concerned! Note that the portrayal of an interracial family has nothing to do with the story itself yet nor does it detract. To the extent that the same can be said for real life (in other words, that color *doesn't* matter), this is worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful picture book","review":"This deservingly Caldecott piece is a wonderful picture book that all children (and adults) will enjoy and read over and over.

Juster does a great job of using humor and play to show the special relationship between the child narrator in this story and her grandparents.I especially love Poppy's morning greating (\\"HELLO WORLD! WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR US TODAY?\\") because it gently teaches children to not fear the world. As the child sits at the Hello, Goodbye Window, she reinforces this message when she says, \\"...anybody can come along when you least expect it. ... They could all come! And a lot more if they want.

The heroine, Regina, seemed to be a spoilt and selfish little madam, which is unusual for Oliver: her heroines are usually sensible, intelligent women with a well-developed sense of humour. However, Regina did improve later in the book, and I ended up enjoying it.It was interesting to encounter both Gresham and Wolverton in a book set before both of their own stories; I would also love to see Oliver write a book with David Laughton as the hero. He has cropped up in a few of her books now, and he sounds intriguing as well as having a mysterious and sad past."},{"rating":"1","title":"On my unfished shelf","review":"I bought this book a couple of years ago because of its place in the series of Oliver's Corinthian books. I started it but never finshed it - except for skipping to the end to see how it came out. Why - I thought the heroine's behaviour was so childish and self-centered that I lost patience. I find that my enjoyment of any book - but any romance most of all - depends on the development of the principal characters. If I don't like the people, then... so long.

The action, as I should have known from watching the Robotech TV series, is just a confusion of missiles and smashing metal.Perhaps younger sci-fi fans would enjoy this movie. If you're older you might want to check out something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful story of the search for peace at the end of war","review":"I found this movie to be full of action and true life experiences.

I don't recommend buying it, but I do recomend reading the Manga... it is much more interesting than listening and watching though half closed eyes... this Anime Video contains some of the most uninspired voice talent I have ever heard (Dubbed and Subtitled versions) and the most lackluster animation of any Robotech or Macross series. Again read the Manga, and skip the Anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"this is the WORST of the macross world. it's boring and the animation is not all that great. skip this one and go to macross plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Anime fan I know of said this was a mistake to make","review":"No, I haven't seen it and perhaps it would be quick to judge without my seeing it, but every Anime fan I know of who has seen it essentially said it was awful. So awful that in fact all sequels based upon the Macross universe just pretended that the events in this movie never really happened (Just like Highlander II)I'd spend my hard earned bucks on something else, like Macross Plus (now there's a good Macross movie)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what it is....","review":"First off, I want to say that this work is nowhere near as good as the rest of the Macross sequel offerings (Macross Plus, Macross Zero, Macross 7, etc).That being said, I think that this series is unfairly being compared to it's siblings, that are paradigms of the genre (kinda like Alien 3, which in and of itself, was a good movie, but paled in comparison to it's predecessors). But if you look at it by itself, you'll find that it's a pretty fun story with really good animation. Again, not up to par with the rest of the family, but still able to knock the socks off of a lot of other anime offerings out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Macross Plus! This is Macross II!","review":"Every review I have read here is talking about Macross Plus - an entirely different series produced several years after this. Macross II is the first sequal series to Macross. The first half is an intriguing set-up for a series, but the second half is lackluster and delivers no real pay-off. PLUSES: The character designs by original Macross designer Haruhiko Mikimoto are fantastic. The animation and space battles for the first half of the story is great. The universe feels like a natural extension of the original series. MINUSES: Poor second half, both in terms of animation quality and storytelling. Overall, a worthwhile diversion for Macross fans, and any fan of Mikimoto or Kawamori's designs. And still light years better than Macross Zero or the infantile Macross 7 which inexplicably ran for many years.

The older ones were made in the USA in MA and used german made view finders and had real glass lenses (not plastic) The quality of the older cameras with this film is unmatched. They do make high quality 600 and I think 600 black and white or they used to (don't know)If you have a older Polaroid This 667 is great and 669 color also check the film speeds the older camera can take before you buy. They don't have to match perfectly just close is fine. Just adjust exposer control ring on lense to correct. Good luck. 600 film is not the same cartridge size as 667 0r 669.

Their music is heavy southern rock, and the songs on \\"Concert\\" are almost all catchy. The main disadvantage is that the singer, Greg Strzempka, has a halting delivery which might annoy some.

This book provides an excellent deconstruction of some of the more insidious distortions that are becoming increasingly evident in the corporate owned and influenced mainstream news."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"As depicted on the cover illustration, Norman Solomon brilliantly shows us how the mass media behaves like submissive monkeys, well-trained by corporate power.

I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparks and heat... very little illumination","review":"This is a tired book.... Reading it you get the idea that the author never quite got over the 60s as he rales against all the things any self-respecting liberal would have then. If it's something that business or government or the rich do, it's automatically suspect if not out-and-out evil. Eugene Debs would be proud of it, but Solomon's rants suggest he's run his course and can only hope of punditry to pay his future way. He screeches about workplace safety, just to take one example, but doesn't take into fact enormous improvements over the years. (Workplace accidents now stand at something under 7% of what they were in 1913, according to the latest research from the CDE... but then, they're a governmental agency, so must by lying, right Professor Solomon?) This is a Lone Ranger book... tedium, tedium, tedium-um-um. At least the cartoon are moderately amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Wisdom of Solomon","review":"Why read The New York Review of Books when Norman Solomon can tell you why the local news weaterhman knows less than he does about the world. Yessiree, Norm's smart guy, smarter than you anyway, and he lets you now in this book. He doesn't pull his punches, he tells it like it is, blah,blah,blah,blah,blah.

Otherwise, thre are about a million more illuminating authors in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This book is comparable to the Pope calling Mother Teresa an atheist.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flash Over Substance","review":"Another account of how the media, and hence all of us, are all controlled by white guys in suits. Mr. Solomon uses the rubric of corporate media control as a vehicle to uncover his real agenda that is anti-U.S. foreign policy, anti-free market, anti-military, and blame America first.I was really hoping for well-thought-out, reasoned arguments but all I found in here was the same tired leftist mantra that yields little positive results in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, but I hated it because(watch for spoilers)...","review":"of major character death! Some people prefer not to read books that will leave them crying for hours on end, myself being one of them. Readers should be warned that the characters they have fallen in love with through the first half of the book will meet an incredibly gruesome fate, and will be replaced by much less likable characters... Jamie and Jenny. This book was well-written, but should not have been marketed as a normal romance novel without some warning to readers that it ends so horribly. So, actually, my problem is not with the book itself, which I would give three stars normally, but with the marketers of the book. I sat down to read this book as a way to relax during my fall break from college, and wound up crying for three hours straight! Read this book, because it is a nice enough way to pass an afternoon, but do not go into it expecting hearts, flowers, and a happily-ever-after as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chase The Wind - Cindy Holdby","review":"This book was excellent reading!

Alex Kolker takes you into another world, telling stories that not always have to do with the music, but what's behind the music - the people. I never got to follow the Grateful Dead, but I almost feel like I was a part of it after reading this book. I felt completely wrapped up in each character, as if they were someone I had just met. So go and do yourself a favor...buy this book, and run, don't walk, to a Phish show...and see if you don't feel a bit of the wonder and magic yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book reads like written for grade schoolers","review":"I think that the whole aspect of hitting the road and going on tour with a band is just about the coolest thing that a person can do. Thus, this book seemed like the perfect read for someone like me. But when I got the book I was dissapointed in the fact that it seems like the author took five or six stories from the 'The Babysiters Club' or some other book for young kids, rewrote them to include drug and music references, and than sold it. The writing is just not very good and the stories are all lame. A girl's mother realizes her 16 year old daughter is right about being on tour, a girl runs from the cops and gets away, a ticket is fake, ect.

Drug use - yes. That was an inevitable part of the scene at a Dead show. \\"philly head\\" may find it distasteful, but that's his problem.I had the great pleasure of watching and reading this book as it evolved over the years. If you ever quit your job and grew your hair to go on Tour, chances are you'll have a blast reading this and want more. If you never had the chance to go on Tour with the Grateful Dead, then this is your opportunity to experience it a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it on a kindle","review":"This book might be good in the paper format, but it's terrible to navigate on a kindle. The answer key is so small it hurts your eyes, and cannot be adjusted with the font settings.Also, constantly having to scroll back and forth between exercise and answer key is exhausting. The author also launches right into exercises without giving you the vocab first, and expects conjugations from exercise 1.4!

Either it's fuzzy, or blurry, or just down right bizarre-looking - boy, do some people on TV look weird through this TV. And the sound is very tinny. My old TV was a 19\\" Sony Trinitron I bought in the mid-80s, so I'm used to a decent picture, with decent sound quality. I should've saved up another $75 and bought a good TV. I think Toshiba and Panasonic both had nice 27\\" flat-screen TVs for about $275. But I'm so cheap. Well, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"27\\" diagonal piece of junk","review":"I haven't bought a new television in years, and I ASSUMED that a JVC would be just fine. What a mistake. If this is what picture quality from a brand-name manufacturer has come down to, then the world has gone horribly wrong. This thing is TERRIBLE. The picture looks all jumbly and mushed up, and the sound is awful - like it's coming from out of a metal garbage can. You really can't get a good idea of picture and sound quality from inside a huge, loud big-box store, can you?

Actually, the website would be more promising. For it could be updated easily, and the companies it mentions would have links that go to them.A book of this nature is primarily a reference. It's not like a novel or textbook, which many people still rightly prefer, for reasons of convenience or ease of reading. While you might indeed go through this book page by page, it is like the phone book. If you had to use a hardcopy of the latter, or an online query, what would you use? Likewise here."},{"rating":"1","title":"not reccomended.","review":"this deck removes nearly all helpful symbolism and replaces it with quasi-shamanistic, badly-drawn, badly-colored images. this deck could possibly be used by people who value the political statement over the real learning of a tarot system, but for all others, steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poorly Conceived Deck","review":"This is not really a tarot deck; it is a political tract. It appeals, really, to a VERY limited audience, but those to whom it does appeal defend it vigorously.Its main attraction, I think, is its venomous male-bashing throughout. In fact, it is very generous in its misanthropy. The authors' philosophy draws heavily on the colorful and not unentertaining works of Mary Daly, but, sadly, Noble and her accomplice take Daly's ravings seriously. The deck suffers for it.This really is not a life affirming deck in any sense.The artwork is unskilled. The deck's roundness is gimmicky, not useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely They Jest...","review":"The authors of this deck, that is. I mean, I have read some of the other reviews, and to me, the bigotry evident in this deck is inarguable. The artwork is a notch above cave paintings--which may or may not be intentional--and compared to some of the other decks out there (like the Thoth deck), it is very inadequate.The authors' \\"wild wanton womyn\\" theme is so mannered and tedious that one quickly tires of the deck. True tarot decks represent true diversity with a wide range of archetypes. The Motherpeace deck limits itself to one archetype (the Matriarch) and very narrow variations thereof.The authors express a blatant dislike of males and maleness--in the book more than the deck, although it is VERY clear in the deck once you have perused the book.This might make a good gag gift if you have money to burn, but, really, it is quite unpleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"for men too","review":"Guys can be feminists too, and this deck is great for us!

I wear a size \\"10 D\\" in any other shoe I have purchased. However in the two Minnetonka shoe products the \\"10 D\\" was too narrow and too short. For me a size \\"10 1/2\\" or \\"11 E\\" fits okay in this shoe.UPDATE: After 7 months the right shoe's sole was no longer attached to the toe of the shoe.

After racking up significant shipping and return shipping charges, I finally ordered a pair of the camp mocs, which were too wide but I kept them because I was tired of wasting money. I emailed Minnetonka about the size variations but they never bothered to respond.

My only complaint is that there is not enough padding or arch support underfoot. I like loafers that support almost like athletic shoes; these do not.

My problem is that the vibraphone by its nature sucks all the attention in its direction. Hence the very limitations of the instrument boxes in the rest of the band. I don't care how many mallets are stuck between the fingers the sound is one-dimensional. It is a serious mistake to let this particular instrument dominate an entire album. Most people find the sound of the vibraphone pleasing at first only to tune out later. This is a shame in that this is obviously a quality effort on the part of the band.I'm sorry. All the pieces run into each other and I had the repeated problem having my attention drift to other matters (\\"I wonder how many pencils DO I have?\\"). Mr. Holland should have mixed things up more."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like homogeneous jazz (elevator jazz?) go for it","review":"...You can't tell one song from another on this album...

The twist on the old easy-listening is that this music tries desperately to sound cool and modern...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Jazz fans, real jazz fans anyway","review":"I'm not trying make value judgements here, but I just want you to know what your getting. To me, this is not the Hollan who did Conference with the Bird's and Duo's w/ Sam Rivers, all amazing and clasic stuff. As for this, I would say, if you listen to it while driving a BMW, you will probably like it. If you like less glossy and (to my ears) superfical modern jazz (not really jazz, the drummer is LAME), such as roscoe mitchell, Kieth Jarrett, jason Moran, etc, you won't want this album at all! The music really lacks depth and daring. It might make good backgroud for some. I say, don't encourage jazz to go so commercial. We have enough contentless commodities out there. Let's make room for and recognize some real indiviudalty and creaitivity (listen to roscoe Mitchell's Nine to Get Ready, or Jarrett's Inside Out, for instance)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potter Rules","review":"This is a really fabulous album. The sound is contemporary and very listenable, not necessarily compatible concepts. The instrumentals are very solid. Chris Potter is amazing. If you have not listened to this fine young tenor player before, you will want to immediately buy some of his own albums. In this author's opinion, Potter has surpassed other current phenoms, such as Branford Marsalis, Joshua Redman, Mark Turner, etc. He seems to be a strange mix of Joe Lovano and Wayne Shorter and Coltrane. This group plays like they have been together for a very long time. I for one hope that they will stay together to produce more fine jazz albums like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz Guy Autumn Picks","review":"The consistently high quality of Dave Holland's Quintet releases is maintained in the new one, \\"Not For Nothin'\\" The cohesion, discipline and musicianship of this group are routinely remarked upon, but it is Holland's skills as a composer and arranger that comprise the defining elements of this band. There is not a single weak track here, but I particularly dug the opener, \\"Global Citizen\\", \\"Shifting Sands\\" and \\"Billows of Rhythm\\". Dave Holland remains one of jazz's most cogent arguments for sheer excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good AC Adapter","review":"I am happy with this AC Adapter, at first charge/power up it ran warm, but once the battery charged it cooled down and has not run as warm as the 1st time.I ordered this product because it is a OEM Adapter and the cable is good quality, thick and flexible.

I can hear my children's voices in this very alive stick figure child, but these are voices I did not hear at the time because I was too caught up in my own emotions. But...What About Me? gets to the heart of the matter of a child affected by divorce and hopefully will trigger a wakeup call to the parents to help the children they both love, to feel loved and not torn apart. The book and the workshops are so needed in this world where divorce is the norm rather than not, and encourages maturity and selflessness in handling a child's whole world turned upside down. The personalities and emotions shown in the illustrator's drawings, combined with the author's words from the mind of a very hurt and confused child, tells the whole story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant and educational book!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

I have listened to this CD over 15 times and still enjoy every listen. There is truly not a weak track on the CD. Let the morons who gave this 1 star go back to their emeinem , and psuedo punk.

You will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much Devo, too little Green Day","review":"How this CD keeps getting five star reviews I don't know. I love Green Day, tolerate Devo. Unfortunately for me, the ratio of Devo to Green Day was far too much in favor of the former. The songs, and I use that term loosely, are almost entirely devoid of any tune or melody and the lyrics are almost incomprehensible. The few moments where I could filter the Green Day guys out of the rest were pretty good, but out of 12 songs, that accounted for far too little time. Two of my favorite CD's are Green Day's \\"Warning\\" and \\"Dookie\\". But this CD, while definitely part Green Day is just too much Devo to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Day had to be drunk to make this.","review":"I bought this CD because I heard it was Green Day and I love Green Day, my 2nd favorite band (1st-Foo Fighters). I was disappointed when I listened to it, it's mostly techno crap. If you like techno, good for you then buy the album. If you like rock and Green Day then buy another Green Day album if you don't have them all already. Don't waste your money unless you like techno. There's about 2 songs that are okay but the rest suck. The singer sounds a little like Billie Joe Armstrong, that's the only major similarity I found between the two bands. None of the songs sound like any of Green Day's songs (Green Day's songs are tremendously better). All of Green Day's albums are incredibly better especially Dookie, one of the greatest albums of all time. I don't think Green Day could make this crap unless they were drugged, drunk, or both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"This CD sucks and barely sounds anything like Green Day. Everything Green Day has ever written is a lot better. Green Day probably didn't want to ruin their reputation so they kept themselves secret when they made this, if they made this, I don't they could make something this bad. Differentenemy and joethomann are totally right about this CD. Don't waste your money on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mucho Crapola","review":"Let me explain to everyone what's the deal with the Network. Green Day got together with two other guys to experiment with a different sound. Well, unfortunately, the new sound sucks. Green Day tried to remain anonymous so if the music didnt go over well their name wasnt attatched. The singer in Supermodel Robots is clearly Bill Joe, and the lead singer in several other of the songs is clearly Mike Dirnt. This music is crap. Supermodel Robots is a quick energetic punk song, but this sounds totally different than the rest of the record. Come on guys, I know your gettin old and you want to experiment with new sounds, but please, all we are askin for is a sound like you had with Insomniac and Nimrod. There should seriously be a crap section in the music store for music like this. Don't waste your money on this crap, eventhough the members of Green Day are in this band, it sounds nothing like Green Day and it sucks hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen if you must","review":"If you want to listen to '80's retreads then this CD is for you.

Its a new wave album in the year 2003, and to me the fact that someone thought to somewhat bring it back makes me a happy camper. All of the tracks are marvelous, as I have listening to this over and over again, and enjoying it more and more. Its great to sit and listen to and its even BETTER to listen to when driving in your car. I applaud Billy Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tre Cool. I bow down to the two members of Devo (for I don't know which two members yet) and I bow down even more to Devo in general for there great influence. I am really excited about this album, and I think its absoultly wonderful. Thank you very much to all those listed before for making such a wonderful thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album of 2009","review":"O.k. first I know it didn't come out in 2009 but I saw Green Day in concert and only found out about this album in 2009. I got it with low expectations but found that it has incredibly good fun catchy music. It's great music to run by. There is one song off the new Green Day album that has the \\"network\\" sound... I can't recall which one but you'll figure it out immediately. The album reminds me of some old Surf rock too. Just a warning... the album contains \\"naughty words\\" and that could be the deal maker or breaker for some of you. You have to love the liner notes... there is just this great subversive quality to playing this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is Green Day","review":"This band IS Green Day although it is a slightly different genre. If you wish to know more about this band I highly doubt that you will find it under Green Day.

With awsome 3D graphics. With the best boats and tracks, including bonus tracks and boats to win. plus even more extra boats on the tracks for fun like cruise ships.

Its addictive, everyone who sees it picks up the pieces to try and build something.

And you always run short of the sticks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Wii control options ruin a great series","review":"Classic games and motion control do not mix.I bought the Wii version of the MSA as it was cheaper than the PS2 version. I figured since there was a GC controller option, I could hook up my PS2 controller via my controller adapter. I was disappointed to find out the D-Pad does not work. And it wasn't because the adapter isn't compatible since I also tried hooking up a GC controller and using the D-Pad on that, and it turns out that the D-Pad is just not activated in GC controller mode. So the only way to play with a D-Pad is with the Wiimote, which would've been fine, except you have to shake it to throw a grenade. They didn't even give the option for the classic controller. I like using motion controls on Wii games meant for motion control. I like thumbsticks for 3D games. For classic 2D gaming, however, I prefer to keep the controls classic; with good ol'-fashioned D-Pad and buttons.I highly recommend Metal Slug Anthology; just not on the Wii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"This is a very nice game.

If contra would have kept on being cool and would have had comedy in it, it would have been metal slug. The controls are GREAT on the Wii. I think there is like 5 diffrent ways to play. The only down fall of this collection is that it doesnt have a lot of unlockables. For the metal slug collection i would expect more. Plus this game has ulimited credits, so play your little hart out."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"A great collection for a great price. This game, second only to Zelda: Twighlight Princess, should be at the top of everyone's list. The Metal Slug games are the best 2D shooters ever made and once you play them you will know why.The only con I have about the game is that you cannot use the classic controller.

The best parts of it are the complete collections such as the First, Second and Supplemental Years of the Annees de Pelerinage and the complete Transcendental Etudes. The playing is compelling and the technique is near flawless, if not flawless. I like the fact that Bolet does not rush through any one piece for the sake of speed over substance but I feel his playing of the Galop Chromatique is too slow. I really wish this set further included the entire Harmonies Poetiques and the entire Annees de Pelerinage. Had it contained those two works in their entirety, I would've given this box set 6 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Binding","review":"This is a very good collection of Kant's practical writings, but I strongly advise against buying the hardcover edition. The binding is very poor quality and it will inevitably crack the moment you open the book (I exchanged my first copy after it broke, but the second did the same). In short, if you're going to buy this book, buy the paperback edition and don't waste your money on the hardcover edition. The paper is of better quality in the paperback, and you won't have spent three times as much money for a poorer quality book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good . . .","review":"This was received as a Christmas gift, and was a disappointment. After following the spartan instructions, we cranked the lantern for 5-6 minutes. We powered up the unit and the LED's dimmed to half brightness after less than one minute. The lights at half brightness stayed lit for quite a while, but half brightness is just too dim to be usable.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light doesn't last","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who said the light dimmed after a minute.

The options can be overwhelming and the web interface not so intuitive but you get all the features you'd expect for the price. The hardware is nice and heavy but the plastic shell feels a bit flimsy. Picture quality looked pretty good once I had it set up to simply ftp snapshots off-site when motion was detected.Two days after the return period ended (today) and the camera has stopped responding. I have yet to try resetting and reconfiguring (in the middle of dismantling the network for a move) but will update this review with the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay in full light...","review":"We bought our camera to monitor our toddler while he's in his room. I picked the Panasonic because it had a good reputation of not disconnecting, something a prior camera we had purchased had problems with. True enough, the connection was rock solid. And it's a quiet camera too, like a whisper. BUT... the image was heavily pixelated compared to other netcams, and it's absolutely horrible in low light. If you closed the shades in the room during the day, or tried to operate it at night with a small night light, you got a solid black screen. The image size on your computer is also very small compared to others I've seen. To add to the issues, the mounting bracket was a joke and there is no ability whatsoever for a ceiling mount - it's wall mount only. Finally, the range of scan was very limited. In the end, we returned this camera, mostly because of the pathetic performance in low light."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good FOR A MAC - can't see at work","review":"the product does work if you want to use it within your local WIFI.

Wired is fine. Not WiFi. Yet I have several other IP Cams (Toshiba, D-Link) plus many other devices (PC, MacBook, Nokia phone, several laptops, Nokia tablet, iPhone, etc) working on the wireless.Panasonic's support FAQ doesn't even have a single hit for the BL-C131A. But since I do this type of stuff every day, I either got a bad unit or they have some serious compatibility woes. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Network Camera","review":"This Panasonic network camera works great. I had to call their toll free number two or three times for help. They stayed on the telephone for nearly two hours each time and guided me through the installation and trouble shooting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has trouble with wireless security","review":"I've had this camera for over a year now and although I'm happy with the video monitoring performance I have a lot problems with it when I set up wireless security on my wireless router.If I set any type of wireless encryption on the router and set the camera to the same security it will not establish a connection.If I set up MAC address filtering on the router the camera will still not establish a connection.The only way I can use the router in wireless mode is to have a completely unsecured wireless network.I've updated the camera BIOS to no avail. I have other devices that connect flawlessly (laptops & Wii), but this camera is a no go.Not recommended if wireless security is important to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the camera was to setup. I am still trying to figure out all the options for Internet access, but the options used so far have been great. There is a wide range of pan and tilt. The zoom is electronic. So the zoomed images are pretty fuzzy.After several months of use, I feel I need to mention some problems. This camera can provide direct Internet access without having to go through a local computer. But it eventually loses Internet access. I can only remotely keep an eye on things because I have a local computer that I can remotely access. I can use that to make a local network connection to restore camera Internet functions. When a power outage went beyond battery backup up time for the remote computer, all was lost until I returned to the site to get things going again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating ...","review":"Well, I've had this camera for a week and it works fine in wired mode but have not had any luck with it working in wireless mode ... tech support has so far not been any help?

I had a little difficulty getting the wireless figured out, but after reading through the documentation and fiddling with my router I was able to get it working.

It worked well for this purpose, and the picture was pretty good and better than expected in low light. Two gripes with the product. First, the viewnetcam websites were unreliable, so checking in on the kids from work was hit or miss. Second, and more importantly, the products do not last. We've had two C131As, and both broke down after about 18 months.

That makes a two-star on the ease of use. Low light performance is not good (7AM on a winter day in room in Chicago makes an impossible to view dark recording), which makes it 4-star overall for features.

It doesn't come back bothering you with trouble shooting or re-installation.I like the built-in HTTP server, the website service provided by Panasonic seemed to be discontinued, but it was relative easy for me to change its port number and use port forwarding on my router.It's a little pricey, but the quality is good, my installation was mostly smooth, except a minor delay because of a typo I made in my wireless network name.Edit: Two and half years since I put this in service, still working, no problem at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice camera...Fairly easy to set up...","review":"Using camera for a pet cam and back porch cam.

I can log onto it from my iPhone and see what's going on at the house while I'm away. It has a long electrical cord, which makes it easy to place wherever it is needed. To move it, just unplug it and plug it into the new location.The software can also be set to automatically upload pictures to a web site at a periodic interval.The only downside about this camera is that it takes a bit of figuring out. The manual is not very useful, particularly with regards to the software, but once you get it set up there's no maintenance to be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around Camera ! Beware its not plug and play !!","review":"This is overall a great camera. If you are looking for a basic camera that allows you to watch your kids or pets than its great. Don't expect high resolutions or you will be disappointed. The camera is easy to install, but the wireless function requires a user with a little bit of knowledge in setting the network router.Great camera. I highly recommend it.To set up the wireless mode:Go Into your router and make sure it support port forwarding. Set both (the netcam and your router) with the same SSID name, and have both ports setup the same port number ( 50000). The manual doesn't help much, once you set up both port number to 50000 than switch to the wireless mode. I was having difficulty at first , but it is mostly due to the router setting. So make sure your router is set right , the camera just autodetect right out of the box !! But you have to manually go into the netcam setup to change the port number !!Good Luck !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when it worked","review":"I had this camera for almost 2 years.It worked Ok until two weeks ago when the front LED started flashing red.Call to Panasonic technical support did not help - the camera needs to be sent back for repair.Just the labor is about half of what I paid for the camera, which makes the repair option meaningless.The camera was never abused and was at the same place all that time (in a room next to glass window)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complex setup and poor image","review":"If this is the best, as other reviews claim, I would not want to experience the others. The system works and has lots of features but it has too big flaws. The first is, as others have said, setup is complex and you will likely need tech support - it took about a half hour going thru various router settings etc to get this thing to work. And if I ever change my router I'll have to go thru that again. This is about as far from plug and play as you can get. But my main gripe is image quality. At 640 x 480 (decades old resolution) the image is very grainy and fuzzy - probably about what you might expect from a $19.95 keychain digicam, or worse. Maybe I'm spoiled in owning a modern digicam but it must be possible to do better than this. The lens appears to be a pinhole - I'm not sure there is any lens at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Product, Poor Documentation, Uneven Support","review":"This is a remarkable device and well worth the money. It has a wide range of scan and tilt, good picture quality, especially within 100 feet of its objects, and outstanding sound pick-up. The documentation, as commented elsewhere, doesn't adequately cover port forwarding (necesssary if you want to view your picture from over the internet), so you will undoubtedly end up in long sessions with their telephone tech support people (who are not uniformly knowledgeable, so you'll probably end up calling back a few times till you get one who really understands the subject).

I rarely listen to the entire CD without falling asleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"speechless....","review":"I just have to say that this is the most beautiful recording I have ever heard. Up until listening to Spiegel im Spiegel, I have never cried to a CD before. However, I unashamedly bawled my eyes out while I was listening to this in the record store. It is delicate, like spring rain, it is moving and it certainly touched me like no way I ever thought possible. I highly recommend this cd to any Arvo Part lover (and to anybody else)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful starkness...","review":"Anyone who has never heard these two compositions is likely to break down during his/her first listen to this disc. Words cannot convey the interplay of the notes and the silence between them...Spiegel Im Spiegel I think is best expressed as a slow dance between the piano and violin (or cello). Each instrument follows a progression of notes that gently reaches an amazing climax; this piece particularly emphasises the violinist's ability to sustain some high notes (you can almost hear the rosin coming off of the bow/string...).Fur Alina is delicacy on the keyboard. You will need a quiet room for this piece.Some may think the album a bit of a waste because of the repetition but I suspect those people are just not listening very carefully. Each track is somewhat different and it is an enjoyable experience to hear the progression over the entire album."},{"rating":"1","title":"note of caution","review":"I would disagree with some of the other reviewers here on an essential point: if you are not familiar with Part's music, listen to this CD before you buy it. Obviously many people love this music, but I'm afraid I'm not one of them. This composer's music might be defined as extreme minimalism, and for me the music on this CD is the aural equivalent of watching paint dry. Part makes Steve Reich seem positively frantic with activity. If you really want to hear one or two instruments playing ten minute chunks of the same music, with only the slightest variation from piece to piece, or as each piece progresses for that matter, than this might be your idea of beauty. It sure isn't mine. Either Gorecki or Glass are safer bets in this gereral category. For that matter, I'd take Paul McCartney's Working Classical or Keith Jarrett's The Music at Night, with You over this if \\"contemplative\\" is what you are after. Listen before you leap."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I like it.","review":"I think I like it. Well I like it- but it's hard to get way into this one. In one way it 'takes one away' and in another way- it doesn't go far enough in that regard. So you are stuck about 2/3 the way there. Know what I mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a DOG!","review":"Anyone who has been captivated by the minimal spaciousness and poise of Part's other releases should think twice before purchasing this turkey. The compositions (only two of them, but recycled several times by Manfred Eicher in this pre-Christmas cash-in on the composer's celebrity) date back to the seventies when Part was still germinating his true style. They are tedious in the extreme, lacking the harmonic depth and thematic development that characterise his more listenable works. Newcomers to Arvo Part's world would do far better to check out Te Deum or Kanon Pokajanen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the emperor wearing?","review":"I like the works of Part, not for concert listening but as background music for creating an ambiance. I frequently play his music when doing yoga in the mornings. But this album goes much to far in the direction of minimalism for my taste. The music is childishly simple and repetitive. The marketing department compounds the insult with extra layers of packaging, and by filling a CD with nearly-identical performances of the same two works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Part's Alina and John McArthur's HIDDEN may very well be the two greatest albums of the 21st Century and what a splendid way to start.I look forward to more from Part as he delves further into the spiritual. How lucky we are to be alive while one of the few living canonized composers continues to bless us with his artistry.A must for any Part listener and lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender...exquisite","review":"I picked this CD up at the library yesterday, and it's been on \\"repeat play\\" ever since. Up to now, I've only heard Part's choral pieces and was facscinated with the spare instrumentation. The music is infused with such tenderness....It evokes tears in me and soft rushes of longing....If anyone knows of any other similar music that this composer has created, please e-mail me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Space","review":"The use of silence in music is very dramatic here. It is not really minimalist in that it is rich in emotion and beauty. This is perfect after a hard day at work! The serenity and beauty are very touching. Its simplicity is only apparent since everything must be perfect( timing, tone, touch, etc.) to carry off the total serenity of this work. Spivakov and Malter are outstanding. Strap yourself in for a totally soothing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Achingly Beautiful","review":"The miracle of this cd resides in the depth of feeling it evokes through the simplest of means. The quiet, child-like melody offered by the piano, along with the heartbreaking violin and cello demand - surprisingly - that you stop everything and recognise an innocence you may have thought you'd lost long ago. Once again, Part surprises us with his ability to reach courageously into our subconsious and remind us of that which is truly beautiful about ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"This music was featured in HBO's \\"Wit\\": Beautiful","review":"I finally tracked down this music. It was the score behind the final scene in \\"Wit\\" with Emma Thompson that recently aired on HBO.The barely audible crecendos of the Speigel im Speigel pieces are transcendent: just a tiny act can mean so much if you pay attention and notice.I have to say I'm less fond of the piano works--a little too Windham Hill for my taste. But the other pieces are terribly moving and well worth having in any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT for lonely, rainy nights alone!","review":"I discovered Cornell Woolrich twenty years ago, his dark, macarbre thrillers leaving me a terrified teen! With this in mind, the novels and short stories collected in the omnibus were 're-reads' for me, yet they still left me in a state of spellbound suspense. However, if you're looking for an 'Agatha Christie' type whodunnit where, by the final page, the killer is safely locked up and everyone has tea...Forget it. Woolrich's work is dark and truly haunting, leaving a thrillingly eerie aftertaste.

Although Stravinsky and Ansermet had a falling out over the interpretation of some works, Ansermet was a superb interpreter of the Russian composer's music, especially the ballets. Ansermet never recorded the opera, \\"The Rake's Progress,\\" so of course that's not represented. However, I'm very disappointed that his old Decca recording of the oratorio \\"Oedipus Rex\\" with Ernest Haefliger, Helene Bouvier, and (I think) Heinz Rehfuss is not here. It certainly falls within the realm of \\"stage works,\\" so it should have been included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's Literature","review":"Sukey and the Mermaid written by Robert D. San Souci is an unusual hunting tale passed on from West Africa via the Caribbean to the Sea Islands off South Carolina's coast. It is a very interesting story about a mermaid who becomes friends with a young girl named Sukey who has had a hard life. I really enjoy this story, because it teaches a valuable lesson. It teaches readers to be grateful for what they have. It also brings to light that money does not buy happiness, it may make things easier, but it isn't what the heart truly wants. Money only matters to those who are greedy, selfish, and mean like Mister Jones. I also enjoyed the illustrations as they are also unusual but pretty and very detailed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin 3rd string","review":"I've had these on my banjo for 24 hours now, so enough time to \\"settle in\\" a bit. I absolutely hate the thin 3rd (.013) string. It feels flabby, and sounds really weak. Not only that, but it vibrates so wildly (due to being so loose) that it actually goes out of tune for a second after you strike it, returning to proper pitch only if you wait. But then, in banjo playing, you strike the strings wildly, so it never even has the chance to return to the proper pitch.I'm going to give them another day or two to see if they settle in any more, but chances are I'll be swapping them out sooner rather than later."},{"rating":"2","title":"B.B. King Twofer","review":"Actually, the first 10 tracks on this MCA cd reissue are the lp \\"Blues N Jazz.\\" This was recorded in 1983 and indeed contains some brassy blues, almost a return to his blues foundations after B.B.'s previous flirtations with funk and soul. The next 10 tracks were originally issued as the lp \\"His Best - The Electric B.B. King.\\" These are songs recorded between 1965 and 68 and include some real gems. There is an excellent live version of \\"Sweet 16\\" from the same late 1966 session issued as \\"Blues is King.\\" Some consider that lp as greater than the far more famous \\"Live at the Regal.\\" This track, not included in the original lp or cd reisse of \\"Blues is King,\\" is a definite highlight.

I have also lost 2 inches off my hips (which is a problem area for me). This video is great. You must give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vigorous exercise - and lots of fun","review":"I really liked Turbo Jam 1 and got this just in order to have some variety. But it's as if they took all the most fun moves and combined them here, so I enjoy this one quite a lot more. You really work up a sweat - it's genuine exercise - and I love the variety and the music. The time segments are just long enough so they carry you smoothly through the routine and you don't get bored. My only complaint is that Chalene is quite inept with her verbal cuing about what move is coming next - so you basically have to memorize the routine in order to avoid confusion. When she does the cuing right, like one musical measure before the change of step, it is great because you can truly relax into what you are doing. But at least half the time she announces the change right as it's happening, or even a bit after the fact. Irritating! But I do recommend the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, Goovy Workout","review":"I don't care for this particular Cardio Party Mix 2 DVD.

Of course life in a family is better, but the orphanages are doing the best they can with few resources. Many of the nannies earn as little as $20 U.S. dollars per day doing extremely hard work. Imagine two nannies taking care of 12 babies or toddlers at a time. If you've handled any number of babies or toddlers at one time, you will know what I mean.Also, most children adopted out of orphanages as toddlers have a more difficult transition period than the book portrayed.

The main character/hero gets knocked unconscious so many times he must have more concussions than Troy Aikman. For me to enjoy a piece of writing, it's absolutely necessary for the hero to DO something rather than merely observe events around him.

Rydberg's Investigations..., is just plain wrong. This is a GREAT book. The reviewer from Vinland obviously has some grudge against V. Rydberg and must not read Swedish - I think the translation is excellent and the footnotes are wonderful. It's fantastic to finally have an English translation. People you have never heard of will say bad things about V. Rydberg, but how many of them have schools named after them in Sweden? It is also stupid to say that Rydburg didn't have a background in mythology. The negative reviewer probably did not even read the two books that he posted identical reviews for.Buy both books.

That said, this album is simply haunting. Indeed, it is the closest thing to a musical representation of utter darkness I have ever heard, and has a seriousness that can only be associated with the contemplation of God, death, mourning, and other such happy noumena. The production is remarkable. I wish I could find more music that sounds like this. Anyone who wants to recommend more chorales, please feel free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revelatory recording","review":"While the scholarship behind this project overreaches a little in presuming Bach's intentions for the Chacconne, the recording is wonderful.

Gurdjieff considered European culture worthless in favor of his notion of \\"ancient\\" music (read: imaginary, mythical and nonexistant) and he certainly did not have Bach in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"musicology meets musicality","review":"this is about as good as it gets and those who have criticized the violin playing (\\"shallow tone\\" etc.) probably just don't happen to like the sound of the baroque violin and the style in which it invites one to play it. the instruments played by your veghs, menuhins, heifetzes etc. have without exception been extensively tampered with since they left their makers' workbenches in order to produce the bigger but blander sound more suited to more recent music and preferred by many modern ears. a modern g, and i think, d string notwithstanding (see telltale photo), poppen is playing an instrument that more closely resembles what bach and near contemporaries such as antonio stradivari and guarneri del gesu would have recognised as a violin. a correspondingly \\"modern\\" approach to the singing would probably have disfigured bach's harmonies (exquisitely tuned by the hilliards) with pitch-altering vibrato - ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant IDEA, Horrid EXECUTION","review":"I wonder about the results of this project had it been executed by a more accomplished violinist.

This book fell off the shelf and bumped me on the head. I put it in my pack and when I finished, I read it for hours in a coffeshop. Then I read everything by Shah I could find, Tales of the Dervishes, etc. They say you can't be a sufi by reading about it. To a point, I agree with that, unless it triggers something inside you that you 'remember' or 'discover' that you are one perhaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect","review":"The most well documented and interesting book about the sources of sufism and spirituality. I recommand too all the books of Idries Sha, great man and a great specialist in the scientific way of the word. You can be christian, muslim, budist or whatever... You will love it. And may be learn a lot of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Difficult but Rewarding Read","review":"I think it should be clear from reading the above reviews that if one begins this book with a preconceived notion of what it should contain, the result will be disappointment and confusion. Like the title of the Rumi classic, this book has \\"in it what is in it.\\" It is part of a course of study, and though it is rich in factual information about Sufism, those who are obsessed with the academic inquiries \\"Who, what, when, and where?\\" will find that they could have gotten what they were seeking without the difficulty of bothering with the parts of this book whose purpose is something else. So I will, in a sense, concur with those who have panned this book: If you are looking for an academic treatment of the history of Sufism, this book is not for you. If you are interested simply in learning what a true Sufi master has to teach you, whether or not it is what you originally set out to learn, read The Sufis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair book for pseudo-Sufi studies","review":"This is one of Shah's books which \\"popularized\\" the Sufi path in America. While it can be viewed as a very general \\"introduction\\" and is interesting in parts, it lacks the authority of scholarship and experience. The author, Idries Shah, was a self-proclaimed \\"Sufi Master\\" and falsely claimed numerous titles for himself. If you want a good, honest introduction to the Sufi path, read \\"Heart, Self, and Soul\\" by Robert Frager or\\"Irshad\\" by Muzaffer Ozak. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a New-Age, watered down, westernized \\"Sufism\\" stripped of it's spiritual essence, than I guess Idries Shah is for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps a work of a charlatan?","review":"I read this book The Sufis and found that its best points are taken from an another tradition and distorted . Its good for references to Sufi books (?) but beyond that caution is needed!Be careful when reading this. But feel very free to read the works of the original sufis: Attar, Saadi,Rumi,Khayyam in their original versions. There is no short cut to enlightenment remember that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much substance","review":"10-Point Rating: (2.5)The book is classified by the publisher as Religion/Philosophy (top left back cover), but it is anything but. The reader is treated to life story after anecdote after life story without any attention whatsoever given to the phenomenon of sufism as a religion (or philosophical worldview). Even classifying this work as a history would be a stretch, there is no continuity or development of sufi thought as a historical progression. Sometimes it seems as though the author is being obscure because the subject matter is so subtle, but my take is that the book is just poorly written. In short, if you are buying this book to discover what sufism is (as I did), you will be disappointed with what this book in fact delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swamp Fox","review":"I used to only have this music collection on cassette tape, and searced for some time to replace the worn out version with a crisp sounding CD.

I was in high school when he hit the charts in July of '69 and \\"Polk Salad\\" was one of my favorite hits. To this day whenever it comes on the radio or I pop the cd into my player, it brings back so many fun memories of us all singing and humming to the tune, I will never forget!

To get it to run you should install these 2 things:Service pack 2 and Black and White patch 1.2. Also I would recomend on XP that you have 192MEGS of RAM instead of 64. Now the game: You play as a god. You quickly see a angel and monster hanging around that are your good and evil consinese. They provide some advice. Basiclly you help people or scare/kill them. You quickly choose from a creature.You can choose from a nurturing cow, a smart ape,and a strong tiger. No matter what creature you choose you will probally want to train it to be violent or peacefull. In the game you come across several sidequests. Yet later in the game you can learn miracles, which your creature can learn to. My 2 problems are: The creatures take forever to grow, and gestures(a way of casting miracles)are hard to cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God!","review":"I installed XP last week and I've been trying out a lot of games. Black & White always wowed me and now on XP with the 1.2 patch it works mighty fine. I had not problems whatsoever.

I'm using an older version of the game and don't have the add on yet. Another patch, 1.3, is for people who have this special glove that really looks as if it would enhance the game.

Then the Deluxe was offered and I read the box carefully; XP compatible it said. I was excited to get home only to be disappointed once again.

I have enormous patience with video games; sometimes one has to delve deeply into a game to appreciate its finer points. As far as I'm concerned, this game has no finer points.

Margaret Goff Clark wrote this book. This is a historical fiction book. The book takes place back in the 1850's. This book tells about slavery and the underground railroad. It first takes place in Laura and Bert's house. Laura and Bert are two of the main people. The middle of the night Laura is having trouble getting to sleep in bed she here's voices down stairs later on she finds out there's a slave in the house. This book is filled with action and suspense. So basically Laura and Bert have to help the slave Martin get to Canada. This book is probably for 4th grade and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaron's Review","review":"The book was about a runaway slave named Martin.My favorite character was Martin because he was funny. This was a good book. Laura was a girl from the south who didn't believe in slavery, and when she found her brother and childhood friend were hiding a slave in their house she was enraged. Once she got to know Martin though, things changed. My favorite part of the book was near the end and Laura decided to help Martin, they were in the basement of the strange house and they heard footsteps, and knew they were going to get captured.I would encourage anyone who likes suspense books to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An \\"ok\\" book","review":"We didn't really like the book because it was kinda predictable.

There is a runaway slave and they try to save him from all of the slave catchers.

Combat is run up and hit the enemy, go back, do these same two things again until you're bored out of your mind. All of the sound effects are really weird, and just plain annoying. There is no dual shock support, analog control, and the loading times are even noticeable. Plus, the graphics are just filled with glitches to the brim. Even navigating around the little menu is a chore. I know there are some bad games out there, but only a few are truly horrible.

She was great singing Rossini and Mozart Opera. She was even better singing Soprano-Arias than mezzo Arias.

In these Gluck Italian Arias the amount of air in her voice is tremendous, almost disphonic. This is more likely to older Jazz Singers(!) Not to classical vocalists. The colour of her voice appears artificially pressed. I really miss the SOPRANO Cecilia Bartoli!!!Her refreshing Italian temperament which she showed fabulously in Mozart's Coos Fan Tutte and Rossini's Works (and should do more of this) is unsuited in Guck's and Handel's Music.

Our dog pretty much takes this without a fight, but the only thing I didn't like was that I have to cut them in half because she is so small (9lb Yorkie).

The sheets in the first wash lost about half its flannel from pilling and left terrible mess of blue flannel all over the other clothes.

I am glad I got these on sale, but I would never buy them again at any price.A Side Note - I also purchased the Ivory colored version of these sheets. They too lost a ton of material in the first wash, however they did not suffer from the same pilling like the blue sheets.

I've bought perfectly nice flannel sheets, king-size, for $10 more, that didn't shed one bit. These make a huge mess in the washer, dryer, laundry room, bed, bedroom, and all over whatever clothing they come in contact with; it's absurd, and I really can't believe Amazon soiled their usually fine reputation selling junk like this. I bought three sets, and they aren't worth the postage to send them back....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warm sheets...cheap manufacture","review":"The sheets are warm, but they are not like the flannel that I am used to. They shed enough during and especially after each of the first 3-4 washes that one could knit a sweater out of the lint that you have to vacuum off the bed, pick off your clothes, and brush off of your skin--not to mention the huge lint balls that you pull out of the dryer after drying one of these sheet sets. Worth the price...barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't care for flannel sheets after all","review":"They are warm, however, after a while of use, they just start balling up into little balls of fuzz and fall all over the place, the little balls get on everything!

I should have waited for another Martex deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - poor quality","review":"I ordered these sheets based on previously posted positive reviews. These sheets are a big disappointment-- the green is more \\"lawn\\" green than \\"forest\\" green, so thin you can see light through them, lots of lint as others have noted, and grey dust balls inside the package when I opened it! Save your money and don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous!","review":"I bought 2 sets each of the twin size Brick and Navy Blue.I opened and washed 1 of each color - seperately because of the pillig issue I read - and even after 4 wash and drys (and FULL dryer filter cleanouts after each dry) - they STILL have bits coming off .To top it off, with all the 'fuzz' in the dryer filter - they are now no longer as soft and thick as when I first opened the package and they haven't even been used yet.I see from some reviews that the light solid colors seem to not have the same issue so maybe this is some type of dye process issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"I bought these sheets on sale thinking they'd make a nice backup set to my existing flannels. We received them and they felt soft, if a little thin. Unfortunately, after my wife ran them through a laundry cycle, the sheets became covered in lint and were quite \\"pilly\\". We tried washing them again but it didn't have much of an effect, other than filling up our dryer's lint screen again. I suggested that we at least try putting the sheets on the bed but as soon as we started to put them on, we could see a copious amount of red lint starting to stick to our mattress pad, pillowcases, and virtually every other surface within 5 feet of the sheets. My beagle looked like Elmo! (OK, not really on that last part.) All kidding aside, we were too frustrated at the quality of the sheets to bother trying to make them work any more, and got rid of them. Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with these sheets","review":"I didn't expect much for the price, but ordered as the reviews (at the time) were so favorable. I was surprised when I opened the box. I ordered the pink set as a gift and found them covered with black lint. As I'd never give these as a gift, I washed them figuring I'd keep them for my guest room. Well, the pillowcases do not fit on the pillows, the sheets don't fit my 14\\" mattress and they're very thin. I love Amazon and purchase often, but I'm shocked they would offer such an inferior quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVIOD - LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE","review":"Looking for a nice warm flannel sheet and these are it.

I'd give no stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like LINT, you'll love these sheets.","review":"I agree with another reviewer who had a big problem with the lint factor on the red sheets. I like the color. They're kind of thin, but that's okay. They are soft. BUT...I had to clean the lint filter twice during one drying cycle. I washed them twice to see if it was just the intitial washing that created all of the lint, but it was almost as bad the second time. And there were still lots of lint balls all over the sheets when I took them out of the dryer. I don't plan on using these sheets. I'm very sorry I bought them and would return them if I could. Maybe the lighter colors are better, but I won't be spending any more money to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sheets!","review":"I love, love, love these sheets!! I live in Connecticut and it's very cold here at night - these sheets are so warm and toasty. I do not have a problem with pilling like other reviewers did - you do have to clean the dryer vent several times during the first few washes but other than that, I have no complaints about these sheets... and for $5.99 for the pale pink king set, it's well worth the price"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't know flannel came this thin!","review":"This is truly the thinnest flannel I have ever seen. The fabric tears at the slightest stress, and after two weeks it is pilling. If you want soft sheets these are the sheets for you, just realize that they are truly only to be used as disposable as they are too thin to use as rags and too fragile to wash more than once.

Do not waste your money. These sheets become translucent after a couple of washings, and the lost material needs to be scooped out of the dryer's lint trap by the handful. The seams on the pillowcase have also come apart. Poorest of poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Sheets are thin and leave lint balls all over my mattress.

The mixture of mundane politics and the otherworld inhabited by gods and dragons reflected, for me, the mind set of the ancient Germans.

Yeah right","review":"If I could give this book no stars I would. I'd rather give the author a good hard spanking.This isn't fiction, it's a horrible retelling of the Saga of Sigurd the Volsung, but overextended and with a tremendous amount of unnecessary references to Christianity.Do yourself a favor and read a book on the Norse myths, it'll be easier to understand than this crude attempt at \\"Fantasy\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Effort, but Difficult to Defend","review":"I would be surprised if there were a better defense of 7th Day Adventist Sabbath theology than this excellent attempt.

The only thing I can think of to match this is the sequel to this(DWM 2:Tara's Adventures) or Pokemon FireRed. This game is similar to pokemon, get monsters, train them, and fight. It can be strangely addicting and awesomely fun. I haven't played this in about 3 years, but I decided to write a review after seeing it on here. This game is great for kids(once they get to the age where they can read).

It must be good!\\" So, I started playing it, and I automatically knew I hadn't wasted my $. I woke up at about 5:00a.m. every day to get started again. It has practically all the monsters from the main games. If you've played games from the original series, this will really take you back. If you like Dragon Warrior and did or still do love the Pokemon games, this like a really cool mixture of the 2.

The fact of raising monsters and breeding them and combining them into different monsters justed makes you stuck to the game! This is pokemon with more drama and action! You buy items and join with allies to form a team of unbeatable creatures, cute and strong! There are a lot of cute and cuddly monsters and powerful monsters.

You can also breed your monsters with your friend's monsters. You can trade, win(your friend's monsters), and battle your monsters against your friend's monsters.

I felt it was far too slanted towards making us believe that Lennon was a negative character, and that his relationship with Yoko was basically just \\"bickering\\". I don't agree with this at all and feel that other books and interviews with actual people who knew Lennon give a much different picture than the one presented here. Go to the Library and borrow a copy to flip through the pictures. Don't buy this book.On another note: Lennon the New York Years is a fantastic book that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Across Five Aprils","review":"Civil War Diary is the story of Jethro Creighton and his family living in Southern Illinois at the begining of the American Civil War. It is based on the Newberry Prize winning book Across Five Aprils written by Irene Hunt. Jethro is a ten year old boy who's family is divided by the war with one brother going to fight for the Confederacy, while the others fight for the Union. It is a great story full of insight and makes one think about how to deal with such differences. Being a U. S. History teacher, and also a Civil War historian I find the film most useful in a classroom to support the novel. It is a great story and the film sticks to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhh..... Ok...","review":"To me this album needed to be re-titled Wildest Dreams Part 2. It's ok.

The players play off each other without restraining each other's improvisations and companions.The compositions are brilliant throughout, except for the difficult \\"Darkness on the Delta Suite\\". The last track \\"The Caravan Moves On\\" showcases Abercrombie's strangely fluid lines and Lloyd's deeply intense solos. The opening track \\"Dancing Waters\\" starts off with Mehldau's piano playing, setting the perfect background to the rest of the CD: introspective, intense, dark, yet brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Spewing Pulp is a brilliant and diverse work from first time novelist, Gregory Blair.

He has some very good tips on writing prayer letters; what to do and what not to do. There are many good ideas on how to treat your supporters and I am keeping my book because of these good points, but I am ignoring the parts about raising support!I am glad this method of support-raising works for the author, but I do not see it as being the way God wants us or, anyone for that matter, to raise support.

He is emotional, judgemental, politically incorrect, abusive, controlling and yet he is also stupidly optimistic.Highly recommended for laughing so hard, your abs might hurt!

Anyway - it is full of fantastic Victorian scraps that you can use for your craft projects. My advice is borrow it from the library, or buy it used.

At no point was I mislead into thinking this had any association with Druids. I was fairly confident that it was a Wiccan Book of Shadows based on old Irish myth. People in the pagan community are fairly much aware that \\"Irish Wicca\\" is a blending. Old family traditions and folk ways find a comfortable home within the Wiccan framework.I read the book. The rituals were not claimed to be older than the 20th century, although they sprang from older roots. The rituals were clear, interesting and beautiful. The aspects of the gods and goddesses were based on the old myths and serious research. This book did not disappoint me at all. It was what it claimed to be: a Book of Shadows.

This is not a book about assembling a car, it is a book about an intellectual's struggle with middle age interspersed with occasional comments about putting the car together (which was depressingly uneventful). Had it been marketed more as a essay on how vehicles have changed our lives and interesting tidbits of history, I probably wouldn't be so hard on it. I was looking for another \\"Truck\\" by John Jerome, and I was misled that this was it.

Unless you lived near a major aquarium, this might be your only chance to see an octopus.

The flow of writting was a delight. Hepinstall has a way of telling the story of the warmth of gentleness and the fire of hatred. On the surface the subject matter is something I would not have normally read but this book goes way beyond the rape of a young girl. It deals with living with the wrong choices you have made and the power of forgiveness. If you are in the mood for a different kind of book that is hard to put down and stays with you long after you are done, I urge you to give The House of Gentle Men a try. I am sure you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh, creative story. Couldn't put it down.

It touches on a place that should be - at least in every woman's soul. And yet, the book is full of mystery and drama.

Every word of this novel made me vibrate with a sense of the magic of Kathy Hepinstall's vision and craft. She has created wounded characters of great originality, a South recognizable as same but blessedly devoid of picaresque cliches, and an engaging and heartbreaking story. Her writing is fresh, alive, poetic without self-consciousness, totally accessible, as intimate as your next breath. This novel is a jewel. It will be praised and shared among friends like a meal served with pride. The printed book itself will grow creased from travelling and rereadings. The story, however, will always stay fresh, and unfolding with layers and meaning, in my heart.OPRAH, YOU ARE MISSING OUT! <g>Kathy, bless you.

Were we even reading the same book?!What a great big fat load of crap this book was! I am completely astounded that so many people -- especially women -- would sing such great praises for this insulting waste of paper. The characters are completely one dimensional and unbelieveable; the dialogue is horrendously false-sounding an uninteresting; and the tidy little wrapped up package in the end is insulting to an intellegent reader. Worst of all is the idea of a rape victim falling in love with her attacker. As a rape survivor, I am thoroughly insulted and disgusted by this. The author should be ashamed of herself for writing it and the publisher for printing it. There will be letters written to the author and the publisher and I will never again pick up another book written by this woman.If I could have taken stars away from this book, I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condemned house","review":"Simply one of the worst books I've ever read. From the silly plot to the paper-thin characters, this is an amateurish effort that should have stayed in the slush pile.

If Ms Hepinstall doesn't win a Pulitzer for this book I would be amazed. The characters are richly depicted, the narrative is so lovingly crafted it was hard to set the book aside. I couldn't be away from it for very long. I think the people who rated this novel with less than 5 stars were taking the story too literally. There is a bigger message here than how a young woman survives a brutal attack or how a young man survives his guilt. It is about redemption and love and kindness. If they made this into a film and captured the poignancy of \\"Cedar House Rules\\" it would be a lovely, classic film for everyone who has a heart and a soul. Can't wait for her next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book....","review":"I do not know what it was about this book but I could not put it down. I read all night long and still couldn't get the book off my mind the next day. I do not have alot of time read but this book was definitely worth it.

It was great to be caught up in Hepinstall's magical world but at times things seemed a bit far-fetched."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great story.","review":"I enjoyed this story and found it unique. The author really takes you into the characters and makes you feel for them. The only reason I gave only 4 stars is because I would have liked to have seen what happened to each charcter in the end. The ending is abrupt. An epiloge would have been nice. All in all and exceelent debut for Kathy Hepinstall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable!","review":"Several days have passed since I finished reading this amazing novel, and I still find myself thinking of passages and lines, until I have to pick up the book and reread them again. That's what Kathy Hepinstall's novel does -- it works its way into your heart and mind and just doesn't let go. Her deft handling of atmosphere leaves the reader feeling as though she were part of the book. The characters become friends making me want to hold some of them, shake others, and weep for all of them. The themes are timeless and universal, but hardly nowhere more moving than seen through the eyes of these characters.I echo what someone else said here -- this is a book that deserves the attention Oprah's Book Club would give it. I can think of none better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic taste","review":"I am a very experimental cook, and just love making dishes from any country I can.

These cds document Arrau at his finest. With each piece, Arrau plays with specific focus on melody and injects a beautiful and almost dreamy tone (good examples of this are G minor Ballade and A flat Impromptu). The tempi he chose brings out so much emotion in every piece.

Just finished reading it again and had to comment. The main characters love triangle - Grant, wife Marie and love Anne, is well developed. However, if written today, I must believe Grant would have crawled home to wife and beg forgiveness instead of ending up with Anne. Also interesting that heros smoke and drink freely. Today, only the villians would indulge. Interesting that a novel written in the 70's would be more 'liberal' than the 'politically-correct' books of today! An outstanding work.

I am still surprised that there are so few reviews less than 5 stars. The basic premise of HAB Theory is scientifically very weak, and the dialog and action between characters is unrealistic. I also felt that the book seemed 'dated', and therefore has lost some of its energy over the years. Finally, what pushed me over the edge to give this book a bad review is the SHAMEFULLY BAD printing of the Backprint.com edition of the book. It is very distracting to have a new paragraph begin in the middle of a sentence! This editorial blunder occurs about every 10-15 pages, and is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the poor job of printing. If a reader decides to give this book a try, I suggest finding an out-of-print used copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The underlying theory: indisputable; Mr. Eckert: wonderful.","review":"This book, read by me in the summer of 1974, has had a remarkable influence on my life. I began study at UMR (formerly the Missouri School of Mines) that Fall, & there had access to the original sources cited in the novel. I was convinced already of the theory's validity, and actually reading and considering sources such as Charles H. Hapgood's \\"Earth's Shifting Crust\\" at a University which had once focused primarily on Geology, served to \\"ice (see Hapgood's book) the cake.\\" Consequent studies led me to other amazing discoveries, some my own.

After she passed away, I borrowed it and read it, and was thoroughly entertained. Very good storytelling, and very good ideas. I won't rave about it as others have here (come on people...), but it was a very forward-thinking book.

I'm sorry to say it hasn't stood the test of time well. The science is poor-that's to be expected as its a 1970s interpretation of what was understood about geology and Earth sciences and a lot has happened since. In terms of a novel, there are a lot of side plots and developments and it reads as though the writer had a script planned.Generally, it is very dated in terms of relationships between the main protagonists, and I really didn't warm to the character of John Grant and his tedious and selfish meanderings and justifications about his love affairs. Its also very dated in political terms, and as international politics is a substantial part of the book it feels like watching a very elderly, very long 'Cold War' era film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding tale that may indeed contain some kernal of trut","review":"A recent UPI story talked about the possible ancient tilting ot the earth on its axis - an explanation of ferns found in Antarctica, hidden rivers found by imaging radar in deserts.

The prose style is belabored and switches between \\"fantasy\\" and modern style intermittently. Characters are hollow despite the repetition of supposedly meaningful backstory. The author uses the same expressions over and over again, especially during sex scenes. Dialogue feels inauthentic and is ultimately unconvincing.

WRONG!I did indeed note that the most important first concept that needed to be learned was ommitted in this book - BASIC CHECKMATE WITH KING AND QUEEN (and perhaps even King and Rook versus King should have been covered). So this author thinks he knows how to teach chess to children!!

This book should have gone into more types of endgames which would have been useful for children, starting with the basic engame checkmates, and then after the King and Pawn endings, perhaps the more important basic Rook and Pawn endings.

The chosen people are no longer only the Jewish people but the kingdom of heaven has been opened to Christians - the fullness of the faith being the Catholic Church which Jesus Christ implemented 2000 years ago.

Colleen is part of a very big family and she feels like she is closed in and never has any privacy. Throughout this book, she acts like she has PMS. She meets Jonathan at the riding stables she frequents and it seems just a couple pages later, she is telling him she loves him. She hopes to keep him a secret from her very nosey and intrustive family, but they find out and insist on meeting him.

What happened to the songs such as How the Gods Kill, Left Hand black, Going down to Die, Heart of the Devil, and her black wings.

Danzig is my favorite metal band, along with Pantera, but he has long lost his old style. There are almost no tempo changes or surprises of any kind throuhgout the songs on this album. The songs did not slow down or speed up, etc... they were just kinda bland or plain. For another band, this album would probably be great!

Granted Danzig 6 and beyond were solid efforts. But Circle Of Snakes is his best effort in a looooong time. I credit it to the arival of one of my favorite axe men in Tommy Victor. Tommy's band Prong broke new ground in the early 90's, and was one of my favorites (Beg to Differ was a classic album). Tommy melds Prong-style riffs with the classic Danig sound pioneered by John Christ. The result is a great album.Danzig is back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album From Danzig!","review":"I had been waiting for this album for almost a year after I had heard that he had started work on it. I am a big fan of all of his previous efforts and was hoping it would be just as good or better then his last release Danzig 777: I Luciferi. I could not have ever expected the album to be as good as it is. Every track on this album has great Songwriting, something Glenn Danzig is well known for. Each track has such a dark vibe to it, you can't ignore how good this album is. If you are a fan of his first 4 albums I feel this is a lot closer to his old style than Danzig 7.I highly recommend you pick up this album if you are a fan of any of his previous work, you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not have enough good songs to be worth more than $5","review":"Red Hot Chile Peppers have a great song, \\"Soul to Squeeze\\" and \\"Tainted Love\\" is good as well, but all the others are at best average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pictures (not great) / bad binding - falls apart.","review":"I bought this book brand new from Amazon because I wanted to see some nice pictures of the French hillsides and landscapes. The pictures are good (not great), but as soon as I started flipping through the pages, I noticed that they started to come off the spine like those cheapo postcard books you get at the swapmeet or tourist traps.Don't waste your money on this book (like I did). I bought mine brand new, but because they used an inexpensive binding method, it'll always fall apart as soon as you open it wide to look at what you think are supposed to be 'great' pictures of Provence. The pictures are just OK - in my opinion. It's a small book, so it doesn't really do justice to those pictures (if they were really that great in the first place)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good photos but terrible binding","review":"I should have paid more attention to reviews of this book.

I couldn't quite put a finger on it at first until I realized the obvoious: Ronnie Sellers is not a cat person. That much I derived from the \\"about the author\\" page. He does not even profess to be a cat lover at all. This book is but a compilation of anecdotes from cat lovers from all over. Sellers says the idea of doing this book came from a cat person he met in a book shop. That woman should have been the proper author of this handbook. Jennifer Reinhardt could probably do it being a cat person herself. What remarkable talent! I found her illustrations funnier and more effective than the text that accompanied it. Each illustration captured what every cat owner (or cat owned human) has probably gone through. I give her illustrations five stars. I was thinking of returning this book but I decided to keep it anyway if only for Ms. Reinhardt's hilarious drawings."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WAS GREAT!!!","review":"This game was great!

More useful and interesting, however, are his summaries of more recent, even less well-known, events such as the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak and the 1976 swine flu debacle.It is interesting to note that his depiction of the men investigating the 1918 virus is universally glowing and complimentary, while his depiction of the women involved is either flat or entirely vilifying. His depiction of Kirsty Duncan seems particularly vitriolic, and one has to wonder if he was taking some cold shoulder just a touch too personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but...","review":"This did grow some blades of grass on the side of the water dish, but the water became foamy and needed to be totally changed more frequently. I think that the idea of having theDrinkwell Pet Fountainis to encourage your cat to drink, but my cat wasn't drinking as often when the foam started to appear. As other reviewers have stated, the sides of the bowl get slimy as well. The grass also grows slowly and needs a light source (something I didn't consider), which also would encourage algae to grow in your water dish. There aren't a lot of seeds in the pods, so you're really better off with a separate pot of grass for your cat than sticking it into his water dish - plus for the cost of the pods, you probably could buy a whole pot of grass instead of just a couple dozen strands of grass (and you don't have to wait for the grass to grow)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This product came very quickly however I've already thrown it out. I was very disappointed. It doesn't clip onto the side very well, and once the grass starts growing, my cats want to eat it and it yanked out very easily. Another bad side effect is that it makes the water green and the sides all slimy. Great idea but fell flat. I'm so disappointed because one of my cats just loves eating grass and buying it at the pet store is so expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slimey business.","review":"The first time the grass grew well, the second and third time I tried to grow the grass almost nothing grew. The biggest problem was the slime it created in the fountain. I had the hardest time trying to remove ALL of the slime -- it was everywhere. Had to take apart and clean the entire unit once a week. Needless to say, I won't be buying these again. Cheaper and easier to buy cat grass that does not grow in the Drinkwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea - But Some Concerns (Check Your Water Filter)","review":"I bought this to spare my houseplants. In theory, this product is great. The grass grew pretty quickly, but after several days I noticed long, white roots hanging down in the cat's bowl. It seemed like the roots and the seed casings from the grass made the water bowl very dirty & I noticed the water flow wasn't as quick as normal. When I went to change the water filter, it was much dirtier than usual. I was a little concerned about the cleanliness of the water, so I've stopped using this product. I will say that our cat is a Maine Coon & they are known to play in their water - so it's possible the cat was pulling on the grass or trying to bat at the seed pod & made a mess of things. But, if I were still using the product, I'd be checking and changing the filter regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"it seemed like a great idea at the time,but it does not work at all....simply the grass isn't growing,it only made the water in the fountain dirty"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slimy water","review":"I thought this would be a great way for my kitties to enjoy grass. Instead it just made a big pool of slime in the drinking fountain and all over the filter (I had just put in). Even cleaning it every day wouldn't have prevented the slime from over taking the bowl. If you've ever had cut wild flowers .... and when you threw the flowers out, the slime and the smell that went with the slime ... is what you get when you grow this grass in your pet's water fountain.It's a great idea .... but wow, what a mess. I ended up letting it finish it's growth cycle in it's own bowl of water i changed every morning.Not worth the price at all.Sorry. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, but falls very short of claims","review":"This is the first negative review of a product I have made. I just purchased the drinkwell platinum, the aqua garden, and pretty much all of the extra accessories that go along with it. I love the fountain, it really works well, and both my dogs and my cat like it, and drink more. I really wanted to like the aqua garden as well (especially since I bought the starter plus 2 more packages of refills). My cat is the only one who eats the grass, but as another reviewer stated, he eats it about as fast as it grows. So, what is supposed to look like a somewhat lush little patch of kitty grass, looks like a stringy few pieces of almost dead grass. I do not know if it will start in another container or not, but I will give it a try and update if anything changes. I know I will not be buying any more refills, and I will stick with getting kitty grass in a separate container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"Not only does the grass never grow, but the water gets so nasty in a short time that it has to be changed almost daily. Do not waste your money on this product. I'll be using chia pet grass instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely fits","review":"This supposedly fits on the deluxe model, but it would barely stay on mine. The force of the moving water was almost enough to dislodge it from the edge. Any time my cats tried to eat from it, they'd end up yanking the whole thing out so I was constantly picking it up off the floor and snapping it back into place. Furthermore, like another reviewer said, it can make the water a bit slimey after a few days when the roots grow long. It could barely feel it when I checked the water texture with my fingers, but my animals stopped drinking out of it in favor of the Drinkwell without the garden. I stopped using it after only a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this from Amazon","review":"I ordered the package the Amazon was offering, which included the Drinkwell Aqua Garden for Pets Fountains, a filter and seed pods. I ordered two sets and the first time I received my order, there were only 2 seed pods, 2 filters, but no pet fountains with no explanation as to where they were. I contacted Amazon and they said they would resend the fountains. Several days later, I received 2 seed pods, but again, no fountains. Again, I contacted Amazon and again I got the same runaround and AGAIN they sent only 2 seed pods. Each time, the receipt indicated that these were the pet fountains. Not sure what the problem was and I never got a decent explanation. Finally, had my original order refunded and now I am purchasing it from a seller. I hope this time I actually get the pet fountains because I have no use for that many seed pods!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High Maintenance","review":"I enjoy this water fountain for my cats. I believe that one of my cats will not drink from it, so I keep a separate bowl of water for her. Different cats will have different preferences. This fountain MUST be cleaned once a week - especially if you are not using bottled water. You really need to pay attention to all parts - including the motor for \\"guck\\" & build up. If you are not going to clean it once a week, do NOT purchase it - the water will get bad and the cats won't drink it and they won't have any water. Do not bother with the aqua garden - it gets moldy in less than a week and you have to clean the fountain more than once a week. Other than high maintenance, I like having the fountain for my cats. I am not sure if they love it or it is just OK to them. I think it is just OK to them. None of them got excited about it. Personally, I'll keep my fountain going and clean it once a week!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aqua Garden is a waste of money","review":"Bought this thinking how great it would be to have without soil...latch it onto the fountain & viola...but too few sprouts make it not worth the extra time & effort. Use a small dish, good potting soil & viable seeds; sow seeds, lightly covered with soil, keep misted with H2O & you will have much better results in a day or two, just make sure you have the starter seed dish out of the way of the cat..at least till it's 4\\" or so. No need for the fountain either. I found it to be too loud & can't control the flow well. Cats will drink out of a toilet, if you let them..they love trickling water. My cat is 15 & is on special diet due to renal failure. Be sure to supply fresh water often and make sure you groom your cat regularly or you'll be cleaning up more cat yack than you want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for an indoor cat*","review":"I have had no problems with my Aqua Garden. It clips on perfectly, the grass only takes about 2 days to start growing, and boy does it grow! I've had to trim the grass sometimes because my kitten can't keep up. Other than trimming the grass (which really isn't a con) it's wonderful for my indoor kitten to experience some outdoor cuisine. It's long lasting, you don't have to water it, or deal with any soil messes that the other potted grasses can cause. It doesn't effect the water in the fountain at all.Keep in mind that your grass will grow better if situated with some sunlight. I've noticed the placement makes a difference on color and amount of grass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I thought this would be great for one of my cats (who loves to eat anything green), and was hoping my other cat (who has urinary crystal problems) would get more interested in the water.The idea is great, but it doesn't really work so well. I had no problem snapping the frame onto the fountain. (I assume that the people who did, simply didn't push the clip down far enough to snap onto the ledge). My problem was with how foamy the water got, and then how slimy the fountain started to get. The grass is great, but the last thing I need is a reason to have to clean the fountain more often. I simply don't have the time.For now, the grass just lives in a plastic container of water. The cat seems to feel this is perfectly acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made cats sick and too expensive","review":"For what is there this is too expensive and both of my cats became sick after eating the grass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The grass didn't grow very well.

The only problem is the cats eat the grass as soon as it starts to grow upwards, so there's never more than a few smashed down blades of grass at one time. The grass never gets a chance to grow as pictured and they don't ever get that much to actually eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but not a solution","review":"I echo the reviews of others who like the idea, but found the actual product unworkable.

Are there really people that find the use of farm animals in sex play exciting? Okay, maybe I am naive to some degree, but that is just plain icky! Reading this book is like looking at road kill, somewhat compelling but still an unhappy experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"same ol' kinky song and dance. . .","review":"Laura Reese is a truly gifted writer who, unfortunately, may also be a one-trick pony. TOPPING FROM BELOW, her first book, is one of my all time favorite novels. With PANIC SNAP, I see the author trying desperately to recreate the magic of TOPPING FROM BELOW. The plot is almost identical (female gets involved with sadistic lover in order to learn a \\"secret,\\" then falls in love with him, then exacts her revenge), but the writing isn't nearly as colorful or skillful. James McGuane, PANIC's resident sadist, is quite boring and not nearly as intriguing as TOPPING's antagonist. I hope that Laura Reese abandons the S & M theme in her next novel; otherwise, she'll just be beating a dead horse (pun intended)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly the same plot as \\"Topping from Below\\"","review":"In her first book, Laura Reese, captured me. It was with great anticipation that I began reading 'Panic Snap', only to be dissapointed at the numerous similarities as 'Topping from Below'. It's as though she took the exact story line from her previous book and just changed the setting, characters and a few scenes. I was extremely dissapointed, especially at the ending, talk about duplication!! I would probably buy another book of hers, but first I would ask my friends if it was exactly the same as the first two,which wouldn't surprise me one bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not a sunny day cd","review":"This is some sort of clerical error. The CD noted here is really a cd by Japanese singer Sunny. If the cover art was available, you could tell. It also only has two songs.

I think this blend makes him pretty unique, rather than \\"not bringing anything new to the table\\".

These are terrible BOOTLEGGED CONCERT PERFORMANCES AND ARE NOT THE ORIGINALS!

As my first taste of the Flaming Lips, this was fantastic. The best I can describe it, is a fine almost 50-50 musical interpretation of a mix between the MeatPuppets and Galaxie 500.

I thought that it was a silly but cool sounding song. I probably played that song a few times and then the CD made it to the bottom of the pile for several years. Today I found it again while I was going through my music collection and decided to give it a spin. Honestly... I hated it! All the songs sounded so juvenile, under produced, predictable and... just terrible...I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you want to explore this band, I highly recommend that you first download a song or two or listen to the samples here. If for some weird reason that I don't understand, you like them, then by all means buy the CD and support these artists.I, for one, just don't get it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lips have done better...","review":"As a huge Lips fan, i can easily say that this is not the band at their best. It has She Don't Use Jelly, and a few other great songs (my favourite is Pilot Can) but most of these songs seem to get old and boring very quickly.

The author might want to consider this fact and develop touch methods of training for doubly handicapped animals.My only negative is that it is very expensive for a soft-bound book--almost $30 plus shipping just seems way over-priced but I needed it so coughed it up.

And to say that this method is not as harsh as some others, the mind boggles to think what these alternatives are! To suggest a water spray for blind and deaf dogs is just disgusting.

Before I Let Go is a rhythmic, uptempo number and the Trippin' will also set your foot a tapping. There are also lovely emotional ballads like Do What You Like, No One and Believe That.

And the fixture itself looks so nice, with good quality glass, so it's really a shame that it has such a poor, non-interchangeable, light source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light!","review":"I've had it for a week now and so far, so good. This light is a great addition to a bedroom. It gives just enough light; just the right glow to see in but not too bright like a regular lamp. The battery operation is a plus although I suggest using rechargeable batteries because it takes six AA! The fixture is glass and well made. It does have weight to it. Not flimsy. The size is appropriate for a wall, not too big and not too small. I didn't give it five stars because I think it's a bit pricey for a battery operated lamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light it up!","review":"I looked for a battery operated wall sconce for a long time. Finally I chose this one and I am very happy with it. Hangs in our hallway. Gives just enough light to change the thermostat and gives a glow to our wall of family pics.

More fulfilling than a lot of the Criss-Cross jazz in my collection. These guys have played together a lot (they really are the \\"Pete Zimmer Quintet,\\" not just some guys Pete paid to get in the studio for a one-off session). They have a great ensemble sound and they know the arrangements intimately.The recording is almost as good as the live show: swingin', high energy jazz with heaping doses of both tradition and individual personality. Pete's drumming is marvellously propulsive, never letting up (his drums and cymbals also sound amazing on the recording), and Joel Frahm is a truly remarkable tenor player, unlike many of the [...] out there today, often undifferentiable from each other.

This past year I decided to invest in some hair thickening products, as well as masks to help my hair get strong and healthy again. This Aubrey mask did WONDERS for my hair! My hair was so silky soft after and noticeably thicker as I ran my fingers through it! I also have an issue with products weighing my hair down and making it greasy - this product is perfect if you have the same issues! No grease, and weighed down hair.

Also, I died my hair super blue black, bleached sections and applied ultra violet dye to the bleached sections, so I guess you could say my hair is fairly processed.I applied this stuff to my hair, put a shower cap on, and then I wrapped my head in a hot wet towel. This stuff did almost nothing. I noticed no change at all, but it did grease the heck out of my scalp. I ended up using this other stuff I picked up from CVS for about 6$ and it worked like magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice!","review":"I like this hairconditioner very much, makes a difference for sure.

The abrubt ending made it a bit disappointing, for I was expecting a happy ending. Usually, with adventure books, I go, \\"Oh, this is so expected. Happy ending.. again?!\\" but here, there was no ending. Unfortunately, Scholastic decided not to publish them anymore. I could scream with rage, or just hide in the shadows, fuming.

It was so awful I wished that I hadn't even started this series.I finished this series at thirteen, three years ago. Ever since then it has been, to me, an example of how not to write a series.The first book is very good. If Stanton had kept up to that standard she would have had a great series. Unfortunately, the series is episodic-- it never flows; some of the books have no point in the series (especially this one); and the main point in the series, which is brought up in the first book, is never resolved. With the exception of characters from the first book, Stanton rarely reused her old characters. Instead, she added new characters and abandoned them after the book was over. It is incredibly evident in Shadows with the new \\"surprise\\" villian.

It draws example from a period of hyperinflation in Brazil to give advise to business in the US. I find the book concise, well organized, and the information is useful. The only dislike is that, as concise as the book is, the information is repetitive.

Yes, the notes ping, but so do those of a synthesizer. Gramophone is spot on to call this voice 'stainless steel'.

I thought this was a generally good book. Being from Illinois, I enjoyed reading references to Illinois namesakes such as the cities of Peoria and Chicago and the Chicago newspapers: the Tribune and the Sun-Times. However, the book seemed to have drifted from its main theme towards the end. It appeared the author didn't really know what to write about after TJ and Tyron left basketball camp. The story didn't seem to wrap up in a logical and realistic manner like the rest of the book. Bottom line, I enjoyed the book overall, but the ending could've been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around resource","review":"I have been a fan of Haynes manuals for years .... however, I picked up this Chilton's manual specifically for the vacuum routing diagrams .... and found it to be very helpful in many basic repairs.For anyone who has not used a Chilton's manual in many years, the new versions are much improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!","review":"Finally a book that exposes the gay agenda for what it is, and just what a great threat to this nation's moral foundation it represents. It is a call for those who still know right from wrong to take a firm stand against this grievous threat against faith, marriage, and family. While we talk about the threat from terrorism, the war, and the state of our economy, we are ignoring a profound threat from within, as homosexuals seek to overturn every aspect of American life and insinuate their perverse lifestyle throughout all of society.

Floyd is obviously seeking to make a few bucks off the valid concerns of Christians and conservatives and has done so with a book that offers no new info and certainly no depth to the discussion. His is not even a satisfactory survey review of the issues. Where others, such as Fr. Rueda's The Homosexual Network, Sears and Osten's The Homosexual Agenda, Chris Wolfe's Homosexuality and American Public Life, Legislating Immorality by Grant and Horne, and Jeffrey Satinover's Homosexuality and the Politics of Truth, offer insights into this dangerous movement, Floyd's was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"HITLER WAS RIGHT!!!","review":"Kudos to Ronnie Floyd for blowing the lid off these scheming queers.

This book could be edited down to a good two pages that would be informative. Possibly to use as a preface to a discussion If you think I am wrong, let me know.

Hence the titles, \\"Shoot'n Up And Gett'n High\\" and \\"Step Into The Projects\\". She combines jazz, soul, r&b with her diverse vocal range and her rapping/talking/flowing style, similar to Prince. There's really no category to place this lp under, because she has a concept quite unique. \\"Outside Your Door\\", a slow sexy pleading groove that later Brian McKnight took the piano intro on \\"Anytime\\" as the major key for a melody.

I would not rely on this book if I were a candidate."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not provide value for the 70-176 exam","review":"This book's contents and the exam questions appear to come from two different worlds, the exam seems to focus on COM and application deployment which are areas that this material barely mentions, with limited samples and exercises, many of the subjects that the exam covered, specially in deployment and help are not covered in this book.. Do yourself a favor, do not rely it on this book to pass the test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Exam Preparation","review":"This Book is the ticket if you want to pass exam 70-176 Desktop Applications for VB6. I read the entire book and worked the labs in two weeks. I took the test today and passed.I especially liked the \\"Using this Book to Prepare for Certification\\" section (which is a task by task outline of the certification requirements as they relate to different lessons in the book). The practice test that is included on the CD that comes with the book is very much like the real test and helps to give you a good feel for what to expect in the way of delivery of the exam. The CD also has a full VB 6.0 multimedia course \\"Learn VB 6.0 Now\\" that is very much like the MS Mastering Series in design.The only problem with the CD is that you will have to hunt for each of the Setup EXE's to load these training aids on your computer. There is no master Setup EXE to step you through loading everything the CD offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh, Microsoft... So Incomplete","review":"You've heard all this before, if you've read any of the other reviews on this page. So I'll be brief about the book, and then tell you what you really want to know, and that's how to prepare for the test.The book is, as per the MOC usual, a general foundation and overview of the technologies, but very much lacking in the detail needed for you to pass the exam.The exam tests your knowledge of data types, default properties for controls (referencing \\"text1\\" is the same as referencing \\"text1.text\\"), focuses heavily on how to deploy solutions (to web server? To floppy? To CD-ROM? You decide...), and stresses data services as well (knowing which cursor types and locations to use).Read this book for a good overall picture, but also read the following:- VB6 Desktop Exam Prep- VB6 Black Book- VB6 Distributed Exam Cram (this will give you some cross-reference on data services and package/deployment)Good luck on the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"MCSD Training Kit - Not!","review":"I bought this book to attempt to prepare for the VB certification. It is definately not the way to go. The questions at the end of the chapters are not focused on passing an exam at all. After studying the entire book, I was only able to answer 1/2 the questions on a simulated exam. (And I knew VB before I started)In contrast, I purchased \\"The Complete JAVA 2 Certification Study Guide\\" by Roberts, Heller and Ernest and was able to pass the JAVA certification in 2 1/2 months, even though I knew no JAVA when I started. This book is a good book to work through and learn some more Visual Basic.

MS Press has always been so good, they can't go wrong, well they did!! Big Time.

I bought the Hawhee book and studied that instead. Using that and the Trandender test I got a 942. I don't beleive that using the MS Press book will help you pass the exam. It is unfortunate that Microsoft's exam guides often do not cover the material in their own exams. I would strongly recommend the Hawhee book and of course the Trancender test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"There are a number of factual errors that are unacceptable in any sort of official curriculum (you *can* call an event procedure if there are arguments to it; there is no Description property to a menu).

The associated CD-ROM contains some multimedia presentations which are also light on content. In my opinion, if you aren't up to the level of doing the exercises in this book, you have no hope of passing the exam anyway. I bought this book and read it, but there were MANY topics on sample exams that I took that were not even mentioned in this book. For the money, I recommend buying both the Exam Cram VB6 Desktop book and the VB6 Black Book. Those two resources helped me a lot in passing the exam, and together they cost about the same as this MS \\"guide.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, Typos, not enough detail","review":"The book is overpriced and does not go into depth on any of the subjects.

It falls out too easily but is easily fixed with some scotch tape at one end to hold it in place and stop it sliding out.The crimping effort required is surprisingly light. It can be a little awkward to position the uncrimped connector with cable aligned in the required center position, but you'll soon get the hang of it. I insert one end while holding the connector and ribbon together with my fingers, then press very lightly with the tool to keep everything aligned, then use one finger to slide everything up into the correct crimping position and finally squeeze.Wasn't sure about making this purchase, but it's a tool I now wouldn't be without. Easier, quicker and more convienient to use than a vice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised","review":"This game is very good. Lots of cars to pick from, real weather conditions and time of day. One thing I really like about this one, is the way it puts you in training from the beginging by making you earn everything (you start with nothing) you have to race to get your first car. A few times around a track and you quickly over come the interace issues. From that point on you become a better driver and the game continues to become fun, rather than a struggle to drive using an awkward controller set (as some racing games do).Four out of five stars, because I really like the control, options, and the graphics are above average.The bad/and things to consider - The game is hard and it is a simulation (not arcade like) - If you want the most graphicly appealing racing game for dreamcast this is not you stop. Try \\"Test Drive: Le Mans\\" or \\"Test Drive: V-Rally\\" (V-Rally for arcade, LeMans is simulation like this game). - The menuing system is one of the worst I have ever delt with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!!!","review":"This game ..., from the beginning to the end MSR is boring.

This book reads like the journal I'd like to write. The cars and their circumstances are mostly unique situations, and the lost/found and long term pursuit angles are the best. For the most part the buyers have a genuine interest, if not a personal one, in the cars they seek. Thankfully, the megabucks trophy collectors and hoarders who fill their warehouses (and ruin it for most everyone else) don't dominate the book.If you are looking for high end writing and extensive stories, or if you only like certain cars, this book may not be as much fun for you.

I have only been watching Days for about 2 years, so when I read the storyline, it was really confusing, but I am trying to follow it. It doesn't have any color pictures, and the pictures it does have are mostly of the older families on Days. This book does, however, give you a good background, and it doesn't really leave anything out dealing with information. It also has family trees in the back so you can be sure about the Days generations. You can learn some real trivia from this book. If you want history, and trivia, get this book.

The characters lacked depth, as the most interesting of them was already dead. Kelly, our \\"Nancy,\\" was more tenacious about learning to knit than solving her mystery. The series has promise and may improve, but don't bother with this one, unless you want to pass it along to a 12 year old mystery buff who wants to learn to knit. The knitting patterns were way simple, but the recipe was good. How this was nominated for an Agatha I cannot imagine--must have been a slow year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag me with a ball of yarn","review":"This is one of the lamest mysteries I have ever read. What's with \\"she tweaked\\". Is this supposed to be a cross between a squeak and a twitter. The dictionary defines 'tweak' to be a pinch or a twist. There is nothing in there to describe a voice. The plot was lame, there was little jeopardy in the so called climax and the third time the wool shop is described is one time too many. I'm afraid my writer's critque group would not have let this out the door. This book only proves that to be a best seller you only need a gimmick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new series!","review":"Being a fairly new knitter, I really enjoyed this book. Discovering the same things that Kelly is discovering make it really interesting. Love that I am learning things that I didn't know about before.Aside from that connection, the book has some really interesting characters that I want to find out more about. I want to know if Kelly is going to stay in Fort Connor & if she will finally get together with Steve!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery?????","review":"Call me confused. Mediocre story and characters, but a mystery? Sorry...I just don't think this \\"mystery\\" has followed the typical criteria. Hardly any clues, and suspects. I couldn't find any, except the vagrant that we knew didn't do it. The ending was very contrived.I have to agree with another reviewer. It's almost as if this author started off with the romance genre and somebody told her to turn it into a mystery.And ditto to another review.....enough already with the colors and textures of the yarns....that was way overdone! We got the point after the first five times it was mentioned.Was really looking forward to a new MYSTERY series and was greatly disapponted."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be worth the pattern and the recipe, but...","review":"I was excited at first to see a book that ties in mystery and one of my favorite hobbies. So, when I managed to get a copy, I immediately began reading. Unfortunately, past the first few chapters, the writing becomes flat and uninteresting. Characters don't develop, relationships are predictable and all too easy for the main character. I simply lost interest and only kept reading to see \\"who dun it\\". The very ending seems to be something out of a \\"Murder She Wrote\\" episode, yes, the ones my mother forced me to watch during the afternoons. It goes like this: Herione draws in suspect, using common excuse to see him /alone/ but she isn't alone at all, everyone is watching from off-stage, then she cajoles the murderer into confessing his crimes right where a policeman can hear. The the suspect is dragged away, end of book. Very dull and dissapointing. I recommend that you get this book from the library, it isn't worth keeping around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to love it, but just didn't","review":"I liked the book, but had trouble both getting engaged with the characters and keeping all the women straight. And I kept reading that she was adding yarn and needles and notions to her tab and thinking about how HUGE that tab must be, especially for someone supposedly watching her budget!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited and a waste of money","review":"This book is poorly edited and includes grammar mistakes, tense errors, and other mistakes (my favorite from page 48: \\"The sound of Carl's growling reached her eyes\\"). If this sort of thing makes you crazy, as it does me, this book is not for you. Otherwise the book is pleasant enough with a cast of characters and plot very familiar to anyone who reads mystery novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing In on the Knitting Craze","review":"To my mind, this is a fairly blatant attempt at cashing in on the current knitting craze. Apparently the author was quite dazzled by her first entry into a well-stocked yarn shop, as she tells us over and over again about the kaleidoscope of color and the multitude of yarns that invite touching. There's a mystery plot of sorts, but I can't help wondering whether the author began as a romance writer. It's a pleasant book, though, and if you like Debbie Macomber's knitting-shop books, you'll probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nancy Drew Learns to Knit","review":"A pleasant little book about a stranger learning to fit into a strange (to her) world. Set in an attractive-sounding Colorado community populated by sincere characters, this book never grabbed my interest as a mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters, paper-thin plot","review":"I find nothing to recommend in this book. The characters are one-dimensional. The main character drops into a ready-made supportive community at a yarn shop, where she can indulge in one-way friendships, but the knitting sections are not realistic. The solving of the central mystery is not believable. The author seems to have picked out several trends (knitting, coffee-drinking) and tried to make the book popular by incorporating them, but the overall effect is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"American racing never sounded so good !!!","review":"To hear the music on its own is one thing, hearing it alongside the action in the IMAX film, is an all out attack on the senses. A great collection of songs, especailly P.O.D.'s 'Boom', which accompanies the experience of watching cars race at over 200mph, as perfectly as the way Jimmie Hendrix played the guitar. On their own, each track will please any listener, for example: if you like rock, or are beginning to like rock, then this CD is a good place to start, with tracks like 'Boom' or 'You'll Never Catch Me'. But without the film, that's all they do. I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this CD, far from it, which is why I'm giving it top marks, but nothing beats the feeling you get when listening to the music as well as watching a field of NASCAR's 'thunder' around Daytona Speedway at full throttle. Go buy the CD and the film. You won't be disappointed with either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Class!","review":"I really enjoy this class. Apart from just liking David Howard's voice and instruction I love the combinations in this video. It is a fun and interesting class for home all demostrated and performed on both sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"so close to a real class","review":"ive taken ballet through school. being finished i was looking for a replacement. most ballet dvds are random exercises. this dvd is structured like an actual ballet class. i love it!! so worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Class","review":"I recommend this for all intermediate/ Avanced Ballet dancers. This is a good DVD to use in between classes or just because."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for practice","review":"I like this video because the dancers execute the steps and movements very profesionally and through repetition one can aspire to imitate them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep-inducing","review":"Ugh, this was dull dull dull. Each track sounded a lot like the last. I'm a huge fan of all of Thievery Corporation's LPs, but this album was definitely sub-par.
