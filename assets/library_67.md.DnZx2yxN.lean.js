Install went fine except that it did add an unusable parallel port. I used the ports to print to industrial label printers on a packaging machines. The print job would make it to the printer fine but after sending a print job the processor would immediately jump to 47-60%. Then If you did anything else on the computer it would jump to 100% and freeze. Task Manager was no help and did not show a process consuming the processor. Used the latest drivers available from the manufacturer. I figure it's a driver issue. The board has jumpers on it with no explanation of what they are for and nothing on the web site about them.

The new card wouldn't match up to any driver (I downloaded newest drivers after CD failed). This usually means the PCI configuration space on the card is corrupt so the card can't be matched to the driver's .inf file (Vendor ID or Device ID).I spent 2 hours with chat tech support - helpful and easy to talk with, but still had a defective card 2 hours later.I was able to steal a part off the new card (the DB9 cable) and fix the old card with it, so I have 2 working serial ports ($26 for a $2 cable effectively). The cost of return on top of the 2 hours already spent is too great to proceed.I'd say this product has quality problems (cheap DB9) and not so hot quality control (PCI configuration bad).I've previously used SIIG serial cards with no problem - I think I'd buy one of those instead of this, for a few $ more, if I had it to do over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"This book is very easy to follow and I have used it for about 14 weeks now and have seen incredible gains.

This book brought back all the wonderful memories from that season and filled me in on some of the facts I had forgotten from that season and the years leading up to that as well as the competition with teams from Boston with Bob Cousy and New York with Harry \\"Sweet-water\\" Clifton. Of course all Nats fans will remember Dolf Shayes and those high arching set shots!

This is the paperback version of a hardcover book, published with a different title -- not an uncommon practice in publishing. The complaint of the reviewers is that the contents are the same as the hardcover original! Well, yes, that's the point of a reprint.More substantively, the author has earned a hearing through his decades-long reporting from Japan and his stubborn, well-documented contrarian outlook. For instance, he shows beyond question that during the long years of Japan's \\"collapse,\\" its advanced manufacturing sector continued to grow -- in technological sophistication, and in world market share.

While well written, there are some confusing bits in there that may take a little interpretation, but otherwise, I like his program for two reasons: 1) relatively simple, yet sweat-producing workouts, and 2) no equipment (besides two chairs, and a short stick or dowel rod) needed. As the cover suggests, this book is directed at martial artists, so you will find it geared to developing power in that regard; more definition rather than raw muscle. Besides some confusing instructions for a *few* exercises (maybe I just misread?), this is a great book, filled with illustration. There are plenty of exercises in here to keep you fit, and I would reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A no-equipment method of increasing strength","review":"This book is a great deal considering it's price. The author shows and describes every exercise in detail and I had no problem following right along from cover to cover. The main advantage of this system is that virtually no equipment is required to produce results. Many of the exercises can be performed in \\"odd\\" places such as at school, the office, etc. The system is a strength building system (not cardio) so in many ways it is similar to weight lifting without the stress. It is the ideal low impact system for those that want to develop additional strength."},{"rating":"1","title":"A heavy-handed imitation of a much better book","review":"Lowney's book -- from its cover and font to its subject material and format as a series of mini-biographies -- is a less elegant, less informed and less nuanced rip-off of Professor Maria Rosa Menocal's masterful \\"Ornament of the World: How Muslims, Jews and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain.\\" Anyone interested in medieval Spanish history would do better to read Menocal's gripping account than to waste their time on a wanna-be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charger kills batteries.

When I told her I had the biggest crush on Rex Smith back then, she said she saw how that could be possible and that is a huge compliment coming from a teenager these days!

I still own the vinyl copy of the soundtrack from 1978. Furthermore, I was so thrilled to purchase it on VHS, and now DVD. If any of you remember this time period, you know that this movie will take you back to those old feelings, when you saw an older boy and wished that he could be yours. When you got him, you felt scared, and alive. This movie will bring back those wonderful feelings and more. In addition, this is where the song \\"You take my breath away\\" was originally released.

Norman Brown has albums after albums of some of the smoothest jazzyiest funkiest....man. Like I've been missing out..like I was cheated all these years. Now I've gotta spend all my DVD money and catch up.Mike in DC"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE BEEF?","review":".Most smooth jazz stuff doesn't have great melodies...just simply ditties turned into, or manufactured into tunes...Keep the sound if you want, but try some cal tjader tunes, or Harold Arlen, or famous funk tunes, etc. Maybe the problem is that one has to pay to use these...but isn't it based on how many CD's sell anyway? I can't distinguish most smooth jazz tunes from each other, and I really don't think they allow the players to play their best ideas in solos. Try some Ellington tunes, or Waits tunes like Barber Shop, or Crusaders stuff, or Les McCann things...All Things Shining...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding and right on time!!!","review":"I've been a fan of Norman's since day one and this album is another perfect reflection of how great of an artist he is. I've read the many great reviews and the few negative reviews. As far as the negative reviewers it's obvious that you are not Norman Brown fans, but rather fans of the genre of Jazz or Smooth Jazz. This is what limits you in understanding artists as individuals. The vibe on this outing is ultra hip,creative, and cool. The contributors on this album are all successful(check the bio's on James Poysner & Jay Dillah) creative genuises with their own unique sound. The selections are all worthy of praise and their is not a boring track on the album. This is a must have for any true music lover. I applaud Norman for reaching beyond the standard format and rendering something fresh. Like the album title states this is the ultimate groove for cooling out on a sunny day and just chilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"shut up","review":"Frank Zappa had a title that is apt for this Norman Brown cd;SHUT UP & play your GUITAR ! Pop arrangements, lots of vocals, and drum machine. No Jazz here. He is an awesome guitar player, and I really like his earlier cd's. Do yourself a favor and skip this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"full of vocals and drum. where is the jazz?","review":"I hope someone will let these artistes know that the fans are not interested in hearing vocals on a supposedly jazz album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work!!!","review":"It seems as though the smooth jazz artist are trying to attract the r & b listener. The cd was done in poor taste and the songs lack creativity as well originality. Too many vocals. I would rather here him play his wonderful guitar. I love Norman Brown but it seems as though he just through this together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice body lotion!","review":"I really like this lotion. It smells great, absorbes into your skin nicely and softens your skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a professor of Religious Studies at a University, I was very disappointd at the reading of this book. I wanted to look for a book that would teach my students to spread the Christian Word. However, the book did not focus on other religions and minority groups. Mary Marr's style of writing is very cold and formal. She uses complicated words to get an idea across. She ignores younger audiences. Other college students who I have presented this book to have difficulty grasping the concepts. Mary Marr needs to focus on minority and real Biblical characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't focus on the poor and oppressed.","review":"I didn't like this book for a few simple reasons. First of all the book kept stating how important it was to save the unsaved but how does the reader know who is truly saved or not only God knows that. This book made it sound like you had to make people believe your way or they were not saved. It did not talk about other religions and how to respect them. I think this book would have been much better if it had taught the reader to be charitable to people of all different religions instead of forcing people to believe what they want to believe. Also, I was saddened that the author didn't have an opportunity to really help economically oppressed poor people. The book didn't even talk about these hardships and show us how to help these unfortunate souls overcome their barriors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have been using a Safari for a few years and love it; I thought a broader tip might be a fun change of pace so I ordered this pen.While I was disappointed with the cap (it doesn't stay on the end of the pen when in use) it's a lovely looking pen and the length of it makes it feel like an elegant writing piece.I have the 1.1 nib, and find it has enough flare to be a bit fancier looking for letters and correspondence, but not so much it's not appropriate for use in the office.I first tried to use a cartridge with it, but didn't like it. I found that the converter is a much smoother and consistent writing experience, no wonder it's included with the pen. If it matters I use the Lamy brand bottled ink. I'm very happy with the way it writes and wonder at this point if I'll go back to the regular Safari!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"I... I think it's important to note that yes, at times the book is a little bit corney,but it has it's place, and even though it seems that they are some unlikely heroines, most of them die.Anyway I thought it was an awsome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken Follett never disappoints","review":"I've read most, if not all, of Ken Follett's book and this one is a winner. Written in the suspenseful style that he's famous for, he keeps you interested to the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty Half-Dozen","review":"Picture this: The time was Hours before D-day, World War 2. The place: German-occupied France. Six agents parachuted behind enemy lines to sabotage a communications facility that serves as a link between France and Germany. Tell you what I think it was: Dirty half-dozen, except that instead of those ragged boys in the movie (and in the book), women did the dirty job of getting the Germans with their pants down. The characters were awesomely depicted, especially Flick Clairet; the antagonist, Dieter Franck was extremely annoying that you would actually think of Jason Isaacs' role in The Patriot (I really hate that character). Anyway, it's a good read, much of it is page-turning, and if you're not doing anything can finish it in a single day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on Track","review":"I think that this is Ken Follett's best work ina long time. Some critics have claimed that hehas been very overrated, but this book showswhat a master craftsmen can do within the contextof a bizare storyline. This book is a must readfor fans of this genre of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Likeable characters, exciting twists, Good read.","review":"I like Ken Follett, and this is no exception. The characters are interesting, the story believable, and there are enough twists to make this whole story an enjoyable read.In this book, Follett's villain was a likeable character. In other books, Follett's portrayal of the villain caused the reader to dislike him. But in this one, Franck was a likeable villain, and the reader almost cheers for him, especially with his clashes with the Gestapo.If I was forced to criticize the book, it would be regarding the ending. Of course we know that the good guys win before even starting, but the sabatoge story and the subsequent stories (details omitted so as not to ruin the story), went too fast, and without many things going wrong for the Jackdaw team.But I enjoyed it. It was an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente!","review":"What can I say? I bought this book in the airport in Houston and finished it in the same day - no small task with a 500-page novel. I have been a staunch Follett fan ever since \\"The Key to Rebecca\\" and \\"The Eye of the Needle,\\" and he does not disappoint with this new novel - quite the contrary, in fact. Felicity \\"Flick\\" Clairet is the most intelligent, pragmatic, hard-headed, and yet vulnerable heroine in years, and she makes \\"Jackdaws\\" into a wonderfully engrossing page-turner. It is truly a \\"female Dirty Dozen\\" (or perhaps \\"Half-Dozen\\") Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flick rocks","review":"Having been a fan of Follett for some time I am admitably slightly biased in my praise for his work. I loved Jackdaws. Plain and simple. Sure the plot was somewhat unplausible given a group of untrained ladies parachuting into occupied France and securing an important communication objective but otherwise this is classic Follett. His abilty to endear the characters to the reader is simply uncanny. I loved Flick. I only hope he'll re-introduce her in a future work. You will not be dissappointed in Jackdaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken Follet Does it Again","review":"If it was possible, I would have given it a 4.5 star. While I was somewhat disappointed with his Code To Zero, Ken Follet is back doing what he know best - writing thrillers about the Second World War. Flick, the main heroine is a strongly sketched character, the portrayals of Ruby, Helen and the others are also well developed. There are plenty of twists and turns and breath stopping suspense in the plot to keep one hooked. If there is one shortcoming, it is in some of the incidents being too unbelievable in extremes - sometimes it is too easy for the jackdaws and sometimes too difficult. However, it is the element of suspense -the way Dieter Franck is always on Flick's trail, but she just about manages to stay one step ahead - kept me reading late into the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should write about something he knows about","review":"As an aficionado of epsionage books (fiction and non) i must say it was an \\"ok\\" book, but that author really doesnt have much of an idea about the SOE/OSS or resistance during WWII, nor is he good at description of the characters or how they act, maybe he should stick to whatever he normally write, Espionage books are definately not his speciality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and informative!","review":"There seems to be a common thread amongst writers: WWII and love affairs. This is a quick, exciting read. Set in WWII France and England, this is a yet untold story of the roles that women played as intelligence officers during the war. A fast paced book mixed with stories of torture, love, war policy, and bravado.The author moves you from place to place seemlessly and focusing on only a handful of characters, sets the story before you, as seen through the eyes of each: the British female spy, the German officer in chanrge of breaking the resistance, and the American in charge of the operation to break German communication on the eve of D-Day.Enjoyed it and recommend it to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackdaws","review":"The book started slow but rapidly picked up momentum. The story was believable with a good plot and feasible actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken Follett has done it again!","review":"Mr. Follett, again, has written a book that you will read well into the night. You want to cheer on the female characters and hope they accomplish their goals. With a backdrop of World War II leading up to D-Day the reader will be swept into the story with feelings of hope, disappointment, fear and understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackdaws","review":"Normally I adore a thriller set in France in World War II, but so much of the dialog and the actions in which the characters engage is inappropriate for the era. It feels like this should have been set in the last thirty years rather than sixty years ago. There is more focus on sexual tension than necessary to advance the plot, and the graphic description of sexual sadism is nauseating. I cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dirty Dozen meets The Steel Magnolias","review":"Not Ken Follet's best effort. This book is basically a feminine reincarnation of The Dirty Dozen updated for political correctness. It's a triple dip: strong woman versus evil man, politicians who are bigots and liars, and the drag queen with inner strength and beauty. Then, throw in some romantic tension...boy and girl, that girl and her husband, her husband and another girl, girl and girl, and the Nazi and the sweet hooker. There are enough gays, lesbians and affairs in this book to keep Jerry Springer in material for a month. I'm a Ken Follet fan but this one just doesn't measure up. I felt as though the author was being condescending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! I want my money back!","review":"I waited for this book to come out in paperback because I thought the concept of a gang of female operatives in WWII would be interesting, and the single star I gave this novel is only for Follett's concept. Everything else in the book is predictable, boring or downright dumb.I haven't read any of Follet's other novels, so I don't know if he has a habbit of creating the weak caricatures similar to those in Jackdaws or if he simply has a problem writing female chracters, but nothing about any of the characters --male or female -- rang true. At one point I had a strong image of Mr. Burns and Smithers from The Simpsons in my mind while reading about the Nazi spy-hunter and his assistant.The romance that protagonist Flick finds herself in is downright gratuitous and unnecessary to the plot and all of the dialogue was just weak...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Interesting","review":"Ken Follet is usually a great writer. Not this time. His strength is strong interesting characters that you come to care about. Not this time. The first half of the book is mostly page-filler. The second half, the action half, has a weak plot that he supplements with detail about torture.If you want a great Follet read on WW II, try The Key to Rebecca or other earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please!","review":"This is one of the silliest, most implausible books I've ever read. I certainly expected more from Follett, who has written some real winners. Commanding officers referring to a group of spies as \\"girls\\", the main character making ridiculously emotional choices while she's in command of a supposedly vital, world changing operation -- well, that's how it goes, through the whole book. Dumb, dumb, dumb. We know he's capable of better writing. This is a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn, but hurah for the female heroine","review":"yawn, for me this book never took off...i kept waiting for the sparks to fly with the male lead and the female lead....not..i really like ken follet but his last few books were letdowns. its like the story is there, and you are waiting to get to that next level with the character but it never comes. flat. its too bad because the story had a lot of potential, a great female lead and a good setting but he does nothing with it. sorry ken!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but nothing great","review":"1. I've heard a lot of good things about Ken Follett and was looking forward to this book.2. Bottomline: it's not a bad book, but nothing significant beyond an average \\"ok\\" book. Translation: I don't feel any need or inspiration to get another Ken Follett book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, entertaining & educational","review":"What a great book. For someone who wants an entertaining story that honors the brave Allied agents and French Resistance agents of WW II, this is the book. Exciting, humorous, and disturbing all at the same time. By the end, you will have great admiration for the heroines of the story as well as all of the unsung heros who set the stage for D-Day and helped to ensure its success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets your heart started--new twists throughout.","review":"Book was entertaining, kept my interest throughout, and lots of action. The description of events, location, people, characters, etc. seemed like you were there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Ken Follett is always on target and entertaining. I liked the book and I'd recommend it to others who like to read, as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackdaws","review":"Ken Follett is one of my favourite authors and this book is one of the reasons why. Suspense, intrigue and a ripping good story. Could not put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riveting WWII Thriller!","review":"While his last several books were mediocre at best, Follett returns to classic form with Jackdaws. Though not as good as Eye Of The Needle or The Key To Rebecca, Jackdaws is Follett's best book in many years. The tension constantly builds and the action is non-stop. For pure suspense-reading, Jackdaws will have you biting your nails and on the edge of your seat. However, Jackdaws falls short of deserving a 5-star rating from me because, with the exception of Flick and Dieter Franck, many of his characters served as \\"tools\\" to tell this action-packed WWII thriller and were not developed well enough to truly care (one way or the other) about. While I thought this criticism would be important for you to know, I would highly recommend Jackdaws if you're in the mood for a novel of suspense set in the most dangerous days of WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWII by Ken Follett","review":"I would recommend this book for anyone interested in WWII, especially the areas we don't often hear about, i.e.. women pilots, spies etc. And written by Ken Follett is an additional plus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"Good read, but not his best. Wonderful details, but too many coincidences hurt believability for me. Lots of violence, but it is a war story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackdaws","review":"Ken Follett has really studied this era and knows his history. It was a history lesson as well as intertaining. I can't believe such brave women! They were awsome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackdaws Ken Follett","review":"I love Ken follet books but this one was missing something. I read half of it maybe I'll pick it up again someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, well researched","review":"Loved this book, it's very well written and extremely well researched so while the characters and the story are fiction it gives you a good insight into the second world war."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strong PC current runs under the surface","review":"The farther I got into \\"Jackdaws,\\" the more I began to realize that this book isn't just another WWII espionage novel; it's also a mind-numbing exercise in political correctness. The 21st century gay/lesbian/transexual agenda makes quite an in-you-face showing in this WWII spy & romance thriller. The story would have been just as good without all the gender-bending and kink in my opinion, but I guess Follet feels his readers aren't getting enough PC indoctroncation from every other artistic medium, so he decided to make it a major theme in this novel. Seek your reader pleasures elsewhere if you want a genuinely good WWII thriller without all the post-war prostelitizing for modern diversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally predictable.","review":"Not nearly the quality of his prior works. No complexity of characters is attemted. The storyline is predictable within the first several chapters. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"WW II and the gays.","review":"Halfway through the book and encountered the fourth gay/lesbian. Didn't feel like reading further. Other than these encounters, seemed to hold my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A TYPICAL KEN F. BOOK","review":"THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK IS IF YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH YOUR WIFE AND SOMEBODY STEALS HER PURSE YOU CAN THROW IT AT THEM."},{"rating":"1","title":"He got lazy","review":"This is the exactly the kind of thing I watch out for with very successful writers. He either got lazy or he let someone else do most of the writing. I can't understand how the others could have reviewed this so highly; the premise is good but the writing is awful. I don't demand that a book be realistic, but it has to feel real to bring a reader in; this one does not come close. Ken Follett has written some incredible books. This is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WWII story about women heroes","review":"I had never read Follett before and was pleasantly surprised at this book. Wonderful story about a group of British women agents who worked with the French Resistance during WWII. It's nice to read a WWII story based on just some a few of those real women who risked their lives to turn the tide of the war for France. A great quick read with characters you want to hear more about after you've finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the brave women of the SOE","review":"This book is dedicated to the brave women of the Special Operations Executive that were dropped in occupied France. They took immense risks for the right cause. For our freedom. Follett creates the character of Felicity Clairet (\\"Flick\\") and lets us experience the dangers she encounters when she is dropped in France to assist the resistance. Very good WWII thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough to put this book down","review":"Am trying to learn as much as I can about WWII and need to research this book to find out how much of the background is accurate realizing that this is a book of fiction. I would agree with another reviewer who found some inaccuracies and some inconsistencies with the time period in which this story takes place but having said that the book was nearly impossible to put down. Interesting premise, well constructed plot, and good character development. Follet gave me a sense of what occupied France must have been like and under what terror the French had to live. Perhaps I am not a professional reviewer but this book worked for me as a gripping piece of historical fiction.Would definitely recommend it to a friend along with Eye of the Needle.Update: If I am not mistaken BBC has made this into a mini-series that is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A singular miss","review":"While I am a big fan of Follett, this was not his finest effort. The story could have been compelling, but the prose was not up to his standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"good read like all of Follett's books.","review":"I liked this book. Follett is excellent at developing his characters and making you care about what happens to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Purchased Book, Jackdaws (Large Print)","review":"I would have preferred a soft back with Large Print. I tear out the pages to read. As the hard back book is too heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really looked forward to getting this book. I waited till my library had the unabridged audiobook and listened to it as soon as I checked it out. What a disappointment. I've enjoyed a lot of Follett's novels but not this one, I think because I didn't like any of the main characters. The shallow romance and detailed torture scenes weren't enjoyable for me at all. I enjoyed the descriptions of the Jackdaws but guess what happened to most of them. I guess I don't really enjoy reading such stark reality--I get enough of that on the news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I was so excited about getting this book after reading so many wonderful reviews, but I found it so hard to finish. I read 2-4 books a week, and I have to admit once I put this book down, I could not remember one thing notable about it. Use your valuable time reading something more interesting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Follett book........but it will NOT be my last!","review":"I had not read anything for several years when I picked up the book Jackdaws. This was my first Ken Follett book. I could not put this book down. This a brilliant WW 2 spy novel.....On to the next Follett novel........."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great thriller, start reading it on a Friday...","review":"...because you won't want to put it down until you are done. Follett's Jackdaws is an exciting read from the first page to the last. Sure, some of it may be implausible, but it's a thrilling ride. Follett builds suspense by trading viewpoints between the Nazi, Dieter, in charge of finding the British spies in France; and with Flick, the lovely British spy who has led numerous groups of French resistance for years. Flick's challenge is enormous: in a day she needs to find a team of women in Britain who can speak French fluently, and possess the qualities she needs to blow up a telephone exchange. It's almost like \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" but with a female cast. Dieter is one of the greatest villains I've ever read about, unfortunately his atrocities are based in fact. Dieter pulls out all the stops to capture Flick and her group of spies. If you like WW2 stories and espionage thrillers, don't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"This book is the least helpful OB text I've ever read.

Lots of good drawings, but save your cash, and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror show","review":"I am not sure who this book is written for.If I were a medical or nursing student it would be too simple with not enough information and as a layperson it assumes I know a lot of medical words when in reality I would need a medical dictionary just to get through it.Useless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Interesting Reading","review":"It was bound to happen after more than a decade of email becoming mainstream and popular. Autobiographies and biographies are best sellers in America these days and there are increasing numbers of them focused on people who enjoy kinky sex. \\"The Puppy Papers\\" is a biography told through emails. It is not, however, really just the story of one woman. Through Puppy Sharon's emails we certainly do read about her life but also about the lives of the men and women she'd met. Most of these are rather clueless in terms of how to do kink safe, sane, and consensually, often letting their fantasies dictate where experience would be a better guide. Her story, however, is probably far more common in the kink community than most people realize. At least with her current dominant, the man who organized and encouraged her emails, she has found someone better and that should give hope to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Begging for Narrative","review":"Usually I give a book the first 100 pages to decide if I want to continue reading. I made it to page 56 with this one and couldn't go any further. I wanted so much to enjoy reading this and at the outset I thought I was in for a good read. There's nothing more boring than leaving the readers out of the action. This book is all self-reflection, which is great if you happen to find your teenage daughter's secret diary, but I wanted a narrative--a real story. The reader is never taken inside a scene, but only reads about reflections, and the book goes to more than 372 pages like this! The emails used to tell Puppy and Master's story should have been converted into a well developed narrative. I guess the author didn't have the talent to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karate Bert","review":"A must read for any Martial Artist! The book illustrates the true essence & morality of Karate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Read It","review":"I read quite a bit, and really like books about Wall Street and the insiders game there. I can't remember ever starting a novel and just not being able to finish it. This book is boring. The characters are flat, and the sexual; references are just not exiciting. The plot: completely predictable. I've never written a review here but I felt compelled to save a few people some money. To borrow from an old Monty Python joke:This is not a novel for reading ... this is a novel for lying down and avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ending?","review":"As I was dwindling down to the last few pages, I wondered howthe author would wrap up this story. When I finished the book,I checked to see if some pages were torn out at the end. Howcould any author end a novel in this manner is beyond me.Does anyone know if a sequel was published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Substance","review":"Harold Robbins novels once seemed so deliciously erotic; now they just seem lame and smutty. This book was a BIG disappointment. I read about half the book and lost interest with the rest. I think I will stick with reading literature with more substance and less trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Good is more like it","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be good. Was I ever sorry. I wish there was a no star or half star rating This had to be the worst piece of fluff ever published. The writing was stilted and childish. The story of David Shea, a totally self absorbed power hungry user would have been better if the writer could write. I can't believe as the preview said that a \\"carefully selected\\" writer was responsible for this meandering loose story. If you want to read the crisp, tight, really juicy Harold Robbins books, go for his classics. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"In the first place this book is not written by Harold Robbins, but is a compliation of garbage by some unknown writer and Mr. Robbins wife apparently. The plot is juvenile at best, and the sex parts appear to be written some twelve year olds or so that are looking for the crudest, most gutter type of trash. I am confident that Mr. Robbins is spinning in his grave to see his name placed on such garbage.It is unfortunate that you do not have a negative rating available for this as it is sub minimum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seemingly high quality skillet","review":"Not much to say about this product.

Otherwise my only specific comments would be:* It's RED. Could be a decor issue for some folks.* The actual flat cooking surface is much smaller than the overall diameter of the pan. It'd be good for cooking eggs, omlets, etc. but you can't realy fit more than one sandwich in the pan at a time due to the sizable sloped sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cisco CID Certification Guide","review":"I took the exam and did pass it. I was reading this book and was amazed with the errors and the references to graphs and charts that were not in the book. The book goes into a painfull explanation of SNA, which is more confusing then helping the issue. The voice part is readable but that just about it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who want to pass the test. It has too much irrelevant information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tons of mistakes, or lack of detail","review":"I recently just started reading this book, and I'm now up to chapter 12 amazingly. I can't believe the lack of detail that went into this book. It VERY VERY often will mention something important, and then not tell you what it is. A perfect example is in the OSPF section it tells you that routers form adjacencies, but doesn't explain what it is or how they are formed! There are also more technical errors in this book then any other book I have ever read.

I'm talking about real, substantive technical mistakes. I lost track as I was reading, but I estimate about one major mistake per page. At first I thought it was poor editing, but now I am beginning to wonder whether the authors really know the material.It is also poorly organized and very repetitive. The authors will say the same thing several times in one paragraph by just changing the order of the words. Then they will repeat themselves again in a few pages. It's very frustrating.Finally, the editing job is very poor -- missing and incorrect figures, etc.I'm very disappointed in this book, and I doubt that the reviewers who gave it 5 stars even read it. Normally I am a big fan of Cisco Press books, but this one is an exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like the way they've compiled this book","review":"Even if you know the stuff I think it's not good to study using the certification guide.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engaging Page Turner","review":"Kathy Hepinstall has given us an engaging page turner which I found to be a nice quick read. Alice, the novel's young protagonist and her brother Boone suspect that their stepfather is trying to poison them. This isn't the mere overactive imaginations of childhood, but a terribly unfortunate reality for these young teens. As they escape from their home life, they discover some shocking truths about their stepfather. The plot, while not predictible, isn't exactly groundbreaking, but the story is engaging and I found Alice to be very likable. She's funny and smart and never lets her fear get the best of her. Absence of Nectar is an enjoyable (and quick) read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ENJOYABLE SURPRISE","review":"Even though I read this book some time ago, I would like to say something about it. This was my first book by this writer and by the title I did not know what to expect. Let me say, I was pleasantly surprised by it and will read others by this author. If anyone has ever read BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA, TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD AND HUCK FINN well, put them together and this gave me some of the same feelings. I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Absence of Nectar","review":"Anyone who has grown up with the problem of an abusive step parent can probably understand the authors representation of her characters. Meg, Alice and Boone fit perfectly as an exaggeration of a disfunctional, disallusioned single parent family. Their desperation to survive as best they can, are marvelously tempered with the challenges they are faced with. I loved Numbhead, and the wit of Alice as she trys to protect lovesick Boone. I reccomend this book to all of you who enjoyed \\"Drowning Ruth\\". I know I will read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"No absence of sadness in this book!","review":"Absence of Nectar by Kathy Hepinstall is a coming of age novel set in the early 70's in Texas. This was a strange and distrubing novel which tells of the life of a young 12 year old and her brother who is 14.When their mother remarries these two children are afraid for thier lives as their step-father becomes more and more abusive. Parallel to this story is the tale of a young woman who has escaped from a prison and eventaully fits into the story of the two young protagonists.This was the third book I read by this author and while I found it a worthwhile read, I found the two previous books I read, The House of Gentlemen and Prince of Lost Places more intriguing. Still, Hepinstall is a writer worth reading since she leaves you with a lot to think about. I look forward to reading more books by her in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A coming of age story worth your time","review":"I love a good coming of age story, and \\"An Absense of Nectar\\" does not disappoint in that department. Alice, Boone and Persely are three of the more memorable characters I have encountered lately. This story is both hilarious and heartwrenching, and I'll likely never forget the twin terrors that live next door!As others have said, my only issues came with the very stereotypical characteristics assigned to the adults in the story (evil stepfather, ... mother, dimwitted law enforcement); and the ending was a little \\"much\\". That said however, this is still a thoroughly enjoyable story worthy of you time. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent work by Hepinstall","review":"I really enjoyed everything about this book. The setting was very easy to picture in my head as I read and the characters were written perfect for the story line. I didn't care that persley was a little off the wall and maybe not of been a super great character, some may think she's kinda far fetched or unimpressive but I still loved the way the story was layed out and unfolded . Even the unknow of what-ifs and what-now's of the ending left me in awe.

This is a story about a sister, Alice, her brother, Boone, their mother, Meg, and their EVIL stepfather, Simon. This is an excellent \\"coming of age\\" story with strong characters that you won't soon forget.

This one certainly is quite captivating. Kathy Hepinstall surely knows how to interweave many twists and turns in the story. Its interesting how Boone and Persley influence each other. The description of Simon Jetser's manipulating ways surely sets the tone throughout the book. Meg surely has her weaknesses as a person but definitely surprises the reader in the end. A good account on how children can be trapped in a bad situation. This story certainly gets my seal of approval."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard-to-put-down suspense novel.","review":"The action really moves in this hard-to-put-down suspense novel. This book has a whole lot of interesting stuff going on -- love, death, religion, poison, babies, murder, \\"crazy\\" people, \\"sane\\" people. There is beautiful -- even magical -- language in the author's mataphors, but they are at times bizarre and incomprehensible. The mind games are pretty scary. There are also situations that are brutal and frightening. I suppose some of the plot resolution is predictable, but there are quite a few surprises. After the initial set-up, the book is very fast-paced, and it has an interesting ending. The characters are totally different from any others I've encountered -- EVERYone has some kind of flaw. This family puts the \\"dys\\" in dysfunctional! An interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carver is no Chekhov.","review":"What I can't understand is not the revered tedium of Raymond Carver, but how Robert Altman managed to use this sterile material to create one of the great, rich tragicomic masterpieces of the last twenty years. The closing story here, about the death of Chekhov, is an attempt to extend his range, but the flat biographical style, the phoney insertions of 'meaningful' details and 'significant' events, the clumsy gropings for understated emotion, are quite intolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Animation just keeps getting better.","review":"I bought this book for myself, not my children. As an artist, animator, and Disney fan I wanted the book as a reference for the artwork used in the film. All I can say is I love the look of this film and I can't wait to see the movie. However, this is not an art book and in fact is not approved by Disney. It gives a little background on each of the characters, vehicles, and equipment used in the film, accompanied by gorgeous artwork from the movie itself, but is not a narrative story. Be aware, if you have not seen the film, this book gives away almost all of the plot. It also has none of the creative process behind what went into the movie. It is simply a very nice picture book and, in my opinion, worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE from DK","review":"Dorling Kindersley makes great looking books.

Railroad magnate Edward Harriman went on and sponsored a major expedition of scientists and naturalists to the coasts of Alaska and modern Alaskan Nancy Lord traced this expedition, following it in part with family and friends in her own fishing boat. The book is thought-provoking and does a good job of describing changes and common themes in Alaska over 100 years. As I read on, I could anticipate the author's perspective on issues. I found myself wanting more information about the expedition, including more maps and photos. Overall, I enjoyed this book and recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many feelings, too little facts","review":"This book reads more like a young girl's diary with dreamy references to \\"natives\\" and \\"pristine wilderness\\" as if they were boys she hoped would chase her.

No worries with this book. It has to be the easiest, most simply written computer software program I have ever read (that's quite a few). All the instructions are in large type and presented with graphics and easily understood instructions. No fussing like in most AutoCad tutorials. You can learn one item at a time and proceed at an easy pace. You are taught one efficient way to perform each command. Upon further reading and more confidence (yes, the writer is kind enough to take it easy on you and reduce your anxiety), you can create your own ways of doing your favorite commands. The \\"F\\" keys can greatly reduce the number of steps you need to perform many, many tasks. Believe me.

The material is there and a terrific cast does their game best to make \\"Serial\\" a memorable cinematic experience.

I was never all that great at math and I needed to brush up on mostly all of my math concepts for the GRE exam. This book was a great help to me in that process."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book reminds me why I hated math class","review":"I finished 3/4 of this book in an attempt to make up for my math deficiencies and to do better on standardized tests. I realized to continue with the author's viewpoint would be futile since I learned to hate the book. The author does well on the early chapters of reviewing basics but stumbles in later sections. Algebra seems to be a particular problem for her to explain clearly and there are shockingly short details. In short, there are not enough explanations, examples, and working through problems. The annoying tone of the author grated on me with her quasi-cheerleading and flat jokes. I would appreciate a more comprehensive answer section which would explain the process. True math confidence can be achieved with hard work, good explanations, and repetition. This book does not deliver. My math tutor, who is a PhD in math, started to cross out sections of the book. I think that says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best math review for standardized tests!","review":"I was preparing for the GRE, but I had one big problem. I had not taken a math class in 5 years. I had made it through calculus, but after a 5 year hiatus, it had all left my brain. Even the basic stuff, such as rules about exponents was out of my memory.This book takes you back to the very beginning (we're talking, \\"Here are the positive numbers, and the negative numbers\\"), and reteaches you math step-by-step in a very easy-to-understand way. It is also fun to read, as the author keeps the book interesting by using jokes and quips. This was the most helpful math review that I had (and I even took the Kaplan GRE course!). Teaches you how to solve math problems quickly by also giving tips and shortcuts. You won't regret buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Math Smart, 2nd Edition ( Princeton Review Series )","review":"I always am the best math person in the whole class.I just can't remember each formula, rule, and specificstep to do so. So when we went to Border's we saw this and Math Smart 2. I picked it up and scanned some of the pages. To my amazement, they had everything I was currently doing in my school. Integers, Fractions, Decimals. I was so good I finally found books with precise facts and easy-to-understand step-by-step guide. So I showed my mom and she said she would by it. Since then, I take Math Smart everywhere I go. It a perfect reference tool for math terms and the best studying guide I have ever seen. If you have a kid at home or want to brush up on math skills yourself, this is the book. Trust me your purchase will be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Product arrived in good condition like I was told, it was the right one I needed, arrived as soon as I ordered it (within 5 days! awesome!) I couldn't be happier. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than reading","review":"I learned in 30 minutes from this video what I couldn't learn in hours of reading other books. Plus, I was happy because this is truly about how to run and not about selling shoes (like the book natural running). I have not fully implemented all the techniques in this video, but I recommend it for anyone who is trying to improve their stride. I've watched it a couple of times and think it was a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"New running form","review":"This video is more accessible than Chi Running. No BS just right to the point. This syle of running and the quick and easy drills have allowed me to return to running after a knee injury related to heel striking. I would highly recommend if you want to just get to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little dissapointed","review":"When purchasing this i had read through all the reviews at the which were generally very positive.in all it is not so much that this is a bad DVD but more that it is not nearly as good as i thought it would be based on the other reviews. Generally it looks very outdated i.e. early 90's and the nubmer of drills and advanced information is pretty limited.i do however like that it does have drills that are accessable outside rewatching the main DVD.If you want something basic that gives you a few drills and a few very short clips of people doing them and running properly then this is for you just dont get your hopes up much more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"My military physical fitness run times have progressively decreased over the past 7 years due to this training. I also dropped from 8min/mile pace to 7:30min/mile pace on my last 1/2 marathon and felt great at the finish.With respect to this DVD, the producer won't win any awards for entertainment value or use of graphics, but the information is spot on and results are undeniable. Loved it so much we bought another to give out to family for Christmas this year! If you've been looking for a way to enjoy running and improve at it, do yourself a major favor and purchase this DVD AND make sure you follow through with the training. It takes time but it's well worth the investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Marks","review":"I bought this video in hopes of finding some tips on running with less knee pain, and I'm glad I chose this one. I do triathlon's in the Clydesdale division and I've had knee pain from running workouts. After watching the video I ran 18 miles in three days with zero knee pain. I'm very happy with the purchase and recommend it for anyone who's looking for tips on reducing injury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Content - Zero Support","review":"Watched the video and found it very informative. Drills were well explained. However; there was no suggestions as to how often to do them, how many reps to perform, or any other pertinent info. Went to their website twice and asked for assistance. No response at all. Has been several weeks now. Don't think it's coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I received the dvd yesterday and viewed it as well. It was as though I was looking at a book on my TV set. There were very few drills dispersed througout the video but what would have been better was to have them at the end as well, sort of a wrap-up. You will need to forward through the dvd little by little to find them. Although I run about 6 miles daily and have been doing it for awhile, I did learn some things but really the dvd was too technical. I am sure there are better dvd's to help the novice runner."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - Causes plantars faciitis!!!","review":"I give this DVD 1 star because Zero is not an option. I have been a runner for 15 years running an average of 70 miles per week. This may sound like overtraining but I have only had one injury until now. Within 2 weeks of trying this running method I developed severe plantars faciitis in both feet. I have had it for 2 months now despite returning to my previous running form. The podiatrist has informed me that running on your forefoot is absolutly not for any distance running. He said it strains the plantar facicia and achilles tendon These tendons are inelastic - yet in the video they say you use elastic recoil. Purchasing this video is one of the stupdist purchased I have ever made in my life!!! Steer clear from this DVD. Even if you increase your speed, you highly increase your chances of injuries to your plantars and achilles. It is not worth it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, soulful, dynamic album!","review":"I'm still speechless after listening to this album the past 2 days! K-Ci and JoJo's greatest hits' album just sounds great! The vocal talents are so soulful here. Sometimes, K-Ci reminds me of Bobby Womack vocally in his prime. And JoJo has some good pipes too. All My Life is still a classic some 8 years later. The album's mostly midtempo songs and ballads, but the performances are so dynamic! I still like Last Night's Letter, Tell Me It's Real, You Bring Me Up, I Care About You, the song from the Stella soundtrack and others. One other surprise here is Life, which sounds like it could have been done in one take, because K-Ci's voice sounds so pure here. Same with K-CI's If You Think You're Lonely Now. The offerings from the four albums and the soundtrack albums are so well balanced. You are going to be moved by this album!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, missing one song","review":"This album is great. Only gripe I have is the missing song \\"Beautiful\\" from the NY Undercover soundtrack. And of course, the Jodeci songs. Maybe they will release a remastered Jodeci compilation someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"kci and jojo are the best of the best!","review":"Come on people! Kci and jojo and awesomely amazing incredibly the best of all time. Their beautiful voices, amazing lyrics! What more could we possibly askfor? Their talents are truly given directly to them from GOD himself and I won'tbelieve anything else. Listen to their music and you'll be feelin' it allright!Already K-ci and Jo-jo!!! I love you guys and can't wait to meet you even thoughthat won't be until we get to Heaven! I thank God for you! You are one of my lifes biggest blessings of all.

It would be better if called \\"Best Of\\" because KCi and JoJo only had three significant hits and those were \\"All My Life\\" Crazy\\" and \\"Tell Me It's Real.\\" \\"All My Life\\" was one of the best R&B ballads to come out of the late 90's, but the other two resembled pale imitations that revealed the duo desperately trying to live up to that monster single. They succeeded someone considering both singles got pretty decent airplay ,but nothing will ever top \\"All My Life\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Sure They Are Any Better Quality Wise But...","review":"...they are sure a lot easier to put on and take off. The NUT alone is why I use these filters. Got really tired of crumpled cans and scrapped knuckles, using a box end wrench that is pre-fitted to the nut makes working with these filters well worth the extra money. Just hope they are as good as they advertise them to be quality wise because they are the only ones that I will use...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A suspenseful science fiction novel filled with action","review":"The cover art really drew me to this book, as I have not read much before by this author. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a very enjoyable read; a suspenseful science fiction novel filled with espionage and action. The idea of cloning from ancient DNA is not new (Jurassic Park, need I say more) but the idea of \\"blending\\" personalities inherent in DNA was a new twist, handled very well. The archaeological aspects in Alexandria were also well described and made for some vibrant settings.One of the highlights of this novel was the way Scarborough develops her characters into unique individuals that are easy to associate with, both good and evil. The protagonist and antagonist(s) are people that truly act out according to their personal beliefs and values-a very human trait which often gets left behind in science fiction works. I highly recommend this book-entertaining, engaging and full of plot twists that keep your interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloned or infected???","review":"I'm not sure which one you'd call it. In a distant future, Nucor Technologies has invented a 'personality transplant.' Donees are implanted with the personalities of famous and infamous people from the past.Naturally, many women want Cleopatra.Forensic scientist and closet anthropologist Leda Hubbard and her father Duke, an ex-cop with a lot of ex-wives, are hired by Nucor to find Cleopatra. She discovers quickly enough that this isn't the safe assignment she'd expected. Many people want a transplant without Nucor's controls.Scarborough is always fascinating whether she's writing Medieval, current day, or futuristic fantasy. She's created a world and a cast of characters that I can't fail to cheer for. The novel takes some interesting twists that leave you laughing--and thinking about what makes up a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Channeling Cleopatra","review":"Didn't like the book much, the author tried to be too girlish with her main character, and the technology was too easily believed by the other characters. Read about 1/3 and skimmed through the rest to see how it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpowering dust and fragrance","review":"First, I really loveFresh Step Crystals Cat Litter, 8-Pound Bagfor containing odors, but as it's expensive I usually mix it with a clumping litter. Unfortunately, I simply cannot recommend this one. The bulk size is very economical, but there is so much dust and artificial fragrance that I practically choke on it (can even taste it! disgusting!) whenever I change the litter or my cat uses the box (even when I'm two rooms away). It's as if Fresh Step emptied a canister of powdered carpet deodorizer into the litter. With the crystals I don't need a deodorizer, so I am definitely switching to an unscented clumping litter the next time I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Step is excellent","review":"The one-star review is 3 years old. The product has transformed from the 'face powder' mentioned to a grainer version (at least the product I purchased recently). A plus for me is the lack of obnoxious perfume, often present in other clumping litter, that seems to be a deterrent to my cats. Still has a little dust but nothing like other similar products. After a lot of experimentation, Fresh Step is my choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible dust and what I find a sickening smell.","review":"The clumping works well, but the fine dust everyplace is incredible. It smears when you try to clean it up and it gets everyplace. It's made a mess of my downstairs and one just can't clean enough to get rid of it ... I can't recommend this product and that is why I gave it a one star, the horrific dust. And when you clean up the dust you get the cat litter smell on your hands and all of the items you're trying to remove the dust from. Also, it gets into your respiratory system as you clean and in my case my allergies start up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"The only advantage to this product is that it is lightweight and easy to carry home from the grocery store. I have been using the traditional Fresh Step Scoopable for years, and have found it superior to all other products for keeping down odor. I was hoping the Natural product would provide the same functionality without the heavy weight and without the environmental impact. Unfortunately, this is not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooh, that Smell","review":"And it's not a good one. This cat litter is scented, a horribly strong soapy scent that takes over the entire room when I add more to the box. And if my cats have just visited the bathroom and come anywhere near me, I get a whiff too.Besides that, it really doesn't work as well as the previous brand I was using to eliminate the smell of cat waste so the soapy smell mixes with that and it's entirely unpleasant.Although the clumping capabilities are decent, they're not amazing. If this were my only complaint, I would probably still use Fresh Step Scoopable.While affordably priced and widely available, Fresh Step Scoopable isn't the best cat litter product I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't like this CD your a commie","review":"Great CD nothing like his work with Thrice. Influences from Johnny Cash to Elvis Costello and everything in between. Trust me its worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh, expecting something diff","review":"So i expected this to be some kind of great musical offering. First, let me say I respect his work with Thrice and was looking forward to this. I think he wrote this album more as an experiment for himself, which is good but sometimes doesn't translate well to the listener. I know art is subjective so don't let a bad review stop you from checking it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"I bought this novel because of my interest in the Civil War. It contains a fascinating description of the escape from Richmand, Va. by Jefferson Davis as the Confederate treasury was brought along. However, this is not a Civil War novel. I have never read a book like this one. It is totally different from any other novel I have read. It was surprisingly good. I got about half-way through it before I realized it. This is a neat love story and a fun book to read. My wife is reading it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Found Out","review":"I had been sick lately and my boyfriend got me a copy of this book to read. It makes me wonder where I have been. I just found out about it. This is a great read. I love the wedding scene. You can just picture it in your head. I want my boyfriend and I to get married in a setting like this. I think people will enjoy reading this book. It has mystery but not much. It mostly has romance. This is a story of true love. Any woman in the world would want to be treated like Miss Armstrong. I think she did her husband wrong by being gone so much. You'll like this book. I can easily see this story as a movie. It would be fun to go to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic video","review":"This video is broken down well so you can follow from the beginning or skip around if you like. Has good basic dances and \\"moving together\\" section to teach more than steps.

I tried it on three other DVD players and the DVD wouldn't play at all. I don't know if I just had a defective copy or the DVD's were burned on really cheap discs, but I don't have enough time to wait for a replacement DVD to find out. I just returned the DVD and went to the local Border's book store to buy a different instructional wedding dance DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD works. Forget the rest.","review":"I've tried dance videos before. They've all been miserable, frustrating, horrible! Not to say all dance videos are bad, but if you've ever been frustrated by dancing or a dance video before, I think you know what I mean.This DVD is different. The instruction on this disc isn't confusing at all. Quite the contrary, if you simply watch the short section called \\"Moving Together\\" you'll learn how to lead or follow in about 30 minutes. Then you can fake your way through any dance.I hate to use the \\"two left feet\\" cliche, but I've always felt that way until my Fiance bought this DVD. We literally practiced for less than an hour, and we pulled off our wedding dance without a hitch. We even got a bunch of compliments, and look good in the video. Who could ask for more?Why are you still reading? Add this disc to your basket. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Find Your Right Foot!!","review":"As in other reviews, we've tried a number of other videos and DVD's on dance lessons. We found this one particulary helpful as it shows a good balance between the leaders and followers part. We took 6 private lessons before we found this DVD and thought this was a better value. We are looking for more advanced videos now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reservng an opinion until all sides heard","review":"Hugo Chavez clearly is an alternative to free enterprise capitalism.

I was definitely mistaken as the author constantly rants about meaningless things completely unrelated to Hugo Chavez or Venezuela. For example, in Chapter 4 he goes on and on in the first person about his email campaign with an anarchist in London to organize a Seattle style WTO protest in Europe. This, like most of his pointless rants, have no purpose and must be some method to add pages for the publisher.

Sachar adopts a moderate to liberal Israeli stance, admiring early Maipai and Labor leaders Ben-Gurion, Peres, and Rabin. On the other hand, he is unremittingly critical of Likud leadership as well as the influence of the Orthodox and charedim in Israeli society.Readers should keep in mind that this tome is a history of Israel, and not of the conflict with the Arab States and Palestinians; while it does an excellent job revealing Israeli ideology regarding the conflict, it spends far less time discussing Arab thinking and motivation. Even so, it does not mince words in criticism of Israeli militarism, particularly that of current prime minister Ariel Sharon. An outstanding, extremely readable history of the Jewish state."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"We bought several of these for use at a university and have been very happy with them.

The lessons about musical theatre construction are taught here in a way that makes them personal, fun and important to the reader; not unlike Moss Hart's education in playwrighting in \\"Act One\\". Explorations of when to reveal details about a character, how to construct a lyric and most especially the particular art of compression that drives a musical are a delight that simply never leaves the mind. And you will never hear the word 'spaz' the same way again. This is the book I have recommended about musical theatre more than any other and the one I have never (it is the rarest of the pack) lent out. \\"The Making of 'No No Nanette' is the dishiest-but this book, like the musical it describes is an act of joy and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"If you are stuck in the past, like our company is, this should work well for you.

The main focus is Angel vs. Roc vs. Rahman and him fighting his old demons. This book has plenty of drama to hold you over until the final book. This is a must read for all Teri Woods fans and this book also has a cliffhanger ending that has you yearning for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"NxCESS book club","review":"This second book was better than the first one there is a lot more action, and Angel is a bad a** girl she is to smooth.

Part I and II were made two years apart I am dying to read what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This book was stupid. You could probably read the first and then the final book. This book focused around Angel and Rahman and this stupid beef-- the book was dumb. Dutch wasn't even in the story.

She really used characterization to bring out the plot and through the eyes of Angel and her nemesis, who used to be her friend, was able to show that people can change. That people do things based on what loyalties and based on their beliefs of what is right. The only thing I had a problem with is some of the typos I spotted but overall, I love the story.

I agree with the other reviewer, I can't wait another 2 years for Dutch III, don't torture us Teri! lol I definitely see these novels on the big screen....but...but the casting's gotta be tight because the characters are no joke! I love the alluding to Dutch throughout the whole book. That was part of the mystique too that kept me reading, to see if he would appear.

One eyed Roc and Angel are now enemies, once friends...Angel will do anything to avenge Ducth's \\"Death\\".

It seems they would be a match made in heaven or perhaps hell. Anyway, I'm waiting with baited breath for Dutch III because I know it's going to be as tight as the previous parts of the trilogy. By the way, I'm not feeling Nina and I want her to take her indecisive self out of the picture. But you know we don't always get what we want. Major props for Teri Woods. To be able to write to develop a character like Angel, Ms. Woods has to be a true G."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth","review":"The book was the truth. I honestly believe that Teri did an outstanding job with this book. I like the way she made sure that she didn't forget a character from the first Dutch. She builds you up for Dutch three in this book. She included his mother, father, Nina, Angel, Craze and Roc. I hate reading a sequal and then you have to sit back and wonder what happen to this person and that person, because the author forgot about them. I find the book ironic...because in this book you are actually rooting for the bad guy. But if you are from the streets then you know someone like this so it is natural to want the best for them eventhough they have stripped so many people of their dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I think Teri Woods is an excellent writer.

Written for children, the books tell a story of being a time and space traveller, and visiting chronologically the stages of development of the Unites States. The first book starts in the Ice Age, with Asians crossing the land bridge, and follows up through Native American tribes, ending with explorers from Europe.I'd say these books are probably around a 6th grade reading level, and they are fun, interesting, and capture the imagination as well as teach an awful lot about history. The perspective of the books is that no one view of history is correct, and your child is expected to formulate his/her own ideas about what is right and wrong (for example, about forcing \\"native americans\\" to live on reservations.)I highly recommend the first book in the series, and I can hardly wait to finish it up, so we can start in on the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A BOOK AS USELESS AS THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION!

In an attempt to be \\"politically correct,\\" this book teaches the reader that B.C.E & C.E. should be used, since religions like Islam, Buddhism, and Judaism do not believe that Christ is our Lord. On page 166, B.C.E. and C.E. are explained as such and are defined to stand for \\"Before the Common Era\\" and \\"Common Era.\\" Throughout the pages of this book, the date is written as B.C.E or C.E. rather than B.C. or A.D.

This, unfortunately, would have been the doings of the white man - the \\"Indian\\" wanted all parts of the animal, not just the tongue and tail.

This is not a good way to treat musicians. Therefore: please do not buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare, Precious & Beautiful","review":"This album, if you can find it, is probably Glenn's best. His unique high-energy guitar style is combined with some real pretty fretless basswork (Bill Rea), tasteful synth by Paul Provost and insistent, almost tribal drums by Doug Landsberg. The result is an album of stark contrasts: very beautiful tunes played at the edge of feedback, and driving rhythms which are so comfortable they seem quite relaxed.All of Glenn's albums have been great, but this one, which perfectly sums up his instantly-recognizable sound, remains a perennial favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Release","review":"I remember reading that U2 was not going to release any single CDs in the US for All That You Can't Leave Behind. That's really a shame. There were no less than 4 POP singles, and they all featured much-welcomed remixes, B-sides, and live material. Take this single, for instance. It's fantastic. This is the better edition of the 2 versions put out (the other one in a standard-size jewel case, I believe) because of the quality of the live tracks. Beautiful Day is a great track live, period. And New York was a real surprise--it converted very well to the stage format. Overall, I have very pleased, even having to pay a little bit more for the import. (But it's always been that way if you want certain tracks.) I wish the US singles market was more open and we had more maxi-singles, especially for new U2 material. Are they afraid they won't sell?

Where else would you learn about the highwayman who robbed his victims naked? Where else would you find out about the glamorous highwayman who made the ladies swoon until his untimely young death?

Unfortunately, this salad spinner falls far short of the quality I've come to expect. First of all, you have to put it together from numerous smaller parts, and as you know, anything you can put together, can fall apart. Next, the thing is just really big and bulky, using a lot of wasted space on large plastic pieces. The plunge handle seems great at first, however, if you push it all the way to the bottom it LOCKS! So you have to be careful as you're pumping it not to reach the bottom. Very annoying. Why couldn't they have designed it so that you had to twist it at the bottom to lock, or something? Anyhow, I'm just used to KitchenAid being the highest quality and using the smartest ingenuity in their design, so I'm a bit surprised by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pump handle locks when you use it.","review":"Bad design. The pump handle locks into place when you push it down to make the basket spin. So you get one push/spin and then it locks. You have to put one hand under the pump lever to keep it from going all the way down and locking, or push very lightly which produces a very low speed spin that does not spin off the excess water from the salad. I'm shopping for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"While KitchenAid is typically a reliable manufacturer, this salad spinner is a big loser. It is honestly one of the worst product designs I've ever come across. It's impossible to spin the lettuce without causing the spinner to \\"lock.\\" The pump itself is attached to the basket/strainer, so it's difficult to rinse things in the basket. The lid has to be carefully \\"fit\\" over the pump every time you want to close it.

After a micro-blurb on what JDBC is, the authors tell us that a description of using that interface is out of scope of the book.

Buy this book and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Book","review":"I had high hopes for gaining some clear techniques on time management from this book. However, I found it extremely confusing once I got to the Time Mapping section. The segments (activities, goals) melded into each other and I found Morgenstern's explanations less than clear as to what exactly to do. I consider myself fairly intelligent but she lost me.I did find value in identifying major life categories and big picture goal - but again - that entire section of the book that explained how to utilize that information was confusing. I went to her website to try to gain some insight and found going through message boards that it seemed as though many people who logged in were also still struggling.I have to say I'm disappointed as well as out $15.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Management from the Inside Out","review":"This book has helped not only me personally, but also helped get my family more organized.

This is the first book that gave me hope that my life could really be better. Rather than taking the approach that most books take of giving you a list of the same old tips, this book gets to the heart of your organizational problems. It works with each person, helping you organize in a way that best fits your individual personality and needs, and then gives you step-by-step instructions on how to get and stay organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great!","review":"I've only read a little over half the book so far, but it is already changing how I think about time and how I do things.

But I was on a \\"get organized\\" kick when I stumbled across the book at a thrift store for less than a dollar and figured \\"what the heck\\".Within the first few pages I noticed a number of typographical errors. In this technology laden age there is simply no excuse for a book to go to press with typos. It conveys a lack of attention to detail and focus that does not speak well of the author or the publishing house.I found it hard to keep reading after finding the errors but I muddled through. I must say there is NOTHING remarkable in this book. Unless the reader it totally disorganized and unfocused I can't see anyone benefiting much from its reading.Bottom line, avoid buying this book and instead spend the money on a cute notebook, head to your local coffee house and spend some time thinking introspectively about your own personal obstacles to organization."},{"rating":"2","title":"I should really get this book","review":"I purchased Julie Morgenstern's previous book Organizing From the Inside Out and have not read it - yet. I will purchase the new book Time Management From the Inside Out first, for its promising advise on procrastination!and second,to locate time \\"after hours\\". I want to organize my home and have time left over for a life. Time management and organizational skills are in place at work since many of us work, by definition, for an \\"organization\\" and the skills come from the outside in. It seems logical that for my life, these skills need to come from the inside out.

It wasn't just that the Veterns of Vietnam were not treated well by some, but that those who served, couldn't remember the names of those with whom they served and who eventually gave everything. Jan was so very upset that he couldn't remember the 'names' of the ones lost. He could see the faces and remember the men, but couldn't remember the names. That is what he wanted...for people to remember the names. The men, by their names, couldn't be forgotten. That was the original purpose of the wall. A very good and real purpose it has been. I want Jan to know his dream was not lost, but most do not remember this part of the reason for the memorial. Thank you Jan...you were and are right, the names have to be remembered.

I've had one for a month now and it still works great. However, it did stop working for me at one point, but you can fix that by pressing the reset button which is underneath.

This will cause it to go off-cycle and stop running, then you have to use the reset button all over again.

I had to figure out how to change the batteries (no instructions) and also when the opener would not release the lid, I found out that if you hold down the little black push button on the underside of the handle near the bottom, it would reverse the can opener process. I gave it high marks because of ease of use, storage and non electric. (We changed batteries 2x during the 24 mos.)

Also it will do nothing more than put a death grip on a number 10 can, and you're back to trying to get to the reverse button. Any can filled with liquid is probably going to get spilled, so have mop rag ready.

We changed batterie 3X; my machinist minded spouse tells me the motor sounds too weak to do any good. We certainly had a lively conversation about its merits.

The seam broke and leaked juice all over the counter.The \\"handy\\" screw to back the can opener up, was of very little use.You are better off with a cheap electric can opener any time, or a hand crank can opener.With this device, you might as well throw 20-bucks out on the lawn.This piece of garbage ended up in the garbage.Completely worthless.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad design","review":"I loved this can opener at first. It was, and still is, nice to press a button and it opens. The biggest pro is that the lid isn't sharp like with the regular can openers. Although the top can edge is a bit sharper than with a regular can opener. - My fiancee cut his hand scoopping out wet dog food. As others say, it eats battery power fast. -For me, I might open 8 cans (max) on one set of batteries. And I don't notice any slowing down, it just dies. Everytime the battery has died while cutting open a can. The first time mine ran out of batteries, I broke the can opener prying it off the can. I thought it was a fluke, so I bought another one. Batteries still die in the middle of opening a can. I'm just more careful prying it off now. It's fun at first. But I don't understand why it goes through so many batteries so fast.

It felt like I had stuck my hand into a light socket! I was up in a mountain cabin and not near a hospital, but my firefighter/EMT son was able to get the bleeding to stop and then applied surgical glue from his medical kit to close the wound. I have no feeling on the outside of my pinky finger -- it feels like it does when your foot is asleep (pins and needles)!

Fourth, there's virtually no way to clean the blade. You can't submerge the thing in water. And don't even dare try to clean it with a sponge.

Thought it was just old so ordered another and it FAILED, JAMMED, BROKE after opening only 3 cans! Poor me, I cut my finger trying to separate the opener from the can!

I thought for sure it would turn out that it wouldn't work as easily as shown on the tv ads, and I have to admit I was hesitant about paying so much for an item that was going to maybe just end up in a drawer. Three days after I placed my order the can opener arrived. I couldn't wait to give it a try! And.... bingo...it worked just like on the tv ad! I was amazed how simple it was, just place it on the can lid and push the button. It was just that simple. I think this is the first \\"as advertised on tv\\" item that I have ever bought that actually works the same as shown on the tv hype advertisement. My mom loves it! So far, so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I am very happy with this can opener. It arrived within week after I ordered it from amazon. I put the batteries in it and put it on a can and hit the start button. It worked just like they show on television. I have used it many times since then and it has worked as advertised every time. The only unknown is how long the batteries will last, but at this point I have no reason to believe that it won't be at least the 100 cans as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes two","review":"It took me two of these for me to wonder why I ever spent the money.

Otherwise, forget it.I got about two cans actually open before it stopped working. Seems like it's low on batteries. Let's see, two fresh alkalines / 2 cans opened = 1 battery used per can. If you don't think that's a great deal, this pile of junk is not for you. Oh, and I am not talking about the wholesale sized coffee can with a 12\\" diameter lid, either, these were little tiny baby sized tuna cans.You'd be better off paying some kid $20 to stomp on your foot with baseball cleats.

The batteries were fresh when first installed. Apparently, the batteries or something else failed as the can opener would not continue to operate and was impossible to remove from the can. As far as I can tell, there is no release mechanism to disengage the device once it has stopped while partially opening a can.I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.Dickson G. Pratt"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Touch........most of the time","review":"This can opener does open a can by itself, if it is a regular size can, but sometimes it takes more than 'one touch' to get it started. Once started, it goes all around the can and cuts it open from the side. It comes to a stop automatically. The top of the can comes off with the can opener when you take it off, but it does leave the very top edge of the can itself with a razor sharp edge and also leaves a 'shaving' or sliver of material hanging; paper or metal? Not sure, but usually leaves this little shaving of material you have to be careful not to get in your food. I have been using it, but I use it with care. I would not recommend it for a household where children may use it, I think there may be a saftey issue here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"This Can Opener is terrible. We paid an extra $4.50 for a more powerful motor. When it arrived we read the instructions in detail. It could not make it all the way around a standard coffee can. It stalled four times. It danced back and forth. It was difficult to remove from the can and never did cut all the way around. It left sharp edges on the can itself. We tried several sets of fresh batteries. Part of the weak motor problem probably occurs because it only takes two AA batteries. We tried it over and over on normal cans and finally returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"nite lite","review":"The cd is poorly produced. I had trouble listening through the first few songs.

After the 3rd song I wanted to reach through my speakers and destroy the piano. Somehow Ms. Fury mistakes glibness of piano technique for artistry. There is none on this disc, in spite ot the synchophantic reviews. It is truly an amateurish recording with very little to recommend it. I bought it based on the other reviews and I am not happy that there seems to be no place to say that it truly stinks and should be left to disappear into some miasma somewhere, never to surface again. Perhaps in her next album she will have some faith in her music to not obliterate it in over-the-top pianistic noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"the tragic encounter of two worlds beautifully conveyed","review":"This book is a gem. The sad results of the encounter of the Spanish with the indiginous population of the Caribbean Islands is presented objectively and the few accounts of the Tiano Peoples' own words are effectively used to hint at who these early victims of European expansion really were. The use of modern photos and historic illustrations opens up the real lost world where these events unfolded and every illustration adds to and interacts with the text. The result is both a good read and a rigerous scholarly introduction to the foundations of the American experiance. This is the first work of its kind that interperts the historic documents as understood by an island inhabitant who understands details the first explorer encountered from personal experiance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"A bit geared towards blue-water people and liveaboards, but still managed to give us a few tips applicable to our part of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me","review":"I'm sorry to be so critical but I reached a point where because of pages of boring repetition and no progress, I felt the title of the book was exactly what I would say to the author - \\"Don't Say A Word\\" , not another word.

There were some twists and turns at the end but it took forever to get to them.It was hard for me to like the protagonists. I found them self centered and foolish. They were told repeatedly that they were putting their loved ones in mortal danger. But, they didn't care. They just kept seeking out more and more people to put in danger. When they were told they could be killed by professionals that killed before, they kept saying \\"I can take care of myself.\\" He was a photographer and she a disc jockey.

Writing a dumbed down version of \\"Russia House,\\" \\"Parent Trap,\\" and Anastasia, the author actually has a great plot and story idea, but she didn't research, didn't build up enough detail and didn't enrich this with real characters. The plywood cutout characters failed to elicit any emotional attachment from me and the whodunnit aspect of the story was apparent from the beginning. I wanted to get lost in the prose and the story, but I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Such a good story idea.

The writer is excellent but it's the editors who are the problem, demanding their authors follow formulaic plots, not stretching out to something new. Ignore this review if you love most romances; you'll love this one - I've been tainted by Stieg Larsson who I could not put down, and Tami Hoag's last few books which were more suspense than romance.

They are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetely trouble with magic","review":"I'm a big fan of paranormal mysteries and was very excited to see this one come out. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this book. It has the elements to be a great read, but I found the character annoying. I understand that the character goes through a process of \\"opening her mind\\" to other possibilities, but the constant internal monologue to this topic detracted from the story line. And the fact that she lives in a small town with close-minded people... well I got that point on page 10, and don't need to be reminded of it on page 20, 30, 40, etc.I think there is great potential with this series, and hope that the author can work out some of the more distracting elements and focus on writing the story, rather than commenting about the character's situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer who said she was left feeling like we had to listen to the lead characters inner thoughts too often.

I was so looking forward to reading #1 in this series, I had Border's order it for me as they didn't have it in (now I know why)!!! I actually didn't like the main character at all, the prose was so slow-moving that it required ALL my patience to get halfway thru and then I just stopped reading, wondering why I was compelled to finish this....there was NO tension with regard to the murder/mystery/ghost-like occurrences. Well, actually there wasn't much of anything (although I loved the Magnum references).For those of you out there, interested in wonderful reads on this very same topic, I agree with the recommendation of Victoria Laurie's Psychic Eye series and her new series Ghost Hunters, as well as Shirley Damsgaard's Abby and Ophelia series. Both those authors know how to keep the reader on pins and needles, not hay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystical and Addictive","review":"When Maggie O'Neill takes a job in a Stony Mill antique shop, it's the first time she follows her unknown psychic instincts. She and Felicity, her boss, a witch, become fast friends, so when Felicity is accused of murder, Maggie has no choice but to search for the real killer. I devoured this story from beginning to end. The mystical and mysterious world Madelyn Alt creates is one that calls to you, one you wish to return to over and over again. I adore Maggie's ghost hunting cronies and all the quirky characters who people the pages of THE TROUBLE WITH MAGIC. Marcus is especially yummy. I loved the story so much that I quickly picked up A CHARMED DEATH and devoured that as fast. I can't wait for HEX MARKS THE SPOT.

If you want a fun book with good characters and great magic, try Enchanted Inc. and leave Trouble alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anxious For More!!!","review":"I just discovered Madelyn Alt's wonderful series with this book, and I immediately ordered all of the rest!

The Trouble with Magic is a bit clumsy at times, but it's nothing that you wouldn't find in any first-in-a-series book. I loved the characters, found the narrative to be well-paced, and had a grand old time. I'll certainly be looking for the rest of the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting mystery","review":"This new series written by Madelyn Alt is a fresh new perky kind of series. It involves magic, murder, mystery and mayhem. The 4 m's what could be better?Anyway, the back of the book pretty much tells the plot, Maggie recently gets a job at a charm shop working for Felicity when all of a sudden Felicity is charged with murdering her own sister. Maggie is convinced that she is innocent as does Felicity's friend, Marcus. Felicity and Marcus and a few other people gather every now and then to practice their magical capabilities. They are known as the N.I.G.H.T.S. and they deal with the supernatural when it occurs around them. Maggie is asked to join them on the account of she recently and slowly starts to develop strange powers...Anyway it's a good read with a bit of magic and mystery to keep you hooked.

Time is precious, read something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally \\"bewitching,\\" and a good mystery, too.","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that it was hard to put down. The characters are intriguing and the murder mystery keeps you guessing. In fact, it left me wanting more to the point that I ran right out to the store to buy the next edition in the series. You might want to just order both books together to save yourself the trip!This book might not be quite right for you if the idea of ESP and/or witchcraft offends you. Also, the description of the practice of \\"magick\\" could be considered a bit enticing to someone who is easily swayed. But if you can take it with an ounce of imagination and fun, it makes for a fun, slightly goosebumpy reading experience.

The book is clearly, and often eloquently, written and it is up-to-date (till February 2003, the time of going to press). This helps because many important discoveries have taken place recently. It also helps that Seife is a trained mathematician since modern physics is so closely tied to mathematics. So, for example, most popular science books wrongly explain Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, but Seife gets it right. The book is particularly strong in describing various experiments and telescopes, how they work, and how they are expanding our understanding of the universe. On the negative side, the graphics could be much better; often, they help little in illustrating the concepts. There are also some spelling mistakes.

Using the red filter makes the light pretty much useless. The green filter is barely any better. Using the light without any filter (white) allows for a small amount of light. This is certainly better than no flashlight - but for hiking I would strongly recommend that you purchase thePetzl TacTikka Plus 4-LED Headlamp, Black #E49Pinstead.

After using this once, you have to ask: \\"what were they thinking?\\" The cutting disks can fit into the device both ways though only one way cuts, the disk is difficult to line up properly in the unit, and frankly doesn't cut well with my main use for parmigiano reggiano...it almost powders it. Worse, the circular hand motion needed to grate is fine for, say, a pepper mill for which only a small amount is needed. For this, the repetitive twisting and small yield are unacceptable.For those of you like me who have and love the superb and unbeaten KitchenAid stand mixers, this device and the rotary grater are not in anywhere near the same quality and usefulness league.Another cheese grater of no value to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Excuse For A Cheese Grater","review":"This is far harder to use than the hand crank models and produces a pathetic little pile of grated cheese.

My first thought was, Did they test this? If you are left-handed, as with most manual devices, FORGET IT! But that aside, I've tried turning it with my other hand and here's what happened. My Parmesano/Reggiano cheese was hard to grind, lots of twisting, not much cheese. (The item came in a box with no actual instructions.) Before long, the pieces of cheese ended up under the pusher housing and stopped grating altogether. So, I ended up with a lot of work, not much grated cheese, and lots of larger chunks that could not be grated. I also agree that the graters could be placed in backwards very easily. To sum it up: 1. It simply does not work well at all. 2. If you are left-handed, you end up twisting your wrist in the most inefficient direction, making it necessary to change hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just try it","review":"After reading the 3 negative reviews I passed on this grater until a buy 3 get one free offer on KitchenAid products. I figured I'd try it as my free item; I already owned the Rotary grater, and this product when used as directed works great.

I have 3 other crates in this style from different brands and this is by far the worst. The assembly was horrible! Though \\"no assembly required\\" is somewhat true it has to be \\"unfolded\\". The crate wasn't truly square so I had to wrestle with this to get it together. Having other crates of this style, I am familiar with the assembly and I know it should not have been that hard. As another review stated, the doors were not secure at all. I jiggled the doors a bit and the door came totally unlatched. An un-crate trained dog would get the doors open with their wiggling. My dogs who love their crates would have it open as soon as they moved around \\"fluffing\\" their blankets.

With a very conversational, informal writing style, Mr.Erdelyi explains the theory of convolution quotients, an immensely powerful and profound mathematical topic. Basically, in the same way rational numbers are developed from natural numbers by division, generalized functions may be obtained from run-of-the-mill functions by convolution. Amazingly, these bizarre entities can be either functions, impulse functions(like the delta function) and operators! The fact that we can treat operators like algebraic entities turns out to be the key for solving many tough differential equations.This gem of a book is a must-read introduction to this fascinating topic. Beginning with a simple introduction, and using clear prose and a perfect balance between rigor and informality, this awesome book is great for anybody trying to solve difficult ODEs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most effective cough drop.","review":"Short of a steroid spray, or codeine cough syrup, Olba's is the most effective cough suppressant I have found.

Aside from his daily ruminations that he was unsure if \\"Grapes\\" would be a good book, there was little revealed as to his creative process. How did he create his characters? Why did he use certain plot devices? Where did his inspirations come from? All this was lacking.If you read Christopher Tolkien's works on his father's \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" you see the work created before you. You can see how a character developed, how a plot changed. In \\"Working Days\\" there is none of that. It is simply repetitive admonitions to himself to work harder. It became tedious and a great many times I wondered if the editor had simply repeated previous entries and only changed their number.\\"Working Days\\" is interesting, but don't be fooled into thinking you are going to be there at the birth of a great novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"skimming the surface with diary entries","review":"I found this book to be less informative than I thought it was going to be.

I really like the three different characters that entwine with each others lives. It always keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. Another part that I really enjoy reading about is the Angels, past-life regression hypnosis, and psychic abilities. I truly believe that there are Angles among us and that they are watching over us. I wish I could see one. The fact that the Devil is trying to ruin the lives of the three main characters puts a different light to the story. One of the best parts of the book is how Phillip and Leigh get to know each other and fall in love. I always enjoy a good love story. Finally, after reading the book, I get a warm feeling that my loved ones that have died are around me and watching over me every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This book was a page-turner from start to finish!

The band displays good musicianship and the vocalist is above-average, but the overwrought lyrics and uninteresting melodies couldn't get me excited. Most of the fast and heavy songs lack intensity, though the ballads are pretty good (mainly due to the vocalist). The CD plods for way too long...about halfway through this disc I kept glancing to my CD player wondering when it was going to end. It starts promising but quickly degenerates into boring, average power metal.

With the exception of \\"I Cash Radii\\" and \\"Cybele\\", I find this music too dark and lifeless. Actually, most of it is not music, but industrial techno noise. Don't waste your money.

When it finally arrived I thought I had accidentally purchased the soundtrack to Resident Evil: The Apocalypse. This music has a very dark vibe and is difficult to dance to, or do anything else for that matter, without a sense of impending doom. It's creepy, haunting sound mixes don't really succeed in incorporating any tribal music. I'm stunned one could belly dance to this. It is less tribal metamorphosis and more scary acid trip. I wish I could ship this one back and make a better choice. Save your money my fair friends and just pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"very different","review":"I love New Age music and World Beat so I figured I'd give this CD a try. There are a couple songs on this CD that I really like that do have sort of a a Middle Eastern flavor, others with a 'temple' sound to them. I like that, believe me, but most of the other songs just remind me of sound effects from my son'sX-Box games. Way too 'out there' and 'spacey' for me.

Instead I found this album all kinds of boring and without any kind of melody or even a beat in the majority of the songs. I think the best way to describe it is \\"not enough of either and too much of both.\\" For being an album for dancers, these songs are not easy to dance to--not the kind of music that you put on and want to groove to. I like \\"I Cash Radii\\" and \\"Cybelle\\". The rest are fairly unlistenable and rather pretentious.

I'd categorize it as a rare mix of industrial/ambient techno and new age/Middle Eastern neo-folk. Pentaphobe tries to bring a lot of sounds to the table in \\"Sa'Iyr\\", and for the most part, it's an engaging experience. I am particularly satisfied with the songs \\"I Cash Radii\\" and \\"Cybelle\\" in which Pentaphobe combines traditional Middle Eastern folk sounds with industrial samples, such as rattling metal, to produce a powerful blend of smooth but intense rhythms. I'm not sure if anyone could bellydance to this music aside from Rachel Brice, but it can be appreciated by less flexible people as a singular collection of music. Plus, it's worth it to buy the album just for the picture of the inimitable Rachel Brice on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking Musical Metamorphosis","review":"On very rare occasions does one experience a truly unique direction in music. Pentaphobe has created a richly textured and multi-layered sound with sophisticated use of rhythm and sampling. Each piece generates a complex and engaging atmosphere. The only problem that I can see with this album is one of categorising it. The use of Middle Eastern Rhythms, live insruments, voice, sampling and electronic sound are only the starting point for a sound that is evocative of many styles but ultimately too original for any pigeon hole.Working in the area of performance and physical theatre I can imagine any of the tracks on this CD to be perfect material for supporting live performance and film.

I recently viewed his documentaries on Ralph Vaughan Williams and Leonard Cohen and they are outstanding as well. The Stravinsky film has a lot of footage of the composer himself and appearances by Jean Cocteau, George Balanchine, Nadia Boulanger and Stravinsky's wife and children, among others. If you have any interest in Stravinsky, this is recommended without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I had originally watched this back in 1990. I recently got it as a gift. This is a fantastic film! It covers Stravinsky's entire long life and touches on his major works. There are clips of interviews with Stravinsky (and him conducting his music) through out the film as well as his children and other intimates of his (including the somewhat controversial Robert Craft).A few other reviewers complained about the length (too long, not long enough), or the fact that the sound isn't up to today's digital standard. To me, none of that matters. It is amazing and fortunate to have so many spoken words by Stravinsky himself all in one movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best chips I've ever had","review":"These are indeed some of the best chips I've ever had, but there's a caveat. One of the types of chip in the bag is much harder than the rest, sometimes almost painfully hard if your teeth or gums catch it just right. It's the light, semi-translucent chip, the yuca I think. Anyway, this would be a 5-star product without a doubt if that chip was removed or replaced. The others though are worlds above any name-brand chips or potato chips out there. Another good thing is what it lacks; no artificial preservatives, no cholesterol, very little sodium and very little carbohydrates. They are certainly a welcome break from all the garbage sitting on store shelves, in taste and in health."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crunchy but too hard to eat","review":"The only thing good about this product is the packaging. The chips themselves are okay, not great. Very crunchy, but about 50% of the chips in the bags are very hard to chew on. They are as hard as rocks. I bought 12 bags a few months ago and still have about 5 left. For each bag, I can eat about 1/3 (those red and orange chips and taro are not too bad). The rest of the bag is thrown away because those translucent chips are as hard as rock. Maybe some people like this kind of chips. Do yourselves a favor and try some at the grocery first before buying in bulk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative chips, these are a winner!","review":"The last couple of months I've been buying the Terra Blue chips, in the small bags, Which is such a good idea, I like the fact I know how many calories i am eating, Well, Amazon was out of the Terra Blue so I thought I would give these a try and I am glad I did, They're very good, I like the variety of different chips in the bag, all which are yummy. Very yummy, And a super alternative to potato for those of us who are encouraged to rotate our foods, I'll definitely be reordering these, They're my favorite now,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greasy, Broken","review":"I thought I'd really found a great treat to eat, but all the bags in the case contained a lot of finely broken pieces, and the product is very greasy.

Also, they are very colorful which any cook knows is important when preparing food for others. Place a bowl of these on the table at your next BBQ and just wait for the compliments.

I wish I paid more attention to the size - 1 oz bags, not quite as good a deal as I thought. I was looking for the big bags. This is my fault, and it is still a good deal, but I would be happier if they were the big bags. The snack size bags are convenient and neat though. It would also help if they did not expire so soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like the taste","review":"I will say I like only SOME vegetables and this makes it easier for both myself and family to get more of or veggies into daily life, if not always on the dinner plate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product...just not in small packages!","review":"I love Terra chips...when they are in the big bags from the store...I ordered these expecting the same quality and it wasn't. The chips in these small bags (which were perfect for my lunch bag) were stale and tasteless. Some of the chips were too stale to comfortably chew.

This is also a great deal for them on subscribe and save when I compared it to the normal price I pay per bag in the store. The chips are yummy and taste natural. Some are very crunchy and a little hard to bite so I would not recommend these for elderly individuals or people who need or prefer softer food. My only issue with these chips is that they seem a little salty. Most people I let try them kept commenting on the sodium level as well. I kinda love salt, and don't plan on giving it up too much right now, so they are great to me! The sodium is just a warning for those who are watching their intake to do their research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"The dryer does its job, but it started to deform just after the 2nd use.

The dryer is still functional, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than I expected","review":"I bought the shoe dryer to dry bike shoes during a wet 6 day bike trip and the dryers worked like a charm. It took about three hours to dry one pair of thoroughly wet shoes. The dryers are compact and does not require much room to pack if you're traveling with it. The dryers also did not appear to run hot and I did not fear of it overheating. I don't know how it would work for much larger and denser feet coverings like ski or snowboard boots but I imagine that it could handle it but just take a longer time to dry the items."},{"rating":"1","title":"total waste of time/money - 2 pairs never worked","review":"I bought the Circulator from another vendor but thought to share my experience of the product.

That said, I found next to nothing on these subjects:- Natural or organic hair care products- Styling your own hair- Braiding- Updos- Long hair: care, concerns, special needs or special warnings- Identifying quality implements and caring for implements- Uses of hair accessories you may not be familiar with (eg rats, hair sticks, etc.)There was a lot of very basic and general information on many subjects including hair loss, alopecia, etc., and it is a good general sourcebook. However if you are looking for in-depth, or even just detailed, treatments of your areas of interest, look elsewhere. I returned this book after reading it through very gently."},{"rating":"1","title":"too basic","review":"I agree with the other reviewer, way too basic for me. May be good for the average person who knows little about hair. I thought most of the information was common knowledge, and there were even a few things in there that were just wrong. They mention over and over again that you have to wash your hair every day, which is completely the wrong thing to do for many people. I got this as an addition to a series of more hair books, brushing up on my hair knowledge after 7 years of doing hair professionally, and I learned nothing from this book. I found myself skipping through it, it was boring to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"the marriage-go-round","review":"Two views of what damage infidelity within marriages can do.For readers who relish the complexities of two people making a life together, the dialogues ring true & the situations are both delicately funny & seriously telling.Anyone who has been espoused will know of what this author writes, & will find some interesting information to take back to their marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"The uncertainity of our relationships","review":"In Her Absenceby Antonio Munoz Molinaas well asConjugal Loveby Alberto Moraviaare far better books in analyzing relationships. Both involve a self-conscious narrator who analyzes his relationship - often seeing it with the clarity that could have saved it but also often deluding himself to keep it going when it is obvious (to the reader) that it is over.I should say that though I tried to read Marriage, I did not read it completely. I skipped through the first novella and found it mildly interesting but it did not engage me enough to keep at it. I returned the book unread even though it was a short novel and I had picked it up at the library because I was intrigued by the theme of the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"Where do I begin? I only read this book because the back cover contained a good review by Frank McCourt, who must have been either drunk or insane when he wrote it.The writing in this story is no different from a Harlequin Romance. The characters are unbelievable, the plots are stupid, and the characters are so utterly unlikeable that you actually relish in their misery.The second novella concerns a raving idiot of a husband who cannot get over his wife's \\"infidelity\\". They go for counselling, he ends up on Prozac and Viagra, and acts like a moron every chance he gets. And his wife didn't even have an affair - she had a one-night stand consisting of oral sex.What this author doesn't know about men is a lot: her male character is essentially a woman named David. No man acts, thinks, or behaves, quite like this. This author is obviously connected - how else can such trite fluff be published?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Read","review":"Journalist Anne Fleming writes a lovely, engaging book on marriage, which is actually two longer stories. The first is about a woman whose husband is dying; and the second story is about a man who becomes completely unhinged after his wife's brief affair. Most enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marriage:A Duet","review":"I HATED this book. OK, to be fair, I only whizzed through the second novella hoping against hope that it might get better. I found it to have gratuitous sex and language, \\"gratuitous materialism\\" AND completely run of the mill writing. I am greatly surprised that the author, an experienced reporter, who appears on the Jim Lehrer News Hour could write such totally soap operaish prose. The writing reminds me more of ad copy or the script for a not very good R rated movie. I mean who cares about all the yuppie accoutrements of the main protagonists--the \\"cashmere jacket\\", the de rigueur Jeep, the trendy jobs, et cetera ad nauseum. I thought Fleming's original premise about the devastation adultery can wreak on a marriage an interesting one but I found her, upon reading, to have nothing important to say. This is NOT Anna Karenina by any stretch of the imagination.Shallow.

Several people in our household have tried this product and we all have the same problem. The plunger in the middle stays in the down position for easy storage. The way to get it to stay in this position is to push the rubber button in the middle of the plunger. You push it again to get it to return to the up and ready position. Here's the problem. To get the basket spinning inside you push the plunger down but without pushing the rubber button in the middle. This proves to be not that easy of a task. If you don't push the plunger down just right, and it does take some pressure to do this, the plunger stays in the down and locked position since your hand tends to push on the button. You then have to push the button to release it and start all over again. Quite a faulty design."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinks","review":"Not worth the price we paid.

Then, it just broke after about 2 months of using it. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"Awful design with the plunger for spinning the bowl attached to the bowl (instead of to the lid). The problem with this is you have a column (the plunger) down through the bowl, making it harder to fill the bowl and reducing the space. Moreover, the instructions recommend never submerging the plunger, which means you can't wash the lettuce in the spinner before spinning. We tried to use this for a few weeks, then just ended up throwing it out. Much prefer our old OXO spinner (which we were trying to replace with this because the bowl cracked after a few years of use)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound too good to be true?

Anyone who knows this band, is aware of lead singer Rob Thomas' powerful vocal skills, and hearing these songs performed like this is almost too much to bear (acoustic versions of songs always lend a feel of intimacy that you don't get from normal recorded tunes).

The album crosses an amazing spectrum of electronica styles, without dwelling on a sound for more than a single song. More melody-based than JXL's debut, with finer tracks all round. Standout tracks are 'Legion', with its Rap/acoustic guitar juxtapose, electronic-punk anthem 'Power of big slacks', single 'Zerotonine', and dance-hall big beat 'Love like razorblade'. It's not all pulse-racing beats, however: Tracks like 'Synasthesia', with its mellow-out orchestral interlude, or 'Black Jack', which sets an instructional gambling tape to a degenerating drum beat and droning samples, allow you to regain your composture - momentarily, at least.

This book could bring back icebox/refridgerator cakes! Aside from the fact that you enter a time warp just by reading it, there are some hidden gems in here. If you're looking to make a dessert that no one has seen before or that inspires questions like \\"how did you make this?\\", and \\"can I have the recipe?\\", buy this book. The Honolulu Pineapple Cake is delicious. So are the pound cakes. The collection of fillings and sauces for cakes is lovely.I have not tried any of the non-dessert recipes, and therefore have nothing to say about them.The one tragedy of this cookbook is that most of these recipes credit the woman who submitted them by using her husbands name. \\"Mrs. John so and so\\". I understand that it was customary to do this at the time, but it seems tragic that the names of these women have seemingly been lost in time......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"This was not what I was hoping for.

Specifically because the package was labeled \\"non latex\\", and I thought I'd try a sponge applicator instead of the cosmetic brushes I normally use. I'd been wanting to get the smooth application of a sponge, but have been wary to try one because I have an allergy to latex. So when I saw the \\"non latex\\" label, thought I'd give it a try. The sponge applied my foundation makeup beautifully & looked great! However, the next morning I had a typical \\"latex reaction\\" (dermatitis) all over my face: rough, itchy skin. Which is still continuing 6 days later so far. I'm taking an antihistimine which helps a little.

It's hard to overstate the awfulness of this piece of overpriced garbage. To spin dry salad, you need to push the center handle down firmly to build up momentum--but you need to stop just short of pushing the handle all the way down, or it will lock up in its \\"storage\\" position. It's even more awkward than it sounds.On the plus side, the construction of the spinner is as lousy as the design, so the gears stripped within a matter of weeks, preventing me from having to pretend for very long that I liked my present. Now, we own a $35 plastic salad bowl with a red base.The complete idiots who designed and approved this product on need to find a new line of work. As a result of this experience, I will never trust a Kitchen Aid product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two broken in a row - total junk","review":"I had one of these salad spinners and it worked for a while until one day the latch that keeps the center piece locked down broke. It would still spin but you couldn't put the center peice down and so it wouldn't fit in my fridge or cabinets anymore. I figured I just had a dud so I bought another one. MY MISTAKE! A few months later the new one broke in exactly the same way. I probably only used it 10 times before it failed.This is a total piece of junk, and I will never buy a Kitchenaid product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment in a trusted brand name","review":"I have several KitchenAid products, which I am very pleased with, so when I was looking for a salad spinner at Kohl's, I went right for this one. The pump is awkward: when I pushed down on it, It would spin slightly then stop. I tried several times to use less pressure, but it would mostly either not spin at all or give a short spin then stop. Occasionally I'd get the right amount of force for the pump and got a god spin going, then realized I had to use more force than I expected (tiring my arm out) and I had to worry about pushing the pump down too far and hitting the brake. Too much effort is required for a product of this brand and price. After two weeks, it stopped spinning altogether!. This didn't function any better than the cheap one I bought at WalMart, that lasted much longer than this did. The only redeeming quality is that it \\"looks nice.\\" Very frustrating and disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I bought this a couple of years ago and I've never gotten it to work properly. Mine appears to remain functional but it's a struggle to assemble and use correctly and even when I manage it, it doesn't do a very good job drying anything. An exercise in kitchen frustration. Other reviewers have enumerated this product's many flaws more eloquently than I could - heed them and do not buy this salad spinner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Without A Doubt The Worst Piece of Trash Ever","review":"This salad spinner makes me physically angry when I attempt to use it, and I don't generally have anger control issues or problems shrugging off the little stuff. I have never used a more poorly designed piece of kitchen junk than this salad spinner. The lettuce, cabbage and spinach I've attempted to spin dry have as much water on them after spinning as before. The bowl is easily unbalanced and starts to rock around on the counter. It's impossible to spin with enough speed to accomplish anything - if you attempt to push harder on the pump mechanism thingy, ominous cracking and groaning noises emanate from the lid. Did ANYONE test this thing before offering it for sale? I'm embarrassed for KitchenAid. Returning mine as soon as possible and buying a Zyliss. My old Zyliss Spinner lasted for 5 years and worked great. I have no idea what possessed me to try something new in the salad spinner department, but I've learned my lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a couple months","review":"I think I maybe got 3 months use out of this POS before it stripped out.

The plunger suddenly started making a grinding noise as the internal teeth started missing and failing to spin the bowl. This thing is engineered very poorly and made with flimsy plastic.

Wish I had seen it sooner. blah... it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!!!","review":"I had to throw it away after it failed to spin anymore. It would just click when trying to spin lettuce.

I recycle and reuse these as bathroom cups in place of disposable paper \\"Dixie\\" cups and I couldn't count the number of times they've been washed in the same dishwasher with no \\"casualties\\".I didn't buy this from Amazon, but as I was looking for a new salad spinner, I saw the Kitchenaid one and decided to rate it.

Nothing does much spinning any longer (it's broken).It is now in the trash.Did I mention this $22 dollar product lasted for about a month?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money and can cause injuries","review":"I felt I totally wasted my money on this product.

Mine eventually broke and I ended up injuring my wrist because it gave away when I was pressing down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst KitchenAid product I've used","review":"I really wanted to like this salad spinner, but ended up hating it. The spinning mechanism is very difficult to use, because the plunger locks if you push too hard. And the lettuce doesn't get very dry. Also, the plunger soaks up water, so I was always afraid that dirty water could be getting into the lettuce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst $ I've spent in a long time","review":"This product never would like down like it was supposed to, and the stem would spring up suddenely with such force that stuff in my fridge was knocked over and broken.

His contention is that, quite the opposite, mankind's own libertarian principles will lend to tyranny, not biological experimentation - and he maintains that the human ability to different between feeling good and being good will remain as a stop gate to biotechnology's fast pace. An intriguing discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawler Had Nothing To Say Worth Reading In the Book","review":"We read this in an honors Political Science class on Darwinism in politics.It was pretty universal that the entire premise of his argument was pure bologna. No one in the class, including the professor, thought his argument held any weight. It was a boring read and hard to get through once you realized Lawler was just blowing steam, which was pretty quickly.Larry Arnhart, who holds the opposite viewpoint, gave a much more convincing argument on the subject. The class much preferred his book over Lawler's. I would recommend his book over Lawler's any day, but if you want to compare the two, then go ahead and purchase this book.

She wants to kill the brothers and take over the family, while the brothers must battle the very commission of which they are members, and do so while avoiding the FBI, and their sister's ruthless henchmen!

That being said, I didnt rate the book a 5 because I didnt like everything about it. I tried to like the Grace Moore character. However, she was soooo weepy, desperate, and weak. If she was a bit more tough and smart she could have been a pretty interesting character (the idea was quite good but poorly executed).Princess on the other hand was flawlessly developed. She showed up every now and then to create havoc but was in my opinion was the most interesting character. Thoroughly smooth and viciously ruthless. I hope she plays a bigger part in the other two books.Word of advice to Teri, kindly kill off the Grace Moore character or have her take a few notes from Princess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is She Serious?????","review":"After reading Dutch by Teri Woods, I assumed all of her books would be great. This was a serious mistake on my part...It was totally horrible. The plots and the situations that took place were totally unbelievable. There were times when I literally was ready to throw the book out but I am one to read through the entire novel to give it a chance. I was disappointed in the author for this one. I wasn't sure if this was just a little something to pass the time before Dutch III came out but I personally feel like it should never have been written. The crazy thing is part two reads a little better, but not much.

The Reigns family was a clan that didn't play, even when it came to blood relatives. The death and torture scenes in this book are quite graphic. It was hard to believe the over-the-top rivalry between Princess and her brothers Damien and Dante. I didn't quite grasp how the competition between the three Reigns siblings began or why.The book left out key information about the parents of the lead characters, and whether or not the parents actually spearheaded this very diversified portfolio of family businesses. I also wondered about the younger brother Dajon and where he fit into the picture.In Deadly Reigns II, I hope there is some insight on the FBI agent's daughter, Stacia Ness, and how she ended up on the wrong side of the law. I also didn't really buy the bond between Damien and Grace/Jonel; their romance seemed out of place and not genuine."},{"rating":"2","title":"She did it","review":"Reading some of the reviews,i thought this book was going to be boring like Dutch, but i absolutely loved this read, and am planning on getting the next to the triology.

Come on Terry, we are all waiting for that conclusion!!!Anyway, this is the start of another good series. Lots of murder and madness going on. The siblings are off the hook with the way they treat each other! The undercover agent is just plain stupid for the way she acts sometimes.

Honey was right, this book is definitely no comparison to Teri's other books. Instead of creating a new story, Teri should have given the public what we're waiting for...Dutch III!!! Why introduce us to a whole new cast of characters when we're anxious to know what's about to pop off with Dutch & Angel. What's good Teri?

I appreciate your use of authentic dialogue and not insulting the intelligence of your youthful (and not so yourthful readers) by resorting to the political correctness that is such a plague in our society today. I could feel the turmoil in Alice's mind and heart as she struggled with her conflicting desires to be accepted and popular and true to her own heart. You have a rare gift for characterization. I look forward to your future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sacred journey","review":"This is a \\"must read\\" precious little book! While the title suggests it is a children's story, as an adult I found the book's message deep and touching. The book is about our spiritual journey and how even the most seemingly insignificant being--in this case a little raindrop--is connected to the All. The little raindrop is not only an important part of the Whole but is also capable of enlightenment through its life journey. If read to a child, you will have to explain many things and I guess that is precisely the hidden gift of this book. In its seemingly simple storyline, The Little Raindrop hides great spiritual wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maria","review":"This is a great book for understanding how the world of Marketing research and data analisis work.

Now, all I'll have to do is plug in this card right? Wrong! Where are the compatible portable devices as advertised? Maybe I'm missing something here... Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Often overlooked, this was one of Anthrax's best albums. (Being that it came out in 1995, I think it was overwhelmed by all the crappy grunge music that was clogging up hard rock radio)Belo, Bush, Ian and Benante didn't seem to mind not having a true \\"lead guitarist\\" at this time... and their songs didn't really need it. They did just find tapping into the talent of Paul Crook (who I believe would end up on the road with them on the \\"442\\" tour) and the classic wild wailings of close friend Dimebag Darrel (who would \\"fill in\\" for 'Thrax up until his untimely death).Buy this, turn it up and rock the crap OUT!!

However, while these recipes are awesome, most are not for the novice cook. They work best for individual who have experience with the unique caribbean ingredients and experience with the cooking technigues (quick sauteeing with cream!)Overall...I would say that 1/3 of the recipes can be made by anyone...1/3 with a little experience and 1/3 by the dedicated gourment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great source for entertainment ideas","review":"I live a couple of blocks from the restaurant, but the place is so popular I rarely go anymore.

There is a nice narrative about the practice of santeria and interesting stories about the history of the restaurant and the recipes. At the back are musical suggestions for adding the festive touch to your dinner.The recipes must be authentic, since there's an abundance of sherry and cream. My favorites in the restaurant are the plantains and black beans and the mushrooms. So far I've only made the sangria from the book. Was it good!

I also recall that combination of Sorrels and Phillips as he performed his classic \\"Starlight On The Rails\\" and she his also classic \\"If I Could Be The Rain\\" on a PBS documentary honoring the Café Lena' s in Saratoga, New York, a place that I am also very familiar with for many personal and musical reasons. Of note here: it should be remembered that Rosalie saved, literally, many of the compositions that Utah left helter-skelter around the country in his \\"bumming\\" days.So what is good here?

It is the poorest DVD I have ever seen. Think of recording snowy PBS stations over the air, and you get the idea. Outdoor scenes suffer the worst from snow, dark images, and general fuzziness.

The overall production is a standout for what's here, but the songs on this effort are far too varied and confused to constitute a solid album. Shadow, you could have really used some editing on this release.

When it did, I eagerly put it on, looking forward to introducing my girlfriend to Shadow and give her a taste of what we were in for in person.All I can say is I hope he draws on older material when he performs live, because this album is a wreck, an effort to take a lot of mediocre rappers and beats and make them sound original and impressive.

Even though both utilize turntables, I don't think there are many people in this world that would list these 2 artists in their top five. But that's fine...

I thought DJ Shadow was better than this, but obviously not. We can only hope he will redeem himself one day, I will certainly forgive him.This sort of music seems just like the pop trash on the 'urban' Hip-hop/R&B; stations, you know, where a song is played a few times an hour for a month, then is never heard again?'Endtroducing' is a decade old and still sounds great today (and Amazon sales rank of #1,350 in music).

We all know rap takes no talent, and even with Shadow's beats in the background that fact has not changed.

Still, there was one good song amidst the complete garbage: \\"Artifact\\", and what do you know, it's an instrumental with NO RAP. DJ Shadow should have made the whole album in that style, but no.Final rating: 1 1/2 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"I purchased this album with such high hopes and when I popped it in to give it a listen, I was sadly disappointed.

The picture quality and editing is very poor. The play by play radio caller's iritating voice (Eli Gold) was added to the footage afterwards. Halftime interviews with head coach Nick Saban is shot from behind from a distance. The DVD contains footages from every game of the 2009 season, however, you can only play one highlight at a time, does not play continuous. This is not a professionally made DVD with a nice naration, and footages from TV televised actions. There is no excitment what so ever. I feel the DVD is a bad production.

The people come across as individual people, not a monolithic species to be observed and catalogued in an anthropological zoo.It takes some time to get through and I never did keep track of which tribe was which and who's trying to kill whom, but you really feel for her and she really brings you into her world.

BUT, what seemed like a helpful book was seriously marred by repeated inconsistencies between the diagrams and the description of the diagrams in the text. \\"km/hr\\" in the text are shown as \\"km/m\\" in the diagram; symbols are different; in one case, the text clearly meant to refer to \\"t\\" [the symbol for time] but the symbol was just dropped [\\"if it moves for hours\\" instead of \\"if it moves for t hours\\"]. Plus, the author does a good job of setting up the basic explanations, but when giving example problems, he relies on the diagrams to explain the solutions. Since the diagrams are often wrong or inconsistent, it left me a little muddled. I'm not sure how anyone made it through this book. Didn't they have a copy editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos and forced humor","review":"At first blush, in the bookstore, this seemed like a great book--but the typos in chapter 2 are infuriating!

The book was decent until about the 3rd or 4th chapter. There were many mistakes in the calculations which made it hard to learn. Was I wrong or was the book wrong? I don't know because the appendix only comes with (sometimes incorrect) answers and not explanations! This book also has a few formulas that were either a) incorrectly followed by the author or b) very complicated with steps that are not obvious THAT THE AUTHOR SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED. Seriously, the book is called The Complete Idiot's Guide to Physics. The author should assume that the reader knows very little about the subject. Don't buy this book.

It is very dated - although the CD date is 1998, the original recording is from the 70's. And it sounds like it. The solists' voices have a nice quality, but unfortunately their vibrato is so overbearing I have a hard time listening to it. The tenor soloist is particularly bad in this regard. The instruments have a somewhat heavy sound to them, so I wonder if they are modern rather than historical. For anyone like myself who has been spoiled by listening to great early music ensembles of the last couple of decades, this recording won't fit the bill.

How does she so keenly know what the author knows, and does not know? All we have is the text. The text clearly shows how little Gerardi knows about that which he is writing. He has never been to Africa and never fired a Wembley, and as Mr. Taxton so rightly puts it, who in God's name would seek out a Wembley in our time? This book reads like a \\"This Boy's Life\\" adapted by someone who grew up fantasizing on National Geographic magazine issues. By the way, where's the second edition of any of Gerardi's books? Nowhere. Quite."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for the title; you've got to love a girl!","review":"Gerardi has never been to Africa and it shows. Completely unconvincing. Shoddy details make plot twists deadweight, as when yon \\"hero\\" has a Wembley pistol blow up in his face. Well, Gerardi doesn't have the guy CLEAN the weapon during the entire novel. Anybody who's actually handled small-arms in Africa knows that if you don't clean a pistol in the tropics, particularly a WWI-era weapon, you're dancing with the Devil himself. But I give him a star for the title, as any reference to women always cheers my spirits. Back to Cormac McCarthy for me, who not only takes the imagination to places Gerardi does not dare to venture, but the Master from West Texas also knows of which he speaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hated this book . . . but I loved it at the same time","review":"Maybe due to simple youth and inexperience, this book made me horribly sad. I cried for about an hour at the end. I felt especially bad for Cricket. She was a bad person, but it was the only life she had ever known, and she wanted to escape from it, but needed to wait so she could escape without looking back. I felt sad for Wilson too. I mean, he was the good guy and he did what he thought was right and it was right, obviously, but to just forget? It seems so sad.Anyway, the writing style was pretty good, easy to follow, unlike some older classics that can't say anything straight out, and with a really clever blend of reality and fiction. The characters were believable, and though it was a really sad, brutal story, I got snapped at three times in one class today for surreptitiously picking up this book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I Can Say Is, \\"Wow!\\"","review":"What a great book!

Compact enough for travel as it fits into the boots.Compared to the other DryFast two-horned solid-plastic dryer, this one is much for compact for travel.My main complaint is the power adapter, which is the older transformer type (9 volt 0.5 amp DC), that works only on 120 volts -- a problem for international travel.

David discusses the need for role changes between women and men, especially when children come along. She sensitively deals with a mother's needs for other work and personal time, as well as her concern to meet her child's needs. Her stories include examples of parents as partners. The tone is warm, personal, humorous and practical.Such a wide ranging introductory book may help the reader choose topics for more in depth exploration in other sources.

My husband was extremely uncomfortable watching what should be intimate for other people on a TV screen. We do not disagree with the information in the documentary, however we found that watching other couples births to help us be intimate in our son's birth as insane as watching porn to help or sex lives.

Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible!!!!","review":"i am so elated that we found this video! my first birth experience was sadly not remembered due to multiple interventions followed by complications. in short it was incredibly traumatic for both my son and i. i vowed if i ever got pregnant again i would do it differently. i watched what babies want, the business of being born and now orgasmic birth. All of which have resonated with my intuition that this is truly what every mother and baby wants. i am so excited to be having a home birth and i feel these movies portray that incredibly well. I recommend this to anyone thinking of having a baby or looking for more answers for their following births. for me it was an A++++ film, i think i teared up six times or more.

The biggest gaping hole in the book is the fact that the author was not able to interview either Gamble or Huff. It also reads like a college textbook - dull writing style.

At best this book should be selling for a measly $10. Thankfully, I have the disposable income to take this hit and chalk it up to another learning experience.

I now know that it it best used as the name applies as a rocker, chopping knife. I would 100 percent recommend it as part of your knife set.

The knife is solid and has a nice weight to it. Sharp as a razor as soon as it arrived. My only complaint was there was a small dent on the cutting edge of the blade. The dent was easily removed by a bit of sharpening so it was much of a problem but I would have much rather it not have been there in the first place.

My husband is Mr. Fix-it, so I thought it would be fun for him to give to our new grandson. The set is adorable. The tools are plush toys, and perfectly safe for a baby. The hammer is a rattle, the wrench is a squeaky toy, and the screwdriver makes crinkly sounds when you squeeze it (or chew on it). The plush tools are all machine washable, but the toolbox itself is only surface washable. The tool box closes with a velcro closure. The toolbox is 6\\" long, 3\\" high, and 3\\" deep.

I find it completely underwhelming. I have listened to it many times to see if I am missing something; I am a HUGE Wilco fan and with most of the band playing behind Tim, I thought it would get better with every listen.My number one reason for not liking this Album is Tim's voice.

The songs are skillfully crafted and he sings with a voice that echoes of early Dylan. I must admit I purchased this album when I heard he was being backed by Wilco minus Jeff Tweedy,an incredible band in their own right; but Easton needs very little help as he sings about love that has gone awry and the consequences. This album sets a definitive mood throughout its 11 tracks and will stand the test of time better than most of the albums in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"Sickeningly generic, creativityless emo.

Along with Junior Walker, he blazed a trail for all those who were to follow and their musicianship is still being copied today. Such greatness deserves a great biography and I'm afraid this is not it. The enthusiuasm of the author comes across but the book is short on content and research. The faded photographs of King Curtis's old LP covers is testament to the short cuts that have been made. If you are interested in the basic background to the King Curtis story then I suppose this may be a starting point but you may be well advised to wait until a better researched biography is brought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational toy for older children","review":"Got this for my son last Christmas.

I had to force myself to keep reading; the main problem was extremely weak character development. At the end of the book, I still didn't feel I knew either Jordan or Amanda, except that they both craved sex, and more sex, and more sex. There were very few conversations of the type that lets you get to know a person - instead, they just had more sex, and even the sex scenes were just blatant, not sensual. Amanda was so weak-willed, I wanted to shake her. Jordan COULD have been interesting, if we'd ever gotten a chance to know him. A sad disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No character... just sex","review":"I'm only half way through this book and I'm disgusted. Actually, I've been disgusted almost from the first page. Amanda is weak - always giving into Jordan's sex drive - which is his answer to everything. There's been no discussion other than they don't want to talk. Even the sex scenes leave me flat - to the point where I'm just skipping over the repeated scenes. So sad, because normally I love Linda Lael Miller.

I sit with my daughter when she plays with them and when shes tired of it I pack them and place them where she cant access them easily. They are small enough that a child can put it in their mouth so it can be dangerous if left unsupervised.This is actually meant for 3 years and up. Other than that its a fun colorful toy .

They are awesome because they not only provide you with solid, easy-to-understand definitions, but sentences that really give you a good understanding of the words. Even when I taught for Kaplan(SAT test prep) in college, I always secretly recommended these particular books to my students.

It has good white paper and each words has a full page. Remebering was easy too, but forgetting was not hard.

Already thousands of children and adolescents have been forced to register as sexual offenders for committing harmless acts such as groping or even pre-marital kissing.Is consensually kissing someone a couple years under an arbitrary age of consent is really \\"sinful\\"? Is it really the job of government to punish this sin with a lifetime sentence?All thinking people must not fall for the absurd \\"save the children from sin\\" bandwagon movement that is spreading sexual dysfunction and fascism. A fascist police state becomes absolutely necessary when the age of consent is higher than puberty. The natural age of consent is puberty. The ultimate goal of the child purity movement is to outlaw premarital sex.

But, beware, the book is not a good one and author doesn’t really know much what she is talking about. Maybe all the mayhem around this book is because, by the time it was published, some of its statements seemed bold and even daring politically incorrect.

The only reason I don't give it 5+ stars is the way it is written. This is a book that every parent should read, but the author's word selection (have a dictionary at hand) and sentence structure (average sentence is probably 25 words) cause it to read more like a post-graduate text, instead of a common sense reality check for today's parents, teachers, legislators, and sexuality educators. I'm afraid that it is above the reading level for most of the parents who REALLY need to read it, and that is truly a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harmful to all people","review":"Thanks to this book, more teenagers and children are going to have so-called \\"protected\\" sex and end up with STDs. I remember my public school sex education well, and nowhere in it was I informed that condoms are not made of steel and that they don't protext from certain diseases (such as genital warts) AT ALL. This book is another effort to sexualize children at younger and younger ages. The people who make fun of abstinence make ME laugh. I didn't have to have an AIDs test before my wedding."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Clothes","review":"This book is no more than postmodernist claptrap, masquerading as science. The positive attention it's garnered is due more to the desire of academics and pseudo-intellectuals (too often synonymous) to appear au courant and grab a ride on the PC bandwagon than to any redeeming social value or merit contained within its covers.Levine's thesis simply reemphasizes how far we as a society have sunk, and how little distance we have to go before we strike rock bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be real,,, the good response is NO","review":"...Please be careful. This book does not advance the rights or responsibilities of kids, women, or men. We as a society have not moved to the point where we need to profess extravagent claims that serve to bolster our deviant impulses. If we do not protect the most vulnerable amoung us,,, our kids,,, then why protect any ?This is thinly veiled hypocrisy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexanderphiles will follow \\"In The Shadow Of Alexander\\"","review":"This is a fiction story set around Alexander The Great and told from the perspective of one of his soldiers, Thessius. It's a great read because it is a fiction story which incorporates true events in the life of the young king.I am quite certain that this book will be of interest to both those who are followers of Alexander The Great and those who are knew to the legend.Well worth reading this summer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And this is about.....what?","review":"Very disappointed. Superficial characters and story with little historical detail. Main theme seems to be the extent of homosexual relationships/tendencies among thewarriors up to and including Alexander. Most every chapter ends on such a note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading the reviews on this novel, I was very excited to read In the Shadow of Alexander. However, after reading the book, I was quite disappointed. I thought I had purchased a historical novel. Instead, it seemed that I purchased a romance novel about homosexual love. I would have preferred more history with detailed battle scenes. The various love scenes were a bit too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit!","review":"Installed these to my AMC Javelin's 360 V8, and everything is just fine.

This product does not provide turn-by-turn directions. When I called the Garmin software help line, the suggestion was made to purchase the Metroguide USA product since it had all functions of R&R and more. Seems the R&R was the first software product offered and is for low memory units (1mb). This is an obsolete product and since I opened the package--it cannot be returned. If you have a newer GPS unit with more than a mb of memory, don't bother with this software. It is not designed for your unit. Don't look for this info in the manual--it's not there. Call the help line and you may find your money was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOK OUT","review":"I have a Legend and wanted additional map details for my unit - so I purchased this software. Well, I got all the map details but no functionality. The documentation is bad and so is the online help.

After two years the impeller shaft broke and since it is the only moving part it's easily replaceable. However, in both cases, the old impeller damaged the internal bearing and housing so the replacement impeller is useless. My emails to Danner Mfg go unanswered...The pump is used in a pond only 6 months out of the year, then it is removed, cleaned, and stored in my basement until the following summer. I won't buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging concert from Muti, with many unusual items","review":"My mind is pretty clear about why I don't buy Muti recordings. He's an arrogant stuffed tuxedo who hasn't had a musical idea worth a second thought, and he looks as if his face would fall off if he dared to smile. Over the years Muti has been allowed to conduct a vast range of music, none of it with any real distinction. And yet...This 2004 New Year's concert contains a trove of Strauss and Lanner rarities (at least a dozen items would be known only to specialist collectors), which Muti conducts nicely, if not exactly with high good humor. The Vienna Phil. has a long relationship with Muti, and they play comfortably and well for him. Muti doesn't drive the music hard for once, and he even allows a lilt here and there. I am taking no pains to disguise my dislike of his music-making, but this was a refreshingly low-key day with the Strausses, and I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice.","review":"Nice design, well executed, good price. Put these on the rear of my road bike, seems to match the wheel curvature reasonably well. Haven't used much, but seem to work well. The actual rubber is very, very stiff, not rubbery at all, I guess they know what they're doing. These should last a long time. Almost too big to fit in the brakes, the brakes had to be let all the way out.

Now in an updated and expanded third edition (fifty percent of the material is new), all of the pertinent laws regulating homeless people in public places are covered, as well as the results of federal funding, along with housing, health issues, and state policies affecting the homeless. An essential, core reference for academic, governmental, advocacy organization, and community library reference collections, American Homelessness also offers a series of insights into homelessness in Western Europe, Canada, and Australia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immerse into your Self","review":"Aquarelly is a collaboration work of Hans Joachim Roedelius, Nicola Alesini and Fabio Capanni. 12 out of 14 tracks were recorded live at the VI Music Festival in Lanzarote, in Spain. In this record, Roedelius, using his unique style of playing the piano and keyboards, creates a world of sophisticated contemporary sound patterns that could be applied to define the notion of natural beauty. Try listening to this music in the ear-phones while taking a European late autumn evening walk. Listening to this record at home, you can find yourself immersed in a mismeric atmosphere of subtle ambience. Recommended especially to introverts and to all Roedelius fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a tinkerer","review":"I'm not the most mechanically inclined person around.

It was the best gift. The recipes in this book contain the diverse soul of San Francisco. My favorites are the Tamale Pie, the Chicken in Spice Laden Coconut Sauce, and the Chicken Lime Soup-but everything I have tried has been good. The cookie section in particular is amazing. If like I was you are home sick for The City, or if you just want a reliable source of creative and tasty recipes, this book is well worth buying, and will become one of the dog-eared favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good collection of the Chronicle's recipes...","review":"This was a great cookbook with a lot of good recipes from the S.F.

Some of the recipes are time consuming, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author typifies the hubris of his generation","review":"On the Today Show, David Obst said his Baby Boomers did so much they left nothing for subsequent generations to accomplish... How fascinating that the Greeks who produced democracy, mathematics, philosophy, rhetoric, theatre and epic storytelling, never had such a high opinion of themselves; the framers of the Renaissance who brought these ideas back from the dark ages never made such claims. They did have a concept called hubris, Mr. Obst might consider. When you develop that high an opinion of yourself, fate, god, nemesis, karma or your own overblown ego is going to take you down a peg. Watch out, Boomers, there's an iceberg out there with your name on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"He was at all the right places and knew all the key players.","review":"Obst was in all the right places and knew all of the key players from the 60's and 70's. He explains how strange it was to grow up in the 50's practicing the 'duck and cover' drills at school, and fearing death at any moment. As a early baby boomer myself, many memories were brought back about those times. I want my in-laws to read his book to understand why people my age are so different from other earlier and later groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that must be read by those under 30.","review":"This book was written by a man who has done and seen things that most of us only witness in the movies.

However, my baby is worth it, so I say have these toys all over the house to keep your cat happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful recipes, made healthier in River Road III","review":"I guess I would give this book more like 4 1/2 stars. My fiance is from New Orleans and I wanted to serve more native dishes but in a healthier way. This book is just the ticket. The only thing I'd change is a few more of the \\"traditional\\" recipes but what is in there is very good with easy-to-follow directions. I especially like the way it shows you the difference between the original and lighter recipes. My future mother in law has used the book for years and really likes it. I can't wait to try more recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I was born and raised in New Orleans, and the River Road Recipes Collection is on every family member's shelf. My grandmother passed down her original copy when I went away to college,and now I use Healthy Collection for my family. It is very easy to follow and everything I have tried so far is amazing.

I recommend this to anyone looking to eat healthy meals that are restaurant quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just In Time for Christmas","review":"The cookbook is great and the most amazing thing is that it came in time for Christmas. I had procrastinated and thought that I could just \\"run in\\" to the other bookstores and pick up a copy for my daughter for Christmas.

And how many of us had younger siblings that were pests? This is a great story of two brothers in this situation. But in the end find mutual respect for each other. William Steig's fairy tale magic leaves children wanting this story read over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not amusing for the target audience","review":"The story background here should provide an imaginative tale...a medieval family, alchemy, and a shrinking brother. But the actual story line won't amuse children from the age of 4 - 8. The problem with the book is a somewhat mean-spirited story and it's rather dull unfolding. Some other reviewers on this page were amused and even flattered by Steig's 'respect' for his audience's intellectual curiosity insofar as he uses an advanced vocabulary in the story. Permit me to ask you. Would the early reader in your family go to the dictionary when he encounters 'big' words on each page? Would his attention hold, if 50% of the book had to be explained by an adult because it was obscure to him... and uninteresting besides?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you need to pay more?","review":"I bought this to replace my older dropped-too-many-times jamb level. It's accurate, has a lifetime warranty and cost 1/3 what a Stabila would cost. Not only that, it has crisper edges which makes it easier to use to draw a line accurately and the bubble extends from line to line which is easier to read than many other levels I've seen.I'm not so sold on the blue vials making it easier to read...I think that's a marketing idea but it doesn't seem to be a problem at least.I didn't realize Empire wouldn't sell a 32\\" level separately so now if I want a \\"jamb set\\" I'd have to go buy someone elses 32\\" level. Seems kind of dumb on their part but I contacted them and that's what they told me.So all in all, this is well worth the price.Note; I paid 56$ at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Amante's \\"Humbled\\" CD","review":"This is Michael's third album and he goes in a different, and very personal, direction this time. Michael's selection of religious music shows off his voice in a very positive way. He had performed a few of these songs in concert and his fans were begging him to make the album. His orchestra leader, Herb Bernstein, did a superb job on the arrangements on the ablum. If you like Michael Amante, you will find this album to be his best so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"slanted portrayal of the state of reseach","review":"This book is rather naive and overoptimimistic with respect to the state of consciousness research today. It's not that bad of a book for its point of view, but given the title a more balanced approach would be more appropriate.

No single work of art could possibly do so, but this book comes close, evoking such fond and strong memories and visions of India, that this has, over the past decade, become THE one book I would encourage people to go through, to get a mesmerizing glimpse of India.Mainly pictorial, and close to being a coffee table book (not hardbound though and the binding could be a lot better...), it is by far the best book to encompass a range of visual images including India's landscape, its people, and hints of its cultural past and present.

For most people, some basic math is a requisite to appreciating the profound insights of this book. Humans in their modern physical form lived as hunters and gatherers in nomadic tribal groups for 190,000 years, then began farming, settling down, and dramatically altering the normal ontogeny just in the last 10,000 years. The last 5% of our history should never be appraised without consideration of the other 95%, something which this author understands. Shepard writing combines a scholarly erudition with a poetic and mythic literary style. This guys rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Informative; pretentiously abstract.","review":"With a reasonably good start, the book wavers in obscure directions; it tends to get judgmental about music appreciation, when it discusses works of different composers.

The two units appear similar on the surface, but I like this new one much better. Here's why:- External power supply is optional, not required.- Cable arrangement, esp. for the main keyboard and mouse is much more accessible.- Effortlessly handled one computer which had it's own monitor. My old KVM didn't like that set-up for some reason.- It seems to switch faster than my old KVM.I'm very pleased with this unit. It does exactly what I hoped it would do, which is pretty rare when so many subtle design decisions can undermine an otherwise good design.

I loved immersing myself in some of the familiar poems and passages from great works of literature and religion, but was also very struck by the more unusual selections like the Sioux prayer and Rumi poem. Some of the pieces are very personal and touching.The overal feel of the book is that one is sharing not just a deep grief with other people who are clearly walking the same path and sometimes grappling with the same difficulties, but also a deep and enduring love. Very uplifting and moving. I would definitely recommend it for anyone going through the grieving process."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific collection , what do you have to lose ?","review":"as noted elsewhere , these films are presented in their proper aspect ratios and are all fun classics . with todays' heavy reliance on CGI in sci-fi filmaking , these films are more than desirable , they're essential . all films have english subtitles ."},{"rating":"2","title":"sci-fi classics","review":"Received the item on time and was happy to see the quality of the DVD's.

I've read any number of ASP books written by people who don't know what they're talking about, but this one is definitely the very worst.

Being new to the subject, I thought I'd be better off with a more comprehensive offering.Was I wrong.

I do not agree that beginners should steer clear of this title, perhaps they should allow themselves more time to assimilate the material. The examples do a good job of illustrating the concepts in question.The only complaint I have (and a major one) is that there is no index of all the objects, methods, properties etc; otherwise it would have scored full points."},{"rating":"1","title":"ASP in a nutshell","review":"I picked up this book as my first ASP book ever!

However Star then berates the Chief Justice Rehnquist for subsequently affirming Miranda. All in all, the book falls far short or critically analyzing decisions the court made or the theories onvolved.

This was the fist KVM that I have owned that didn't have a hot key to switch between computers, but I thought that would be OK for a better quility KVM. This KVM was very poor and would loose the video setting ever 2 or 3 times I would switch between computers. It would take me from my high res setting back down to a old VGA mode of display and my display would be a mess and would only clear up after a reboot of the computer. There are far better KVMs for about half of this cost, and that do the job far better then this box does."},{"rating":"1","title":"flaky switches - beware","review":"I bought one of these from Amazon, and it worked well for a while.

Tech support tried some fixes, and when they didn't work, arranged to have a replacement sent out under warranty. The replacement unit has problems losing keystrokes on the Linux system.

Ideal for old school fans and followers of the Runaways, Pandoras, The Ramones and maybe Kitty (as I finally got to see the long-running all-female metal band play some dive here recently).

I am pleased that the temptation to digitally remaster was avoided as the imperfections of tape transferred to DVD just add to the patina of the collection.Yes the dialogue is dated and there is more than a little padding to stretch the stories to 50 minute episodes but these characteristics are of their time and add to the enjoyment of reminiscing about settling down to watch the 'Sunday Serial' after a classic British Sunday roast dinner.I say well done BBC for taking me back to my childhood and reminding me what adventure was before Connery burst on the scene as James Bond. 5 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic ..Not really","review":"This Classic BBC product is simply umwatchable. don't be fooled by the \\"positive\\" reviews it's awful...wish I could return mine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting lost world adventure","review":"In this adventure, your PCs (levels 6-8) are introduced into the deepest dungeon realm of them all - the Hollow World!

I don't know what they updated, but it wasn't their maps. I have never seen maps so out of date or a search engine that was so worthless. The only advantage that Garmin's software has over MS Streets and Trips or DeLorme's Street Atlas Deluxe is the ability to upload maps into the GPS, but what good is that if the maps aren't current?

Maazel can be a perverse interpreter--one almost expects it of him--but here he's behaving well, and his ability to make ensembles sound good is undeniable. Some say he has more podium technique than anyone else in his generation. Be that as it may, ths gorgeous-sounding recording also boasts demonstration-quality sonics. Overall, a definite winner.

I also think he was fair to all parties in the accident. The Italians made a wrong turn and were going too fast. The Swedish ship was in the wrong lane and her third officer captaining the bridge made some mistakes in judgement. Two ships that would have near missed each other collided with each other due to radar.This was an epic disaster alongside the Titanic. However, through valiant efforts of several passenger vessels, most of the crew and passengers were saved. However many of the Italian kitchen help fled first ahead of others when they got in lifeboats and fled the Andrea Doria.This is a great story about a disaster.

This can be very anonying if your out RV'ing or Off-Roading for the weekend or the week.So Garmin has fixed this problem by making a Cigarette Adapter and PC Interface cord that attaches to your Garmin GPS.Now you can cruise around all day with all of the features of your Garmin GPS turned on, and don't have to worry about the batteries dying. I think that is a big plus.My only complaint is that I wish the cord was longer. It's good length, but some how I feel that I am going to need a longer cord one day and it's going to annony me that it is not.So, if you drive alot with your Garmin GPS, get this and save money on batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin PC Interface Cable","review":"This item is an absolute must for operating your GPS unit out in the field when connected to a computer of some sort.

On a subsequent cast, the top section broke off about 4 inches above the joint. A clean break with no apparent stress. I contacted the company concerning the warranty and was told I would have to pay $20 each way ($40 total) to return the rod to them for examination to determine if the rod would be repaired under warranty, replaced or if they didn't think they were at fault. I decided that I would put the $40 towards the purchase two ugly sticks at $27.95 each"},{"rating":"2","title":"Un excelente libro para organizar sus finanzas","review":"Es un libro muy interesante, lo he recomendado a muchas personas que necesitan organizar su vida financiera, y balancera sus gastos, es una historia de facil lectura cuyo mensaje llega al lector con efectividad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toni Tennille can sing!","review":"This is a great cd--lush orchistration accompanied by Tennilles' soothing alto.

I was also relieved that there are position adjustments, so that an off center image can be centered by this box and the monitor. Some boxes force you to only use the monitor to adjust the image, which is not a great solution.The image quality is a little bit weak when using the RCA jack, but that is to be expected. I always use component connections for my PS2, so it was a bit jarring to get thrown back to the bad RCA connection.Edit - Now that I am using an S-video cable there is significant improvement over the picture quality. I would have much preferred component cables connections, however given that this is not a true HD converter, and the low cost, it is somewhat understandable.An excellent, dependable, small and functional unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"StarTech Game Jockey","review":"Was really easy to install and use.

The graphics felt ok .. nothing gr8 but I had to adjust my monitor settings. I don't have any problem with that (although I was disappointed since it meant changing the settings everytime you toggle between PC and PS2). Additionally, I would have liked longer cables. Thats fine too. The thing which really [ticked] me off is that when I connected my PC and monitor to the adapter, I was not able to get input from PS2. I tried but my monitor kept saying \\"no signal\\". Now this can be a problem with my monitor settings but it worked fine when I connected my PS2 separately. And the box said its just plug and play. Well I plugged and it didn't play. So its going back. I will have to pay restocking fee for this junk but atleast I will save 40 odd dollars.

It would cycle from 54 to 1 at any given time, regardless whether I used Windows, Intel or Belkin to control the wireless function. We have 3 notebooks, 2 that are about 60' away and one that's about 12' away. It doesn't matter which notebook I'm working with, the result is still the same.

But sadly, your lenses WILL NOT work the same way. This is due to the sensor chip not being full-frame (35mm). Had it been, It would have gotten 5 stars. Right now, your lenses are less wide in angle. This really defeats the purpose of it being compatible with EF lenses. Too bad. Canon almost had it for a great consumer camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is one major downside","review":"The 1.6x magnification. How does this work? Do we only see a smaller percentage of the frame, as I suspect, and therfore the resolution should be divided by 1.6 to give a true figues of 3.93 mega pixels. stil good, and all the positive features of the camera should not be overlooked, but it is very limiting. one of my favourite photographic techniques is to take a close up portrait with a wide angle lens. you can get a really interesting subject with a nice background too, but for a 28mm shot with this camera, you need a 17mm lens; for 24mm you need 14mm ... count the extra costs of these lenses (expensive) if you ever want to take a landscape shot again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the D10 go?","review":"So here I am in Portland, OR last week, I walk into Camera World and the guy tells me the Canon D10 has been discontinued.

This camera is really a great blend of the two. With all of the options available you can take as much control as you want over the exposure. The resolution is excellent. I found the real limitation of my old digital was the low resolution. For 4x6 prints it was great, but you really couldn't do much else. The 10D has over 6 megapixels, which give you much more flexibility in Photoshop. As a real SLR it can take any EOS lense. I have the 50/1.8 and the 24-85. I can't stress how great the quality of this camera is. From the magnesium case to the excellent software package, Canon really did this one right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent technology, one big disappointment","review":"Since there are tons of rave reviews about the features of this camera, I won't bother you with the details. Instead, I will tell you about the one HUGE letdown of this camera and the likes (Rebel, 20D): the 1.6x focal length factor. This means my dear 28-105 lens is now a sorry 45-170. To recoup the loss I'd have to spend $700 on a 17-40 4.0 lens. This is a consequence of using a small CCD. Cameras like the 1D with full-size 35mm CCD sell for over $4,000. I cannot wait for that price to go down. I also cannot help to wonder whether the focal reading of the Speedlite flashes will be correct (I own a 540EZ and discovered with dismay that it doesn't work in these cameras).I look at my A2 (still infatuated with it) and I wonder if I did the right thing.

Don't forget to take off the little protective caps.

That's the good news. The bad news is that it just does not snap securely into the socket like it is supposed to do and like any other optical cable I used before did. As the result, the cable keeps falling out, which fact is especially annoying when used with the downward-facing sockets in tight places (like the ones found on the back of flat screen TVs.) Be sure, it happens with the connectors on both ends of the cable, and it is definitely not a socket issue as other cables I used with the same sockets work just fine. In theory, I would have returned it with a zeal; in practice though don't think it is worth the hassle - all thanks to a strip of duct tape that keeps this marvel of craftsmanship reasonably secured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.

Helps to take the shock when I drop it! I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not that useful--Updated!","review":"I received this case with my new etrex Venture. If came in a bundle with the Mapsource software, a USB cable and a lanyard. However, on my unit at least, the belt clip slides into a pouch on the back of the unit. The first time down the trail, the case slipped off the belt clip and dropped softly to the ground. Not acceptable! It will provide protection for your unit and the screen, the buttons are accessible, but not being able to clip it *securely* to clothing or a pack limits it's usability.Update: I just received the Micropak case from GPS Outfitters (on Amazon but currently not being sold). It's a big improvement--a belt clip and a belt loop, pockets for accessories, a carry strap, attachment loop--and the Garmin etrex *with* the supplied case fits in it snug as a bug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case performs poorly","review":"After two weeks of using the Garmin Carrying Case I put it away, probably for good. The reason for this is that it just simply is not ergonomic. As you can see in the picture, the case butts right up against the menu button and also enter button for the Vista HCx making these buttons very difficult and frustrating to use. It is also very difficult to get the gps unit in and out of the case. It would have been better to have made a 'hard' case in which the unit was meant to be removed to be used. I bought a small 'fanny' pack to use instead for geocaching and just put the unit, sans case, in that; that works out better. I cannot recommend this case at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin Case","review":"I found this carrying case to be ok if you like cases, nothing great though.

It would go on but I could not get ar my scroll button easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"If this item is supposed to protect a Venture eTrex, it's weak. The upper side of the gps is NOT covered in the sides, just only a narrow area in the center.It's very easy to find sand or similar dirt between the gps screen and the case, that could be worse than having no protection at all. What about a more tighten design/material ?Even worse, the shape of this case seems to be for a different gps model, as it gets in the way of the ENTER/ROCKER key, that is for sure the most used buttom of all the device. This obstruction makes me remove de case almost every time I want to touch the enter/rocker key. A real disadvantage.The clip and the strap are good, but this case shoul be re-designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I felt this item was a waste of money and I sent it back. My GPS buttons were hard to use in this device and the velcro looks like it will wear out fast. I took some advice from other reviews and just put a smart phone skin protector on my GPS (cost $4). Now my screen is protected and not bulky like it was in this case. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not perfect","review":"This is a really nice way to protect a Garmin eTrex from such hazards as scratches, dirt, oils in your hand, etc. It does have one minor flaw, though - it reduces the satellite signal strength a bit, so you have to take it off when reception becomes marginal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes the GPS hard to read","review":"The case has a plastic window over the GPS display. Unfortunately, it makes the GPS harder to read, especially if the light is not ideal. Also, the window is a little too small, and tends to cover the top of the screen. Since two of the main menus are at the top of the screen, this is a problem. Although I would like the protection provided by the case, I find I can't use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite right for the Etrex Vista...","review":"This case is a great way to carry my Etrex Vista unit around in. It protects the screen with a plastic film, and has button holes that line up perfectly down the sides for my GPS unit. The belt clip makes it easy to carry while hiking as well.My complaint with the item is that there seems to be no easy way to use the \\"click stick\\" when it's in the case. Also, the Vista is mostly rubber on it's exterior, and sliding it in and out of the case is sometimes an excercise. I still recommend it if you are planning on carrying your GPS around and want to keep the screen safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy!","review":"Besides being useful for protection, I found another use for the velcro on the case. I stuck a piece of velcro to my car's dashboard and opened up the flap on the case and stuck it there. Voila! My Garmin now stays put while driving.My only complaint is that sometimes it's difficult to read the screen through the plastic, but I guess that's the price you must pay for having something covering the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cover","review":"I was a little skeptical of using this cover at first but since it came as part of the package deal I thought I would try it. Now I feel it is well worth it. What it gives you is protection from screen scratches and a belt clip for holding the gpsr hands free. In addition the padding gives you a better grip on the unit. You don't have to remove it to use the cable for downloads and all the buttons are uncovered. (You do have to remove it to install fresh batteries.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned Item","review":"The Garmin Vista is difficult to read without the clear plastic cover afforded by the carry case. When in the carry case, I could barely read the Vista's screen at all. The clear plastic that goes over the Garmin screen was too shiney and difficult to see through when out in the sun. Also, the case is bulky and significantly increases the size of the Vista. I sent it back. Thanks to Amazon for having such good customer service and allowing returns including shipping costs. I would have been very disappointed if I had been stuck with this carry case, as I would not use it. I would have given it zero stars, but a 1 is as low as it gets on the choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"wont fit 60CXS","review":"I order a 60CXS Garmin GPS and the Amazon website suggested this case for it which I ordered but it doesn't fit the GPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"stuped device - very basic","review":"It is just a compass not a navigator. it does not have maps and you cnnot navigate using this stuped device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing Case","review":"I used this case for 4 months. It has some good qualities--provides protection for my Etrex 30, easy access to buttons and acceptable window to the Etrex screen. I hang the GPS on my pack using a carabiner connected to the metal loop on the case. Yesterday, while I was hiking, the strap holding the metal loop broke and, unbeknownst to me, my GPS fell off my pack. Fortunately my friend was walking behind me and spotted my GPS on the ground and returned it to me. Otherwise my $400 GPS would have been lost forever. Do not trust the metal loop on the case. Failure after only 4 months suggests that this case is not well made."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"I bought this so i could clip my gps onto my backpack and lifejacket, worked great for a while but the small ring tore off after 5-10 uses. Not great for serious outdoor use. Hope i can find a heavier duty carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless.","review":"One review I read said that I would need a case and would not be able to live without it. I have never used it. The window is ridiculous and the case has no purpose, except for storage, and I still don't use it. Don't bother unless your \\"storage\\" involves the GPS being trounced around in a truck or something. I did buy laminating sheets and cut one to fit the screen of the GPS. This works fine and is cheap to replace when it gets scuffed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adaquate","review":"But the whole design of the top leaves much to be desired. You can get to the four way hat switch, but I'd have rather just had a hole in it instead of this sleeveless approach that leaves a lot of it exposed without adding more functionality. The top still gets in the way of the hat switch, which is the whole reason to have a hole there in the first place. Other than that the item quality is good and it's holding up. People that design this stuff should have to use it or use a prototype, this should have been caught at the design stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit the eTrex 20","review":"It said it would fit the eTrex 20 but it didn't. Was not impressed at all. Really they should make sure that the description tells what models it fits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit well","review":"The belt hook does not have a good catch, it would be easy to loose the GPS without noticing it happened. A slight change to the design could fix this issue (add a bit of a hook to the belt clip to snag on a belt or fabric). Secondly, the velcro flap is awkward. It would be easier to use if it went from the back, over the top, and attached to the front. This goes from the front, over the top, and hooks to the velcro on the back. Third, the button access is somewhat restricted. If a little more cut out for the buttons was there it would help a lot. Probably returning it. I have ordered something else that I think will work better. I like the quality of the construction over all. Final thought, I would rather not have the plastic window. If I were keeping it I think I would cut it out. It's too glossy and restricts the view of the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits like a glove","review":"The carrying case fits nicely with the GPS unit and leaves the unit fully operational. Belt clip is molded into the case so if it breaks you will need to replace complete case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several major design flaws, for a eTrex Legend","review":"1. Unless any case is completely dirt proof, no part of the case should be able to touch a unit's screen. Including a clear window. Dirt/dust WILL get in, and will get rubbed by the window to scratch the screen. Rather one should apply a stick-on screen protector, and then not cover the screen further.2. The clear window is just another source of reflections, and as others have said, haze or fog. I suppose it could be unsewn, removed, and the case significantly re-sewn. Just cutting the window out would leave scratchy edges.3. This case is too tight for the Legend's thickness = c. 1.18\\" max. It can be forced to stretch over, but batteries do have to be changed, and then that is not convenient. Inserting my Legend, with its screen protector, started to scrape the protector off.I'm glad some other people like this case, but it doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Protective Case","review":"The case fits the Garmin eTrex Vista HCx like a glove. It has a nice feel to it and the buttons, of the GPS, can be operated with absolutely no problem. Highly recommended for those who want to protect their, Garmin eTrex Vista HCx GPS due to rough use."},{"rating":"2","title":"One complaint","review":"This product is basically a good one. My only complaint was that the clear plastic that you look through to see the unit often fogged up in wet weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good cover","review":"Overall a good protective cover. My only gripe is the dust/dirt/whatever that gets inside through the large openings at the top. You just have to take the unit out of the case from time to time to clean off the screen, otherwise it's working great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protect Your Investment","review":"The Garmin eTrex Carry Case works very well with my Garmin eTrex Vista C. It is easy to see the screen, work the controls, and most importantly, it protects the GPS from those accidental drops that can occur on the trail. I dropped my GPS recently while on a hike. It tumbled several feet down some rocks. I thought it would be damaged, but the case did an excellent job of protecting it. Not a scratch. It's worth the money to protect your investment... just remember to attach the teather that came with the GPS to the back of the carry case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hiker of the great NW...","review":"I think this case is very nice. You can access all the buttons and the click stick with ease, the only problem is it seems to slide down into the case every now and again and you have to pull it up a little to access some of the buttons, and it also slightly blocks the satalite. Other than that, its a great thing to have for hiking around and such! And it works great on a pest or backpack...Its a great thing to have if you have anywere between a Etrex, or a Etrex Vista! It works great on my Legend and thats what I use it for, I also recomend the attackment for a bike, thats a very nice thing for running around town, or if your on vacation and have your bike with you!Enjoy! And buy yourself a Vista or Legend! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Make The Case For This Case!","review":"I'm an avid inline skater and I use a Garmin eTrex Venture to determine distance, speed, etc. The belt clip on this case allows me to clip the unit onto my left elbow pad strap.

The information is very old, the prices are completely out of whack, and someone in Russia took a look at the book and said it is virtually a carbon copy of the last edition. The details on Siberia were pathetic. It was clear that the writer had only been to a very few places and some information was outright incorrect.

This is the case with this nitty-gritty Lonley Planet guide to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. I've found the information for Ukraine far less useful than in Linda Hodges' guide to Ukraine. Lonley Planet treats Russia, Ukraine and Belarus as if it still were part of the same country it was 11 years ago. All three countries have their unique pluses and minuses, and, lets face it, deserve their own individual guides. The reader is not being made aware enough and therefore does not really appreciate the fact that, for example, Russia and Ukraine are very different from one another, and any similarities are far less common than once assumed.What I liked best about the Lonley Planet guide,and the same is true for their other guides, are the details about the obscure and less-known hotels and restaurants."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Comprehensive Guide To Travel In The FSU Available!","review":"I can think of no other guide with as much useful, detailed information on travel in the Former-Soviet Union than what Nick Selby and the gang at Lonely Planet have assembled in this updated-version of the (outstanding) original, 1996 edition.

If you love music this book is a nice look at these artists and how they were represented and in many cases what has happened to them. All well written thanks to Arthur Arron's great translation of sids stories.

I use this light in a foundry so it's one of the tougher work environments, and after about 6 months of use, the holster has ripped apart from repeated use. The seals don't keep out the dust which I regularly find inside, and I occasionally need to open it up and clean the contacts. The on/off switch jams, causing the light to flicker, or not turn on until I've wacked it on an I-beam a few times.

FORZA was the first opera I was in at the old Metropolitan Opera House. I was in the first act when Leonora's father accidently gets shot. When he fell to the floor, I was there to prop him up so he could curse his daughter with his dying breath. Since that time I've probably probably seen a dozen performances of this opera and appeared in around forty productions if you count dress rehearsals. I know what FORZA should sound like and this performance dosn't come close. There is absolutely no sense of urgency or danger which inspires great singing. Who are these vocalists in this cast? Are they on their way up or down? Even the orchestra is \\"chamber size\\" and never gets inspired by Verdi's thrilling music. I actually watched the DVD twice in three days and it simply never worked for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected Delight","review":"Rita's writing is delightful.

These characters go to New York to boost their careers and well moving to a city like the bog apple wasn't helping their careers at all they all end up at being comedians.My favorite part of the book is when Ursula \`s mother comes to New York to visit and Ursula brings her mother along.

The tale of an aspiring comedian, Molly Solomon, the plot takes turns that are at once unsurprising and familiar. The brief glimpses we have of Molly's act are funny, but seem out of proportion with the fame she eventually achieves. Since Rudner uses the '80s as her setting, she manages only to redo the most obvious material. if you must, get it from the library or *very* cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"This needs to be a movie.....","review":"I thought Tickled Pink was a great story about women, friendships, priorities and life. Rudner kept me interested and excited throughout. The characters and the way they intertwined amazed me. I personally think it would make a great movie.I found myself enthralled in the book and losing track of time while reading. I finished it in less than a day. As soon as I finished, I made sure it was the next book my friend would pick up! Tickled Pink kept me wanting to learn more about Mindy, Ursula and all the characters mixed in between their lives. The comedy was well placed and the characters were very well defined! I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star for Verdi","review":"There are some excellent voices on this recording of Rigoletto. Jan Peerce was one of my favorite singers (and also of Arturo Toscanini) with his clarion voice and dashing stage presentation. Leonard Warren was another artist who could always give pleasure with his mellow baritone. This CD gives an extra bonus in the form of recordings from La Forza del Destino, La Traviata, Simon Boccanegra and Otello. I was not taken so much by Erna Berger. She failed to give the impression of a naive young girl. I see that I have not said a whole lot about this particular recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected surprise","review":"How strange that this wonderfully surprising recording of Rigoletto is barely acknowledged, or at least mentionned a little, compared to the Sutherland-Pavarotti-Milnes and the Callas-DiStefano-Gobbi versions of this amazing opera (both must haves by the way).It struck me as far better than the two other recordings mentionned above by its emotion and sensitivity. The voices are wonderful and the singers extremely well cast, but added to that is a sort of intimacy to the recording. It feels like compared to the two others the singing and music are not being thrown at us to try and draw us in. With Cellini it's more comparable to a moving story being told in a whisper, like a heartfelt confession.Very moving, focused on expressing emotions which makes it an exceptionnal Rigoletto!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought i had heard the best......and then........","review":"I had thought i had heard the best when i had heard the young Pavarotti, Sutherland and the great Sherrill Milnes record this opera. Was i wrong! Warren is passionate and powerful, Peerce is in strong voice, passionate, a wonderful sound to listen to, and the soprano has a wonderful sound, Erna Berger. Gilda is a role that i never really connect with, as all she really does is stand there and make pretty sounds and be all pure and virginal. However, with Erna Berger making those sounds, it is a pleasure to listen to her! She really does sound like the character, and the whole recording is just a wonder to listen to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be useful as a very basic intro to the subject.","review":"This two-volume set is a collection of articles originally published in \\"Ceramic Industry\\". At least 80% of the articles were published in the 1920's and 1930's, and so are quite dated in their approaches and conclusions. However, if an historical reference is useful, or if you are new to the field of raw materials for the glass industry, these articles are still quite useful in spite of their age. Good introduction to minerals mining and their use in the glass industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute idiocy","review":"I've only been in college for a semester and I'm so sick of ultra far-right groups complaining about how \\"liberal\\" colleges are. Their basic solutions seem to be that we should convert all colleges to christian-based ones.Not once during my time here have I heard on my professors tell students that there is no god, or that Marxist-Socialism is the only way to live. We have intelligent student debates with liberal, conservative and libertarian students, as well as students who aren't even American citizens.No one \\"indoctrinates\\" anyone in college. You have a mind of your own. Think for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Propaganda","review":"You'd have to be a moron to not see through this book.

Ostensibly for the do-it-yourselfer, too much needed detail is left out. Far more photos are needed, especially to illustrate different models. That might just mean more versions of these books are needed. Just to illustrate what I mean, I recently changed the water pump on my Taurus. Nowhere in the manual does it mention the need to remove idler pulleys, move the alternator, remove the right wheel to access bolts, or the odd fasteners Ford uses. No hints are given for gaining access or for the most efficient procedures to get to the pump. Again and again, terms are used without explanation or illustration. Haynes is probably no worse than other repair manuals, but it's consistently disappointing in being no better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"This book was just what I needed, and at a better price than most to all auto parts stores. I have bought a couple books from tenesseebookman mainly for college but this is the first auto book I've bought from him. Always high quality books, nothing less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as previous edition...","review":"This book is the same as the previous edition with only the title on the cover being different. In other words, it doesn't cover anything for models in years 2000-2005. Worse, the book mainly covers the 12 valve engine, even though most Tauruses and Sables are equip with the 24 valve Duratec engine. The only useful info in the book are the specs given such as torque and capacity. Otherwise, it's pretty useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be.","review":"The book may be useful for older models, however I would not recommend purchasing this book if you have an 05 with DOHC engine. The book barely covers it and has very few photos of that engine in the car. I purchased this book trying to get a good description of plug replacement in my 05 Sable DOHC. The dealer wants nearly $300 to change the plugs. The intake plenum has to be removed to even get to the back three. This book doesn't even talk about the configuration my engine has with individual coil packs and there are NO photos at all of my engine in that section. This is the 1st automotive book I have bought in many years and if this is indicative of what has become of Hayne's manuals, I won't be purchasing any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second hand car manuals","review":"I needed a manual for my son's car and since it is an older car I figured I would look at used manuals.

Way too much respect for authority garbage. This video is like a cat without claws... or a man without balls. I had to fast forward through most of this one. Unfortunately the director of this dvd thought people would be interested in what these guys have to say. I couldn't care less. I just want to see the movement. Like every cool thing in the world people would rather talk about it than do it. The world needs more Parkour and more videos documenting it. Next time more action less lip service. Too bad cause all the athletes are talented. Hearing them blabber about it only stole from the beauty of their skills. Also, get a few songs. The same damn song plays through the whole movie! Nice try.....to bad tryin' is cryin'. This vid is like a move that could've been epic ,but bails hard in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected","review":"I have used Avery mailing labels for almost 20 years.

The adhesive is strong and quite durable which allows me to use them for many applications other than addressing envelopes - labeling the breakers in our church \\"fuse box\\" for one example.Avery products are reliable, and the quality has not changed for many years. I recommend them without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"More About the Nez Perce, Less About the Missionaries Please","review":"Really I would rate this book at 4 stars if Amazon would let us. It is a good book, but, at least for me, it does not quite make it to 5. I felt a little too much time was spent on the history of the missionaries sent to the Nez Perce lands. I do realize though that this was an important event that caused a rift in the tribe, so it needed to be covered. When I was reading the bits about the lives of the missionaries, the book started to bog down. I was more interested in learning about the Nez Perce than the settlers. Other than that, I thought the book was good, and well written. I will definitely be reading more on the Nez Perce in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"studio mix, studio band","review":"When I read the other reviews I figured this had to be a must have cd. The players are good but I hear no dynamics (mp,ff etc.)The rhythm section plays at the same dynamic through out the album. The arrangements are somewhat interesting at times but give me the Basie band with Sammy Nestico charts. I grew up listening to Buddy Rich, Stan Kenton, Herman, Ellington & Basie.When an album is mixed now the two main instruments you hear are bass and drums. What about the 3rd trumpet, the bass bone, the 2nd tenor? Ahhh, lost in the mix...and also lost is the excitement a hot big band can create."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swingin' for the Fences","review":"Gordon Goodwin is a new and amazing talent in jazz composition. Every track on this CD is well written, well played, and well recorded. From the opening measures of Sing Sang Sung, to the funky, A Few Good Men, this disc captures the listener like no other recording. The band roars right through to the end and the soloists are simply amazing. Goodwin has put together an amazing group of musicians such as Arturo Sandoval, Eddie Daniels, Carl Verheyen, Andy Martin, and others. The music is simply beyond words and I eagerly await his next recording. This is a must-have for any jazz aficionado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do this more often, Gordon!","review":"This CD is an excellent collection of some of jazz's finest musicians and their contemporay interpretation of what swing music is supposed to be.\\"Sing Sang Sung\\" is a marvelous version of the old Benny Goodman classic, and \\"Bach 2 Part Invention in D Minor\\" is as good as it gets.Order this one now--I guarantee you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbeliveable","review":"My dad bought this DVD and I didn't want to hear it, but now I can't stop listening to it. It is sooooo cool! I want to play trumpet now and maybe the drums. When the DVD is on our stereo I like to pretend I'm playing with the band because it sounds like you are sitting with them. My dad and mom are happy because now we have something we all like to listen to. I hope Mr. Goodwin will make more music. I'm gonna tell all my friends to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Phat Band","review":"This is one of the best records I have ever heard. I usually use my DVD player to watch movies and didn't even know it could play music until this experience.Music in six channels is an incredible experience! I felt as though I was in the room with the band. Forget stereo - this is it forever for me. I just wish there were more albums available.This record is far more than a Big Band - it has elements of up tempo swing and latin influences. All with a contemporary feel. The sometimes sudden change in styles is more than compensated by the quality of the superior quality of the music and the stellar performances of the high profile players.After I was finished being blown away by the music I then discovered all of the other things on this disk - bios, music charts, composers commentary and even a making of the record video.Amazing, Amazing, Amazing ! Bring on more music like this on DVD - I'm in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD audio","review":"Man, this is killer!The CD of him is awesome, then to get it in 5.1 makes it 1000 times better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not receive DVD Audio format disc, and condition was not as stated.","review":"The listing clearly stated this was a DVD Audio disc. However, what I received instead was the DVD Video version recorded in Dolby and DTS - not in DVD Audio, which was the whole purpose of the purchase. Also, the stated condition was 'like new' when actual condition was good at best, as the playback surface was covered with small scratches. Otherwise, the album itself, especially the actual DVD Audio version, makes for some excellent high-end stereo and multi-channel audio demos."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"Another great collection from Gordon and his Big Phat Band!

I'm not much of a fan of the ballads, but everything else is just so cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great music, poor sound quality","review":"I was really disappointed with the quality of the recording. There is a lot of hiss. It sounds like it was taken from a cassette. Couldn't someone remaster it before releasing it for sale? If it were circulating as a bootleg I would grade it a low B. The band is hot, but it is hard to get the full feel because of the dampened sound. The Filmore East concert remains their best live recording IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Recording of a Great Concert","review":"I was excited to hear that this album was going to be released. However, after it arrived and I listened to it a few times my excitment dwindled due to the poor sound recording.

Go back in time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this sound quality is too abysmal to overlook","review":"Let me say upfront that I love the ABB and Duane in particular, so I was very excited when this arrived in the mail today. A few weeks back I had finally acquired the import/SACD version of Fillmore East and couldn't be happier with it.

I love the Grayson's strong family loyalty and characters who have strong values that help shape their decisions. I loved that respect, honor and love can overcome all with work and determination. My only disappointment was the graphic nature of the love scenes. It actually detracted from the story for me. I get the passion and desire between the Boyd and Claire and appreciate that aspect of the story, but would have appreciated even more, if there had been a bit more left to the imagination. While the Grayson Brothers books were all well written with compelling characters that I loved with great plot twists that held my attention, I doubt I will read more from Wendy Lindstom because of the overly graphic nature of the love scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lips that Ouch Mine","review":"I read all Four of the Grayson Brothers books.

Bugsy Siegel was never sentenced to death (at least not by any court of law). He was shot to death by the mob in 1947 in Hollywood. The \\"Bugsy\\" who actually said the things quoted in the book was Martin \\"Buggsy\\" (spelled with two G's) Goldtsein, who went to the chair at Sing Sing in 1941.

They all have some form of pepper-based irritant that draws blood to the area, and something like menthol that gives a sensation of cooling. They work pretty well for the dull, localized pain of aching muscles, not so well with sharp pains from injuries.This is the main brand I use because I like the peppermint smell. Some of them are quite bad smelling, which just seems unnecessary. Why subject yourself (and others) to that when this one smells good?I recommend applying this with some inexpensive disposable gloves, though. Otherwise it will get on your hands and one wrong touch to your face or other sensitive areas will be painful.Sean P.

I'm not sure how much this antenna would be even over the standard antenna.I set this antenna up with my Hawking router and found it couldn't even pass through a few drywall walls without losing most of the singal.

I can get a working signal with this when none of the other antennae work well (or at all). 90 degree horizontal and vertical coverage.My only complaint is the cable is a bit thin, and I put some duct tape on the antenna to support the cable where it enters the antenna, as I was concerned to flexing here over time might cause the cable to break but it looks like it would be easy to replace if that happen - should get less cable less with a thicker cable anyway.Very simple antenna, outstanding results, reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Signal Strength Throughout My Condo","review":"My Condo is about 900 square feet. My wife likes to use her laptop on the kitchen table which is pretty far from my wireless router. Her average signal strength was about 60-70% which I suspected was the cause of the jitter and pausing she experienced while watching streaming video. Also, since there are 9 other wireless networks in range of ours, we experience random disconnects from our router. In an attempt to drown out the neighbor's networks, I bought this Antenna and mounted it up high in the corner of a room in the center of the condo. Amazingly, no matter which room I'm in, my laptops report a 100% signal strength and all the connectivity issues seemed to be resolved, even the jitter with streaming video. I'm pleasantly surprised at how well this antenna works. My only complaint with this product is that the housing for the antenna feels/looks a little cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Improvement","review":"I did thorough testing before and after installing this antenna.

The Hawking is the best in terms of real world gains as shown on speedtest.net, however, it can also be the WORST depending on placement. As it is directional, you may have to do a lot of tweaking in terms of the direction. The Alfa omni just works but is a tad slower than the best speeds available with the Hawking.

I've been fighting a interference problem according to my ISP. About 10 months ago my signal strength dropped from -8 db to -60 db. I called my ISP who checked my router and found the correct power was being supplied to the antennae. They said that interference was the most likely cause of the signal loss.

I wanted to get reception one floor below and many rooms over from the location of my wireless access point. After connecting the Hawking corner antenna to my D-Link DI-614+ access point, I hardly gained any range - although throughput may have increased a little.I would highly recommend a repeater instead, such as the D-Link DWL-800AP+. It's a little more expensive (~$68) but you get so much more bang for your buck. A repeater is a smart little box full of electronics vs. the little bit of metal and plastic you get with the antenna. I am happily using the network downstairs in my home at high speeds with the D-Link repeater and no Hawking directional antenna.

That also means that setting up my WiFi network was going to be extremely difficult.Up until the point that I bought this antenna, I spent a total of $400 trying to get all my signal strength bars up to max, but rather, ended up getting mediocre connectivity, with occasional connection drops.After installing the antenna, I get perfect signal, without the use of any repeaters in between. Hawkings is truly the best IMHO, especially when the quality of home/office networking gear is going to sh**.

One friend brought his Katadyn pump and I brought this MSR. Both filters provided clean and clear water (though it's hard not to in the mountains of Montana), but his Katadyn was much much much faster than this pump. Pumping at regular speeds, he was able to fill three 32 oz bottles in the time it took me to fill one. By the end of the trip, everyone, including myself, was using his pump exclusively. It has yet to be seen how well his filter holds up vs mine and how well the product itself stands up to the abuse of being stuffed in a backpack over and over again. However, based on what I know now about the speed alone, if I could make the choice all over again, I'd go with the Katadyn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful!","review":"This product is very helpful if you wish to play your djembe while sitting. It's sturdy, and with the rubber coating, it offers the drum a bit of protection from scratches.

Barry plays left field and has to run after a fly ball that he drops but no one sees and he pretends he caught it so they win the game. Barry's sister and some other people know that Barry did not really catch the ball. A boy from the other team named Alec finds a toy that belongs to Barry's brother and does not want to give it back. He tells Barry that he has to hit two homeruns in the next game to get it back. If Barry strikes out twice, Alec gets to keep the toy. Barry hits one homerun and strikes out one time but when he hits a triple and misses second base he feels bad and lets the other team tag him out. Even though Barry did not hit the two homeruns, Alec gives the toy back because Barry told the truth about missing second base. It was not about who won the game but about Barry telling the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deceptively Simple Little Book","review":"In addition to being a warm, poetic piece of writing, Kick It with Gusto is above all pragmatic.

Who has the energy to pore over lengthy treatises on the finer points of manic depressive disorder when it's all one can do to get out of bed in the morning? On the surface, much of what Sutz has to say in this wonderful little book may seem too trite or too simplistic to be effective. But take it from me: Kick It With Gusto is helpful. It is accessible. It is often beautiful.

Just crummy all the way around. Given the VERY high cost of this item, I was amazed at the poor quality. Never again will I buy a Furi product.

Written from stories told by Patkotak himself before he passed on to his reward and from stories recounted by his children, this is an excellent account of the tribulations of a Christian essentially alone in the culture of his birth. The book gives a remarkable view of the Alaska native culture, often in Patkotak's own words, and demonstrates the dichotomy between animism, based in fear, and Christianity, based in God's grace and love.Ms. Rodli's decades in the mission field in Northern Alaska and Greenland have clearly given her first-hand knowledge of the peoples and problems of the Northern cultures.

Mason almost falls victom to this as hard as his old Traffic friend Winwood. This album betrays Dave Mason's ability and everything he tried to portray as a young artist. When i listen to this album my ears cringe at Mason's use of a drum machine. (He should just have called up his old friend Jim Capaldi. Although maybe not as popular as Winwood and Mason, Capaldi has never forgot his \\"rock\\" roots.) Compared to Mason's Traffic stuff or Alone Together, this seems like a different artist. If you are a fan of Mason's earlier stuff, dont even bother to listen to a sound sample of Two Hearts. If you are a fan of Mason's later 70's stuff, listening to a sound sample may not give you an earache. However, this album is really meant for a 80's fan who enjoys listening to machines rather than actual music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this one","review":"Dave Mason's energy, style, passion, and musical brillance are no where to be found on this light-weight, late-80s recording.

I have always thought of Andy McCoy at the creative mind behind Hanoi and was not too crazy about Not Fakin' It (the only Monroe solo CD I ever heard before this). But this is one killer CD. I swear if this was more well known it would be much bigger. Monroe plays all guitars on this and while there is no over the top guitar playing here, it's perfect and impressive. The CD sounds amazing. The only down points: 1) while this is a great version of Self Destruction Blues, I never like artists remaking their own stuff. 2) Not Bad For a White Boy, while a cool title is a lame song. But otherwise, I swear this CD is amazing. Too bad it's so hard to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real thing!","review":"I didn't know much about Michael Monroe before this album. After I heard it I just wanted more. Michael Monroe plays real simple and honest rock & roll. If you like bands like Rolling Stones, Guns 'N' Roses or something heavier \\"Life Gets You Dirty\\" is the best choice for you. Actually \\"Life Gets You Dirty\\" is rare album nowadays. It should sound like old, but it's fresh! And that's rock & roll ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Win 2000","review":"Although the description states that this game is compatible with Windows in general, it does not work with Win 2000, and I would bet NT or XP. The infogrames site only lists 95/98. Since the infogrames site does not list Trivial pursuit as an active title, having just an agreement to support it with Hasbro, its erstwhile maker, I would not expect that they will do anything about updating it to support current Windows systems anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cazwell gets it right","review":"This first release by the artist Cazwell is less an album and more an EP of what he has to hopefully offer more of in the future. The first 7 tracks found here are his originals, then the following 8 are remixes and instrumental versions. Cazwell's voice lends itself easily to the genre and he obviously has talent I hope will not be pigeon-holed into the \\"gay rapper\\" catagory which unfortunatly holds many artists from moving into more deserving success. I am not generally a big fan of rap, however Cazwell transends this by adding in elements of old school hip-hop and disco, throwing in a few guests such as Amanda Lapore, makes it more interesting and listenable. I'm looking forward to see if Cazwell delivers again with a full fledged album. If this EP is any indication, he's got the skills for making of some fun, down and dirty music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borderland Jaguars- Southwest Natural History At Its' Best!","review":"Borderland Jaguars is the latest in a series of excellent books by David Brown documenting the natural history of the large carnivores of the southwest including the Mexican wolf and the grizzly bear. This book on jaguars documents their presence on both sides of the border to include Arizona, New,Mexico, and Sonora, Mexico. It is extremely well written, and is accompanied by excellent historical photographs of jaguars from both sides of the border. The last chapter on a conservation plan for borderland jaguars is extremely practical and highly realistic. David Brown and his co-author Carlos Lopez Gonzales are highly qualified wildlife biologists who have devoted themselves to the study of this charismatic large carnivore of the borderlands. Whether you be a professional in the wildlife field or naturalist by choice, this book will greatly enhance your knowledge of one of the most spectacular large predators of the Southwest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Schenker MS 2000: Dreams & Expressions","review":"Very good instrumental CD.

The recording sounds very different compared to most instrumental albums. It doesn't have a whole lot of power to it. It is like sitting in the recording studio listening to the band play their music. The drums sound real quiet, while the guitar is right in front of you. It sounds like a cheap studio recording. Another thing is that the songs are very short except the last 3 or 4. It is basically a continous song all the way through tracks 1-16. I really don't want to bash the album just because of the recording, the music rocks I just want more power, more crispness to the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slingo","review":"Fun game, we already had this game but couldnt find it so I ordered another one.

At first I was surprised (disappointed?) at what a commercial sound it seemed to have - THEN I listened a little more. This is a very good CD. The songs are lyrically very strong, 22 Steps is my favorite. Many reviewers have commented on his voice, some friends have asked Is that Bono? New U2? No this is not a U2 album! Frankly, Andy Stochansky has his own intelligent voice and a wonderfully accessible sound. A very enjoyable album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked","review":"I just saw Andy perform live this past weekend, and was blown out of the water! I had heard Ani mention Mr. Stochansky on \\"Living in Clip\\" and was interested to see what he was putting out now. After the show I got to talk to Andy and he signed my CD, and now I really couldn't take it out of my CD player if I wanted to. I highly recommend this album, especially \\"Here nor There,\\" \\"22 Steps,\\" and \\"Everest.\\" The music is refreshing, positive, calming, and contemplative all at the same time. And I always have more respect for people who write and play their own stuff, and Mr. Stochansky is a genius in this department. I am also impressed with his ability to step out of his own point of view, and write lyrics from another perspective besides his own. His lyrics are very inspiring.Go buy this CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Andy's stock will rise.","review":"Andy Stochansky rocked the house in his performance at St. Ambrose University. Upon taking the stage the crowd was a little reserved and not sure what to expect. Yet, as soon as Andy strummed his first cord and began to sing everyone was taken back. The song which stood out the most to me was \\"22 Steps\\" a nice melody with lyrics that would impress even the most weathered listener. Andy put on a great set, and was met with loud clapping and cheering from the crowd. Once his set was over I talked to Andy about \\"Five Star Motel\\" and he was a really nice guy.

It starts out okay--if you're from the \\"incomplete sentences are art\\" school of literary thought.

The plot seems derived from old movies (oaters mostly), the story itself boiled over Faulkner. And that's my gripe. Lent should lay off the Faulkner imitation and find out who HE is. Faulkner's done his time, and we don't need to see him paroled. To those reviewers who were transported by this particular novel--and that appears to be most of them--I suggest the Snopes Trilogy.To tell the truth, until I read this I thought Pynchon's Mason and Dixon wasn't much. Even when I didn't like it, I had to admit it was hysterical. That's something else Lent could use: humor. It's a hallmark of American letters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I enjoy historical fiction. However this book was very disappointing. Under the guise of being \\"mysterious\\" the characters are poorly developed. The story line has potential but never goes anywhere. Most of the action seems very contrived and pointless. None of the characters is in any way sympathetic. By the end of the book I just wanted them all to die.Finally the writing is just plain bad. This book contains so many gramatical errors and poorly structured sentences that sometimes I had to read a section multiple times to figure out what the writer meant to say.I had to force myself to finish this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This one is very nice and has the back pocket like other paperblanks.

This book is not written for the average educated reader.Secondly, Jody Blazek keeps referring you to her other book that costs $250 to obtain more detail about what she is writing about. That annoyed me the most, the thought of paying $60 for an advertisement!Thirdly, she doesn't go into enough detail on many of the line items.

Good character development. An easy to digest writing style. The science is pretty hard as in fairly probable. It keeps you engrossed in the story. And the world building in this one is quite good. An adaptation of human culture in an alien environment years after earth became uninhabitable due to the sun.My only nits to pick would be a slightly rushed ending and not fleshing out the results and true motivations of the plans of some factions battling near the end of the ordeal.

After disliking other natural litters I decided to try one more. I'm assuming I bought Unscented (not sure, but it was the only variety at my small-town store).I agree with another reviewer. The pellets dissolve when peed on and since it's unscented, smell like pee. And, of course, the poo doesn't get covered by pellets (for whatever reason my cat won't dig in pellets to bury it...) so my bathroom ends up smelling like cat piss and poo. Actually, no, it ends up smelling like that but ENHANCED. And this is using a litter box with a front flap and air filter on the lid. Not even air freshener around the area helps. After a few days the box smells so bad I have to throw what SHOULD be a week's worth of pellets away.I was so fed up that I decided to go back to clay clump litter permanently.

'Yesterdays News' is recycled newspapers and I wanted to help the environment. 'Feline Pine' is 100% pure pine and the difference between these two is dramatic. We have never had any litter box odor with 'Feline Pine' and it's easy to clean. The only con is our cat tracks a small amount of the pellets.

After paying an exorbitant amount of money ([...]) to feel eco-friendly at the local Petsmart, I was thoroughly disappointed. This stuff is junk:-When a cat pees on it, it turns to mush and there's no way to get it out of the box. Which mean it stinks and you have to replace all the litter more often. That makes the product even MORE expensive.-Trying to hunt down feces in it is no easy task. The litter camouflages the feces because it's the same color.-Once you do sight a turd, you can't just scoop it up alone. It comes with a handful of litter.

But in fact they do absorb urine just as hoped/desired.Solids, another issue. They just sit on the surface, my cats won't or can't cover them up. So I was scooping more often, and because the pellets are quite large they don't pass through the slots on the scoop. Became quite the procedure to get just the solids and leave the pellets.Recently one of the cats stopped pooping in the box and used the carpet instead. I took this as a sign that he too was tired of this product that sounds so promising.

It's well documented and I did find some of the ideas, like vocational guidance pointing kids not where they'd be happiest but where they'll help the economy most, intriguing.Given what he had to write about, I can give it four stars...

Often the one thing often missing from a sexy and romantic ambience is appropriate music, and Bump N Grind 2 fills that role especially well. Appealing to a wide variety of audiences, it incorporates several generations of smooth tunes from Barry White, to Foxy Brown.

The video is well worth watching, however there is an over abundance of video effects that detract from my viewing experience. Please, BBC, stick with high quality images and artfully displayed scenes that add to the science and keep in mind that just because you have the ability to add special effects, doesn't mean it is a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice coverage of Brian Cox","review":"Although I enjoyed it mostly (Brian Cox is certainly pleasant to look at and I appreciated his low-key/non-hype manner) I really kept asking, too, \\"what about the solar system?\\" Even though I'm almost a complete dunce on the subject, I learned surprisingly little for the length of this program. Perhaps this program could be edited to take out all the superfluous shots of Cox and instead answer some of those questions posed in the film. I really wanted more information, more depth and more visuals of the solar system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"There are some beautiful shots and interesting insights in Wonders of the Solar System, but ultimately this is a deeply flawed series. The most glaring problem is that the camera is on Brian Cox way too much. I paid to learn about the solar system, not look at a physicist. A secondary problem is the excessive focus on Earth. There are 8 planets in the solar system but all of them except for earth get very short shrift. On the plus side, the picture quality is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, but not of the same caliber as Cosmos","review":"While this is a noble attempt by Brian Cox to communicate the content in a clear, concise fashion, Cox is certainly not of the caliber of Carl Sagan.

The overview of the solar system has been done many times, but none with the unique approachable style of Prof. Brian Cox. It is easy to get put off by the great voices and giant stature of the presenters normally used on such programs. Bryan Cox is more a guy you know who knows more than anyone you are likely to know about his subject. And the graphics are simply the best as are the little side trips he takes along the way. And the blu-ray can't be beat. Bravo Brian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for all science lovers and any one with a curious mind","review":"I caught this show on the science channel last at night.

This is really \\"The Brian Cox Show\\". For a series that should be about the solar system, about 90% of the footage is shot on location around the Earth, and somebody obviously loved putting Prof. Cox on screen most of the time. For example, it is a good idea to illustrate Enceladus' ice fountains with a geyser in Iceland. But do we really need several minutes of the professor posing in front of said geyser? how about some computer graphics showing theories on how the fountains work?For an astronomy buff like myself (e.g. I watched the pictures being downloaded from the Huygens probe the day it landed on Titan) this set offered little of value. I'm only glad I got it from the library and I fast forwarded through most of it. If I had paid for it I would have been angry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like at all","review":"I did not like this DVD at all, I'm afraid to say. They never got down to the information for some reason - a lot of distractions from the main focus, which is suppose to be the solar system. I kept asking \\"What about the solar system?\\" The host was everywhere and no experts (or very few), and after a short while, I couldn't stand it. I knew I wouldn't like it from the 1st 5 minutes but still gave it chance - maybe it's me. I looked at it for 45 min., then quit. This DVD is definitely not my style and wish I had gotten it from the library before I purchased it. Now I try to get DVDs from the library and then purchase if I like it - it's better that way, otherwise I make a mistake like this. Very unusual too, since I love the topic and can tolerate quite a bit, but not this - this is not for an intelligent person. Very strange too, since a lot of reviewers gave it a high score - I would strongly suggest you see it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense!!!","review":"Amazing how the school system, PBS, National Geographic, and others spew out evolution like it is a proven fact, when it is as far from the truth as one could go. Take a watch apart, put it in a box, shake it, heat it, cool it, and shake it some more for 500 million + years...I assure you you will never come close to having a running watch again. Look at the human body, or any other living creature, the solar system, our galaxy, the other billion known galaxies and only a fool would believe it evolution.

Any momentum left from the poorly characterized and poorly executed \\"Racso\\" was squashed flat in this story.What made the original so delicious to read was that there wasn't much involved in suspending disbelief. Mrs. Frisby and company felt like your friends, you sympathised with their plight and rooted for the the rats and the mouse family. In R-T, there's just nothing that brings the reader into the world and makes them become emotionally invested in the outcome. It's too forced and too silly to bother taking seriously.This was a lackluster end to what started as such a stellar series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Candid first hand account of events that shaped the American experience","review":"A first hand account that will forever dwell in the annals of American history for it's candor, straight forwardness and non abashed honestly. From covert activities in the Middle East, shaping the direction of democracy and politics in Europe in addition to influencing patriotic yet daring engagements in South America, this book is undoubtedly a must read for any National Security practitioner.It would be naive to assume treachery, evil, and state actors determined to undermine freedom do not exist in a coordinated manner.

To wit, here's Clarkson on \\"San Francisco's gay population\\": \\"The city overflowed with nightlife in the early 1990s. But it was a labyrinthine in the extreme, with a very serious sadomasochistic community, a body piercing epidemic, and a lot more besides.\\" Also, his assumption that Cunanan was HIV-positive has been proven false by the twice-leaked autopsy report.

I assumed for the suggested retail price, that this flag would be at least 200 thread count. It is coated in a poly resin to give it mass and strength. Without the poly resin, it wouldn't even be thick/capable enough for being used as a dish rag.I was planning on putting this on the flag pole outside of my house, but I don't think it is worthy enough to take such stature.Sadly, this flag is \\"Made in the USA\\", probably by illegal immigrants.

I'm familiar with Dr. Jackson's work, and he is an excellent wordsmith.But in this case, his writing skills obscure the weakness of his argument.Jackson is arguing that for black people \\"class\\" isn't a matter of educational level, or a matter of income/wealth, but rather a matter of how one carries him/herself in different social settings. So class isn't something you ARE (as in, are you middle class or upper class) but something you HAVE (as in, are you ghetto acting or bourgie). Given the complex way politics and economics truncate black life options, this is a woefully inadequate way of grappling with race and class in Harlem, much less centers of black life like Detroit or Washington D.C.Again, VERY well written. It just isn't saying much."},{"rating":"2","title":"priceless capture of Mexican great","review":"I still haven't watched the butterfly part of this DVD yet, but the bio of Juan Reynoso is well done and entertaining.

You washed the t-shirt once, and the image faded - two or three washes and it was gone. I see they have improved that product line considerably, because...THESE are MUCH better! After a couple of washes, the t-shirt images still look pretty good. So these are perfect, as long as you don't intend to use them on a shirt that will be washed a LOT -- i.e., a sports team's regular shirts. For that, still go to a professional screen printer.But if you just want them for a fun event or a shirt that will be washed occasionally (and gently), these are awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"Having never used a product like this before, it was with some reservations that I decided to make a birthday T shirt for my son, with a photo of his baby daughter on the front. The process was surprisingly easy, and the T shirt was a big success. So far, 3 or 4 washings have had no ill effect upon the image on the shirt. More time and wear will tell, but I'll be using these transfers again for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away!","review":"Please go buy another product. If you want to do iron-on transfers, there are MUCH better options than this one. First complaint: the \\"clear\\" portion of the iron-on quickly turns a shade of \\"cream\\" the moment you finish ironing it in place. Second: it looks and feels like you have ironed a place-mat to the shirt, which then quickly wrinkles, fades, and peels off, even after just the first wash. Third: the iron-on does not stretch with the shirt behind it: it cracks! If you purchase or use this item, I guarantee you disappointment. I have tried it three miserable times, and would never in this lifetime use it again on anything I intended to wear or give as a gift. I am throwing away my remaining sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where should I do this?","review":"Only after opening the package was I able to read that I have to do this on a hard, smooth, heat-resistant surface. These instructions, of which there is no hint on the outside of the package, state that I cannot use an ironing board, glass, granite, concrete, heat sensitive or heat-sink surfaces. They specifically recommend formica, but I don't have any!Also, nothing here says I can use a 100% cotton t-shirt, but I couldn't find white cotton/poly blends.And this doesn't apply to me, but they do not put this on the package and I think it's pretty important. This paper will not work in HP Deskjet 1200C and 1600C printers because they apply heat.I understand simplicity of package design, but they are missing some critical info. It dupes people into buying what they cannot use. But then, maybe that's the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, and is easy to use","review":"It works. It's easy to use.I cropped a picture of my dog. I printed this picture using a Canon MX870 on a transfer sheet. I transferred the picture on a white cotton shirt using the hottest setting on the iron and with no steam. The transfer went smoothly, and I made a similar shirt for my daughter. No problems. I wasn't expecting designer-level quality, and it is good enough for what I wanted it for. Some documentation/instructions would have helped, but not necessary since the process is relatively straightforward.It works.

They were really easy to use and the t-shirts turned out great! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the colors ran a little in the wash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlimited Options!","review":"I love these transfers, because you can use them for any occasion. I used them for a children's birthday party. There are many templates available, but I went with my own Tea Cup theme and made shirts accordingly. Everything printed off correctly and easily. To do the transfer I purchased inexpensive tshirts and followed the directions. I sent each girl home with simple instructions to turn the tshirt inside out when washed. I have not washed the shirt a ton of times, because we have it hanging on my daughter's wall. But I think if you are having a family reunion, birthday party or even wedding celebrations, then this is less expensive then ordering tshirts and much more customizable. Love them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The transfer barely transfer.","review":"I follow the directions and it still turns up cheap. I need at least a semi professional looking shirt... I even washed it before use and it will just crack on the shirt. What if I'm doing it wrong?

It reminded me of when i try to take off a price tag but half of it ends up sticking to the item and then you have to get \\"goo-gone\\" to get it off. So I had to get a wet washcloth and scrub off the backing which revealed the letters I wanted to show but then it had a white halo around the words... ugh - it was horrible.

When I first listened to it, I knew right away that this was something special, something wonderful. I knew that I liked it right away. But it took the next couple of listens to really appreciate the masterpiece of 'Chasing the Ghost'. I haven't taken it out of rotation since I got it.kaRIN's super sexy vocals are perfect for the dark, moody soundscapes Statik creates. Her voice and the music fit each other perfectly, like two matching puzzle pieces. What she does with her voice is incredible. Together, the two members of Collide make a wonderful whole.I'm brand new to Goth and Industrial music but I have definitely loved what I've heard so far. I am exceedingly glad I started my collection with this album. It is a perfect intro to the Goth music newbie. I am, without a doubt, going to grab everything I can find by Collide!

I have to say, that I immediately fell in love with Collide- all their albums. IF you like Delerium/Balligominto type stuff...listen to the supreme vocals by kaRIN and the killer electronic composition by StAtiK... Haunting and sultry, but yet not boring by any means and and excellent duo. Being an ex-goth myself...this musik was an absolute delicious treat and definitely ear-candy.

The dark and moody atmosphere of the music and sensual singing really come together on this album. I am a big fan of the Depeche Mode album SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION and although very different I think if you like that you will like this. Mode has a lot more up tempo songs and the mode stuff is harder but its the tech stuff and the feel that are similar.I also like a lot of bands with the same mood but a little harder, The Gathering, Lacuna Coil, Anti-m, Xymox, Evanescence, Within Temptation are all bands I like, Xymox being more electronic than the others. Of course music is subjective so what I like you might not.Chasing the Ghost is in my most played ipod playlists as well as in my car and my home stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizingly Hard!!","review":"This album is definitely a haunting series of songs!!

Yeah, Phil Hartman made the show his own, but without him, the others were left to shine. And they came through. It was a shame that no one really accepted Jon Lovitz after Phils demise, but the one season he was a part of, he did add his little touches. I thought NewsRadio was one of the funniest shows all the way through. No \\"jumping the shark\\" although I felt they jumped a guppy with the space episode(season 3) and the Titanic episode(season 4). Those were not that most entertaining, but they got through it ok. Purchase season 5 and dont worry about Phil not being a part of this, the season was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fallout Season","review":"Many people wrote this show off after the Phil Hartman tradgedy, which is a mistake. Granted, without Hartman it loses something, but the same could be said for criminally underused Khandi Alexander's departure. Picking up the slack are Patrick Warburton and Jon Lovitz. Lovitz, guesting in many roles in earlier seasons (the one in the mental ward may be his finest work), did some of his funniest work on this show and he does the job solid as a series regular. If you're a fan of Newsradio, the wacky fun continues in this final season. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We'll miss you too, you gap toothed little monkey\\"","review":"I am very pleased with this DVD set. The episodes themselves are fantastic; these are some of the best characters ever created.

Paul Simms answers questions emailed to him by fans, and Andy Dick and Stephen Root show up for a few.

This is not it. The item does feature what it calls 'add mode' but the only thing this mode does is the fix the decimal at 2 places. It does NOT emulate the proper keystroke sequence of an adding machine. If you are doing adding machine style data entry, the final result on the display may be right, but the tape will show the wrong result every time. If you want the tape to be correct, you have to use calculator style entry order. Is it honestly that hard to scale down an adding machine? Not a single accountant at Sharp even tried this product before it went out the door. The keypad action is decent enough, considering the size. It does have the annoying tendency to occasionally and spontaneously issue keystrokes when moved. If you are doing a long calculation, or running a tape, don't move it until you get your final result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calculator Does The Job","review":"The Sharp Elsimate, EL-1611P is the perfect home printing calculator for someone who needs a printed sheet to check statements etc., but does not use the printing feature everyday.It is the right size and is non-obtrusive and does not command or take over your desk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturing defects abound","review":"The first Pelican case I ordered from Amazon had a \\"O\\" ring that did not come in contact with the base, allowing water, and dirt to enter.

I had purchased multiple Pelican cases in the past and this was not the norm, the cases have been excellent. I wrote Pelican a email and explained the defects to them, I have not heard back. I returned the case to Amazon and reordered another of the same type. I received that case today and it too is being returned because the \\"O\\" ring does not contact the base, it has the same defect as the first. I am very surprised and very disappointed.

Now to the good points: Di Stefano even at this late date can still make his voice pure and lyrical, just what Cavaradossi needs. The brilliance of Gobbi as Scarpia needs no more comments - this is his role. As a huge fan of Franco Corelli,with whom she sang often, I have heard Tebaldi live and on recordings, but never as Tosca. She is WONDERFUL HERE. What a shame she didn't do this role more often. I still think Callas was a soprano who needed to be seen as well as heard - her acting was so much a part of her performance. My vote is for Tebaldi. Question for the opera experts - the Spoletta in this Tosca is Piero de Palma who must have been the busiest comprimo tenor in history. Does anyone know about him? He performed with Corelli (often), Carreras, Domingo and all the other greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tebaldi better Tosca than Callas","review":"There you go again, Callas fans still attacking Tebaldi.

Ms. Berriault certainly crafts unwavering depictions of alienation, isolation and banality without apology as her characters remain insulated from feeling - much the way inpatients in a local asylum bounce off padded walls as their next injection of lithium is delivered.

I prefer my heroines with a little spine, they don't have to be the strongest, but it's nice for them not to be so weak. She was too naive, especially for being married before, even if it wasn't an ideal marriage.

Unfortunately, this time round the tunes have remained obscure for a reason: they all try to be the next Jan & Dean or The Beach Boys.

I wanted something that I could use in college and this appeared perfect. Well I was very much disappointed. The monologues are boring and corny; and not even corny enough to be funny, just bad. This might be good for a drama class taught by a teacher who finds everything art and expression, but if you are looking for audtion monologues or a performance monologue-look somewhere else. I have made a list of good acting books, and this certainly doesn't make it. The pieces in here are unrealistic, and even the best actor could not make them entertaining. Most show little emotion and are very bland. The others that do show emotion, show only one and are never complex. The intros to the monologues are never near enough for you to understand what would provoke these speeches. If you need paper to line your birdcage, by all means by this book otherwise, don't waste your time or money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun Memories","review":"I had this CD on vinyl as a child and had such good memories of listening to it.

Rather than step down and accept that he didn't believe in the Christian religion, he tried to remain a Christian priest and continue to receive a salary.It is Furlong who is a hypocrite - I'd far rather read something by Prof Richard Dawkins, who is always honest about his beliefs (and has never suggested that the Church should pay him a salary to attack it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Ranting","review":"The author is a heretic God-hater trying to get sympathy for speaking out against God.

I called Avery and they confirmed that the product number (8692) is only for paper CD Labels, and that DVD labels are sold under product number (8962). I am returning these because Avery advised that the CD labels will not stand up to the additional heat generated by DVD players.I have rated this one star, because I have no need for CD labels. The rating is for Amazon's internet display which is misleading, not the product which I assume works well as a CD label. If that is what you are looking for, it may be fine for that limited use.I hope that this review will spare others the inconvenience of having to return the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to apply - Sent different product","review":"The package I received says \\"Matte White CD Labels\\" and not \\"Matte White CD/DVD Labels.\\" Not sure if this makes a difference, but I figured that it didn't. The labels fit DVDs, however the quality is inferior to the first set of labels that I purchased. My main complaint is that the labels have a slight bend when you remove the backing. This makes it difficult to apply the label to the DVD (I use the applicator), and I destroyed several labels and DVDs before figuring out a method to have it apply correctly. The very first set of labels that I bought from Avery peeled \\"flat,\\" and it was a breeze to apply. Not the case for this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"No applicator required","review":"I like these Avery labels as they are designed not to require an applicator.

It was also nice to hear Winifred Horan share some distinct vocal time on this CD as well.

First off the thing that made me want the album was the lowery brothers were in it, so how could that be bad?

I'm not attacking these guys on a personal level, but anyone that appreciates music will see this CD has no flow. It sounds as if a few guys got together and created some decent riffs and then hastily hired a singer to apply lyrics so they could pump the thing out. The result is just as I said; a few good bass and guitar riffs and lyrics with religious overtones and no feel to the whole thing. There is nothing clever or conceptual about their music. Nothing lasting or memorable. Nothing worth your hard earned $. If this band has as much talent as the reviews that I read here all seem to say, where is the 2nd release? There won't be one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is some good stuff!!","review":"This is a very solid CD from beginning to end.

If a million zillion other bands hadn't already done the exact same songs 11 times over, I'd say dark new day was original. but they're not, and I won't. although i must admit, i did have a soft spot for the song brother. fyi, the rest of the album sounds nothing like it, in case you think like me. boy howdy, that just about wraps things up i suppose. if you like dogs**t on wax, please get a copy of dark new day's 12 year silence. all others, avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"Creativityless major label alt-rock scum.

I've never seen a movie like it before, at least not that I can remember. It was interesting how the main character in the film dealt with this. By writing them down in her diary and making the characters interesting. When Sawyer started hanging out with Jamie, Sawyer seemed different but when the truth came out she seemed so hurt, as if she really was hanging out with because she wanted to. Sawyer went back to the way she really was once she found out what Jamie really thought of her, aww poor baby. It's a shame the way Jamie turned from her \\"real\\" friends as soon as she got famous.

Then, when I viewed it later, I couldn't believe that I'd ever thought that. I'd almost be inclined to say this is as good as High School Musical.Jamie's a regular girl with regular friends and a regular life until her journal accidentally is submitted as an assignment and then gets published. Jamie is thrust into the life of being popular, where she has to deal with staying true to herself and her friends, whilst dealing with the main character of her book, IS, who is an alter-ego of herself.Sure there are the plot fallacies, without a doubt, but they were minor enough that I was able to overlook them and enjoy the movie.

I'm glad I only rented it. First off, the graphics are terrible. There are better games graphically for the Playstation. Only one of the cars is a liscenced rally car. The rest of them would make pathetic rally cars. When I think of rally cars I think of Subaru Imprezas and Pugeut 206s not Pontaic Grand Prixs and Vibes. Another low point is the physics. Cars handle the same on snow as they do on grass and concrete. If you stray from the road even a little distance your car slows down to a crawling speed. The courses don't look like rally courses either. I just don't understand driving through a city with skyscrapers and dirt roads. There are more weak points in the game, but I'm trying to keep this short, so in conclusion don't buy this game. If someone gives it to you don't play it.

And the sex -- yes if you're going to inhabit the 25-year-old body of an \\"Italian footballer\\" as the main character does, you're going to revisit some of the enjoyments of youth, but there's a lot of other things Kurieshi neglects about what if might feel like to inhabit a new body.

I was just doing water running, so it was never even submerged. It never worked again, so I was out $150, since I purchased it before the price reduced. I tried contacting the company, to no avail. It just wouldn't respond at all after that first time.

Maude season one is a 22 episode 3-disc set. In this season of Maude they cover abortion, racism, drugs, woman's lib, divorce and other topical issues that still are relevant today. As far as I can tell, these are the complete episodes, not the syndication versions. The shows are hilarious, even when the subjects are not, such as the show dealing with Maude's pregnancy.

Somehow in the conversion to digital they stretched and cropped the picture and lost the bottom one third of the screen. Frequently, you can only see Maude from the eyes up and being a tall woman this means your frequently only seeing the tops of other actors heads.

Starring one of the funniest women to ever walk the earth, Bea Arthur. \\"Maude\\" is sensationally funny and socially significant, tackling subjects and offering opinions that fly in the face of conservaturd nincompoops like the reviewer above. \\"Maude\\" is a great, great show by every standard imaginable. By the way, TV DVD Junkie, each episode in the set is 26 minutes long, so they are complete as originally aired.

Underwood's Keltora, it all hangs together with no feeling of patchwork. The fighting scenes are extremely solid, but this is unsurprising, given Ms. Underwood's experience as a fencer. The healer Eithne is a marvelous individual, not like the standard issue milksop so often found in lesser fantasy books, but more like the kind of caring person who will fight for your life with defiant words as well as fervent prayers. All in all, a very entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE FOR PM COLLECTOR","review":"This is a GREAT book for a Precious Moments Collector!

My review at the bookstore was confirmed as a purchase because the book seem easy to read and could get me through learning this application pretty smoothly. I've bought other Sam's Publishing Teach Yourself series and really enjoy them.However, when I got home, I needed the source code to do my exercises which the book advises they are available online at Sam's and also provided the author's email address. For the publishing company, they no longer support this book and source is not available. For the author, his mailbox is full and I am sitting here dreading having to type all that source code.So if you want it, good luck, but be aware of my own deliemma. If you've got it and have the source code, let me hear from you."},{"rating":"1","title":"something major missing","review":"Oh dear I wish I'd read these reviews before I bought this book; somehow I had the impression that the SAMs books where good introductions to subject.Yes, there are typo's in the long sections of code that you have tp type in yourself - which is worrying.Worse than that there would appear to be some major details missing from this book. I am stuck on chapter 2 now (I'm not a complete dimwit) as there would appear to be a major differenc between running xml files on your hard drive and running them online. The examples I am working do work when I test them on my pc - but when I uploa them to the web - nothing. I cannot even find the vaguest mention of any software/activeX controls I may need to install on my server to get the damn stuff to work.Deeply infuriating - I'm going to take it back I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful - save your money.","review":"I got this book to learn some basics of XML. I've been working with HTML and JavaScript for a few years now, even doing some hand-coding now and then. However, this book was just about useless to me after the first chapter. What is most disheartening is that the author is assuming the reader will be using some flavor of the Windows operating system and nothing else! Many of the examples just don't work if you are a user of any other platform. That would have been all right with me if the author had offered alternative cross-platform examples. It would have been okay even if the author and/or the editor had simply bothered to put the platform requirements somewhere in its description or elsewhere so that an individual can make an informed choice. Although less convenient, I know that I can find useful cross-platform XML tutorials on the web, for nothing!

It didn't deserve one star but that is as low as it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor explaination and confusing syntax","review":"DO NOT buy this book! It's one of the most confusing and syntactically incorrect books that I have ever bought. The writer never went into details of any concepts and only tried to teach by example, which would be ok if he at least got the syntax right!!! I tried some of the code examples and found tons of mistakes in them. I really thought initially that this book was going to give me an intrductory understanding of XML... but after having read through this whole thing, I find XML still as confusing as before. Also this book is primarily based on Microsoft xmldom and never even talks about Java and Oracle Doms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to SAMS standards","review":"SAMS Teach Yourself XML in 24 Hours is a weak and confusing presentation.

I tossed this one after the third Hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poorly Written Book","review":"I bought this book and then returned it:1. The examples - even in the first chapter - are poorly explained.2. Many code examples are very long, and there is no way to get these codelets pre-written either by CD or download.

Much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book....","review":"This book is a confusing mixture of already known concepts. Someone as said that the organization is poor. My question is: which organization? It does not exist, simply said. From the introduction we know that Mr.Ashbacher only likes IE and his knowledge of Netscape must be extremely poor. But, what is worse, you can use the book only if you use Microsoft Windows. And nothing is said anywhere about that. A dirty trick. For that reason my advice is to refrain to buy the book, as it seems the only way to protect all of us against this shark-writters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unprofessionally presented,insistent, difficult to read","review":"I bought this book hoping that it would be as helpful as other SAMS's \\"Teach yourself...\\" publications. However, even I know other web programming languages such as HTML, ASP and JavaScript, I found this book very difficult to read and understand.It contains codes that were poorly presented and with syntax errors (has this book been proofread at all?). It doesn't explain the concept behind the code and tend to write long, complicate statements where a short, simple one will do.I tried very hard but have to give up after reading one quarter of the book. Until now I still don't have a clear picture of how to structure a XML code, and the more I read, the more questions remain unanswered. Now I am looking for another XML book and probably have to start from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too messy to learn from","review":"I already have a good foundation in HTML and Javascript, but around chapter 3 and 4 this is getting a little obscure.

However, I'm finding that it is not as thorough nor as simple a guide to XML as some of the alternatives. The examples are unevenly explained. There isn't a lot of detail on syntax. The examples on the website (\\"Save yourself the typing!\\") are organized by chapter, but do not have perfect correspondence in their filenames to the titles of the examples in the book. The one saving grace is that the lessons are shorter than an hour, each.On good alternative is Jan Egil Refsnes' XML101 website. It is very straightforward, and free, although there isn't a great deal of pure narrative. I have also heard good things about the Wrox book, \\"Beginning XML\\" but haven't had a chance to look at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible number of typos...","review":"I know everyone who has rated this book had mentioned the typos. But, isn't this a major problem? This is a teaching book. If the examples won't work without the reader having to edit the copy as they are trying to learn, it seems to defeat the purpose of book.Also, the exercises are a bit monotonous. How about some varied content with a wider range of examples. After a while, examples started bleeding together when I went back to review previous lessons.I've purchased Sam's books in the past and been pleased. However, this one I should have skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are many typos in this book!","review":"Typos in the code examples make this a very difficult book to learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for XML Beginers !!","review":"This is a good book for a XML beginer who has HTML knowledge and wants to quickly have a headstart on XML.

The worlds of Chinese fairy tales are radically different from the Brothers Grimm that most of us eurocentrics grew up with, and that's part of the appeal. Events and circumstances that seem so oddly improbable to us are received and accepted as \\"matters of fact\\" by the characters in this book. It has (at least) one thing in common with reading Shakespeare: when you pick up the book, either for the first time or after an extended absence, you'll probably have to read the first few pages more than once to reorient your language receptors. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully funny but also moving.","review":"I've never picked up a book and fallen in love with it so quickly before.

My one flaw is with Number Ten Ox, the narrator. Of all the characters in the story, both male and female...he comes across as the weakest. I never truly felt like I got his character as much as the others. But other than that, I loved this book!! The Duke of Ch'In, the Man in the Mountain, Jade Pearl, Miser Shen...so many hilarious and memorable characters that aid and deter our leads on their journey of finding the Great Root of Power!!!! Great book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Fantasy with the flavour of the Classics","review":"I am a fan of classical Chinese texts and this rang true of the writing style including the humor (puns).

It features some of the most original characters in fantasy today, using a setting that has been little explored in comparison to the mass of fantasy in pseudo-european-darkages settings.As a source of pure enjoyment - what can I say - at the start of the book I laughed, at the end of cried. Few authors can create characters I actually care about, and Hughart has done it.I understand that Hughart is no longer writing - this is one of the great tragedies in fantasy literature today.Definitely read this book, and definitely read the next two in the series. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really what I had thought it would be","review":"I picked up this book thinking of it as a fantasy novel, however I felt disappointed. Instead of non-stop action, intrigue, or even any type of excitement, I found it to be slow and unsuprising. I do not understand why it is classified as a fantasy novel, other than the fact that it is fiction. I finished the book, however it was quite a chore. One major thing that bothered me was the weird references to sex. I mean, one moment the main character is playing lookout, the next he's talking about spying on some couple having sex. To top it off, it turns out that the couple are nothing more than insects. If you are looking for something that is filled with dragons, myths and excitment, this is definately not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO FLAKY.

It's suppose to of taken place in the \\"Year of the Tiger 3,337 (A.D. 639) but you get, \\"....a Great Root of Power, if such a thing exists, will probable be worth it's weight in diamonds and look like a dog turd.\\", modern day garbage slang/terms.

Did he and I read the same book?I have read this book several times and have never failed to be amused, entertained and uplifted. Hughart does what all authors wish they could do....they make their readers want more. Number Ten Ox and Master Li (...there's a slight flaw in my character) are some of my favorite fictional characters.Virey needs to lighten up and recognize that he's only one in almost 100 readers to weigh in on the negative.Hughart rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definition of \\"apocryphal\\"-- if it is not true, it SHOULD be","review":"with the confident jauntiness of a tall tale, the Bridge of Birds unfolds a tale of wonder, pathos, and humor.

My thanks to the author for giving me such a wonderful world to explore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiantly clever and engaging","review":"Li Kao is a scholar with a slight flaw in his character who agrees to assist Number Ten Ox when the children of the village are mysteriously struck down by an illness that only the Great Root of Power can cure. Along the way we see characters like Miser Shen, the most expensive woman in the world, Henpecked Ho, and the Key Rabbit.I generally don't like fantasy set in historic periods but I loved _Bridge of Birds_. It's written with a combination of irony and sincerity that is very difficult to resist. The story unfolds with humor and pathos and I found myself genuinely wondering what was going to happen next after every twist and turn. Absolutely worth a read or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever written! You go, Master Li!","review":"It's a sad state of affairs when the publishing world refuses to recognize and encourage a storyteller of Barry Hughart's caliber.This is my favorite book of all time and I've read it at least 50 times since 1984.I'm in love with Master Li...would love to have known him...even in his old age. What a wonderfully rich character.If you love a good story, well told, you should buy this book when it's available again..encourage the publishers to support more Master Li/Number Ten Ox tails."},{"rating":"2","title":"You haven't read fantasy until you've read \\"Bridge of Birds\\"","review":"This book shows that length is of no accord when it comes to fantasy. Its single volume of eloquence, humour, wit, drama and pure imagination puts the multi-volume monoliths of Eddings and Tolkien to shame. To date, this is still the best fantasy book that I have ever read. Hughart manages to enthral his readers with a magical and fascinating world of musical trinkets, mystical caverns and outrageuosly funny characters. He manages to blend Eastern and Western folklore in a way that is at once recognisable yet seamless. In reading it, one cannot help but sense that Hughart had a whale of a time writing it. Absolutely unfetterred imagination. I read this book six years ago and it's still fresh in my mind. \\"Jade plate, six eight, fire that burns hot, night that is not.\\" It warms my heart that so many other readers share in the joy of reading this volume.

I also decided to find any other Barry Hughart books. I found 8 Skilled Gentleman in a close out sale, but couldn't find The Story of the Stone anywhere. These are great books. Like a previous reviewer stated the tone of books is similar to that of The Princess Bride, though a little more grim and a little more adult. They are a must read. And finally, for those of you dying to get them all, the Science Fiction Book Club did a omnibus reprint of all 3 in a single hardback in 1998. You might still be able to get some. I know it was a high demand item for them, but it was definitely worth it to finally get to read all 3. A must read book that would make a great animated movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the three best books I've ever read.","review":"I re-read Barry Hughart's Bridge of Birds today. I had remembered it being good. I had not remembered it being one of the greatest fantasy novels I've ever read.I rarely laugh or cry when reading books. Most of them simply don't move me that strongly. As I re-read the book, I laughed aloud three times and I wept three times. Once, I laughed when the heroes flew in a bamboo dragonfly, and once, I wept during the tragic prayer for Ah Chen. The other four instances of laughter and tears I will leave as an exercise for the reader to find. It's cruel, I know, but then...I have a slight flaw in my character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mad, wonderful, beautiful, frantic, inspired book.","review":"Not to repeat all the other reviews, but everyone I know who has read this book is pretty much speechless.

It can also get old after awhile though. If you have a GBA link, it is a must buy. The multiplayer modes are awsome, where you can battle Charabombs (amazingly like pokemon), play in a very fun battle mode, and unlock 20 bonus levels if you link up with an owner of the opposite version. Another advantage of linking up is that to play in battle mode, you only need one game pack, so you can play with a friend who doesn't have the game.

His role in Noble House was right for him, but these shoot'm ups (always appearing with a beard, apparently to offset his \\"hunk\\" image and be a \\"real\\" actor). These two movies have little to recommend them. In the first, Brosnan's character seems secondary to that of Stewart Patrick, and has no depth. In the second Stewart is not there and Brosnan's character becomes dominant by default. A viewer would have difficulty caring about Brosnan's character in either movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"or sex and sin","review":"I thought the idea behind the novel in a sense was good.

I was so excited to get this book and yet from the first 5 pages I knew it was not up to the standards I have come to count on from this author. It took me several nights to get thru to the end and it was almost a task vs. a pleasure to read it. The characters and chemistry were dry and lacked the usually snappy dialog that keeps us fans engaged. I did not get the reason the herione felt so trapped and the constant tension with her family members seemed silly and was over written to the point it was annoying. I hope the next historical follows the examples of the much better \\"London's Perfect Scoundrel\\", \\"Taming Rafe\\", \\"Reforming a Rake\\" and \\"Meet me at Midnight\\".

I have to agree with the reviewers who disliked Nell because there was very little character development in this novel.

The accidental marriages she had underline just how insecure she was, and it's a great mirror for many ladies who are on the edge of saying YES! when deep in their hearts they feel that there is something wrong with doing it.

It is only USB 1.1 compatible. but given the transfer rate of an infrared device is only 1Mbps (compared to USB 1.1's 12Mbps) it is no issue. I recommend it.

They give you a \\"template\\" to use to line up your printing, except they DON'T tell you that the alignment will change when you finally put in the product and hit \\"Print\\". The first go round I wasted many sheets and gallons of expensive Canon ink to finally get some usable cards. I STILL had to recut them them with my \\"chopper\\" cutter to clip away white edges. Now, after this second try, I feel better because I have dumped all of the wasted sheets and remaining product in to my recycle bin. Never again!!

I was hesitant to get them because I worried that the final product would be lacking, but I figured between the price of the product and the quality of my printer, I couldn't go too wrong. Well, my initial instinct was right. I used Avery's online card designer along with this paper and lost three sheets because it kept printing my design over the margins. When I finally did get it to print correctly, I was very disappointed with the card's feel. The package boasts \\"extra sturdy,\\" but it just doesn't feel like a quality cardstock and the edges, although not a disaster, aren't perfectly clean. My conclusion is that for most professional purposes, this card lacks the kinds of authority you'd want. Definitely wouldn't feel comfortable handing it to a client. Two stars because I can see it working just fine as a social card (not a business card), and I appreciate the effort on Avery's part for providing simple-to-use software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Good Product.This product is suitable to use for printing business cards.

I absolutely loved his collection _Quicker_than_the_Eye_, but _Golden_Apples_ has an entirely different feel to it. All the stories have this nostalgic airy utopic tone that makes all the characters unbelievable. It's almost victorian. And all the stories seem to revolve around one single idea, and that's all the story has to it, is that one single idea.

I'm glad to see it still in print.No one can infuse so much tension, or wring as much drama out of a short story as can Ray Bradbury, and \\"Golden Apples,\\" in my opinion, is his best collection, easilly rivalling \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" in sweep and vista.

The book I received is smaller than I remembered, almost a \\"pocket edition,\\" measuring 15cm x 10cm, and the text is badly scanned, halftoned, and reduced to 5 lines per centimeter, 40 lines per page. It even looks bad under magnification. Nothing in the product description indicates the dimensions of the book.

After listening to them I can say that the sound quality reminds me of cheap computer speaker that come free when you buy a computer system. The subwoofer does sound as good as other reviewers have mentioned but that's the only good thing I can say. The satellites produce sounds come out muffled and weak.I bought these thinking I was upgrading from my 2 piece Advent AV180 speakers. I was wrong. The Advents have a clearer sound coming out of it that sound similar to speakers from a home stereo system. The Yamahas satellites are 6 watts while the Advents are 7.5 watts. So the power is similar but the sound quality of the Advent speakers are sooo much better.Yamaha usually has excellent sound systems, this is NOT one of them. If you're thinking \\"but there are so many good reviews\\", then you better think twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive sound for not much money","review":"Got these for Christmas this year from my brother. I used 'em first with a portable MP3 player which doesn't put out that much power and they still sounded really good.

So I decided to look 'em up on Amazon to see how much he spent on me. Heeyyyy.... was he ever a cheapskate! Flaws: previous reviewers have noted the lack of a headphone jack and the weird placement of the bass knob on the back of the subwoofer. I'd also like the cord between the subwoofer and PC to be longer to allow more flexibility in placement.

And this system easily does that! It gives you a subwoofer plus two sat. stereo speakers that anyone would easily love! Within 5 minutes after pulling it out of the box it was already set up and playing my favorite music! The bass with the subwoofer made it wonderful! The only bad thing was that I hoped that it would allow for other speakers to be interfaced into it to allow for a surround sound setup, but it doesn't. But, don't let that one little thing throw you off. This is the best sound system out there for anyone!

I set the Yamahas atop my expensive high end speakers and envited a freind over to listen to some Jazz. The guy thought the sound was coming from the tower speakers until I pointed it out. The speakers pack a real punch... Note: I found the sound does vary dramatically based upon the type of output device you have.

Here is why: the band sounds great and Brown rips them out pretty decently, but the songs are too quick. Don't be impressed by the cool setlist on the back cover, because JB only plays about 30 seconds to a minute of each song before going into the next. THE CONCERT IS ONE BIG MEDLEY!

In fact it is a piece of total BS that is about kidnapping women, selling them, killing them and selling their body parts. The plot makes no sense. All the details about such relationships are wrong. The presentation of \\"training\\" and its results are laughable. If you want to watch a couple of naked women running around and being treated like dogs for part of the movie, then it may be worthwhile, but unlike the opinion of some others here, this movie has nothing to do with anything that happens in the real world. And the acting, editing, etc. are not even B movie quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Movie","review":"I looked forward to this movie's release, especially after seeing the trailers. In short, it is terrible in about every way imaginable. You could steer an aircraft carrier through the holes in the plot, and the acting was just awful.Probably worse than the money I wasted on this is the black-eye it gives to BDSM. There is not a character in the film who could not be considered quite insane. This is not even a love story. It's a strange story about bizarre people, all of whom manage to be inept human beings with no moral bearing. All that and it manages to be boring too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly anticipated purchase; atrocious result","review":"This was a gift to someone special last year, and I was thrilled to have it delivered before the holidays; we were both eagerly anticipating seeing it after having viewed its very intriguing trailer on the web. I can report that the actual film has a plot that is convoluted and crippled with an absence of logic. This effort tries to be many things, including being a lifestyle film with some thrill components, a morality tale, and, partly, a film that dips slightly into the psychological exploration of D/s. The result is a nicely photographed steaming pile of celluloid filled with bad acting and really bad lines that was incredibly disappointing to see. Once the credits rolled, I knew I had just experienced the worst film I had ever seen, and I felt utterly embarrassed that I had given it as a gift.

The people who do this, (not te actors but the monsters who traffic real human beings) should be all lined up and shot slowly -beginning at the ankles and going up- for all the suffering they bestow for the kidnapped children and young girls.

The ending felt as if it had been tacked on to deliver a 'message' that would redeem all the previous prurient interest stuff and then left the viewer with an unsatisfying downer conclusion.On the bright side, the photography was pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected at all.......","review":"For all the advertising and hype that went on about this movie, they should have invested that money into research into the BDSM, M/s, Master/pet lifestyle. Then they should have invested more in someone to rewrite the poorly written script, then someone that knows how to film, and someone to edit properly.I've seen high school kids make movies that were better made than this. I'm not sure if the actors could have done better if it was written better but they didn't seem to know what they already were given to work with.Had this been made better, it could have compared consensual slavery or the life of a human pet with a Master to slave trading but this fell far short of the mark. I was very disappointed in it. It took me 2 days to watch it just because of how poorly the film was made."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWO THUMBS WAY UP FOR \`THE PET\\"","review":"I'm not a BDSM fan or even in the life style, although I have some friends who are, and they tell me that this film has sparked a huge controversy in that community. I just like good storytelling and good film making and I have to say THE PET excels in both these categories. When you see how easy it is to be taken advantage of, when you trust other people - whoever they are, you will be moved - the movie is shockingly real.Performances by Pierre Du Lat and Andrea Edmondson are particularly involving, and the score by Chris Walden is mesmerizing. It's a wonderful slice of a very unknown life -- if the bizarre interests you - you'll no doubt get a serious thrill from THE PET."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liars feeding you lies","review":"Hate the movie, hate the producers, hate the director and writers.This was funded as a movie against \\"White Slavery\\", however the staff convinced practitioners of consensual contracted pseudo-slavery that the movie was about their community.

If the book were a celebration of the amazing miracle of Celine's own child it would be one thing, but this just strikes me as super super tacky. On top of that, the music is over the top and several of the songs are recycled from past recordings. The whole thing smacks to high heaven of trying to leverage your fame for more money, which is bizarre to me coming from someone who is so wealthy!

If you have, like me, been searching for the intersection of cutting-edge Franco-Canadian symphonic arrangement and adorable baby pictures, than you, like Coleridge, have found your artistic pleasure dome -- all without the damaging side effects of opium consumption that so plagued the Romantic poets of that earlier generation of transcendent -- and now, demonstrably lesser -- artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable Collaboration!","review":"Fans of either Geddes or Dion are not going to be disappointed with this powerful portrait of the beauty and innocence of motherhood.

I saw on a very recent Oprah Winfrey program, Anne Geddes & Celine Dion were guests. The show gave a detailed account of how the photography is done, how carefully they do this, with the babies' mom's present for the photo shoots. Celine was so tender & gentle with those babies in each photo shoot, it brought tears to your eyes! Dr. Gish should get the facts straight first!

And then paired with Celine Dion's latest release...WOW! What a combo! Celine's music surely complements Anne's talent. I couldn't imagine a better book/CD/DVD combo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very creepy and methotical erotic vampire flick.","review":"Don't go in expecting the film \\"Vampyres\\". But honestly, there is something magical about this film. It is dark and creepy in a \\"Hammer\\" sort of way. The head mistress is very cunning and seductive and the actress plays her part very well. Creepy bongo-type music plays throughout the film. Not super erotic like \\"Vampyros Lesbos\\" and \\"Vampyres\\" but still a good old-school film. More on the line with \\"The Vampire Lovers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ridiculous book...","review":"Despite it's mixed reviews, I decided to give this book a try. I should have known better. It is absolute dreck. The choppiness of the writing makes it difficult to follow. It's almost as if it was written in a stream of conciousness style, except I doubt there was much conciousness behind it to begin with.The \\"heroine\\" of the novel, while booksmart, is so incredibly lacking in street smarts that it makes her character totally unbelievable and ridiculous. She's such a highly selfish and pathetic character, that I found myself groaning in parts because of the stupid situations that she puts herself in.Without giving it all away, the \\"shocking\\" final scene is hardly that. Anyone with half a brain will figure it all out long beforehand. The clues are there, and so patently obvious, that the \\"twists\\" fall flat, and the character in question gets what she deserves for hampering the murder case that she's involved in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond the brink of porn and just third class fiction","review":"Explicit language in literature does not offend me. However, I want this kind of language to be useful in the context of a story. I don't see the usefulness here. So to me Susanna Moore's novel is more porn than literature. The lack of usefulness applies to the bloody ending of the novel, too. Besides, this ending could not have been logically more impossible: A total failure as far as point of view is concerned. Maybe I'm expecting too much of entertaining fiction, but the book was a waste of time, and yes, even a nuisance for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"violated the standard rules of fiction","review":"I don't usually reveal endings or review books that came out a long timeago, but I wanted to call the author on her ending that I feel violatedthe standard rules of fiction. I'm sorry but the narrator cannot be deadunless the readers knows this already as in The Lovely Bones. Otherwise,it is just a sleazy trick from the author. The writing was snappy and clever throughout, making the shoddy ending way below the quality of the writing inthe rest of the book and even more obnoxious. I literally threw this bookinto the garbage when I finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising elements, disappointing follow-through","review":"Interesting characters, sexy premise, but underdeveloped, and, well, ultimately unsatisfying. I didn't need a \\"happy ending,\\" but I felt . . . cheated. I expected something more complex and interesting at least. For something so bloody, it was awfully neat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characterization (warning--contains spoiler)","review":"Since Susanna Moore opens this brief novel with heavy refs to irony, I suppose it's reasonable enough for her streetwise narrator to get ripped off and then whacked by the very people she should be hip to.But there needs to be more development of the anonymous narrator to make her shift from skeptic to gullible runoff victim believable. It could be believable if the author hadn't skimped in the middle. There's no development that could make the transition believable, so it's not. There are a lot of wasted words devoted to what could have been a subplot re Cornelius, but this text seemd by the end to have been a poorly-developed red-herring in the detective aspect. This author may have talent but needs to go to the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally exotic","review":"This book is the most amaizing book I have ever read in my life. The way she described the passionate sex scene in the bar basement and the sex scene on the desk was amaizing. Her choice of words and excitement through out the book kept me wanting more. I could feel the way she felt as she wrote the words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sly, vacant , and dark exercise","review":"I expected this book to be grim from the outset. The dark sexuality did not bother me. What did bother me was how soul-less the book was. Franny, the main character, is caught in some malaise without any depth. The author, Susanna Moore, gives some hints to Franny's past with hardly any elaboration. From this superficial treatment of Franny's inner life and her past, the reader is to focus on Franny's present journey. This sly, seamy escapade is merely an exercise. You don't care about Franny, her detective boyfriend, her student, or even the rash of murders in their wake. The conclusion is violent and stupid.The author elicts no emotion for the characters and the story is not interesting enough to justify this failure on her part."},{"rating":"1","title":"tense, but leaves you cold","review":"Moral ambiguity is great but this is no Maltese Falcon. The mood is right, the writing is taut. But in the end you couldn't care less about what happens to the main character (whose level of detachment and egotism must set some kind of record for the genre.) Worst of all are the author's literary pretensions, quie laughable considering the weak character development. Sexy? Yes. Unfortunately it's as deep as a fishbowl, and as hollow as one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent porn","review":"The only thing worse than violent porn (and by porn I mean gratuitousness for its own sake) is a talented, established writer trying to write down to her audience in what she clearly perceives to be a marginal genre. I'm basing this response on my memory of my experience reading it as opposed to the book itself, which I successfully managed to forget almost as soon as I threw it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read","review":"This book is a mess. I am amazed that it had 100,000 copies printed. It's supposed to be a thriller but the plot is transparent and predictable. It's supposed to be erotic but it was more like 4th rate porn.But the worst was the terrible writing. The author loses track of a couple of scenes. Meanings are lost in murky language that seems to be an attempt at great writing but comes across as a parody.I'm glad I bought the book used. I don't want anyone to ever pay for this copy again so I'm going to leave it lying at the airport or in a coffee shop with a warning inside the front cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the cut - certainly doesn't make the \\"cut\\"","review":"This book is certainly far from an \\"erotic thriller\\" as it seems to billed. i was left confused and disappointed...where were the thrills?

I saw the movie first. The ending is a lot more satisfying. It's a rare event, but in this case, the movie actually was better than the book - which doesn't say a whole lot.The book is raw. The characters are not likeable. The writing style is choppy.I can say two good things about this book:1) It's short so at least I didn't waste too much of my time reading it.2) I didn't mind too much about Frannie's outcome because I didn't like her.If you feel compelled to read this book, save your $ and borrow it from a friend or the library. Don't say you weren't warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Let Down of an Ending","review":"The only reason I bought the book was because the movie was pretty bad and lacking in substance. The book is a little more meaty as far as details and character but I had to give this book a 2 for the way it ended!!! I can't believe you can end a book like that and get away with it. It was such a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops, forgot to add a plot!","review":"What a horrible mess this book is. There are some exceptional sections and obviously Moore knows how to put pen to paper. But the overall story is so hollow it put me to sleep three nights in a row. The story spirals around and around with a highly disappointing ending and repetitive erotica.I'm amazed at what ends up on the big screen. Let's hope the screenwriter has some original ideas to add."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly Unpleasant","review":"'The Whiteness of the Bones' was one of my favorite books when I read this. I expected gritty and I expected dark eroticism but was chagrined to find a weak plot, an unsympathetic heroine and a nauseating ending. The word 'chum' now fills me with horror...When I finished the book I promptly threw it away rather than keep such bad juju in my house. I was left with a profound sense of disgust and disappointment that such a talented author could spend her time creating something that was, perhaps, technically laudable, but reprehensible on practically every other level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad; no, pretty bad.","review":"Truthfully, I am surprised that this novel was published. Badly written, the writing was strained and didn't flow, and I merely finished it because it was short. Overall, the story was more akin to an episodic crime television drama, albeit perhaps worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminist noir leaves an empty feeling","review":"While Moore has a flair for dark descriptions of NYC nightlife and the singles scene, it seems evident she has no interest in characterizing heterosexual relationships unless they involve males as ego-cruising masochists and women as depressed suicidals. Darkness in noir fiction is fine but here the characters are so segregated into stereotypical holes that I found myself wondering about the author's view of the real world rather than those of the characters. Still, it manages to intrigue, and the dialogue is crisply written. My biggest complaint, however, is the ending which, without giving it away, is unexpected and quite unfair when you consider the book was written in the first person. I felt cheated, that the author was laughing at her readers. Yes, rules may be made to be broken but readers still expect a modicum of fairness and the final page disregards that."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than an eroctic thriller","review":"What makes this novel so special is the sense of doom that you can feel in the very first pages. Erotism and blood have always made an interesting combinition in literature. Moore succeeds in both arousing you and also making you feel very uneasy. Although there are no description, and the character's name mentioned just once, everything is so vivid. The female point of view on sex, the nature of language, along with poetry, are what's best in this novel.I heard that director Jane Campion is currently editing a movie based on that novel, with Meg Ryan starring. The ending has also been changed... That's too bad. Read the book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I loved the way the main character used her words. I liked hearing the many different translations for words that she was saying. I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say I didn't like the ending. I thought everything happened to fast. The relationship that Franny and Malloy had happened so quickly. I think it should have developed more. But I really did like the book. It was one of the most suspenseful and thrilling books that I have read in a long time. I would have liked to have known more about Franny's past. But the author really put me in her shoes. This is the first book I have read by this author. But it encourages me to read more by her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange series of musings punctuated with sex","review":"I didn't like this book because it didn't make sense to me. The main character didn't behave in a coherent way and she kept putting herself in risky situations, though she would be the type of person who you would think would be more savvy. It was almost like she was looking for trouble or casual sex. maybe both. The ending was bloody, unexpected and abrupt. It just didn't ring true for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"In A Word: Sickening!","review":"I don't think I've ever read a book that disturbed me more than Moore's. It's blatant Grand Guignol, blood and gore and sadism, peopled with characters devoid of humanity with whom it's not possible to empathize. I also feel it is totally anti-woman. The macho detectives' attitude toward women is sick-making, but the \\"heroine\\" just laps it up, panting to be abused over and over again. She's not the poster child for the woman's movement, that's for sure. The final scene is grotesque, sadistic, bloody, and just plain downright nasty. Nicole Kidman bought this property for a film? I wish her well with it---perhaps she can authorize a complete re-write and wash its mouth out with soap. P.S., it deserves no stars whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your $$money","review":"For the first time I believe the movie might turn out to be better than the book. That is assuming they add to the story line... and another ending wouldn't hurt either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reluctant to give it one star, but I can't click on zero","review":"Such a boring, pointless story that only an antisocial might find appealing, with an ending that will probably leave you yawning. If you could care any less about the central character, you would be in a coma. Yes, Moore writes well, but so do countless writers who achieve more than she ever comes close to... Trust me, there are books that waste your time, and this one is at the top of the list. Move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"mystery/ romance","review":"Both this book and the movie are good. A combination of romance and supense make this an interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elegantly written, erotic trash.","review":"While Susanna Moore's In the Cut could have been a pleasant addition to erotica, it is severely depreciated by the ugly violence. She appears to take some pleasure in language as evidenced by the occasional lists of slang, street language, or argot, but this is primarily an in-your-face piece of trash"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant to say the least","review":"Despite being warned, I gave this book my time. And what a waste of time it was. This book was the worst book I have ever read. The writing style was jumpy and choppy. The choppiness of the writing made it difficult to follow. The ending just creeped me out. No wonder the movie bombed - even with Meg Ryan. And why would an actress like Meg Ryan want to be involved in such a dark, yuck, story? Warning! This is very sick stuff and not at all sexy or erotic. I hope to never again read about a murderer who likes to cut the nipples off his victims to save as \\"souvenirs\\" and all sorts of other unpleasant crap. This book was CRAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"'In the Cut' was a horrible book. I had read the reviews a while back, and most seemed like they liked the book ...let's just say that I don't quite trust Amazon's rating system anymore. Frannie was just a lonely, pathetic character. In the end, I was extremely mad that I actually payed money for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for recycling","review":"I am surprised that this book is considered a National Bestseller. I can only imagine that is because of the sex. Moore seems bent on trying to shock the reader with her graphic, violent, but ultimately sad sex scenes. In this day and age when we are supposed to all be going green, when the \\"in thing\\" is to recycle and the conservation of natural resources, the best thing would have been to never bother publishing this mess of a book in the first place. Since someone found a reason to publish it, please do the \\"in thing\\" & recycle it instead of reading it. You'll feel better for it, believe me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I really love Susanna Moore's other novels, The Whiteness of Bones, My Old Sweetheart, and Sleeping Beauties. However, this novel was really disturbing to me. I don't know why, maybe because I am used to reading thrillers with happier endings. Susanna Moore still writes well in this novel but I just didn't enjoy it as much as her other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Erotic and Not a Thriller","review":"Moore can write -- well enough to keep the pages turning and to show that she has a brain. But I think she's squandered her talents with this book. The purported \\"eroticism\\" isn't much more than uninspired pornography, and the \\"thrill\\" is pretty much nonexistent, with an ending that is easy and not particularly surprising in the way that a good, intelligent crime/mystery is when it rises above its genre. The narrator is so detached and flat that it's hard to know or feel much about her -- and while that persona may have been Moore's attempt to reflect her ultimate ending (which I won't give away here), the end did not justify the means. I was annoyed that I had to endure a gruesome scene with no payoff, and that I wasted my time reading this book at all when I could have been reading something much more original, complex, and interesting. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Didn't Move","review":"I'm finally done with it. I started to read it years ago but got bored with it and put it down. Now that I've made it thru it, I can see why I put it down in the first place. Wow. I may not be a qualified critic, but I rate this book poorly for the convoluted style the author uses. That is, cramming so much into a single sentence. Even when she mentions a BLT, she spells it out in total. The conversation doesnt flow. I don't even find the sex scenes/references stimulating. (It didnt move) If you're in need of more negativity in your life, if you'd like someone to widen the rift between males and females, then this book is for you. This book, in a way, combines the schizophrenic plot of On The Road and the sexual jadedness of The Bell Jar. Actually, I think On The Road was better written. The high point was the bit about John Wayne Gacy, the murdering clown guy. That was funny, but sick as well. Also, pinning a murder on a detective--that's cold.Okayyy, I think I'm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"neither erotic or thrilling...just trash","review":"Having had to read this book for a university seminar I was obliged to finish it otherwise it would have hit the bin long before I reached the end. Moore seems to think that by piling cliche onto cliche and then hanging 'shocking' sex scenes onto an empty plot she can thrill the reader. But she can't. The erotic writing was FAR from erotic and I ended up laughing out loud at the corny situations the characters found themselves. It misses out on a real opportunity to explore the complex and real dangers that women face in an urban environment. Two-dimensional characters and a real sense of laziness about the plot-line combined to make an eminently forgetable experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure sleaze","review":"The characters seemed so phony that I couldnt wait until they all bit the dust.

However there are so many more stories than the few presented in fairy tale books or in the recent tv mini-series. I decided I wanted to read all of the stories.I did some research into different translations and versions. I chose this one because it was a new translation and the translator was of Middle-Eastern origins. Haddaway explains in the introduction how his style of writing, the sentences structure, and word choice reflect the cadence and style of the stories he heard told as a boy growing up.The language is beautiful, well written, and very funny. There is the occasional problem with vague pronoun use, but English pronouns can be very tricky for non-native speakers (and for native speakers as well). These problems are few and far between and don't detract from the stories. I highly recommend this edition of The Arabian Nights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good translation makes a long confusitng book","review":"Because I do not speak Arabic and know very little about the culture it was difficult to understand parts of this book. I believe the translator did an excellent job. Reading the history of the story, we find it was often recited for many many years, and wasn't put into print sometime around the fourteenth century. If I was a historian I would definitely want this translation, but as a enjoyment reader I would rather the translator give me more color. That would probably draw criticism from other readers, but leave a more entertaining story. It was entertaining at times and did provide a flavor of what the middle east may of been like, but the stories got drug down in details that tends to drown the book. But stories like these should be read, to expand our social context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical inaccuracy at its best","review":"The whole story of One Thousand and One Nights is Persian and the characters are Persian, including pure Persian names, however its better known as \\"Arabian Nights\\".

Husain Haddawy has chosen to use an airy conversational language, which is (I suspect) much closer to how the Nights would have sounded to the contemporary listener. It's a pleasure to read, the more so because of the quality and care taken with the physical book itself.

Maybe it was simply due to his personality or maybe the Stalinist chill at the time this was written. Teleshov was rare in that he managed to escape state persecution.

Amazon only does replacements, not replacement parts. So now that I have the thing all set up, I need to tear it down and re-box it if I want it replaced. Oh - and they're on back-order to boot! So you may consider an alternative supplier (one who can provide repair parts) if you need to use the machine any time soon or repair it in the future.

I called Shop Fox and they promptly sent me replacement parts. After I replaced the broken parts I made a couple of test mortars.

Acceptable range and rubber surface is very appealing.Now for the down side receiver is way to big it is interfering with nearest USB port, casing for the receiver is poorly made and easily falls apart(fixed with duct-tape). Mouse often freezes and requires manual reset in addition to being picky with surfaces. And lastly the software does not support X64 bit so 4 way scrolling doesn't work on some computers.(I personally like the modularity of the mice after it broke i was able to take it apart and salvage a receiver without any soldering already with pins connectors, haven't decided how to use laser and wheel tracking yet :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scroll wheel makes this mouse annoyingly worthless","review":"I have been a professional computer programmer for nearly a decade. I inherited one of these that had been used very little.For the most part it is nice (the form factor and the rubber sides in particular), but I can confirm what others have mentioned regarding the scroll wheel. It's behavior is annoyingly inconsistent and makes using this mouse an exercise in frustration. It makes a page jump up and down when attempting to scroll. This is not a quality you want in one of your two primary input devices. I thought it might be a driver issue or low batteries, but reading the reviews here confirmed this device is a shoddy piece of junk destined for the junk bin.I removed the plastic teflon-like feet, put them on my old Logitech, then threw this mouse away."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely satisfied","review":"Excellant service!

The laser is super sensitive, and I found I could run the mouse over just about any surface and easily move the pointer around the screen. However, the mouse kept losing it's signal, and I had to repeatedly push the button on it and the USB plug to reconnect. This got old quickly, but was something I could deal with, because I was tired of using the touchpad on my laptop. Soon after that, though, I stopped being able to sync the mouse to the plug, and the mouse became useless. Now, I'm back to using the touchpad, and I'll probably just wait until I get a laptop with Bluetooth to try to go with a wireless mouse again.

The box on this one said 30 ft, and it was the only one Best Buy had with that feature. I had never heard of Kensington, but I thought I'd give it a shot. Within an hour of taking it out of the box the laser tracker just died. Scroll still works, the buttons still work- so it has to be something in the tracking. New batteries and moving it closer to the receiver didn't help either.It's going back tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot for desktops","review":"The mouse worked great (and feels great) at first, but quickly started glitching and locking up.

Not a problem for laptops, but my desktop is on the floor and the mouse is unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Grrrrrrrr\\"bage","review":"After reading the reviews here, it sounds like I got the worst of everyone's problems. The mouse never tracked correctly, the left click button died after about 4 hours of use, then the mouse completely expired after about 8 hours of use.A fresh set of batteries and two hours of trying to revive the little critter later, I took it back to Best Buy for a new one. I stuck with this Kensington because I like the rubber grip feel and I figured that I must have gotten a defective unit. I didn't think it was possible, but the brand new replacement mouse with new batteries actually performed worse.One word. GARBAGE. Save yourself the time and aggravation and get a different mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, precise mouse; some units have scroll wheel issues","review":"The only thing keeping this product from getting five stars from me is that I, like other reviewers, initially received a mouse with a defective scroll wheel. It had a jumpy, annoying effect on the page being scrolled. I returned it to the retailer as defective, and received a replacement which works perfectly.I have small hands (5'2\\" female) and I found the shape and design pleasing and comfortable (assuming you use a mouse right-handed), but any bigger would be too big. The precision laser tracking is suitable for graphics editing or high-end gaming. And the battery life is great, lasting me months on end.The included MouseWorks software is nice, and lets you customize the functions of the five buttons and the scroll wheel. The only drawback to the software is that I couldn't figure out how to emulate a CTRL button keypress (CTRL+TAB to switch tabs in web browser). But that's getting pretty picky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible scroll wheel","review":"Like others have mentioned, the scroll wheel on this mouse does not function properly, even when you install the Kensington software and even with a fresh set of batteries, and even when the USB receiver is right next to the mouse. The scroll wheel does not move up and down incrementally but jumps randomly or not at all. It is horrible.Otherwise, this would have been a great mouse since is the pointing and clicking works fine and the rubberized sides make it very comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't allow sleep on Mac OS 10.4","review":"I opened this mouse up and plugged it into my computer. I thought it tracked pretty well. The action on the scroll wheel leaves a lot to be desired. It was clunky and the feedback \\"click\\" sensation was inconsistent.I was prepared to deal with it, until I put my iMac G5 to sleep and it came right back on. I repeated three times and every time it came right back on. Unplugged the wireless mouse receiver and what do you know, it stays asleep.Packed the mouse right back up and it's going back. Testing for sleep function on the Mac is something that Kensington should be doing, not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but problems","review":"I bought this mouse for my iMac running OS 10.4 because I wanted a right button and a scroll wheel. The first thing I noticed upon use is that the mouse did not track very well on most surfaces including my old my old cloth mouse pad, desktop or paper. I had to buy a new mouse pad that was described as being designed for optical mice. This mouse also drains batteries much faster than I expected. I'm getting about three weeks of life out of a fresh pair of AAs.Perhaps the biggest annoyance, though, is the scroll wheel performance. The scroll wheel is almost unusable. When I attempt to scroll down the page I get a series of forward and backward jumps that generally trend in the desired direction.I suppose it's possible that I received a defective unit, but I see that another reviewer also had a scroll wheel problem. Nonetheless, I am unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Company won't support you on this","review":"I bought this item and used it a short time before it died. I contacted Kensington via e-mail & was assured they'd send me a new unit. Two+ weeks pass... Wrote them again. Four weeks pass... I finally phone them and am connected to some very polite people in India who tell me to sit tight - a replacement is coming. More weeks pass. Nothing. Spoke to them again and was given some BS story about stock coming available in the next few weeks. Weeks later, still nothing. I tried finding a US-based office to call, but Kensington has pretty much cleansed their site of any way of contacting them except thru those polite people in India who are long on promises but short on everything else. Finally gave up. Kensington will not help you despite what they may say. Look elsewhere for any alternative to Kensington."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glitchy and inconsistent at best","review":"I have to agree with the other negative reviews. I just purchased this at BestBuy for a good deal and have always been please with Kensington until this POS. For starters, the responsiveness is very fickle - sometimes you click on something and it opens - other times you can click away and it's as if the mouse has died...nothing. It has a tendency to be jumpy too. I have tried changing the settings every which way but still no luck in how this mouse handles. I am not a gamer, I just use this for everyday browsing and computing purposes and so far, I am extremely disappointed in this. I am considering taking it back as previous wirelss mice have never given me so much trouble. Yes, it's pretty. Yes, it's laser and feels nice in your hand but who cares when you feel like throwing it threw a window every day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I purchased this mouse to replace a previous Kensington Wireless Mouse because I was so pleased with the performance of the prior mouse.What a disappointment!My laptop never automatically recognized the mouse after a reboot or logon.

The tracking is excellent on pretty much any surface, as you'd expect from a laser mouse. The battery life is adequate (about a month or two for me with standard AAs) and you can extend it by switching the mouse to off while not in use.The scroll wheel is horrible; it doesn't handle a single \\"click\\" properly, so in games like Quake 4 it becomes a nightmare for switching weapons. Finally, the mouse just died on me. I still need to test it out on another machine to verify it's not something else, but the mouse doesn't move a wink or respond to clicks anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Doctora Isabel's Childrearing book in Spanish!","review":"This book is just what we've been waiting for!

Because of the unnecessary tabs, the sheet jams all the time. I use Canon Pixma MP150. This printer has no problem with the previous product or any other papers.

Printed labels have that copy-paper inky-bleed look to them because the paper is literally too cheap and thin to display ink properly.2.

In practice, these holes near the pull-tabs cause the paper to jam about 50% of the time.3. The perforation around the center holes often does not peel easily and tears.4. Online templates (I used the photoshop one) don't line up correctly.You're basically screwed at every turn with this product.

I truly have never had a problem with paper going through my printer, but this - frankly - sucked. The stomper software is pretty lousy for bringing in artwork created outside the program, but I got that down after two mis-registered prints. SO I THOUGHT I was finally in the clear- until this cheap backing and paper started ripping in the print feed. How hard does Avery have to work to make a decent product. Jut to be clear- the original stomper paper that came in the pack worked fine through the same printer. So I can only assume the problem is this product.

It is no doubt a great book and a must read for all races..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is simply the most amazing and interesting biography, i have ever read. What makes Lee's narrative interesting are his crisp observations supported by official British documents made public after 35 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good understanding of political strength","review":"I often wondered why Singapore bucked the trend in Asia (even now enjoying a higher per capita GNP than the UK) till I read this book. Lee's book provides real insights in the political roots of Singapore's success. I recommend this book strongly. For an understanding of the business roots of Singapore's success, I recommend Haley's \\"New Asian Emperors: the Overseas Chinese, their Strategies and Competitive Advantages\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story about a great man","review":"What an amazing story of how Lee started Singapore on the road from colony to greatness.

It just goes to show that how biased writings like that can influence people. Readers must learn that there are at least two sides of this story. The author only lets you know HIS side of the story. The bad side is always covered up. Readers must understand that in this tight society created by the author, people cannot present alternative views without being prosecuted. Don't be misled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singapore Story or selective vision: Lee and the truth","review":"Lee Kuan Yew, the doyen of the People's Action Party, and well known opponent of democratic values in the Asia Pacific has again attempted reformulate history according to whims of the moment. On a personal level, for example, his own account of his family history is amazingly in contrast to other reputable sources. His own account of his familial background is amazingly contradicts his own Peranakan (Chinese/Malay) background. This is obviously a politically calculated move on his part. Firstly, he is obviously rather embarrassed about his own familial background ie. being part Malay. Secondly, his recent push to Sinofy Singapore and especially it's perception of itself can be seen as another attempt on his part to mould SIngapore into his own image. On the whole the book is not necessarily an accurate of history but a good indication of the personal hangups of Mr Lee Kuan Yew."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather bad english","review":"the subject of the book is great but the english sucks. future authors should be aware that they have to be able to write a book in proper US/British English. \\"kiasus\\" might say that it is mr lee's typical writing style but honestly, what more could be expected of a kid who was raised and breed in colonial singapore.......a kid who once adored his british masters. seriously, mr lee should get himself a respected editor in his future writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad english ...","review":"the subject is superb. the writing (of the English language) rather poor.

How could an island surrounded by belligerant neighbors survive to become one of the richest, the cleanest, the most crime-free and the most efficient nations in the world? The Singapore of today is the result of a strict and efficient government that have provided housing for all its 4.1 million people, a prosperous free market economy, strong defense, religious and racial cohesion, a sound educational system and an incorruptible government. The Singapore of today, 100 years ago, would have been unimaginable; the success of one man, in a matter of 40 years has transformed a tiny island that many world leaders thought would never survive into a first world country."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man Who Made Singapore a Success","review":"Being voted as one of the most influential Asian leaders, itproves that Mr Lee has been a respected leader to one and all. Thebook goes into details the hardships faced by Singapore when it tried to gain self-rule and the serious corruption in the government then. At the same time, he added humour in it and tells us more of his adolescence and marriage life. I really anticipate the second volume to be published soon as it will offer deeper insight to how this influential man would transform a tiny \\"red dot\\" on the world map to a nation which made its mark on the international stage within just a few decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"A note to the reader from Macau (posted 26 July 1999)","review":"It might be of interest to you to know that Lee Kuan Yew's writing style was deliberately adapted and simplified to reach not just scholars, but a larger audience: the general public, and more specifically, the younger generation of Singaporeans. If you have read his speeches, you will know that he is exceptionally eloquent and known for being adept at the English language.Perhaps the greater purpose that the Senior Minister had in mind was that this book will become a text that is found in every history classroom in Singapore, although it will undoubtedly be dissected by scholars as well.Lee Kuan Yew's straight-forward style of writing conveyed historic facts, his political analysis, and acute judgment of people and circumstances with clarity, which was not to be clouded by style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping tale","review":"A simple and concise history of the nation-state, my original home. A handbook for building a nation-state, or any othermulti-cultural organization. In this volume, LKY provides insight into his decision making, but does not spend much time reflecting upon his deepest motivations/expectations. The rationalizations are kept on an even-keel, and the text has a bit of a grade-school history text feel to it.I'm looking forward to the 2nd volume. It would probably be too much for LKY to describe his deepest rationalizations, his actions speak louder than his words.

I can't believe this series is no longer in print. The kids are so normal, the dialogue natural, and the mysteries engrossing. When I read about Trixie, I became a \\"Bob-White\\" - these were my friends. Several years ago, I found my old collection in a box and re-read them.

Firstly, the lack of vocals on this album is depressing. I purchased the CD because I love his voice. But the one really decent cut, Lone Star Angel, is predominantly female on the vocals; Basso's backup voice is an afterthought. And that's my second complaint; every song with vocals is in English! The instrumental cuts are all monotonous, gloomy, and again, monotonous. There is a glimmer here and there of a riff that might have been successfully extrapolated into a catchy, kitschy tune, but he misses the spaceship every time. Even the cover of the CD is ridiculous with a Medusa-haired supermodel preparing to resuscitate him with electric paddles on the moon's surface. Profania is a truly bizarre foray into what someone told him would be a good crossover genre. I hope he goes back to his Rock en Espanol roots or at the very least his native tongue on his next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are daft if you thought you would get this product for four cents...","review":"Tennis balls are tennis balls.

They run through my laser printer cleanly and adhere well, blocking things underneath (I tested it on a white box that had black sharpie on it; the sharpie was obscured by the label 100%). They are a bit small for my box-shipping needs (I use the half-sheet labels for that) but for mailing correspondence to the same address every month, it's quite easy to run off the addresses on a sheet of these labels and keep them with my stamps."},{"rating":"2","title":"TrueBlock Covers Previous Label Perfectly; Great Solution for Recycling Mailers","review":"These shipping labels work great for recycling mailers. I've used them to mail several packages & it's a great convenience to no longer have to spend five minutes or more trying to peel off old labels before re-using padded mailers.With Avery's TrueBlock technology, it's a snap to quickly print a label that completely covers the old label. These labels work just like conventional laser labels--just use Avery's template to print the labels you need. The \\"magic\\" is in the dark, vinyl-like coating on the \\"sticky side\\" of the label. This dark screening coat completely blocks out the label underneath, so nothing shows through. Just a clean, neatly printed new, bright white label.Elegantly engineered recycling solution; Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't go wrong","review":"useful, work great, can't really go wrong with these labels if this is what you need. works well with MS Word and my Epson printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another quality Avery product","review":"The free template works well in creating printable labels. This size also allows me to have the return address on the left hand corner so only 1 label is needed for mailing rather than 2. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Room for return and covers up, too","review":"These mailing labels are the right size to have your computer put your return address in small font and the sender's address in a large font so that you can use a single envelope to properly prepare your envelope or package for the mail. As promised by the maker, the labels are quite opaque so that they can be stuck over a previous label without worrying that it might be scanned through the new label. MS Word has a template for labels of this type. In addition, the Avery site has a set of templates you can download so that you don't have to create your own label from scratch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lables","review":"These really do offer everything that you can want. They feed through printers without getting stuck, peel off easily, but not too easily, and don't seem flimsy. The built-in templates for major word processors are fantastic. This size--2x4--is pretty ideal too. They might be called shipping labels, but the \\"address labels\\" are a tad small, and I think these are better for most uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work Well","review":"Not much to really say about a label...but they do pull off easily, so what is most important, works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addressing privacy","review":"It will come as no surprise that these labels are easy to use. They're an Avery product, so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them, so formatting the print data is a snap. What makes these labels different is their construction. They're thicker than the typical mailing label, with a white front and a dark gray sticky side. This makes the labels truly opaque, so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over. I've tried to see through them, and I haven't been able to. This allows envelopes to be re-used while protecting the privacy of the previous addressees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Good Avery Quality Labels","review":"Avery labels always do a good job for me, and particularly print well with MS Word, I had no problems printing labels properly aligned and the print quality was excellent, very clear without any smudges.

It comes with a small measuring cup and a skimpy little recipe book which is almost useless. However, you can easily get more recipe ideas by searching the internet.

The tabs on the labels come off too easily sometimes making it very difficlt to use the stomperThe software that comes with sucks.

I bought the new version and it's such a huge downgrade. Why do I have to calibrate my printer when I didn't before? Even after you calibrate your printer, the text still is never perfectly on the label, I've wasted so much ink and labels trying to get this stupid thing centered and it never prints perfectly. Oh & the side tabs never rip off cleanly, my cds have to look atleast half-way professional when I send them out to clients, and it doesn't look too good with tear marks on the each side of the label...this product is JUNK.Thanks for ruining a great product guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software is horrible","review":"I was mostly interested in the stomper when making this purchase, the template software was secondary. I am fairly fluent in using different types of software in the normal course of my business, (MS Publisher, Adobe Photoshop). Just trying to insert a picture file required many steps and was extrememly awkward to use.Additionally I had problems with the printing lining up on the label sheet. I would print on plain paper first, hold the page up to the light with the label page and all would be good. Then I would run a sheet with the labels and it would be off by 1/2\\". I have no idea why this would occur."},{"rating":"1","title":"was not what I expected.","review":"cd/dvd labeling system was not what I expected. there were no dvd lables, just cd labels.

The adhesive on the labels is not sticky enough. I discover this when I burned a music CD and was getting disk error messages on my device.

The labels always come out just like they show on the program, the program is super easy to use, I sat down and after five minuets I had made my first label designed! the only draw back I have found is that sometimes the labels don't stick exactly on center and there is a slight uncovered spot not enough to interfere with any player just enough to show a little bit of silver on the disc but it doesn't bother me at all.

But I do like a good story, and a good movie. This is not your typical slasher or vampire flick. This is a real film. I can't think of another vampire movie with more terrifying monsters. This is in the veins of great scares like Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later. You really fear for the lives of the poor people in this town, and you can't see any way out for them. I especially liked the crescendo of the film from relative calm, to getting a little worried, to several minutes of all-out terror, and then back down again. This is certainly one of best executed horror films I have seen. It's definitely worth the watch if you like the occasional scare, but aren't into the crappy horrors that we are used to hearing about."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 days of night bluray","review":"movie was very good but maybe not the best sort of movie to view on bluray it is a horror film set mostly at night"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, no frights to be found here!","review":"I was told this was unconventional and original. And I love vampire films, to a point. The point is when it becomes disbelieving and cliche. Well, this movie crossed all of those. First off, I have a problem with the title. Not only did it not feel like it took place over a span of 30 days, but I didnt even believe it took place within a span of 30 minutes. Honestly, it was quite ridiculous and wouldn't fool anybody watching it. Secondly, the ending was awful, cliche, pridictable and boring. The vampires themselves were quite chilling, the way they looked and appeared out of nowhere, but even that got old. If you scare easily, you may enjoy this, but don't look for much of a plot, whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 Days Too Long","review":"Starts off relatively well with some fine visuals but regresses into quite a silly film with a silly ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even waste your four dollars on the rental","review":"This has to be one of the worst vampire movies I have ever seen. When I first heard about this movie, the plot sounded like a good idea...a month of darkness-the ideal place for vampires that are looking for an easy meal without the annoying presence of sunlight. Sounded good but the movie was just a fake bloody piece of garbage. I think the acting by the so-called vampires is what finally did me in...all that heavy breathing I thought they were giving birth! Josh Hartnett must have lost a bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 days of disappointment","review":"There's no suspense in this movie. The fighting scences are quick and badly filmed. They're not exciting at all. There are 2 shocking scenes. They're all related to killing with axes. One of them is exceptionally appalling because it involves a child. Besides that, I felt detached while watching this film. I did not care about the characters. The 2 main characters, the sheriff and his estranged wife rarely spoke with each other. The last scene where the sheriff sat with his wife looking at sunrise was supposed to be touching. However, I felt nothing.It's worth watching for curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bad","review":"I had high hopes for this movie seeing the acclaim it received from various circles.Well, the proof is in the viewing and this one is not worth the bother.What starts out as a great setting with some wonderful cinematography soon turns into the run of the mill humans-running-and-hiding-from-creatures-who-can-make-mince-meat-out-of-them.

It is particularly irritating because it could have been good. The concept was interesting, but the execution was awful. Almost without exception the characters did something other than what you would have done in the same circumstances. Save your money and time. If you want action in cold weather get \\"The Thing\\" with Kurt Russel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best vampire movie in a very long time","review":"This is the best vampire movie I've seen in a very long time. The vampires are actually very smart, somewhat scary, and hard to kill, as opposed to the usual stupid, mindless idiots that can easily be beaten into submission by teenage girls like Buffy. The movie is actually more about how the remaining residents of the town have to work together in order to survive. In my opinion, one of the best parts of the movie is a quote by the lead vampire: \\"Burn the town, destroy everything. We've worked for centuries to make humans believe that we are only a bad dream.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good horror.","review":"I haven't read the books, but plan to. I would've liked a different ending, but the movie itself did keep my eyes glued to the screen. When vampires come to a town that's plunged into darkness for thirty days the result is a blood bath! I was wondering why they had to eat so much so fast...must be used to the 'all you can eat buffet'. I love a good horror, among many other genres of films and books, and this wasn't a disappointment. If you're a horror fan and you haven't yet seen 'The Descent', that should also be on your list! I will say that the actor Danny Huston gets my vote for 'creepiest vampire' in the history of modern vampire films! When you add a snowstorm, darkness and isolation to the mix the viewer can't help but feel a 'chill'.Chrissy K.

However, as a comic book adaptation, it's a great movie. In fact I'm almost inclined to say that the movie is better than the series it was based on.The movie is based on issues 1-3 and does a great job bringing to life the illustrations in the original comics with the cinematography imitating the original coloring, shading and lighting used in the comics.Also, ironically, I think as an actor, Josh Hartnett gives the best performance of his career.If you are a fan of comic books and are mildly unimpressed with the recent movie adaptations, this movie is for you. But if you are a horror fan especially of the vampire genre, you may be dissappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vampire Movie","review":"Good movie in theatres. Excellent quality in Blu-Ray.

The action sequences are better than average, the special effects are better than average. The story is very typical, the only standout from a story aspect is that this is the first monster movie I have ever seen where the people that attempt to hide from the monsters are actually successful in hiding from them. The downside to that is that hiding from monsters...not really that entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"slightly dissapointing at times","review":"for a movie based on a comic books series i wasn't really disappointed with it. i still much prefer the comics over the movie and can't help but wonder if they will continue with making the comics into more movies since they are so neatly organized into smaller series of 4 or 5 comics. the only sad thing is how many people had never heard of or even knew it was a comic until the movie came out.but my overall thoughts on the movie is that is doesn't really stray much from the comics in overall storyline so i can't really complain to much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Vampire Movie","review":"30 Days Of Night has an extremely interesting premise in which an Alaskan town in the midst of winter and 30 days of darkness is besieged by a horde of vampires. That's about the only interesting thing about this film. There is loads of blood and violence, but the plot is thin at best with a ridiculous ending. The acting is marginal too be kind with a very stiff performance from Josh Hartnett. One of the more annoying aspects of the film is that the lead vampire (played by Danny Huston) is the only vampire that \\"speaks\\" but the language is no more than some clicks and clucks which is subtitled. As some other reviewers have noted, the film doesn't depict the vampires as cultured fashionistas, but it goes the other direction and basically reduces them to a pack of rabid dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"They gotta be joking","review":"For anyone who might think this is better than a tenth rate bore flick, you are wrong.Don't get me wrong I adore slasher flicks providing there is actually a story behind all the blood guts and gore.

That is not the proper way to do things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"No storyline, no suspense, tons of blood, and just plain boring.

I was thinking what a terrifying idea it was, a place like Alaska, one of the few places on Earth where there would literally be 30 days of night. There's no where to hide from a vampire!However, this movie failed to pick up steam. We have the standard subplot with the police force who are estranged and headed for divorce court. The town is shutting down as they are prepping for their 30 days of night, something unique to the residents of Alaska. But ... it just didn't fly. Instead it turned depressing real quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Days of Night","review":"I'm not a huge fan of horror but I do enjoy good Vampire movies. I went into this not expecting anything and was pleasantly surprised. Now it is a bit gory but it is done in away that is pretty much expected. The vampires were nicely done and the acting throughout is pretty good. The story line of Barrow, Alaska entering it's 30 days of night and being layed siege to by a group of vampires off a foreign freighter is pretty frightening. A small group of townspeople try to hide until the Sun returns. Using guerilla tactics they are able to get weapons, food, and find shelter. I was impressed and found the acting so good I actually became attached to a couple characters. The directing and camera were good as well. The set crew did a great job creating a believeble small town in Alaska. Overall if you enjoy horror you will probably want to give this one a try. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch \\"Ghost of Mars\\", \\"Vampires, and \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". Good quality DVD and replayability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"Boring\\"?","review":"I'm a big vampire fan, so when this came out I was excited. When I actually watched it I was highly disappointed. The teeth of these vampires made them look comical because their lips protruded out. I'm guessing they were speaking Latin, which is fine, but the vampires were more prone to screeching and making odd sounds then actually speaking to each other. Their attitude was more like zombies than vampires, because they acted like complete idiots with no brains. The plot line was too predictable. Halfway through the movie I knew exactly what was going to happen at the end. Really not worth the time it takes to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick cuts= loss of interest","review":"You know it's too dark, when you lose all sense of the action.

Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special, Not Even Midnight Movie Fare","review":"I saw the film and I was not terribly impressed. It was something to see, sort of a Night of the Living Dead survival horror. Of which there is nothing really scary only gory and gore used with a good horror film is actually more effective than simply used for cheap gasps. Wooden performances. A cheap thrill. Not even camp value. Avoid or wait till dvd. It should be out fairly soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"If you love your typical vampire movie then I suppose you'll love this one. But there's nothing new here. The vampires are freaky and there's a lot of blood, but it's the sequence of events that gets in the way.Instead of focusing on how to avoid crazed vampires for 30 days, the movie skips over significant periods of time with no explanation of what happened in between. Not to mention that the vampires had literally 30 days to find the hidden humans in a town where there couldn't have been more than 20 or 30 places to hide. The movie makes the vampires look freaky, but incredibly stupid.Also, Ben Foster plays the exact same character in this movie as '3:10 to Yuma', Josh Hartnett seems bored, and the relationship his character has with Melissa George isn't believable at all.But again, if you want typical vampire gore, enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh, not that good","review":"I didn't care for this movie, normally I love vampire & gorefest movies but I just didn't really like this one, why? you may ask, here's why: the camera. the camera jumped & jiggled when it went to a vampire killing someone then movied away really fast before your brain can process what you just saw, & the same thing with the final fight, you couldn't tell what was going on when Josh Hartnett & the vampire leader (didn't catch his name) started trading blows really fast, & it's an action movie (I guess you can count it as horror also, I wouldn't unless you scream during Friday the 13th & Halloween movies, I don't) which you watch for the fighting, right? well if you aren't able to see what happened it's basically just an action movie without action"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires? No, Just Another Zombie Movie","review":"Why do people persist in calling this a vampire movie? Because they climbed buildings or moved fast? Sure they are fast and have superhuman strength, but they didn't need it. Everyone just stood around and waited to be slaughtered. When was the last time you saw a vampire order raw hamburger, or leave 95% of the blood on the ground? I like vampire movies, from John Carpenter's 'Vampires' to 'Lost Boys' because they're usually pretty intelligent. I do not like zombie movies because there's only one plot.

I love vampire movies, which is why I rented this, but the mindlessness of these guys was pointless. I can't stand mindless killers most of the time.

A mysterious bum shows up. Here he is working with the vampires. He disappears. No explanation. You see him in a prison cell and then you don't. He never makes another appearance. The vampires just hiss. Some vampire victims become vampires while others don't. Why? A giant explosion happens yet the building is not destroyed nor is anyone killed. What was the point? The only hope was a total Hollywood style wipe-out of the vampires. Doesn't happen. This was the worst film of 2007.

Not to mention great SFX and Kill scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite but close","review":"For those of you who liked the graphic novel, this is close but not quite it. The director does a great job in keeping to the spirit of the story but makes a few unnecessary plot changes I felt. Some of the scenes are taken almost verbatim from the original story and are done remarkably well. As a whole this is not a movie for the timid. These are not the nice quaint Anne Rice Euro-vampires we've all become accustomed to in the last 10 years or so. No Twilight vampire-lite here, this is your old school blood drinkers amped up to an almost savage animal like behavior. This movie starts fast and doesn't let up until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice twist on vampires","review":"This splashy adaptation of Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith's highly inventive vampire graphic novel works on most levels.

The survivors of the initial attack now have to find a way to hide and last until the sun returns, or they're Vampy Chow.

But it ended up being a boring, poorly written piece of filth that I wasted a good hour and a half on. The story wasn't at all plausible in the sense that the writers assumed that we the audience already knew things such as where the vampires came from, and why they were there. And every single death that happened could be predicted way before they happen. And the acting was horrendous.If it wasn't for my best friend being there making fun of the movie as it went along, I would've asked for a refund. It was a good story idea, just very, very poor implementation into film. Don't waste your time on this film, if you want a good vampire movie, go watch \\"The Lost Boys\\", \\"Nosferatu\\", or the Blade series. Pretty much any vampire movie is better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure what people were expecting with this movie...","review":"But if it was a fun, creepy, well shot and decently paced horror movie, they got it. I've seen reviews that bash this movie on the most ridiculous of things, like why the vampires scream...what? Are you really nitpicking a movie about bloodsucking undead in Alaska? I really think the haters need to get over their preconceptions on this movie, sure it's going to have cliches and jumps scares, but theres so much to like. The vampires are way more in line with my personal preferences on how they would behave; rather than trying to sexually seduce or hypnotize a victim, they just tear them apart. They're vicious beasts, and it's a fantastic portrayal. There's good (not great) lines of dialogue, good action and gore, and it doesn't pull punches. There are problems, sure, but just sit back and enjoy the ride. This isn't a Palme D'or winner about raising a child in a war torn African village...it's a horror movie about vampires. And it's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS IT THAT TIME OF THE MONTH AGAIN? !","review":"'30 Days Of Night' has a good premise, great setting and solid special FX, but it's a poorly executed film! The film starts out interesting enough, but soon turns into a ridiculous and amateurish horror movie with no real tension. 30 days fly by 7 to 9 days at a time with so many people getting killed in the first few minutes it should have only taken half a day to kill everybody in town. It doesn't feel like these people have been trapped anywhere for more than a few minutes! OK, they added facial hair to the men to imply some time had passed, but the time element and isolation were completely forgot about. This was really a missed opportunity as this could have been a really intense film! It turn out to be a pretty mediocre film with one of the stupidest endings I've ever seen in a horror film! Watch it on cable if you must see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope there is more to come...","review":"Finally a movie without the stupid actor/actress. How many movies go downthe drain due to a miscasted character(s). A big plus, is that we haveoutside shots in the great outdoors. These vampires/zombies are prettyfast...dont blink. The movie carries well enough, there is gore and lotsof blood. I like the way they end the movie as they dont try to tell usa sequel is on the way like most horror movie do these days.Good for multiple viewing.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm going to buy a different Aida CD","review":"First the disclaimer - I'm new to opera and not an expert on sound quality. That being said - I simply can't listen to this CD. There is something about the sound that isn't right. It's like static or white noise or something that is especially prevalent when there is singing. Again, I'm not a sound quality expert, I just know something about this CD makes it bother me and I can't listen to it. My wife, on the other hand, doesn't notice the stuff that bothers me at all, so take that for whatever it's worth. Regarding the opera - it seems fantastic. The music sounds great and the voices do to. I'm definitely going to buy another Aida CD. I just can't listen to this one. I recommend finding a different recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging sound quality mutes strong performances","review":"With Domingo and Arroyo taking the leading roles, and Abbado conducting, you'd have every right to expect an engaging performance. But the sound quality is so low that the performers are difficult to enjoy. The vocalists sound as though they are singing through several layers of waxed paper, while the orchestra seems to be phoning it in over a cheap handset. Overall, the sound quality approximates that of an early transistor radio. What a shame, since, no doubt, the actual performances were quite wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonically Sabotaged Aida","review":"Yes, this is a great performance, and I'm not going to explore what most listeners have already found out for themselves. What amazes me is the plaudits this recording has received regarding its sound quality. On a high resolution system, this recording is a disaster. When the music is in its quieter moments, the fizz of distortion is startling; in the louder moments there is a dramatic and unpleasant volume increase, and even though in these louder parts clarity and tonal bloom improve somewhat, the haze of distortion around the singers does not. For a mid-price reissue, Opera D'Oro has not done its customers any service. The slipcase, artwork, and libretto cannot balance the unpleasant sound; nor can the fine performance, for that matter, which is a real shame. This is great singing utterly sabotaged by the sonics. Just what are the reviewers who have complimented the sound listening with or through?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound","review":"Well, the singing is good. But the sound is appalling - analog tape dropouts and cockles, poor stereo depth, distortion, useless dynamic and crummy applause editing. So bad it detracts from the music.

Hey, i really love nudity & eroticism myself, but i just can't appreciate it when it is done as crude & untilligent as it is here. Sex still needs to be either plot or character driven even for me, not some mindless random drivel searching for an STD like in these flicks! As one reviewer on a different site said \\"these weren't filmed, they were taped!\\". Pretty much describes it. Even a piece like \\"Mansion of Madness\\" which has appreciable cult status (& much less nudity than some of the others incidentally)is still in very bad reproduction here. I don't recommend you spend your money here unless you are just really looking for low quality, plotless, artless soft-sex tapes.

The internal threads of the valve pin stripped its housing and caused a minor explosion out of the bottle.

I dropped the old pump on a concrete floor and the plastic tabs that held it together broke off - end of pump. The store clerk assured me that this one would work great with my stove, so I grabbed it and headed out on my trip, there being no time to adequately test it beforehand.What a disaster. This pump is basically on-off for anything but a new Simmerlite stove. It's on was also barely a simmering flame, so much of my trip was spent babying the stove, praying that the silly thing would actually boil a pot of water.Upon my return, I took the pump back to the shop for a refund. I will be investigating how I might get the old pump to hold together. It is vastly superior to this cruddy substitute.

My three gripes are, 1) the glass bottle is a bit archaic, 2) at least one capsule has leaked in the bottle and formed a nice coating of B-Complex dust, 3) you have to take 2 capsules per day.

These are nice books with pictures that are for the most part very good illustrations of each engine covered. These aren't in depth on each engine, just the basic figures and a few pages of commentary on the road that purchased them and what sort of service they were used in. It's handy to have this type of book around because whatever you run into in an article that mentions an engine of the wheel arrangement covered you can get a look at that particular class of engine on that partiular road, a photo of the particular engine class, a bit of basic information on how and when the road used them as well.

Steve had been camplaining about his life and said, \\"I just want to go hide.\\" Two-year old Lauren piped up, \\"I'll count.\\" After reading Jerry Stocking's book I know God was speaking through Lauren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever","review":"I read about 25 books a year and have for the past twenty years.

Not only was it a waste of money, it was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be titled \\"Laughing AT God\\"","review":"The only thing talking to Jerry is familiar spirits, who will deceive you in order to control you. This New Age spiritual bondage book mocks God, by elevating the position of evil spirits."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"The company advertised the product to be 6 inches by 9inches in the description, but it is really ONLY 5.25 inches by 6 inches. I would have ordered the medium if I'd known the size of the small one was falsely advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Show That Started It All!","review":"Hercules and Xena could never stop this show. When the show was cancelled other shows tried to create what The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor tried to do. This show will never die in the minds of true viewers. This show is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book ever written","review":"We have all had the experience of reading a book that speaks to our own experience, and identifying with it. Doubtless, this is such a book for some people, as evidenced by the other reviews. However, on its own merits, this book is simply horrible. The premise is ridiculous, the characters are unbelievable, and the story is internally inconsistent. The writing is so bad it could be a cariacture (remember Snoopy typing \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\"?) and the editing (as noted by another reader) is non-existent. For anyone who has ever been to Brimfield, it is obvious that the depiction in the book is completely unrealistic.I am a big fan of a good story without requiring that it have \\"redeeming social value.\\" Colleen McCollough is a good example of this kind of writer. But I do want my beach novels to be well written, and this one is anything but."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader Beware!","review":"The premise of the book - that people search for objects to complete themselves - was of thought provoking. The author's style, however, was far too overdone for my tastes. He repeated characteristics of both people and places, far too many times. How many times can he refer to Brimfield as \\"the ultimate one-night stand\\" -- I got it the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The whole world loves Italian BUDDY GRECO","review":"If you're a BUDDY GRECO fan, this is for you! The first BUDDY GRECO album with no classic songs or hip versions of ballads. I never heard one of these songs before. All recorded with some Italian friends of BUDDY GRECO. Listen to surprising songs as NEW JERSEY, NICKELODEON RAG and THE WHOLE WORLD LOVES ITALIANS. This is once more the cream of the entertainers. Want more??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Beyond the Good Days","review":"No vocalist had the vocal punch and drive of Buddy Greco....but that was countless years past. By the time this CD, Walk A Little Faster, was recorded, that vocal distinction of Buddy Greco was sorely lacking. This CD, to this reviewer, is a grave disappointment. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and versatile","review":"My kids are two very different children. One is rambunctious and into anything he can hit, kick, roll or drive, while the other is gentle, imaginative and laid back. Both kids LOVE these automoblox.Drive them. Disassemble them.

What's also nice is the pieces are color-coded so that you can remember which parts go with which car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cars!","review":"My son received 2 mini automoblox cars as a gift from his uncle. He really enjoyed taking them apart and re-building them into different designs. I love that they are not \\"theme-y\\" (i.e.,from any particular show or movie) and that they foster imagination. I must add, though, that one plastic prong that holds on a wheel broke--and my son is not rough on his toys. I've heard that the manufacturer will replace parts but I have not yet contacted them about this. Still, it has not deterred me from purchasing this set of 3, which my son will receive as a Christmas gift. I look forward to seeing the new car creations he designs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GIFT!","review":"Our 5 year old absolutely loves these cars! They are very well built, durable enough for the rigorous tests that an adventurous 5 year old can put them through!

Great gift idea, and also great as collectibles for him to pass on to his children someday!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplistic Perfection","review":"They're durable, nicely built and fun to rebuild into different configurations.

It seems like my kids are more likely to lose parts than gain something from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoegazing grunge or grungy shoegazing","review":"If you like 90's indie/alternative rock, you'll probably like this EP. You hear elements of hard rock, glam, goth, and a few more influences thrown into the mix and the end result is not bad-- better than average mid-to-late 90's indie rock. A couple of the tracks are weak, but the rest are pretty solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent follow-up to \\"Deeper Kind of Slumber\\".","review":"I first heard this band with their last album, and remember telling a friend to listen to how great the music was and forget about the annoying singer. On this new release, group leader Edlund uses his strange, baritone vocal style to much greater effect, on an album that improves upon their gothic, moody sound. Much more focused and better produced than the last album, Skeletron should appeal to anybody into the Type O Negative/Eurogoth scene. The album goes from heavy, guitar-oriented riffing to moody keyboard intervals, usually in the same song. I could have done without their Rolling Stones cover (although it's better than most cover songs) and with the loss of their lead guitarist, the guitar solos are basically non-existent. Nevertheless, Tiamat have produced an excellent, mature album with a style much their own. That in itself makes it better than 90% of all the other crappy hard rock/metal out there now. Worth a listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best Tiamat yet","review":"Damn, this album not only beats the hell out of everything Tiamat has ever done, but it also is one of the flat out best albums of the past 5 years. I can't describe how much I liked it at first listen...and it only grew on me from there. I won't waste any time raving about this wonderful album, just go buy it and see for yourself. You will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"THis was the first Tiamat cd I bought, and I gotta say, I wasn't disappointed. Dark and melancholic, this disc just oozes ambience. Its got a pretty ionteresting blend of electronica-induced doom, with a good amount of industrial. My favorites are Church of Tiamat, Dust is our Fare, AS long as You Are Mine, and Lucy. The instrumental, Diyala, is pretty cool to. Its a good cd to put on, and then just sit back and chill to. Reccomended for fans of Type O Negative, Pink Floyd, and the like. Definately a band to check out. Also, the vocalist has a really good clean voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry; A Skip For Me.","review":"the pop of tiamat's works, I could call this album \\"a failed attempt at stoner rock\\" somewhat with not so pleasing vocals and not that good music. not my style at all..a deeper kind of slumber go go go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tiamat's BEST","review":"Well, if you want some of the best music around, just buy this cd, and pick up Wild Honey too. Anyway, this is a fine album, the production is really a treat. Some really nice vocals in parts, and some people say its lost its atmosphere, but in my opinion its stronger than ever on here. Worth the cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to believe","review":"I'm tired of seeing the best doom/death acts turn goth all of the time. Sure, it works with some acts, but Tiamat? As far back as Wildhoney, I have been disappointed with their musical tangents into the progressive realm as they didn't seem to pull it off well. I still had hope, however, until the release of \\"Skeleton Skeletron\\". . . now all I hear is poorly presented gothic music with little redeemable musicianship anywhere within. It's little more than gothic garbage. Listen to Xymox, or Diabolique, but please: if you see this album in the record store, pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiamat - gift from Sweden","review":"I am a big Tiamat fan, but this aint good record. Ideas are boring and atmosphere is too static. There are couple good songs, that\`s all...Buy first \\"deeper kind of slumber\\", \\"wildhoney\\" or \\"judas christ\\". Also \\"clouds\\" is brilliant but style is raw...depends what kind of music u are expectecing...Juha Kainulainen, Finland"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Tiamat CD","review":"This is the first and only(so far) Tiamat CD I have. These guys sound alot like sisters of mercy -pink floyd. If you are a fan of either than you will most likely love this CD. Favorite tracks 2,3 and 9. Try centurymedia for full songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I'm not sure what Tiamat is trying to do here. If anyone enjoyed the lovely intracacies and atmospherics of Wildhoney and A Deeper Kind of Slumber will be quite surprised with this one. I'm just wondering what happened to the guitar. It seems they decided to put the vocals in the forefront. This would be fine except Johan Edlund doesn't have much variety or range in his vocal abilities. I would say the one highlight of the album was The Church of Tiamat. This did bring back a few memories of the Tiamat I appreciate. This album will definitely not hurt any of their commerial appeal in Europe. Hopefully, the next album will continue on with their progression from A Deeper Kind of Slumber."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun but somewhat buggy game","review":"This is a pretty decent looking Diablo-style RPG game that adds another chapter to the game Sacred. In Underworld, you explore more areas farther north in the world of Ancaria. I found the new levels were not super great for being fun to explore, rather difficult and a little confusing, but there are interesting new quests, and the original game world is nicely expanded and can be played with 2 new characters, the Dwarf and Demoness. The original Sacred game has been known to have a lot of small bugs and glitches, which many were eliminated or minimized thanks to the Underworld epansion pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels, Tears, and Teddybears","review":"I read this novel when the author had it posted on writing.com (sadly its off now, but anyway), and I LOVED it!

It was written by an 18-year-old aspiring literary agent who only wrote it to get her foot in the door.

There is a wealth of information in this 498 page book - based on research and professional experience.Bryna Siegel begins with a discussion of the definition of autism and its impacts on children, including development and strengths and weaknesses. By understanding how autism works and effects children, their supporters can find ways to teach them that are effective. The second major section focuses on social and communication problems that face autistic children. It explains how and why it affects their learning and functioning in society. The last third of the book presents various treatment options - descriptions and strengths and weaknesses.I highly recommend this book. It is a remarkable resource for anyone who really wants to delve into the world of autism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, tone is condescending","review":"Ever walk into a room and realize that someone a few feet away is talking about you, yet won't acknowledge that you're standing right there? If you're the parent of a mid to low functioning ASD child, reading this book will make you feel exactly that way. The author isn't talking to you, just at you and about you.Add the fact that the information is now a decade old and mostly disproved or irrelevant, and there's no good reason to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping Children with Autism Learn","review":"Excellent sourcebook for educators and parents. The text is organized so you can go to specific chapters that apply to your needs without having to read from beginning to end. However, I do recommend reading the entire text. Siegel explains current theories on the origins of autism and addresses the validity of \\"possible causes\\" that have been floating around. For a teacher, the heart of the book are the heaps of methods to use with students. For parents, it is a breath of fresh aire. Siegel's writing style is very reassuring and is packed with her clinical experiences and research. After reading this book you will certainly be better prepared to advocate for your child's treatment needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!","review":"If your a fan of club music this is the CD for you!

Dave is a popular guy with the girls and lures Donna Summer, Anita Baker, India.arie, and Vanessa Williams along for this slow boat to nowhere and a couple of (gay like him) guys, Barry Manilow and Johnny Mathis as well. All of them provide serviceable performances which do little than push Dave into the background and distract from his languid sax playing.If your Lunesta or Sominex isn't working, this CD could be a good non-pharmacological alternative to get you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"I purchased this CD on Dave Koz's and Phil Ramone's reputation alone. I must say this is the WORST CD ever. Dave Koz might be a pretty face, but falls into the same pitfalls as Kenny G...actually I would've rather preferred Kenny G to this nonsense. India.arie, Anita Baker, and Vanessa Williams, artists that I love, just \\"phone in\\" their performances. Something that Phil Ramone should remember from doing those Frank Sinatra \\"Duet\\" albums. Dave Koz, instead of performing the entire melody of Cinema Paradiso, plays some sort of improv until the last minute or so of the song. Also, Barry Manilow is competent enough to perform to Moon River, and does a good job, but has to fight with the terrible sax solos. Donna Summer tries to do her best, but you feel she is holding back, or that Dave Koz is limiting her to make room for his obnoxious solos. Uugh...bland and terrible. The Pink Panther theme seems to work, but not for the whole 3 and some awful minutes. Steer clear of this one folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music!","review":"I have played this great DVD daily and hear something new each time.We did see the video and especially appreciate having the music to enjoy!

I have always enjoyed folk music, and after hearing one of Hart Rouge's songs on our classic music station, I had to get the cd! The music may not appeal to everyone, but if you like rhythm and blues, a la Alison Krause and Union Station, then this cd may appeal to you as well. The songs are a mixture of english, french, and even a native dialect from their home region.

Moreover, the dialect is British and Fiennes is made to look German, whereas this is supposed to be Roman. Thrice I tried to get through it, but could not suffer to endure. No credit can be given the cast as their roles were undermined. Ralph Fiennes is a great actor otherwise and Gerard Butler forever shines in his role in 300. I get it...the money made them do it!

The clever use of crawls on the TV screen, banners and graffiti helped to narrow the gap between Elizabethan English and McDonald's Happy Meal English.Everything from the lighting effects to the percussive music underscored the emotion. We already knew he was a fine actor but, in Coriolanus, Fiennes showed himself to be an intelligent director dealing with one of Shakespeare's more difficult plays. I look forward to his next directorial attempt.Another standout was Brian Cox' spot on performance. Is there nothing that man cannot do?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Together We Stand, Glorious and Grand!","review":"About 1 hr and 23 minutes into the movie, I stopped it, rated it 5 stars on Netflix, and resumed watching it.

The movie is very well edited, well written, and features outstanding performances by all the actors.I was unfamiliar with the story, but having just watched it, I commend Mr. Fiennes and the rest of the cast and crew for making this film. It must have been a difficult task, as it usually is when one needs to finance and produce an independent movie. Even if the movie didn't do as well as it deserved in the box office, it achieved something greater than just making money: it introduced Shakespeare's tragedy to a new generation and, being a well-made film, it will stand the test of time -- something that can't be said about most other movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare doesn't translate well","review":"I didn't care for this adaptation.

I appreciate that they were trying to do something different... an edgy Shakespeare set in modern times. However, it just didn't resonate with me. The language felt awkward and inappropriate, especially from Gerard Butler (and his thick Scottish accent). It isn't that I have an aversion to Shakespeare. Certainly not! In fact, I really enjoyed the movie Titus with Anthony Hopkins. But I suppose I prefer my Shakespeare language in a period film, with frilly collar costumes, when it doesn't feel a bit strange and laughable.In fact, I was watching the movie with my sister, and she DID laugh. She said the movie, \\"missed the mark\\" and I couldn't agree with her more.However, I give them 2 stars for attempting something I hadn't seen before. You have to commend that sort of bravery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo","review":"This movie was hard to view. Story was good but Shakespearean dialogue was annoying.

The actions scenes were supposed to be wars, but only had like 5 people in them...ridiculous! I thought the whole thing was just a fiasco.

My husband and I watched it together and both of us were of the opinion that the Shakespearean language didn't fit the story. This is an action story with battles, bombs, bullets--and characters speaking in poetic verse.

By placing the action in modern-day Rome, complete with \\"breaking news\\" on TV, Fiennes makes it clear that this tragic tale of pride, power, loyalty, and manipulation is timeless. Who should have a political voice? By what authority do our leaders rule? Where is the line between populism and demagoguery? Between rhetoric and pandering? These questions are as crucial today as they were when Shakespeare wrote the play in the 17th century*, and when Livy, Plutarch, and others told the story in antiquity.*Shakespeare's language is powerful, but it is 17th-century English poetry so be prepared for unfamiliar words and phrases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespearean language NOT understandable","review":"Great actors, great camera work, but unless you are fluent in old English, you will find it tough to understand what is being said.I am a great Shakespeare fan. In school we studied the great plays, and with help from the teacher we laboriously translated the Shakespearean language into modern day. But as dialog in a fast moving movie, I just couldn't keep up.Why would anyone make a film with dialog like this? Why didn't the first words of the Amazon editorial review mention that the dialog was nearly unintelligible? After Amazon asked my opinion on this movie, I went back and scoured the reviews of people who scored it a \\"1\\". After reading a number of these, I saw that I could have understood the difficult dialog from reading these reviews.

Looked like a great story, watched the trailer, looked good. I even saw the catch line \\"Shakespere's Coriolanus\\", I thought man an old roman shakespere story in modern times, how cool is that? Imagine my surprise when the dialog was in something like 16th century English. Lost interest in 10 minutes, to hard to follow. Kind of like watching a Chinese movie with no subtitles but worse because you can almost follow whats going on. Frustrating experience. My fault I guess, I should have somehow intuitively known that the movie would be in a 500 year old version of the language.

I had to turn it off after about 5 minutes because neither my wife nor I could stand it.

But I couldn't get into this one and it just felt all wrong to me. Call me old fashioned but i'd rather have the poetic shakespearean language in its natural setting.

I would not have rented this at this time if I had known it was the original Shakespeare. At another time, I may have been fine with this movie being the actual Shakespeare lines.

He has a talent for keeping the reader engaged. I didn't think I was going to like it because the subjects of Catholicism and the priesthood are not of interest to me personally. However, I was pleasantly surprised. If an author can take a subject I personally find boring and create a story I can't put down, he has to be good. My only criticism is that it was pretty predicatable. I knew who the killer was half-way though (But that didn't stop me from reading it!). I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in thrillers or suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make Them Cry Will Make You Cry.","review":"You will like this book if you do not read a lot of suspense/ mystery/ thrillers, or if you are Catholic or interested in same.

Kevin O'Brian does not put enough Catholic detail into the story, and has too many points of view going on. You will remain confused until well after half way, then will find yourself reading ahead to get to the end you already know is coming.

When Jack meets up with Johnny's sister, Maggie, they are determined to catch whoever was responsible for Johnny's death.

Upper management of AS&J; gets plenty of opportunity to tell the story of Duel's death their way, and Duel comes off as a trouble-maker whom no one could help but like anyway.

After steeping yourself in this book you will start to see countless opportunities for improving the clarity and conciseness of your writing.I paid $20 for this in 1986, and having been out of print so long copies are terribly expensive.

All four girls (Jessica, T, America, and Auror) have beautiful voice just as good as someone like Britney Spears etc. but they put their voices to good use. Their next single, Bring It To Me is much better than For All Time and should get them a little more recognition. It is the one song that they wrote. All of their songs in Spanish are great and their voices shine. One of my other favorite songs is Monday Mi Amor. Te Vengo A Decir (Interlude) is a beautiful track in which in the first part Jessica sings from recording at age 4 and her voice is great.
