All of the books I had read seemed to come from an \\"Iron John\\" perspective or be a sort of vague, New Agey feel-good book, but none of them offered concrete steps and clear facts until I read \\"The Courage To Raise Good Men.\\" Here at last was a book that told me what my heart should have known all along: just love him like he's a child becoming an adult, and don't try to push him at all (he'll grow up even if you don't push!).

Ali tries to tackle too many issues (marriage, women, homosexuality, religion, politics), and in the end says nothing about any of them. She plays up stereotypes of Indians and Indian-Americans, and is unable to artfully incorporate any of the subtleties around these hot-button issues.The plot is slow and changes directions too quickly without ever reaching a clear climax.

I remember the first time when I applied it to my skin, there was a tiny bit of \\"burning\\" feel but it went away very quickly. Throughout the winter, I used it every day. It kept my face moisturized for the entire day and it also didn't feel too thick or anything.

Queen Latifah's role as the strong black woman who thinks white people are crazy is getting old. The rest of the cast seemed to try to parallel Barbershop's cast. I saw one woman trying to be the old wise person(Cedric the Entertainer), but she couldn't pull it off because she just came off as ignorant and annoying.

Problems with her new employees, her old building, and her conniving ex-boss add to Gina's woes. But of course good friends, a couple of great guys and a well deserved comeuppance puts everything to right.

Oh no, in this movie they weaved, braided, cut, colored, and curled. So unless your a big whinny baby who cant take a joke or two go on and pick up a cop of beauty shop. Now if your caucasion and reading most of the reviews pay attention, after reading one of the reviewers said that this movie might be racist.

Not in the best possible quality but fair enough for a catalog. The first and biggest problem appeared to be that only automatically framed slides thinner than 2.5mm fitted into the frame-holder. 99% of my slides are manually framed (by myself)and didn't fit in. The test I did with the other 1% was disappointing. My Nikon D3100 does not focus well on the surface of the frame. I should focus manually, which is very difficult on such a small picture. The last thing is: the slide uses only a small portion of the image with my 19-35mm lense. That's a waist of pixels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money-time-trouble","review":"This product has a tiny instruction sheet that does not, under even the best interpretation, fit the need.

Not to mention a lot of ligth comming from the edges of the slide.So, now I have 2 choices: To buy any lens with longer focal distance or to do a huge digital crop of each picture I get from this \\"copier\\" (having a loss of quality, of course).Opteka could build a better desing (maybe a set of threaded rings that allow the user to choose the right tube lenght, instead of a sinle pipe).

To focus on each slide you must be able to turn the camera focus ring, which then turns the slide holder off its horizontal plane. If the holder pivot point had slightly looser toleraces it would be easy to adjust that part with two fingers. Instead it takes both hands to avoid torquing the camera lens. I finally left the \\"contraption\\" one thread loose on the lens barrel, placed the slide holder end on a solid horizontal surface and was able to focus that way with probably 80% focusing success. If you want to fool with it you can get satisfactory results, just don't be in a hurry. I think the price for this copier as is should be more in the $9.95 range. If the person who developed this is reading, you have a good idea but it needs refinement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for the money","review":"For the money, you can't beat the Opteka slide copier. It worked as advertised. I copied several slides made back in the 1960's from a 110 film camera. While the slide frames fit in the copier, the opening wasn't large enough to get the entire image top to bottom. If the detail I wanted was on the very top of the slide, I inserted it into the copier upside down and vise versa. However, slides produced from 35mm film fit perfectly. I used a Nikon 35-105 macro lens in macro mode on a Nikon D3. Had to manually focus, but it worked fine. I only used that lens because it was the only lens with 52mm filter size. Bottom line, for the money this did the job. It was much quicker than a slide scanner."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are some problems","review":"The Opteka HD2 Slide duplicator has two problems.1. Some old paper mounted Kodak slides are slightly too large and must be forced into the slide slot. Pliars must be used to remove them.2. The slide is not in correct alignment and cannot be pushed down far enough to fill the viewfinder, leaving a black band across the bottom of the frame. Thus one must either zoom in slightly to fill the frame thereby loosing part of the picture, or crop out the black bar afterwards using a photo editor.If I bought another slide copier, it would be the model with the movable slide receiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in Principle","review":"I bought this device so that I could use my Nikon D70 with 18-70mm f3.5-4.5 lens. The kit states, correctly, that it will fit this combination and includes the necessary adapter ring. What Opteka do not point out is that the large diameter mismatch between the camera lens and the copier means that, if the zoom is set to make the slide fill the sensor, the edges are badly distorted. Zooming out to around 50mm solves this problem but means that only about 70% of the sensor is used, with consequent loss of resolution. Attaching it to a lens with a smaller frontal diamter will ease the problem, so the lens supplied with the D50 and D40 cameras will be more suitable.It takes a bit of experimentation to get good bright results but the potential is there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who did da dub?","review":"Transfer is OK, although colors are a little 'washed out' (maybe a conscious decision by the director.)

They are transferred during the late stages of the Soviet War in Afghanistan to serve in the 9th Company of the (345th PPD) of the Soviet Airborne Troops on a hill known as Hill 3234. The movie is a blend of Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Stalingrad and Saving Private Ryan and has very realistic and graphic portrayal of war violence including blood-lust, but also of the subtle transformation that results in self-sacrificing heroes being made of regular young men. The visualized mountains and valleys effectively convey separation and isolation, if not even abandonment. One minor complaint is that the English subtitles seem to go by very fast, so you better be ready to read quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A descent movie about the Afghanistan war","review":"This is a descent movie about the Soviet Union's involvement in the Afghanistan war specially the events involved during the last battle in January 1988. It is from the Russian's point of view. The movie is well done, the audio is a little low even in the original Russian language but still a very nice movie to watch. It doesn't however in my opinion come close to Plattoon or Full Metal Jacket like it says it does. There were not enough battle scenes and they rushed through their basic training.

Platoon (entering a hell hole/the last stand type of fighting) but with a russian twist. don't know for sure how historically accurate any war movies are, but i didn't know all russians in Afganistan were volunteers. its also good not to recognise any actors in movies for a change, which is getting tiresome in our western countries movies. any way if ya like a high body count and lots of ammunition being expended like i do, youll like this. cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth the Price","review":"This was a very good movie. I would put this movie in the category of Platoon or Hamburger Hill. I have seen this type of movie a dozen times but this gives western audiences a glimpse into the Russian military that is rarely seen.I purchased this movie a few years ago in the original Russian version and watched it with a friend who was born in Russia. Actually hearing the dialogue made it a better experience. The blue-ray transfer was good and really brought out the landscapes.All told a good movie and one worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian vision of the Afghan War","review":"A very good war movie, in the line of \\"full metal Jacket\\" with soviet aspects and maybe more realistic.Even the \\"Iron Sergeant\\" that appears during the instructing period is more \\"human\\" that its USA counterparts.The war scenes are crude and desperating, no Rambo heroicism here, just noise, blood, pain and chaos.One of the best war movies I've seen recently.It also offers a different view of the first afghan war (the 2nd is still underway and will finish more or less the same) different from the yankee propaganda of \\"The Beast\\" or \\"Rambo III\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"No good !","review":"I purchased this movie on seeing the previews ! It looked really good a great war movie ! I was very wrong ! The movie I knew was in Russian and that is fine, I like foreign films. However the acting was poor, more comic than depicting anything realistic. The movie was boring taking almost the full hour before anything significant happened. Even then it was just stupid, a plane taking off gets hit by a mujahadine surface to air missile and then returns to its landing strip only to run into petrol drumms that lined the airstrip ! I mean really how lame. The fight sequence was poor, just all unrealistic situations. You can watch this once I guess, but then forget the 2 hours of your life you just wasted. If you want to see a better Afghanistan film from a Russian view point get 'The Beast of War' its older...but much better !"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"After reading the reviews, I thought I'd take a chance with this movie. After about 8 minutes, I turned it off.9th Company is rated R, but so isBeneath Hill 60. Yet both of these movies couldn't be more different with respect to language.The R rating is for strong bloody warfare, pervasive language, some sexuality/nudity, and drug use. Not family friendly at all. During the first 8 minutes, you'll notice the language right away; from that point, I knew it was all downhill.There are quality war/military movies out there, but this is not one of them.To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on \\"Listmania!

Significant portion of movie budget was spent on advertising and TV buzz, without which this movie would be a financial disaster. As a result, the movie is not well appreciated in Russia.Many scenes in the movie are objectionable, and have little relation to how it was in real 9th company story. Several survivors from that battle were really disappointed and refused to acknowledge movie similarity to real events.The main issue is that they knew that they were not forgotten, and help was on it's way, and the fierce fight was not futile. Every other lie in the film is simply eclipsed by this fact.You should know this when watching 'The 9th Company'."},{"rating":"2","title":"9th Company","review":"This is Must see. Not low budget, and extremely well done! Thinking I must have seen just about every war movie ever made, this one I never knew existed and knew nothing about, 9th Company is absolutely Amazing!

As in many other recent war movies, it focuses on a typical small-unit and explores the personalities of a handful of conscripts, from peasants to the college-kid type. Watching this evokes images from \\"Platoon\\" or \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" with a Slavic flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Afganistan War movie","review":"Best war movie I've seen in quite a while.

The pacing was very slow, it took more than an hour for the main characters to finally make into Afghanistan. Unlike Full Metal Jacket, however, there wasn't a whole lot of character developing, just a bunch of random events. There were couple of good moments but it wasn't enough to overcome the bad. People who think the battle scenes are realistic needs to watch more modern war films like Band of Brothers and Flags of our fathers. The battle scenes felt very amateurish, the Mujaheddins attack at walking pace like they are strolling at the park, and the characters likes to shoot wildly in the open without cover and bunch up together.

I just finished it and am pissed I spent money on it for the Blu-Ray version, when I would have been mad I spend a dollar on it at redbox. I have never studied Russian military history but am sure that they are more disciplined than the \\"soldiers\\" portrayed in the movie. It makes me think that if we went to war with the Soviet Union we wouldn't have had that hard of a time. I think that this movie is similar to \\"The Hurt Locker\\" (worst \\"war\\" movie ever) in that someone (who must have never served in the military) tries to portray to the general public what war is about and goes on searching for a deeper meaning to war and doesn't ever come close to finding it.

It's very sweet and nostalgic.I will say that it's probably better suited for the older end of the 4-8 range.

When he gets angry with her (which is most of the time), he grabs her, mauls her, tells her she's trash, while she fights to get away from him. How is it we're supposed to believe she loves him? Their summer romance was when she was 15, and this is some 12 years later. He certainly doesn't rekindle any romantic feelings by being kind.The sex scenes are embarassing with their euphemisms and overall lameness.The book wasn't a horrible premise.

The secondary characters seem pointless, as if Brown only included them in her novel to fill space and add more pages to this book. With character names like Rink, Roscoe, and Granger, Brown tries too hard to make this into a romance. There is no distinguished climax to this story, other than Caroline becoming pregnant. I was always taught in English class that stories should have climaxes, and shame on the publishers for not noticing that there is none.

There is a villian, the heroine's evil older husband. There are two romances in the story; one of the heroine, and one of the hero's younger, developmentally-disabled sister. The love scenes are trite and although they do not go into graphic detail, there's something vulgar about the language.

Each movement of each step is done at a slow pace and then in a group at the regular speed. The only fault with the video itself is that you can not replay the steps over and over. But that aside, the DVD is an inexpensive way to learn basic Irish dance steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"dance instruction for dancers.","review":"I bought this DVD because of all the celtic dancing DVD reviews I read, this one seemed to be the most accessible. If so, then maybe I'm not cut out for celtic dance. The instruction given seems to be aimed at people who already know how to dance. It's brief, done only once, covers 8-9 moves at a time, and when Dunne lets you try it out, the music is at full tempo. This is pretty frustrating and not made more helpful by his frequent use of \\"this very simple step...\\" \\"the most basic move...\\"It's a fun DVD, and he's a great dancer. And I'll probably try it again. But if you're looking for an easy 'in' to Celtic Dance, as I was, I'd look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for a beginner","review":"If you want to learn the basics of Irish dance, this is not a good choice. Colin is an extremely gifted dancer and his moves are impressive. However, he flies through the steps far too quickly and you will find yourself hitting rewind over and over and OVER to pick up a step.If you are already familiar with all the basic steps, this could be a good tape to practice along with and enhance what you've learned elsewhere.Incidentally, the quality of the video isn't great - the lighting is poor and it seems more like a home video than a professional recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Dance but Pace Too Fast","review":"I own Celtic Feet. Colin is a very attractive man and a very good dancer. But his instructions are for people who already have experience. He shows you a step slowly, explains it once and then his and his background dancers' feet are a blur of too fast to follow motion. This is not a beginners tape by any means, despite what he says. If you have already studies the dance and are just refreshing yourself, then it is nice. Otherwise, I'd just watch the tape to see what I should look like when after have I already learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast-paced and not nearly enough instruction","review":"This video is very hard to follow and is much to fast-paced.

Prior to that I had taken just 8 lessons in Irish Dance and so was familiar with some basics. Anyone with a true desire to learn these dances can do it.

A definite step up from the first film.","review":"You wouldn't think, given how offensively awful the first film was, that anyone would bother with a sequel. You, however, are not Roger Corman. He along with Director Louis Morneau have surprisingly managed to pull off a fairly decent follow-up.It benefits from tighter pacing, an entertaining story that borrows heavily from \\"Aliens\\", and slightly improved special effects. Even without the generously gory carnage the movie offers, I would still recommend it for the fun back and forth between actors John Savage and Cliff DeYoung. Their dialogue, alone, is nothing short of priceless and adds to the reason why I've given this movie an additional star.All in all, a pleasant surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool","review":"This movie was great I would chose it over Jurrasic Park.

(Problems at a government facility, one kid survives, an elite team sent in to investigate, characters picked off here and there by scary creatures, and a must-escape-from-a-building-about-to-be-turned-into-nuclear-dust scene.) The effects kinda suck, but the dinosaurs looked very scary. The tyrannosaurus head model at the end is pretty real, but when the camera switches to a shot of a small scale modle of the rex battleing a fork lift...just doesn't work.

When Transfer Trachea Reverberations From Point: False Omniscient, it was one of the most awesome recordings of that style for the time. Within Dividia was a step down, but still was gratifying. Elementary is such a turn for the worst, I don't know how it can be justified. For an extreme band, this deserves no listening or stars at all.

About half way through I could see the wisdom of writing it in this fashion. I think in the hands of a lesser author, it wouldn't have worked, but it is very well written and developed. It's an intriguing story with many surprises as you move forward - really backward - that keeps the tension level high throughout the entire book. There were a couple of questions I had at the end (which would be the beginning of the book but the end of reading it) that I would have preferred were made clearer. I felt like I needed to find someone who had read it to discuss it with. But, as with all of Ellis' books, I was always interested and very glad I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"backward reeled the chapters","review":"until my mind boggled. reverse chronology only adds to the disjointed plotting in this novel. the setting is non-existent and the characters are not developed well. this tale of murder, suspicion, government graft and international terrorism might be readable in a chronological or backflash order.i am not against ingenious and original writing styles, but in this case the device seems to be used as cover-up for a sloppy plot and cardboard characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner","review":"This is the second of David Ellis' books that I've read and enjoyed this one as much as the first. The characters are interesting and developed so that you can identify with them. It is written in reverse order which made it challenging to read and remember from one chapter to the next.

He writes the ending first, then goes back in time to show you \\"how the ending got there\\" - or words to that effect. Mostly it is various characters (none we can sympathize with) tip-toeing around one another with dull dialogue. Nothing much happens! If you enjoy reading a book where you are constantly wondering what the h--- is going on, this is your dish. Otherwise, avoid this writing experiment. Some might say, \\"Well, it's better than a sharp stick in the eye!\\" - but I say, \\"It IS a sharp stick in the eye!\\" Better you should read a cereal box, as grandma used to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like the reverse chronology","review":"Agreed - the reverse chronology makes the book difficult to follow.

It's fascinating to see the storyteller work around his gimmick so carefully.

It explains things in a very concise way. Still, the lack of art or images makes the reading a little dull. I recommend the text in conjunction with a standard history textbook, along with a text like Zinn's People's History of the United States or Loewen's Lies My Teacher Told Me. Furthermore, the book lacks adequate information on issues such as women's rights over time and racism throughout American history.

I e-mailed the company that I think shipped the item, but I had difficulty even finding who to send a complaint to. I never did get a response to my e-mail, or any customer satisfaction on this. Basically I paid a hefty price for one short shooting stick. What I liked about the stick- it's portable, light weight, and easy to set up. The pointed ends help it lodge securely. If I'd received the bag, it would have been even easier to carry. I'd love to have the rest of the kit, because then I'd probably give it five stars.

If you want a book which tells you more than the very simplest of info about Tiger, don't buy this one. I'm an intermediate level user and I found that there are many glaring gaps in her lessons. I ran into many snags in getting used to switching over from System 9 and she didn't address any of the problems. Nor was her basic information about how Tiger operates useful in helping me trouble shoot the problems.I wouldn't recommend the book to a new user either, because it was so superficial.A minor irritant is that the editor (or somebody) did a very poor job of proofing it.

I was relieved to find out that it doesn't take much pressure at all. I love this pistol. It's a .22 caliber, single shot, bolt-action, 460 feet-per-second pellet pistol. The adjustable rear sight makes it easy to adjust the aim so that the shots on target are accurate. In my other pellet pistol, I would keep a fresh CO2 powerlet in the pistol, but not screwed in tightly enough to puncture it. I would finish screwing it in when I was ready to start firing it. In this pellet pistol, no matter how lightly I screwed in the CO2 powerlet it would puncture the powerlet and the gas would start leaking out; so, when replacing the powerlet it has to be screwed all the way in whether you're going to start firing it or not--or keep the new powerlet out of the pistol until you're ready to start firing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check carefully before You put any accesories on or you void the warranty!","review":"Cap that screws in to puncture the co2 cylinder won't screw far enough to puncture the co2 cylinder and it's not cross-threaded, so I guess I will be sending it to crosman for repairs or a refund This really sucks I bought a scope, muzzle brake,and trigger shoe for this now I don't have anything to put them on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have fun with the modifications!!","review":"This is such a fun pellet pistol to modify, with a Crosman or CB steel breech, RB wood grips, barrel brakes, custom bolts, Williams sights, etc. that the configurations are endless.

In my initial shooting session I was putting 10 shots in a ragged hole from a sandbag rest at 10 meters. The bolt cycled smoothly and locked up tight. The only minus was that the trigger had more creep than I like, but this may work itself out as the pistol breaks in.As I was doing research on this pistol before purchase it became apparent that there is somewhat of a cult following for this Co2. There are many aftermarket modifications available and it can be upgraded to the extreme.At $[...] including shipping the 2240 can't be beat you are getting a lot for what you are paying. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this gun !!!!!","review":"Save your money, it's not worth it. Let me explain why you should save your money for a better gun.

It doesnt even have anything to do with the other ones, besides a brief mention of gatlin and \\"He who walks behind the rows\\" but its just a very brief mention and doesnt really tie into the horrible plot. Also let me say that I,m not strict when rating horror movies, I have liked a lot of them, while others hated them, but I dont see how anyone could watch this movie all the way through without falling asleep or simply dying of total boredom. I mean the only words that the kids use through the first hour of the film is \\"Kill\\" over and over, It really gets annoying, and the death scenes are also very weak with little to no gore, The sequels before had very graphic, bloody murders.

The dinosaurs look a little better than in the previous two, but the film doesn't really go anywhere. It's just a rehashing of the previous films. Scott Valentine does a horrible impersonation of Sylvester Stallone and it is very clear that he is trying to do so from the facial looks to the talking, pure Stallone.

Thankfully I got it used for about $3.00..... although that's about $2.50 more than it's worth. The acting, special effects, and plot of this movie are so horribly bad they're past being even laughable. Instead, this movie is painful to watch and would make an excellent form of torture for your worst enemies. As I watched this movie, one thought kept repeating in my mind \\"Why would Billy Burnette agree to have his name associated with this trash?\\". And the only reasonable answer I could come up with is that it gave him the opportunity to again work with Rick Dean, with whom he starred in \\"Saturday Night Special\\".

I am a fan, but when I read it, to my dismay I found it a very unpleasant book. The famous lightness of wit is quite absent, replaced by a turgid narrative about a group of sad unattractive characters, none of whom are even satirized, and for whom I felt nothing at all. Worse still, the Church, although always quietly present in her works, seems to have got such a grip on the writer's psyche, that she is unable to put together three lines without some reference to it, even when it is irrelevant to the action. My feeling is that she had come to the end of a long creative spell and needed a long rest. And this is what happened.

He does everything to become famous with hilarious results. He starts a band called the Five Pennies and they do great things. Then he is forced to give it up and starts to work for a shipp yard. The script is not that good and if Danny Kaye didn't play the lead, this movie would not be good. But it is, Mr. Kaye lifts this movie up and I have enjoyed it many times with my family. Its very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a classic...!!","review":"There are a handful of films that I recall from my youth that I loved. There are fewer that somehow, through time, hold up even though they are dated in so many ways you cannot count them. These few are to me what great story-telling is all about, and what great film-making is all about as well.Someone in an earlier review commented that this release was bare bones. What does that mean? No bonus features? Who gives a hoot. This movie is fantastic in and of itself and it needs no condiments.Danny Kaye plays one of his finest roles ever as a coronet playing family man. He not being funny in this one. He's being darn good and it comes through loud and clear. In that classic style of \\"tear tugging\\" he riffs this role perfectly, and the film's finale is a mind-blower indeed.If afternoon entertainment with some popcorn is your game, play the five pennies. It'll take you back in time for a nice old fashioned ride, inclusive of great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sounds In This Classic Film","review":"Danny Kaye plays Red Nichols, a famous coronet player of yesteryear. I found this story a notch better \\"fair\\" and nicely aided by the musical talent of Louis Armstrong.Kaye and Armstrong's duet on \\"When The Saints Go Marching In\\" is the highlight of the film.For a classic movie, the stereo in here is amazing, especially on the songs. In one instance, there are three people singing and their voices all coming out separately on different speakers. Pretty good for just a VHS tape. Now that a DVD has been released, I wonder what the sound on that is like?The story starts to lag a bit near the end when Kaye starts to feel sorry for himself and this goes on and on as he retires from playing. However, there is a nice, sentimental upbeat ending.Notes: Kaye and Barbara Bel Geddes, who plays Red's wife \\"Bobbie,\\" never age in the film even though it spans 15 or more years! It's also interesting to see Tuesday Weld as a teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up, way up!","review":"One of the most underrated movie in the history. It's an awesome movie.

This book is for anyone who wants to travel not only for pleasure, but also for knowledge. With humor and incredible insight, Phil Karber writes of his adventures in the lands he has visited, lands that most of us will only see on National Geo specials. Karber immerses himself in each culture, learning as much as he can about the history, philosophy, people, and customs of each country that he visits. After reading this book, the reader will feel as if he, too, has visited each place Karber describes. This book is a must-have for anyone who plans to travel to these exotic locales, but it is also a delightful way for those of us who lack the courage, time, or funds to travel to experience places that may no longer exist in a few year's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yak Pizza Inspires Haikus","review":"I've just finished Yak Pizza--and how much I was transported from Fort Smith, AR to places I've only dreamed or heard of.

I have tried mixing it into smoothies, water, fruit juice, coffee and cereal, and no matter how I try, I can't get rid of the bitter, dusty taste. I find the taste to be a combination of bitter sawdust, cardboard and nasty herbs, that is impossible to hide in any food. I am sure it is very healthy and good for digestion, but I just cannot stand the flavor it adds to foods and beverages. It does not dissolve completely, so anything it is mixed in to becomes extremely gritty.

Initially, I found the text hard to understand. However, if one pairs the piece with Rousseau's writings (particularly Emile, or, On Education) the writing really comes to life. Ms. Wollstonecraft wrote this book as a rebuttle of some of Rousseau's beliefs. When the two are coupled, it is very interesting to compare and contrast. Great place to start when looking at the true meaning of \\"equality\\" a famous mind like Rousseau was striving for at this time period. Dense prose, though. Be warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the roots of feminism","review":"I admit that I read this because it's mentioned in the forward to an edition ofPride and Prejudicethat I recently read. I wanted to better understand the context of that novel, and now I see the clear lines from this treatise to Austen's novel.Wollstoncraft argues that women of her era need better education and better goals than simply marrying a good man. Through better education, women and men are improved by having better relationships, better conversations, and are better able to raise children. Written largely as a response to Rousseau'sEmile, she argues that women have more to offer than simply wife and mother, but as fully-functional members of society. She vehemently argues against the idea that women exist only for the entertainment and edification of men.Reading this in a modern context, one has to wonder how far we've actually come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I just finished reading this book.

Unsung hero of satire. It's a shame the author killed himself, because this was such a great book of witty and tasteful humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important read","review":"I finished this book oh a train ride moving from New Orleans after staying there a year. I think living in the city made the book come alive for me. I didn't like the style of writing and I had a hard time picturing the characters, but it was such an enjoyable and important read. I don't know how to explain the importance of it other than to say it's on a personal level. I plan on rereading it another 1 or 2 times so I can find a better way of expressing myself about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled By The Hype","review":"I finished reading this book a few weeks ago, and have since totally forgotten about it, which I dare say is probably not a good thing. I did not find \\"Dunces\\" funny, nor even amusing and barely entertaining. I read it at the urging of a friend whose opinion I respect - I no longer respect his opinion (at least about what books to read.) I will nonetheless give credit to Mr. Toole for the flawless structure of his book. His ability to make seeingly unrelated events interact to eventually produce a coherent picture is truly remarkable. But, other than the well-planned narrative, I found this book wholly uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book, but . . .","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago after having read rave reviews of it and an article stating that Toole was nothing short of a genius. I really thought that I'd like it. I tried to like it, but I had to struggle just to get through it. I thought that Ignatius was a fatuous, unlikeable windbag, and after a hundred pages or so I just wished someone would throttle him. What killed this book for me was that I just didn't care about Ignatius. I will try to reread this book in the next few months to see if my opinion has changed. If this book entertains you, great, its just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Confederacy of Dunces","review":"This is quite simply the greatest book ever written. The basic premise seems almost ordinary, but in the hands of JK Toole, it becomes a magnificent one man circus, a triumph of crass stupidity over reason and normality.It is crammed with self- referential \\"in-jokes\\", which may pass you by on the first reading. The characters are believable, immaculatley brought to life by the authors incredible style- you can almost taste the New Orleans atmosphere, and its collection of Vagrants, losers, lunatics and heroes that are the books cast are observed with empathy and admiration. The central character is surely the creation of a genius, and the plotlines draw you in to their spiralling web, until they collide with uproarious humour in one of literatures truly Great moments. Few works deserve the title \\"Masterpiece\\"- this is surely one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't understand all the hype","review":"Just finished this so-called masterpiece and found it to be an average read at best. Yes, there were parts that made me chuckle, but they ran about even with those that bored me enough to fast forward through some sections. I leave this book without keeping a memory of even one likeable character.I'm glad for those readers who found this book to be so enthralling. I'm glad we all don't have the same likes and opinions or it would make for a very dull world."},{"rating":"1","title":"No gut-busting here","review":"This must be one of those books that people either love or hate. I read the entire book because of the high praise it has received. To be honest, I wanted to toss it after two chapters. I have a very good sense of humor. Salman Rushdie's \\"The Moor's Last Sigh\\" made me laugh for hours on end. This book did nothing but depress and disgust me. If Toole's life was anything like Reilly's, I can understand his depression. The quality of the writing and the level of imagination exhibited in the book are both very high. As a literary study the book has merit (the Pulitzer is questionable). This book unequivocally did not live up to the jacket reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"So utterly disapointed","review":"Due to the respect I have for many great and funny writers who have lauded this book's brilliance over the years I have planned to read it for some time. I recently read something that referred to the book and decided, \\"it is time to do this\\".As a reader I try to give a book 1-2 hours, maybe 100 pages before giving up. I read this whole thing waiting to laugh, find something funny, anything. THis was a great disapointment in my literary life. I have been trying to rethink this book and try to imagine what could be funny. Perhaps I'm such a dunce myself I could not get into the high-mindedness of it?Oh well . . . like some disapointed movie fan I'll say, thats a few evenings of my life I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strange novel.","review":"It is not consider good form to laugh at deranged people. The main character is dreanged, and if you ever personally known someone like him, you would not like this novel. On the other hand, I read it to the end. The really likeable and funny character is Jones. I hope the fact that he is black does not offend anyone. His character makes everyone else look insane. This is a well writen book, and since I listened on tape, the narration was excellent. There really is no plot in the book. Its a bunch of miserable characters living in disorder. If there is a plot, its Riley's descent into madness. And again, apologies to New Orleans, but where else is more likely to discover a cast of characters living on the edge of sanity.This is not a book to take to the Beach, or read after a friend or relative is hospitized for a mental disorder. It will not help you understand the problem. The only benefit this novel has, is to remind us that there is a lot of troubled folk out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly comic indictment of modern society.","review":"Perhaps one of the funniest books I have ever read. While there have been a few negative reviews of the book, one has to fault the reader for that, not the writer. The real tragedy is that he is no longer around to favor us with more of his books. It is also a book one can recommend to almost anyone who has a brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"a confederacy of dunces","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. Toole's ability to capture the character in all of us is uncanny. He nails Ignatius in all his self absorbant academic glory. If you enjoy reading at all do not touch this book because it is too hard to come down off of and other books will leave you unsatisfied and disappointed. However if you do not have a sense of humor read on, anything you touch afterwards will please you to no end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, very interesting","review":"There's not much really to say about this book other than read it. The main character is great. By the end of the book you are cheering for him. But it is not for the unimaginative. To really appreciate this book, you must be able to get inside of it and dissect it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishingly Witty!","review":"I romped through this novel in only a few days - laughing all the way! I'd never read anything so clever: so funny, yet wrought with the many sad and universal truths of this life. Ignatius J. Reilly - a pathetic and sad picture of a human being - being quite well-aware that he is possessed of a vast superiority of mind - gallivants through New Orleans leaving all forms of upheaval in his wake.Ah - Toole brings New Orleans, a city I love dearly, alive here - it swelters and breathes with every word on every page of this epic work of art and wit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettably unfunny","review":"I bought this book on the strength of its reviews,a nd the fact that I was in the mood for a laugh-out-loud novel. Instead, I have stumbled upon a situation similar to the emperor's new clothes....does everyone really find this book funny, or are they all jumping on the bandwagon? After attempting the first 150 pages, feeling repulsed, and finding little humor, I had to stop. What others must find as humor is really cynicism disguised with a patina of offensiveness. It's sad that O'Toole committed suicide, but if the theory that all novels are autobiographical holds true, Ican see why O'toole/Ignatius did"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I didnt't give this book a ten because I'm holding out for that one spectacular book. I'll know it when I read it. Anyway, this book is one that you simply must read several times in order to get all the humor. Some you don't catch the first time around. I highly recommend it for vacations or plane trips. It may be tough at first, but I promise you that it's worth it. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will read for a fourth time","review":"I rarely return to a book I've finished. This is worth a re-read because of the detail and the incredible humor. It helps to know the New Orleans dialect and mindset while reading it. A wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"Ignatius T. Riely is rude. Ignatius T. Riely is fat. Ignatius T. Riely is a loud, obnoxious, over-educated, under-achieving boob of a man. Yet somehow, when it comes to life, he just gets it.Not only is this book funny as hell, it is deliciously thought-provoking wonderfully written. Worthy of as many stars as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmmmm...Didn't see too much humor","review":"It was a good book. I'll admit to that. However, I did not find it \\"rip-roaring\\". I found it disturbing. It did have funny moments, but I was disappointed, I guess I heard too much hype about its humor.J.K. Toole was a good writer. But I felt this book was unfinished. The last chapter, although climactic seemed to die at the very end.All in all a good, quick read. Interesting characters and story line. Some humor, mostly tragedy and unsetteling reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a classic?","review":"1) It's over-written.2) The characters are sledgehammers with little subtlety and less credibility.3) The dialogs are boring, trite, and artificial.4) The humor is forced.5) The scenes are too long for their content.6) I'll give it a star for mass.In short, it is precisely what I would expect the intellectual elite to choose for a classic.For everybody else, it needs a laugh track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not feeling it","review":"I'm about a third of the way through and it's slow-going. I keep waiting for the uproarious comedy and scathing insight promised by this book's glowing reviews. Nothing yet.The sections of the book written by the character Ignatius are at least readable; a take on modern life provided by a misanthropic medievalist is kind of interesting. But that's not enough to justify the $15 I paid for my copy. Be warned - if you're intent on reading it, borrow a copy from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"Someone compared this disaster to the Seinfeld tv series, and I suppose I would agree. I never had much appreciation for Seinfeld and its desperate grasps at comedy; just so, Confederacy of Dunces relies largely on slapstick, nerve grating characters, and meandering plot. The book drags on and on--the climax, that should indicate an easy, swift road to the conclusion, is so backward that the last 20 pages will be even harder to read through than some of the middle 20 pages.In all fairness, there was some effective comedic elements; the voices of the characters were unique, and the language was elegant. Its hard to say exactly why this greatly lauded, Pulitzer Prize winning novel failed to live up to my expectations, what literary mechanics failed Toole, but I would approach the reading of this book with a grain of salt or two. Not something I would ever read twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent? What talent?","review":"The amazon review says that had the author lived, his critics and fans would have had the opportunity to determine if his talent was genuine or a fluke. Oh, really? Who said he had any \\"talent\\"? What I found in this book was pure amateurism -- in plot, character development, atmosphere, you name it. If Dunces demonstrates genius, then the Three Stooges are on par with Chaplin. The amazon review also says this drivel cannot be easily dismissed. Again, says who? This is one \\"book\\" I plan to forget as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible","review":"While I suppose this book is realistic, it is completely unreadable due to its main character, Ignatius Reilly. Most of the reviews I've read call him a hero and a misfit at odds with the modern world. That isn't true. He's a jerk. The character is a horrible person who I could hardly stand reading about. I have no idea what the author was thinking when he created him. In the story, things always go right for Ignatius even though the reader desperately wants him to suffer. Why would anyone want to read about such a loathsome character? Ignatius is treated as the hero because he's the main character, but he is no hero, to be sure.Why did this win a Pulitzer? I think it was mainly due hype over the complex story of the book's publication. The author killed himself ten years after writing the book and his mother spent the next few years after that trying to get it published. If only she hadn't tried so hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Have Memories (Bad) About This Book","review":"A misguided friend of mine gave me this to read while I was in the hospital around 30 years ago. It was new at the time, and praised highly. I couldn't stand it. The novel was boring, amateurish and unreadable, obviously written by a talentless individual. (The first chapter felt like trying to run a marathon in quicksand.) I still don't understand why it was published, except perhaps to prove that Pulitzer prize winners are usually overrated. Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either you love it or... you can't even finish it.","review":"This book was suggested to me by a friend who absolutely raved about its comic genius. Well, I couldn't wait to read it! Afterall, we have fairly similar taste in books.After forcing myself to get through the first 100 pages, hoping it would get better, I just had to stop. This book was hands-down, the LEAST funny book I have ever read in my entire life. Eventually, trying to actually read it and not skim became completely impossible.The story jumps from location to location so much that I wondered what was even going on and why the author chose to throw in the \\"bar\\" location. The main character is horrendously annoying and not even in a funny way, in a grotesque, childish manner. And God help you during the breaks in which Ignatius writes page after page of intensely boring \\"stories\\". This book was much too over-the-top for me and I agree with another reviewer that unless you're into \\"farts and burps\\" and finger licking this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous.","review":"I enjoy farces when they reveal truths about life or if the characters arouse sympathy. I found none here. Toole's absurd whining grew tiresome quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not get it....","review":"Due to the high praise I think it's a hit or miss and for me it was certainly a miss. I got through half of it which I thought was an accomplishment - it is so boring, pointless and at moments simply strange. I did not find the humor in it; the main character is a loser....that's it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The abridged versions sucks!!!","review":"Even though the book was a masterpiece and the unabridged audio version might be great, Arte Johnson ruins the shorter abridged version on audio from the very beginning! His horibble attempt to capture the New Orleans accent is criminal and his voice is annoying at best. I recommend that you purchase this audio book to seek revenge upon on you most hated enemies! If you are the fan of the original book as I am. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS ABOMINATION!!! IT LACKS THE THEOLOGY AND GEOMETRY that John Kennedy Toole included in the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth finishing","review":"The writing was ok, but the characters were all pitiful and sad. I just couldn't make myself finish this book. I have an acquaintance who everyone considers quite annoying, and who has a very rude and unintelligent sense of humor -- I gave him the book, and just as I thought, he absolutely loved it. Still quotes from it, months later. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my WORST reads!!","review":"Perhaps its me, pehaps not. That notwithstanding, I found the characters to be two dimensional not the least bit likeable. I had to 'slugg' my way thru this book on the hopes it would just get better, and the ending was perhaps the most dissapointing of all!! I wouldnt recomend it to anybody..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not keep it's promises","review":"How hilarious. A fat man and his mother encumber us with their uninteresting lives in New Orleans. If you read other reviews you see that this book promises knee-slapping, uncontrollable howling with every turn of the page. Well I waded through the first 40 pages with nary a grin before giving up on the promise to keep me in paroxisms of laughter. It ain't funny. It ain't interesting. It will, however, cure anyone's insomnia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read with lots of longevity","review":"I started reading this book and was hooked. The character of Ignatius J. Reilly is like so many people I (have had the misfortune to?) know, and really speaks to readers... I did find myself becoming more irritable--but I think that's just because I was so inspired. A fantastic book, I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead Of Its Time","review":"If you ever watch The Simpsons, Ignatius P. Reilly is a lot like the Comic Book Shop Guy, and I think they are both hilarious. This is a book everyone should read. I know a several people who are a lot like Reilly, which makes the book both funny and depressing; realistic and absurd. A literary classic because it encapsulates our American Society into a story. Amazingly enough, it is more relavent now than it was then. Some people would say that it has been overrated which might be slightly true, but the bottom line is it is a damn fine novel and a classic. It deserves at least one read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book that makes you laugh out loud over and over again","review":"This is a book that makes you laugh out loud over and over again, as you eagerly await the next moves of a protagonist who is brilliant, yet pathetic at the same time. The characters remind me of those in a Thomas Wolfe novel, with their faults and foibles right out in the open. Ignatius disgusts, yet compels you to cheer him on at the same time. When you get to the Ladies Auxiliary art show scene -- BE WARNED -- you may not want to read this on a public plane, train etc. because you will be laughing so hard the tears will be running down your face! I was sorry to see this book end, and wish Kennedy had lived to write more. I would have liked to see where Ignatius' travels lead him to next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Oh my God!\\"","review":"I cannot praise this book enough. Never before have I laughed out loud so many times while reading a novel. IT IS COMPLETELY BRILLIANT!

My only explanation for it is that the committee must have figured if *they* couldn't understand it, then it must be good. But I would disagree. I swear I wrote an assignment in 9th grade English that was remarkably like this book in style, and it got a 'D.' I'd have to say this book is different, sure, but ... It did have a few very wry and funny passages, but overall I didn't like the story or the style."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an absolute utter WASTE","review":"I'm surprised anyone would publish such moronic work It's a stupid inane story about an obnoxious, arrogant 30 year old fat slob who lives with his ignorant dimwit mother.

What a waste of trees and every thing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, what tough going !","review":"What a slog it is trying to get through this book. I'm nearly there (I've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this)... the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends, and the mostly rave reviews it's got here. Ignatius Reilly, the main character is interesting enough (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring, I find myself flicking on the pages to see how far I have to go before the story gets back to Ignatius again. I keep thinking \\"OK, the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon\\"...there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the Pulitzer Prize. I'm at a loss to explain its popularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, pointless and uniformly unfunny","review":"Neither comic nor a masterpiece, this book becomes more oppressive with the turn of each page. Reading the sophomoric prose is like being slowly buried under sodden newspaper. Nevertheless, being in the minority here, I truly wonder what I might be missing. I beseech and BEG the admirerers of this book to cite a paragraph, a sentence or a turn of phrase they consider to be masterful and comic, or just comic, or just masterful. I ask that in sincerity because, far from finding anything humorous or well written, let alone masterful, I found myself astonished that anyone could be even mildly amused or impressed, other than by the fact that the author actually had the will power to watch this much paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"the moron was masturbating!","review":"I like comedic books, dark comedies, and the like. I picked this book up because it was referred to with one of my top 5 books:A Fraction of the Whole. I found nothing funny in A Confederacy of Dunces, no relevance to Fraction of the Whole, and when I read the part where the moron is masturbating I threw it across the room. This is not even dark humor, it's disgusting, the characters were utterly pathetic creatures, wastes of space and a despicable example of the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it.","review":"It seems like you either love this book or hate it. I guess I'm just not getting what is so great about it. The main character is detestable, and they are always \\"screaming\\" at each other. I only managed to get about 2/5 through it before realizing I was not enjoying it at all. I tried, but it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FUNNY","review":"For many years, I have heard what a hilarious book this was. I consider myself to be a jovial person in every way, but this book put me to sleep. I could have easily closed it after 20 pages or so, but I slogged on because I was determined to find out what was so funny. The answer was: NOTHING. They keep talking about making a movie out of it...I think the financing has fallen short because it's not a comedy, it's not a drama....it's a sedative."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long, not funny as hyped to be","review":"Three quarters into the book I wished I hadn't spent the time reading it. It was fatiguing to read the same arguement over and over, nothing new develops about the characters, nothing made me want to finish. I skimmed the last one quarter. Maybe East Coast intellectuals can laugh at the antics of those silly southerners but here in the Northwest I prefer my humor more dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid boredom","review":"I had to give up after 60 pages, and scanned the rest.

What a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"Is it possible to award negative stars??? I just can't understand how/why this book won the Pulitzer, or has any kind of following at all. Why anyone could possibly care about the characters is beyond me. I tried and tried to read it, and finally gave up about 2/3 of the way through.I normally LOVE southern fiction (Carson McCullers, Walker Percy, etc.) and really expected to like this, but it was pretentious, annoying, and most galling of all, amateurish. A total waste of paper, and of time if you actually manage to read the whole thing. Absolutely abysmal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dunces Unite!","review":"Apparently a college education doesn't count for much anymore. I really, really tried to get into this book. Finally, I just gave up. Sorry, I just don't get the appeal of this book. I am now a member of the confederacy of dunces that believed the hype about this silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wished for spontaneous book combustion!","review":"What this book lacked in humor, it made up for in absurdity and tedium. With a motley assortment of irreedemable losers and a poorly constructed and boring plot, the reading of this book is only slightly more pleasurable than being poked in the eye with a sharp stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"There were some funny antics in the book, but the characters themselves just turned me off. Reading this book made me feel like watching someone eat a live bug - you want to see what happens, but are grossed out and disgusted afterward. This book went immediately into the \\"give away\\" box when I was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title of the book is fitting.","review":"Well, as Queen Victoria often said, \\"We are not amused.\\" I've heard great reviews, and that this book is excellent! That I MUST read it! It was very dull and-using I. J. Reilly's own words- \\"ho hum\\". I read the book on my lunch breaks, and took me over a month, a colleague shockingly asked \\"You're still reading THAT book?\\". Well, I thought that I would be faithful to the author and finish what I started. Mind you it was an uphill battle the entire way. It kept dragging out, and the vernacular of the characters was at times tiring to read. It ranged from a \\"menza-styled speaking Ignatius\\" [not to insult menza members] to \\"a vagran colo Jones\\". I kept thinking that the ending would be something really good, but it was a let down. I was hoping until the last paragraph, that the 30 year old Ignatius to his \\"Mynx\\" would lose his.... well you read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable even for a book nut","review":"I read voraciously; I almost read for a living in almost every genre there is. I'm not one of the majority of Americans who read an average of one book a year. At least you know where I'm coming from when I say that I barely made it through the first 30-40 pages of this tome. It reminded me of old high school friends who constantly tried to make faces or hoot out tiresome jokes or recite plays on words that left the rest of us either groaning in disgust or avoiding the person entirely.I have no idea how this won a prestigious award or garnered so many positive reviews. Maybe our tastes have sunk this low that Toole's suicide somehow places him in that rarefied air of the great \\"misunderstood\\" writer who was really trying to communicate complex truth in seemingly ridiculous narrative. No, I think it was a foolish man writing foolishness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Arguably the best dialogue of any book ever written in the United States. Every single voice is distinct. Try doing that sometime in your own writing. Try differentiating your characters by voice. It's damn near impossible. Word has it that Toole was a mimic with a spot-on ability to imitate dozens of New Orleans characters, and he'd entertain his friends with his impressions into the wee hours of the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious!","review":"This is one of the funniest book I've ever read - the characters are just unbelievably pathetic. That J.K.Toole managed to invent a protagonist as absurd yet convincing as Ignatius is reason enough for me to consider him - contrary to other opinions - worthy of the Pulitzer Prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GIFT!","review":"I got this book for my boyfriend for his birthday. He has read it in the past and often refers to it in conversation...so I ordered one for him and he loves it! He even started reading it to me before we go to bed because I have never read it before. So far, it's hysterical!!! The book arrived in great condition and in a timely fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh...my...god","review":"This has, hands down, got to be the most hilarious book I've ever read.

What an excellent, funny book (I almost NEVER laugh out loud while reading, but I did for this one) and I couldn't help but think of Bonfire of the Vanities book which I also loved. Though the stories are different, ALL characters are mockeries of themselves and it's all very sarcastic yet realistic. I love when the characters are \\"live people\\" to me, I think about them even after I put the book down. The story is realistic and whimsical. It's very serious, very sad, very funny, wow, I finished it last week and can't stop thinking about the characters. Jones is my favorite character, a poor black guy, that is constantly saying things as they really are. Please read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant comedy","review":"This remarkable novel features one of the most unique protagonists I've ever encountered.

Truly a hilarious book."},{"rating":"1","title":"my review","review":"After reading A Confederacy of Dunces I was really disappointed in the book. The novel was supposed to be humorous. However, as I started to read more into the book I felt really annoyed with the characters in the book, and with the book itself. A theme that the author, John Kennedy Toole, tries to display is that the characters are foolish and unhappy because people in society aren't helping one another and that is a major reason why they are unhappy.The characters, especially Ignatius, annoyed me because they weren't unhappy just because no one was helping them, it was also the fact that they didn't try to do something for themselves and be happy. Few people today in society will help someone so they can make their lives happier. My opinion is that this is a book that I could not read over again. I do not recommend this book if you want to laugh all it did was irritate me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing showing of modern literature!","review":"I could not help but read nearly 50 pages at least upon every sitting while reading this book. Absolutely amazing. So many side stories, twist and turns, that, in the end, comlpletely fall together in a most amazing way. This book is truly a representation of modern literature at its best. Set in New Orleans, this book is a story of an intelligent man lost in a world of confusion and ignorance whose mishaps seem to effet everyone in the area. So many things are involved that cause the reader to never lose interest. Absolutely amazing. I laughed out loud on several occations. This book is filled with comedy, sorrow, and best of all, great writing. You will become lost in this world of the main character Ignatius J. Reilly, and feel the way he does. I even found myself talking like him in conversations after reading. This book is all the hope needed for modern literature. Truly a book that must be read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bathroom humor","review":"I suppose this isn't the worst book I have ever put down half-read.

It certainly did not live up to its billing. I found the book dated, and lacking humor in today's society (that of course assumes it was humorous when it was written).

I am sorry that I wasted money buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a single redeming character","review":"My book club read this book and all eight of us hated it.

Turns out I almost chucked the book at the same place but doggedly slogged through thinking there would be a payoff that justified the Pulitzer. It never got any better. All I can say it must have been a slow book year, akin to giving an academy award to a 60's beach party movie. It is the WORST book I've ever read. The characterizations were were stereotypical and offensive, the plot was banal, and the characters themselves (with the minor exception of the ever-suffering cop) lacked any quality that made one care what happened to any of them. If you've lived a very sheltered life (and the author apparently lived with his mother and didn't the house until he committed suicide) this may seem funny; I felt that I wasted time that could have otherwise been spent reading a GOOD book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Farce on Mankind","review":"First off, the book is hideous. A novel to glorify the weakness of mankind. This is the first book I have ever thrown in the trash. I could not disgrace the various authors of my collection by placing this novel on the shelf.The comedy of this book is in it's reviews. To glorify this novel is to glorify disparity, vulgarity, and despair. If these reviews were written as a joke on mankind, the least the reviewers could have done was credit the proper reviewer...Ellsworth Toohey.It's not even good drivel. It's a poor, vulgar rendition of Catch-22 without plot or character development.Anyone who knows who Ellsworth Toohey is or can answer the following question will find nothing but frustration and disgust in this novel.Who is John Galt?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read John Irving instead","review":"I love characters that fly in the face of conventionality. I love irreverant characters who challenge the way we see the world.Ignatius is neither of these. His rantings on the ills of society from the safety of his bedroom in his mother's house were empty and silly. He is a completely unbelievable character, or at least one with whom I could not empathize. His twisted view of the world is so anathema to the realm of common experience that I'm surprise anyone can put themselves in it.Try as hard as I did, I couldn't raise enough interest in the characters to even finish this book.Read John Irving instead -- He's much funnier, can turn reality in interesting twists and still be believable, and has more important things to say about what it is to be a human being in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain fun","review":"I first received this book as a Christmas gift nearly 15 years ago and loved it...I could not put it down and frequently found that laughing out loud while reading in public didn't matter to me one bit.I've just bought and gifted this comic romp for the 11th time and no one has told me that it was anything but fun.Sure Ignatius is unloveable...that's the point.I read this book as the comedy it is.

Reilly, is too fantastic to believe. the one character i really belived and found terrific was \\"Jones\\". here is a ripe character. everthing else is overwrought and silly.

However, this rambling opus has a poorer center of gravity than its protagonist. The humor is pedestrian at best and the characters, sparsely drawn, wilt in the New Orleans heat. This is just another fine example of how book awards in general are misguided endorsements of sub-par work. There is a very good reason why this book was rejected by various publishers...it isn't very good. Toole casts a very large net, but catches very few fish in his attempt to capture an incendiary and convoluted period in American life. It appears that Toole is making an attempt at clever historical fiction, but shrouds the work in ludicrousness in order to hide its short comings and general failings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd commit suicide too if I wrote this book","review":"The author of this atrocious book has given us the most annoying character in the entire history of literature. Imagine reading the story of the spoiled little brat kid who lived down the street from you when you were younger. The kid who always talked back to his mother and got everything he wanted. Who wants to read about a person like this? The story itself moves along at a terrible pace. It switches from one unfunny episode to another with a bit of difficulty, usually relying on the main character going home to go to sleep at the end of the chapter, and waking up to a new, irritating adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Unfunny","review":"Well, after reading a host of rave reviews I decided to give this book a whirl. Supposedly a comedy, I cannot recall laughing once during it, and with a wholly predictable story it failed to delilver.

OK, Ignatius' journal entries weremildly amusing, but not worth reading through allthe rest to figure out what he was talking about.The characters are all such gross caricatures, bythe end I couldn't care less what happened to anyof them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly incredible read...","review":"'A Confederacy of Dunces' was by far one of the most original and hilariously funny books I've read in a long while. From the first page, this book has the reader's attention all the way through to the end, and not once was I able to state that I found the book 'boring'. With its complex system of characters and plots, 'A Confederacy of Dunces' is one of the strangest, yet most interesting stories in a long while. Though behind the many dilemmas of Mr. Ignatius J. Reilly, there is a tragedy. If perhaps the overweight, and well-educated man who is the protagonist had decided to do something with his life he might not have been stuck at home with his mother, and trying to inspire a conspiracy of some sort anywhere he goes. Not to mention his ex-girlfriend who he is constantly at war with, Myrna 'Minx' Minkoff. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to any reader. No matter who you are, anyone is able to relate in some way to this wonderful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE BOOK!","review":"It all begins with a car accident, which forces our main character, Ignatius Reilly, to get a job, thus, his adventures begin. He is an obese and arrogant slob who is ready to criticize everyone and everything that he sees in the modern world. What he sees, he loathes, and he documents all of his observations or rants in his Big Chief Notebooks. He takes on a series of jobs where he wreaks havoc and irritates everyone he comes in contact with, especially his Mother. The only person who seems to share in his world view is his equally crazy girlfriend Myrna Minkoff who lives in New York and whom he keeps a running correspondence with. This book is hilarous and but it is also rather sad, because nobody really understands Ignatius except for Myrna, and I absolutely loved the ending, it was perfect. This is an incredible book that I highly recommend to anyone who is looking for the Great American Novel...because THIS IS IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Playful and fun","review":"Just great writing.

Each time I read it, it gets better. Thetragedy of Mr Toole's personal story is almost offset by thescope of this brilliant work. I often give thanksto Mrs. Toole for not giving up, and finally beingable to share her son's gift with the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, juvenile, Goofy !","review":"This is a story about a very weird bunch of characters. Reading this was kind of like watching 40 year old virgin and Benny hill goofyness. Some of the comedy is moronic and strange but this book was hilarious. The guy who wrote this must have been one strange individual. He couldn't get his book published and killed himself. Then his mother took the manuscript and got it published and it won a pulizter! LMAO. I enjoyed reading it, but you have to take this book in the context its written in. It is meant to be a goofy, juvenile ridiculous book.

This city has many many idiosyncratic pronunciations of street names, etc., French as well as Native American, (e.g., Tchoupitoulas St.). The recorded version is rife with mispronunciations, which is a real distraction to readers from that area. The New Orleans accent is also unique to the South, and it is this reader's fondest wish that those who record books about southern Louisiana be more careful in recruiting native Orleanian or Cajun readers, or at least long-time residents of those areas in order to have the accent be more authentic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book is a great read and you will be falling over from laughter. I would recommend this book if you enjoy a good laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We all know someone who is a little bit of Ignatius...","review":"A Confederacy of Dunces is fascinating not just for its very interesting background story or its masterful wit and phrasing: part of the greatness here is that most of us (I think?) have encountered some intellectual who, like Ignatius, seems to be attached to some better time or philosophy, constantly offended by the frivolity and lack of dignity of modernity. His sense of superiority and disapproval will induce belly laughs if you have ever associated with college undergrads who aspire to be serious academics.Myrna Minkoff, our hero's object of disgust/love is a caricature of espresso swilling, nietzche quoting college girls who are \\"just doing it for the cause\\" (or maybe just feel important...)If you are a student or a medievalist, if you have ever been oppressed by that vixen Fortuna or known yourself to have a rich Inner Life that the philistines around you would clearly be incapable of understanding, the book will be a sure favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\"","review":"This book was mentioned on a TV program and sounded interesting.

The author certainly had a marvelous imagination...too bad he did not live long enough to see this book published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic reading.","review":"Was guided to this story by the program \\"The Will\\" on I'D. Had never heard about Toole or his two novels; but wow this is an incredible read. Truly enjoyed the humor along with the brilliance. Too bad the publisher kept rejecting this amazing book before John Kennedy Toole committed suicide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as Hell","review":"Do not read this book in public because your laughter will cause others around you to think you are crazy.This was the funniest book I have ever read. Once you get to know Ignatious and what makes him tick, everything that comes out of his mouth will have you laughing hysterically. Though at times you feel sorry for the guy, you can't help laugh at the life he has made for himself. Will Ferrell is playing him in the movie version which is coming out in 2005 - so read this before the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toole Should've Waited Around a Bit","review":"This book was one of those few to make me laugh out loud until I was crying - the sheer lunacy of this character is absolutely fascinating. Ignatius is the personification of the obnoxiousness that resides in all of us, and Toole's carefully crafted words paint a vivid picture of New Orleans, Levy Pants, and his mother's house. His letters to the Minx are somewhat tedious, but humouress nonetheless, his descriptions unique, apt, and crass. It broke my heart to think of this book's creator defeated by rejection, and missing the celebration of this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine comedy, sort of...","review":"I'll be concise, this is one of the funniest books you'll ever find.

I really wanted it to be funny, and I could see these ridiculous scenarios building up to their humorous climax in anticipation, but they quite simply weren't funny. I get what the author was going for - this absurd, delusional, quixotic train-wreck of a slob in Ignatius. It was a clever book at points (especially Ignatius' writings). I did laugh to myself a couple times, but most of the time, the humor missed the mark for me, and when something tries to be funny and fails over and over it just gets tired.I kept waiting for this to get funny all the way until the end of the book, it just didn't happen. Not a bad book per se, but given the accolades it's received, and the fact that it's a Pulitzer Prize winner, I'm very dissappointed. This is the first time I've ever read a Pulitzer winner and not been really impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY FUNNY","review":"EVERYONE READ THIS BOOK. I MEAN IT.

Not knowing what the novel was about, I was surprised to find it to be one of the best novels ever written. In one sentence, its a comic masterpiece. From the first page you are hooked and laughing. The characters are well-written and formed. On the same page you will love Ignatius, piety him, and dislike him. A good story revolves around its characters, not the circumstances. No book does this better then Confederacy. There is no boiler plot, build-up, suspence,or reality. However, it has Ignatius , the most unique character ever written into a novel. He is egotisitc, dirty, a slouch, idealistic, crazy, a day dreaming, narcessitic slob. He doesn't have one redemming quality about him. However, you can never forget him and you don't want to forget him. The sad part is Toole himself. He was an amazing writer, a hidden genius, who died too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very Enjoyable","review":"I did not really enjoy this book. Everyone raved about it, but I can't see why. I thought Ignatius Reilly was an annoying, unfunny jerk. I couldn't find anything amusing or interesting. I thought the attempt at humor was forced, obvious and rather pathetic. I could not finish the book because it was torture to read more than half of the book. I wish I could get a refund in all honesty. The prose was the only reason why I gave the book two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Confederacy of Dunces","review":"Yuck. Just Yuck. Don't waste your time or money on this.

Only someone trapped in the grip of despair could create a character, a character as near to being unredeemable as any other that I've found in literature. Perhaps Dickens's Uriah Heep comes close. At the end of \\"Dunces,\\" I felt sullied, yet also sad. I feel as though I'd watched a crime take place -- no, several crimes take place -- and yet could do nothing to stop them. This book, along with \\"Foucault's Pendulum,\\" perhaps the most pretentious book ever written, are the only two stories I've read that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend to anyone. Life really is too short.

The characters were well developed and immediately I was emotionally involved. The lunacy of the situations added to the story as much as the deep descriptions of sights, sounds and locations. What I found most amazing was how timely this novel is. While it was written many years ago, it is a story for our time, with many adult children returning home to the nest.

I couldn't finish more than 3 chapters. Some of the most painful reading imaginable. It may be that the author has captured the flavor of some community somewhere that I know nothing about, but I cannot imagine anyone wanting to be a part of such a community, nor why anyone would wish immerse themselves in it such a community by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not sit through it.","review":"I was too annoyed with the main character.He is this fat annoying man who blames everyone and victimizes himself for every single situation.I find myself to be able to read through books easily and relate well...I see the satire in this.But I was very annoying and I could not find myself continuing this book any further.I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"When does it get funny?","review":"4.5 stars with 915 reviews.

I would give this book zero stars if that was an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"not nearly","review":"I chose this book because of it's \\"humor\\" and the intrigue of a work by someone who later commit suicide, sick yes but the truth. i didn't enjoy it. The main character really got under my skin and when i'm quick to laugh, i seldom did and was disappointed. Strangely it wasn't the counter-culture themes, the transvestites or the racial issues that bothered me, it really was Ignatius who repelled me at every turn. Maybe that's the point and that makes this a really good book.. maybe, but good book i want to read again, and i almost wish i'd never read this in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dud","review":"Although I'm usually pretty critical of books, it takes a lot in order for me to give a book only one star. I picked this one up because it had won a Pulitzer and I was going to New Orleans soon and wanted some relevant (fictional) reading. I don't deny that Toole had some ambitious aims when he began this book--and yes, I agree it's a satire. But I didn't find it that effective because I could barely recognize humanity in these people. I usually think of satire as a social criticism involving humor and exaggeration. This book is filled with exaggerations--but I really didn't find it funny at all. Moreover, I could see what types of connections the author was trying to make with his critique, but I didn't find them at all compelling or even believable. In fact, I found the casting to be trite and ill-formed and am forced to agree with previous reviewers in saying that the majority of the book seemed redundant and annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't understand the positives on this one","review":"I was really looking forward to this book but then found myself force reading to finish it. Part of the problem is that I really took a dislike to the main character - a completely worthless individual who all you learn from is how not to be. If you like to be inspired by stories this is not for you.(I didn't even find it amusing - are fart jokes really worth a Pulitzer?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why Toole kills himself","review":"As some have reviewed, I was one of those captivated by the prologue. The story of how the book was published is far better than the story itself. I too, found it difficult to pick up this book once it was put down. A mish-mash of vignettes, dream states, and letters by the 'hero' created a mood of boredom and disappointment. The boredom came from this book just not being funny. The disappointment mainly at how much time I was wasting in continuing to read it. I believe in finishing what I started and was determined to the end to give this a chance. The joke was on me. I was the true dunce. In reflection, maybe that's the irony here?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated....","review":"I read reviews of this book that said it was funny, so I decided to give it a try. I didn't find it amusing at all, a lot of the jokes were about Ignatius' \\"valve\\". I don't think six year old musings about gases and other bodily fluids particularly entertaining. Ignatius is a one-of-a-kind character, but rather irritating. He's always complaining about something. I'd suggest A Prayer For Owen Meany instead of this book, but who knows? You might enjoy it *if* you have that kind of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius Humor","review":"There has never been a character so richly developed as Ignatious Reilly. The author--sadly, deceased--introduced me to the seamy side of New Orleans through the eyes of this offbeat lunatic while incorporating tremendous humor and humanity into all his characters. A classic, one to be read over and over again. I can pick this book up now and turn to any page and find myself laughingly absorbed in its brilliant plot. No doubt Toole anticipated a sequel, and his suicide is a great loss to the literary world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Rubbish","review":"I also was suckered into buying this book based upon some user comments. Hopefully my comments and those of a couple of others here will enable someone else to escape the same fate.In summary, this book is boring rubbish!The characterisations are good but that is all this entire book has going for it -- the story is bland and boring. We do not care one iota for any of the characters.However, with great determination I struggled through the whole book in the vain hope that some element in the story would make the exercise worthwhile. But no, reading this book was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Isn't Wearing Any Clothes","review":"After reading this lousy book I am mystified that anyone could think highly of it. Poor writing, cartoonish one-dimensional characters, and a general attitude that people and life are despicable and worthless. It reads as if its intended audience was to be adolescent boys on ritalin. I tossed this trash into the recycling bin afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"The least fun I've had in years","review":"Apparently, this book is a comedy. I could't tell by reading it though. I think I laughed once near the end of the book. That's about it. True, the main character is ridiculous and the situations are absurd. But none of it is funny. It's just a long, repetitive, boring story about an annoying character that nobody could warm up to. If you read the first page and you don't laugh, drop this book, because it's going to be 400 more pages of the same slop."},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated","review":"Indeed this book has some genius in it, on the whole I thought it was just a little too much and I can't understand why there are those who think this is a great book.

Miguel de Cervantes was a great novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the simple minded.","review":"If you like your stories and plot simple and direct and sophomoric 'Three Stooges' like humor, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Way To Lose Your Appetite","review":"One doesn't need appetite suppresents when thinking of the protagonist of this lugubrious overwritten dirge. I couldn't help but wonder if the dunces referred only to the characters in the novel, or to those who paid for it as well.There is no beauty, insight, meaning or reason for this book. Avoid. Unless you crave the grotesque."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever read also","review":"Hated every page. Boring. Impossible-to-like characters, annoying dialog, and very little plot. I suspect that Ignatius J. Reilly describes the late author; he was indeed an extremely unhappy young man. I hope I never pick up drivel like this book ever again. That this book was given any literary prize whatsoever is flat-out astonishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I'm not even sure I want my Masters in English anymore!","review":"A bristling manifesto that attests to the dangers of being over-educated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Include me out","review":"I needed an audio book to listen to while commuting, and during the first two disks I was certain I'd found the perfect one: \\"Confederacy ...\\" was ROFLMAO funny. But by the end of end of disk 3 the antics produced only smiles, and when it came time to change to disk 5, Ignatius and most of the other characters were either so annoying or so over-the-top that I didn't care what happened to any of them.One positive: the narrator of the audio version, Barrett Whitener, is superb. He must have created 15-20 different voices, each was unique and ideally suited for the character's personality, especially Ignatius'."},{"rating":"2","title":"laugh out loud and reread over a lifetime","review":"I read this book around 1988 and have passed it around to friends over and over again. I have picked it up and reread it all the way through and also just poked through it. Ignatius is quotable, his sad, pathetic self is an amusing portrait of a loser, and self proclaimed intellectual who just can't get it together in this life."},{"rating":"2","title":"giggle, snort, laugh","review":"I have been disappointed in the past by great comic novels. This time, I laughed out loud on the subway to and from work at scenes of bewitching absurdity. Ignatius has a way with words that is sharply at odds with his position in the world. If you can't laigh at the hot dog vendor who eats his own profits well then, I feel sorry for you!The adventures are silly, and delightfully so. I think a person who doesn't get this book is taking Life too, too seriouslY! Lighten up and enjoy the racous New Orleans nightlife, the mad stereotypes. Irene, Lana and co. are just flights of fancy that will divert you from reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Didn't Laugh That Much, But Maybe It Was The Hype","review":"When I was first told about A Confederacy of Dunces it was described as a laugh riot. So when I read the book and only chuckled a couple of times I was dissappointed. The book didn't live up to its hype.The ending was quite good and I liked how the individual stories of each of the characters came together in the end. As a matter of fact, the ending alone is worth the price of the book (Myrna and Ignatius deserve each other).I found myself feeling embarrased for Ignatius throughout this book. After Toole described him, I felt like I had to go take a shower. Any other who can inspire that kind of response is worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind read","review":"Hilarious.

I picked it up based on several recommendations, read close to 3/4 of it waiting for the laughter-invoking part to begin, and it never happened... Can't even make myself finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you THINK you didn't like it...Read it again!","review":"One reading just isn't enough to do justice to this, yes, masterpiece.I've lost count as to how many times I've read ACoD, but it's probably around ten now, and every subsequent reading brings the genius of this novel into a little higher relief.A superficial reading will give you a few laughs. Another reading will give you a pretty good feel of New Orleans. Another one will add a dimension of sadness to the more obvious shortcomings of the several flawed or loathesome characters. By the fifth or sixth reading the loathing will have turned to a begrudging affection.By the eighth or ninth reading, you will be so familiar with the work you will begin to understand the genius of the moving parts contributing to something that utterly defies classification -- and you will be astounded by how far above and beyond the sum of its parts is ACoD."},{"rating":"2","title":"People that don't love this book frighten me","review":"I am not one to \\"go with the flow\\" by any means; popular opinion has very little to do with my opinions, or so I would hope. However, the \\"9s\\" and \\"10s\\" on this list of customer reviews are, in my own opinion, quite deserved. And while I am touched by the story of Toole's tragic life, I am by no means influenced by it in coming to my opinion of how good the book is (although the story certainly enhances my pre-existent disgust with the publishing industry and almost all the pompous, self-important windbags I've ever met who work in it).Having said that, I must also say this: The people who have given this book a low \\"rating\\" scare the life out of me, in much the way that someone who continually quotes David Cassidy songs disturbs me.

I don't think you can go wrong reading this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Toole's work is nothing short of brilliant. His characters are unique, disgusting, exciting and you just want to know more about them.

Reilly, the struggling intellectual troubled by the worldview of his coworkers, acquaintances and his own mother is one of the most hilarious characters of modern literature? Living his life along the lines of Boethius, Ignatius is out to change the world through his various roles as a low-payed employee at a well known trouser company and hot-dog vendor. Troubled exceedingly by 'that minx' Myrna Minkoff, who is leading a sexual revolution, Ignatius is changing the world one step at a time. I would recommend this book to anyone needing some colour in their life for a taste of a brilliant character in the setting of New Orleans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great piece of literature!","review":"When I began reading this novel, I was not sure if I would like it. As I read on, I felt myself not being able to put the book down. It keeps you reading on and actually laughing out loud. \\"What degenerate produced this abortion?\\" (69) This quote seems to sum up the main character, Ignatius. He is a character that you either love or hate. Toole has done an exceptional job at putting together wild characters that create this extraordinary novel.

He might very well be a contemporary of Garrison Keillor, or a latter-day PG Wodehouse. Such is the brilliance of this book.

As for me, I think I'll give this one a second read instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I had this book recommended to me by a friend and so I was interested in reading this. Also, I had read a great deal of positive reviews on this. So, I started to read this book rather eagerly expecting that I would be greatly entertained. However, as I got through the first 30 pages, I had to force myself to continue reading. I already despised the main character and had little interest in any of the other characters in the book. This book, unlike other great books, became a chore to read.In its defense, the book does get mildly more interesting as it goes along. This was perhaps its only redeeming quality. I found a couple of incidents in the book mildly amusing. However, having just finished reading this book. I can only recommend that you save yourself the time. This book leaves me feeling that I wasted my time.I'm honestly puzzled that so many people liked this book. It sucks. The only reason I gave it two stars is because certain statements that Ignatius made were mildly amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, bad kindle typsetting.","review":"(This review is for the Kindle version)I wanted to read this again, since I had fond memories of my reading from 20 years ago. Unfortunately the Kindle version's typesetting is distractingly bad. The typeface is not changeable, and changing the size does not really help the problem. It's set in a serif font, and the spaces between the words are all over the place; some of the spaces look like five spaces. The kerning within the words, by contrast, is extremely tight. It just looks bad and does not flow, and it stinks because this book deserves better treatment. I would recommend a print version unless you are very forgiving of bad typesetting.From now on I will always try a sample first, so I can avoid ugly, cheap conversions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true genius has indeed appeared....","review":"The novel is based upon Jonathan Swift's epigram found in his \\"Thoughts on Various Subjects\\", which reads, \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that all the dunces are in confederacy against him.\\" The novel simply tells the story of Ignatius, a lazy, slothful, borish, rude, yet attractively humorous man, and his escapades with the common people that surround him.Read the opening few pages, and you will be very impressed not only by Toole's sophisticated diction, but by the magical scenes that he is able to create."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest book I've ever read","review":"I've read this masterpiece many times since it was published and, each time, I laugh out loud as if I were reading it for the first time. The characters are sterling, the plotting flawless and the writing witty. From its first description of Ignatius waiting for his momma outside the D.H.

The Pulitzer was posthumously awarded. The novel was written in the early-mid 1960's. The author committed suicide in 1969 at the age of only 32. After his death, the previously unknown manuscript was discovered by the author's mother who then successfully lobbied for its publication, which eventually occurred in 1980. The novel is a fascinating insite into OCD and intriguing characters in a compelling environment. There is also an excellent \\"audio book\\" available. The reading of the novel is enhanced when followed by reading to learn more about the author...\\"Butterfly in the Typewriter: The Tragic Life of John Kennedy Toole and the Remarkable Story of A Confederacy of Dunces\\" by Cory MacLauchlin and \\"Ken and Thelma: The Story of A Confederacy of Dunces\\" by Joel L.

Now, having quickly turned the pages, finding I couldn't put it down, and finishing it in two weekdays, I think I like it! I don't particularly like the characters (these are not the kind of people I would want to be friends with) but found them fascinating to observe in a reality television fishbowl kind of way. The fact that there is no plot per se, was actually fine with me. I just read the book as a series of misadventures and enjoyed the ride. The characterizations and absurdities brought to mind Catch-22 and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.The dialogue is quite clever and the dialects superb. It's unfortunate Toole didn't live to continue his writing career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please God send us back JK Toole","review":"One of the greatest pleasures I have ever had in literature. I re-read the book almost immeadiately. Talk about a genius who died young? I want this guy back!! Please read if you have not, I promise you will not be sorry, it is a work of true inspired genius.PS - makes me want to eat a Lucky Dog just thinking about the book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Utter Filth","review":"Toole crafted a train wreck of a book. Ignatius is a character that you love to hate. He is disgusting, rude, and conceded. Thank goodness there are mutliple plotlines and other characters. I say that it is a train wreck because you can not tear your eyes from it regardless of how disgusting Ignatius gets. You just have to sit back and wait for the other shoe to drop and Ignatius to get what is coming to him. Most of the other characters are pretty good, but Ignatius is the protagonits of the book so all plotlines eventually lead back to him. The book has a final twist at the ending that will leave the reader a bit frustrated. This book is definately worth reading, and it did win a pulitzer. It is a fairly quick read and is recommended for college age and above."},{"rating":"1","title":"It made me sick.","review":"I'm sure I will be called stupid for not adoring this book, but I just don't understand the following it has. A professor recommended it to me and I respect his opinion, so I tried to read it. I read 2/3 of it before I was so disgusted and angry at the main character, I could not finish it. There are only three other books I have started and not finished because I had such a strong aversion to them. This one was so bad, I recycled it. Maybe my humor isn't well matched with the humor in this book, because I didn't smile once. Most of the time I found my self dry heaving a little bit at the disgusting description of the main character. I suppose for that, I will give the author kudos for creating a character that was so revolting and colorful, that I literally almost threw up. I guess the fact that his character moved me to anger and disgust means something, but I cannot say it means that the book was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the few books in my life I couldn't finish.","review":"This book is the humor and intellectual equivalent of Jersey Shore. It's nothing but horrible people doing horrible things. Being somewhat OCD, I have difficulty not finishing a book once started. However, the only reaction this book created was hatred for the main character. I couldn't continue to slog through; try as I might."},{"rating":"1","title":"double edged sword - tiresome","review":"Both camps are right about this book. It is both funny and annoying. The people who think it's funny, love the laughs and ignore the fact that there is virtually no story. The people who hate it, don't. I laughed for about a hundred pages and then the book falls into tiresome repetition- Surface activity with no point. The protagonist is someone none of the reviewers would spend five minutes with. I couldn't make it past page 150 or so. A more interesting story would inviestigate how the publisher used word-of-mouth about the authors suicide as a marketing tool, allowing fans to credit themselves with coolness for finding this \\"underground\\" hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype (or the awards)","review":"I don't know why I wasted my time finishing this book, given the fact that there are so many finer works out there to read. I give it a half star.The plot is useless, the main character does nothing but pontificate on uninspiring topics, the remaining characters are flat. I enjoy a good laugh and have a mischievous streak in me, but this book never once made me laugh. Why is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes humour just doesnt translate","review":"John Kennedy Toole is a fine sophisticated writer of that there is no doubt. His turn of phrase is descriptive and vivid and his clarity of expression is a pleasure to read. His Pulitzer prize was earned and deserved in my opinion. However, sometimes humour and other charactistics of story telling, which is what this book definitely is, just don't cross borders. While I could appreciate the talent of the writer in an abstract manner, the story did nothing to entertain me. I was basically left unsatisfied and rather replused by much of the story, due, I am sure, to the inability of a non-american to relate to a very colloquial and private joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Not To Love?","review":"I could probably ramble for days about the comic brilliance in this book, arguing it may be \\"The Great American Novel.\\" Find out for yourself. If you like to laugh, this will keep you in tears. I don't think I can even recall the number of times I have read it over the years. It is like an old friend to me, although I usually try to avoid the Ignatius J. Riley's of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess you have to have been there","review":"If this book was awarded the pulitzer for generating emotion in the reader then it deserves the award. Unfortunately, for me it was nausea. The lead character embodied everything about modern America that I find repulsive. Grossly fat, completely self indulgent, narrowly educated, blaming all on others, and completely disfunctional. Yuck! This book will appeal to those who enjoy the pratfalls of the Three Stooges. No joy, no hope, no sense. Stupidity and insanity are not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I Just Didn't Get It","review":"I've been accused of having a sense of humor outside the mainstream. Reading all of the reviews below makes me believe this may be true. I don't know why, but I just didn't get it! I thought the story was stupid and boring. I got about 2/3 the way through and just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Oh well, different strokes, as they say..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho-hum humor","review":"Can't resist adding a note of dissent to the overwhelming chorus of praise this book has received over the years. \\"Humorous,\\" I suppose, but in a very broad, Vaudevillian way, where you see the joke coming from so far away that when it lands it causes a groan of impact, not a laugh. If you enjoy slapstick--the verbal equivalent of \\"Police Academy\\" movies--this may be the book for you, but I found it tired, strained, banal."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ulysses\\" - only with punctuation","review":"To paraphrase someone else's comment: an emperor with no clothes - possibly better than one with. I can only think he won the Pulitzer out of the committee's mis-guided sympathy for a seriously disturbed mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baffled by the high praise for this book","review":"I can honestly say that I don't understand what the other reviewers who give this high marks see in it, especially when they call those who don't like it \\"humor-impaired\\". Ignatius is pompous, narcissistic, and boorish, but just having those qualities doesn't make him funny - an author has to do something with a character like that, and Toole doesn't (at least through the first half, after which I gave up because it just got too boring). He and his mother are much like the characters on Desperate Housewives: having no redeeming qualities that might inspire even a slight bit of sympathy or relating, yet not evil or noxious enough to generate antipathy and interest to see how they might meet some kind of downfall. Instead you just wish they'd go away and stop bothering you. But then, I guess there are people who like Desperate Housewives too."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAD TO FORCE MY SELF TO FINISH THIS ONE","review":"I didn't find this book at all interesting or amusing. The characters were unrealistic. There was no plot. There was nothing funny about it. I forced my self to finish this one. But I consider it a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Into It","review":"I made it to page thirty-one. The first few pages were humorous so I thought I was in for a good book, but I quickly became bored. I just don't feel like a book should be work, and I was working to pay attention after those first few pages.It's interesting to me how some books can have such good reviews, and I think, \\"Meh.\\" Oh well, to each his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOOOOOOO! SPARE US!!!!!!","review":"I didn't like this book and I finished it out of determination. Personally, I found the plot slow and ripetitive, the characters more similar to jonsonian humours than real persons. The atmosphere of the whole book reminded me of a famous Italian comic strip \\"Alan Ford e il Gruppo TNT\\" (Alan Ford and the TNT Groups). Italian readers know what I'm talking about and will see this is no compliment. I grant the author a deep knowledge of medieval culture, though, and a good hand at mastering his own mother tongue. I wonder whether, had he lived, he would have written something really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm curious. . .","review":"I would like to know what percentage of the people who gave this book a 5 also said that \\"There's Something About Mary\\" was the funniest movie they've ever seen.

My husband must have thought I was crazy because I broke into gut busting laughter so many times. Ignatius J. Reilly is wonderful. When I saw his statue on Canal Street, from a distance, I knew immediately who it was. Ignatius and ALL of the characters in the book were wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not fabulous.","review":"This is a book that I have reservations about recommending. The pacing was good, the humor was there (although I didn't laugh out loud as much as some people), the characters were interesting (if a bit one-dimensional), and the plot was sufficiently twisted and surprising. I think the main problem I had was with the dialogue. Ignatius's interactions with everyone in the book made me shiver at his horrible interpersonal skills. But then I guess that's the point. The whole thing seemed somewhat implausible to me. I think I'll re-read it in a few months to see what I missed the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no middle ground with this book!","review":"I think it is important for people to know that you will either love this book or hate it. I know of about 20 people who have read this (including a women's book club) and most people loved it. However, the people who did not like it (mostly in the book club), had little good to say. If you look at the reviews, they are mostly 5 stars and the few 1 stars.If you are open, like a little dark humor and appreciate good writing this book is for you.

I later picked up a copy at the library expecting much hilarity. It was horrible. I couldn't bring myself to finish it.Roll forward a few years. I thought that maybe my tastes had changed and the book deserved a second chance. No joy. I found nothing funny about the book. It is just one inane situation after another, no ups or downs, just an anemic \\"plot\\" that droned on and on.Is the fondness for this book an elaborate and widespread joke? Maybe it is a story that people pretend to like because others do, sort of an \\"Emperor's New Cloths\\" thing. I don't know but I found NOTHING to like in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not funny.","review":"Front to back terrible. I bought it because I wanted a book that was funny rather than boring old serious and a friend recommended it, but it really just isn't actually funny. To be fair, if you find yourself often saying, \\"Oh that is too much!\\" or \\"Oh that is clever!\\" then you might be exactly the kind of person who will force yourself into finding this stack of toilet paper funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidity","review":"I read this book some years ago. In reading reviews here all the five star reviews astounded me. However, having read many of those reviews let me point out a couple recurring themes: \\"If you like the Simpsons you'll love this book.\\" If you like the movie \\"Groundhog Day\\" you'll love this book.\\" What this points out to me is the American public's declining \\"sense of humor\\". What I consider stupidity and childishness is now accepted as funny. If you want hilarious read The Canterbury Tales. This book is, simply,stupid. I rate it zero stars. For those who are impressed by the fact that the book won a Pulitzer prize: I guess you're also impressed by the Nobel prize; that great honor bestowed on Yassir Arafat for his great efforts toward world peace etc. etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird book","review":"This book was weird but lacked sense. It was like read a story that tried to be fuuny but was just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money and Time","review":"Like another John Kennedy (JFK), Toole has been immortalized for nothing more than dying young. Abusing one's widowed mother, eating everything in site, undermining one's employer just for kicks, yelling at strangers, threatening one's teachers, and dismissing blacks and homosexuals as manipulable minorities; are all not funny. If Toole had written a true farce, I could see the praise for this little book's little humor; but as it stands- with it's awful climax and resolution- this is nothing more than a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unslapped Knee","review":"I can't imagine why people are howling about this ponderous droll. My knees remain unslapped.I didn't even crack a decent grin before finally giving up. The phonetics are inaccurate to a fault and the characters sad and pitiable. Hilarious stuff.

Burn every copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a dunce for sticking with it","review":"This book was recommended to me by a good friend, and I trust his literary taste. At least I did until NOW. True, I listened to this book, and the reader was just passable. My biggest complaint about this book is that there are exactly zero characters that I warmed up to (Just thinking about that - UGH!) or wanted to hear from or wanted to know more about. I understand it is supposed to be funny - but trust me, this book is not funny like the early Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum books. It is not funny in any way. I admit it, I just don't get the attraction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I completely miss any comedic (or any other) value this book holds. The main character Ignatius seems to be to be suffering from Autism or some other similar affliction, and I find no humor in this. The characters may be original, but all of them uninspiring and just uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I found myself not caring about the main character and I didn't find the musings very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical bit of absurdity","review":"I mean, absurd the way Three Men In a Boat is absurd. Both are outright parodies, just of a different time and place, and I don't think I've ever read a book quite like the two of them.Ignatius is hysterical and eerily like some of my old high school classmates. Jones is one cool cat, and the only character with any inkling of how freakin' weird their world is. Mrs. Reilly is a riot, and ends up very nearly a figure of female empowerment. Best of all is Mancuso, the pathetic undercover cop whose various costumes are the delight of the French Quarter.Read this book. It's certainly fun, and you probably won't ever forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Confederacy","review":"This book should be considered a \\"classic!\\" I have never laughed out loud as hard as I did while reading this book. Everything from the characters to their series of comedic events had me in hysterics. The story focuses on the pathetic \\"dunce\\" of a man, Ignatius J. Reilly. This thirty year old (well-educated) man, who is completely dependent upon his mother, is forced to get a job. Every job he has, somehow, seems to interfere with his very busy life of doing nothing. Although he has a master's degree, he finds thoughtless, thankless jobs that he can't hold onto. His on-the-job blunders and his desire to change society as well as his interactions with the other characters make this the funniest book I have ever read. I would definitely recomend it to anyone who wants a good laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hooey!","review":"All you ranting people chanting \\"TEN!!!\\" must have read a different book than I did. I guess I just had a hard time laughing at a fat person and his drunk mother. This book made me incredibly uncomfortable. I am not surprised it won the Prize, the story about the death of the author even won me over before I was mired down in the dull goings on in the actual book. Toilet humor? You could call it that. But not very GOOD toilet humor. I will watch the South Park kids if I want fart jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"would give this book a negative 5 stars if possible","review":"So glad to see I'm not the only person who hates this book.Not much more can be said about this terrible book then what my other fellow 1 star reviewers have said. it's all true and I agree with them all. I got this as a library book because of my book club. So dissapointed! Glad I did not pay for this piece of junk!This book is NOT FUNNY.Hate Hate Hate Ignatius! Such a loser! I got a headache halfway through chapter 2.I tried and tried to keep reading out of repect for the Pulitzer Prize rating(and my sister who picked this book). Hoping beyond hope that the books characters would redeem themselves. Never happened.I personally like to read books that are interesting. I cannot stay interested in a book where I absolutely cannot stand the main character. It's like Catcher in the Rye all over again. Ick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"The characters are not interesting; they're just stupid people with some eccentricities. I got 7/8 through the book and was never amused, moved, or had any interest in the people, their world, or the plot (what little there is of it.) I'm not even going to bother to save the book and try again later. To me, it's simply crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, just plain boring","review":"While I can appreciate the positive reviews of this book, which sparked me to make the purchase, I was sorely disappointed. At page 75, I was bored silly. What, exactly, is the point of the story? The main character is repulsive with no redeeming qualities. As many reviewers have pointed out, the other characters are interesting, but that is about all I can think to say about them. I suppose this is a great character study, but a plot is severely lacking and the characters are just not strong enough to carry this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated","review":"I DONT LIKE THIS BOOK IT IS STUPID AND ITS ABOUT A FAT, FARTING MAN WHO SHOULDNT BE LIVING AT HOME ANYMORE AND WHO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF HIS PITIFUL MOTHER.i see where it is supposed to be funny, but the humor is twisted and weird.BAD BOOOOOOOOK!-unhappy reader"},{"rating":"1","title":"God, how I hated this book","review":"I bought this thing on the recommendation of a friend (who is one no longer) to read while traveling.

This is another example of things that are popular for no apparent reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better books that mix humor and social commentary.","review":"My friend had been badgering me for months to read this book and recommended it to our face-to-face bookgroup. I am an avid reader and love satire, humor, and farce as much as anyone, but this book did not do a thing for me. While there are humorous segments in this book, I never once busted a gut laughing or even laughed out loud. Ignatious was obnoxious, which I guess was what he was supposed to be, but if he was attempting to open our eyes to the superficialities of life, he did not succeed. I never really understood just what he DID stand for. I thought it probably pretty autobiographical and can understand how Toole may have ended his life if he in any way identified with his character. Sad, yes. Some redeeming value--maybe. Funny-not!! If you want a read that combines humor, satire, social commentary and anything else you can think of and really want to laugh may I suggest anything by John Irving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing abridgement","review":"Arte Johnson gives a wonderful interpretation of the characters' voices and accents. However, the development of Ignatious' personality suffers greatly due to the severity of the abridgement. The plot thread is retained, but many amusing asides and some of the more colorful vocabulary are missing. I would not recommend the audio cassette to anyone who has not read the original version of this exceptional novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre but well written","review":"Reminds me of the Fan Man which was better.

Toole definitely had talent, but it takes more than vivid descriptions to make a great book. I found the book utterly depressing. It gave me the feeling I get after a David Lynch film, like I need to take a shower. I kept trudging through it because I had heard such good things, but the good things never came. (...) How can so many people love this book so much? I guess the world would be pretty boring if we all agreed on everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A revelation","review":"I started this book twice (I stopped to read another book) and after reading about 100 pages, I still don't like it but I think I have a revelation.Most reviews of this book say how \\"hilarious\\" and \\"gut-bustingly\\" funny it is. I don't think it's funny at all; I don't think it was intended to be funny. I think the author created a character based on himself and this is how he saw the world. Ignatius seems to have major mental issues and is seriously detached from real life. His behavior isn't comical or quirky, it seems to border on insanity. I don't really understand the appeal of this book filled with unappealing characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"I have to agree with P.J. Otto of St.Louis on this one. What is the author trying to tell us; that fat, eccentric, neurotic personality-disordered individuals are funny? A sociological lession? Political satire?Much of the dialogue is clever but redundant. It becomes predictable after a few pages. Ignitius is never personalized. Throughout the book he remains a character construct. A hyperbolized combination of responses.If there is a great humanizing message here, it is inapprehendable by me. Without a redeeming message, the story is too quirky and uninteresting.A book that is overrated by virtue of too many people propelled by the momentum of a desire to see what has been seen by others."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious and heartbreaking","review":"This is the greatest contemporary book I've ever read.

The main character is so completely vile and off-putting that I kept wondering why I was using my precious time to make myself sick. The book could have used a good editor also, as it seemed to meander wherever the author's mind happened to wander that day. I hate to speak ill of the dead, but I got the distinct feeling that this book was hyped just because the author had died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but.....","review":"I had heard so much hype about how great this book was - a \\"bastion of great literature\\" masquerading as a comic masterpiece - so was quite excited to read it. I ended up finding the book funny....but that's about it. True, the main character was well-developed and brimming with pathology and the story kept me interested enough, but I was expecting some earth-shattering climax, a heartwrenching denouement....I mean, it did win a Pulitzer after all, no?The bottom line - the characters were funny (though their personal interactions not as satisfying as I had hoped), the plot moderately entertaining and the ending a little bit of a let down. I would recommend this if you just wanted a laugh or two, but wouldn't make it your next \\"must read\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"an awful book","review":"I have tried to read this book 3 times.

The characters are brilliantly thought out and he combines plots and situations very well. The statements that he makes about society in his own way are amusing and very poignant.That being said, I was expecting funny. Perhaps I have a horrible sense of humor, but I never thought I did. I didn't laugh out loud; I hardly thought the situation were funny. I tried to picture them actually happening visually, and I guess that was kind of funny, but still didn't do much for me.

Toole killed himself at the foot of the street I live on in Biloxi, MS. I wish I could have been there when he looped the garden hose from the exhaust pipe through the window into the car.

If you enjoyed \\"Catch 22\\" you should find this pleaseing after you get through the first third of the book. It definantly takes so time to pick up speed but finaly manages a strong gate through the end. Given the circumstances the book was written under, (a story as interesting as the book) this is a nice book that takes place in an time period of New Orleans that is rarely painted.The charector who lives in a self absorbed world where he could solve any problem if only anyone would listen to him, stumbles in and out of fringe social circles and environs haphazardly leaving a wake of confusion while remaining ignorant of his butterfly effect all the while.This would be a great introduction to dark humor and irony for a younger reader, but this may take a bit of pateince if you already have a firm background in Vonnegut, Heller, and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"What great dialog!","review":"Tiny print, but worth the eye strain.

Some people will walk away from this great book shaking their heads with incomprehension, \\"how is this a great book?\\", they'll mutter to themselves.Like parents from 35 years ago who couldn't understand what the attraction was with 4 guys with long hair from Liverpool- those \\"who don't get it\\" will be puzzled at joy of those who do.This book is a great way to make friends- those who \\"get it\\", not only share a love at poking fun at the absurdities of life, they are simply more aware of what the true absurdities are.I am tempted to suggest that the like or dislike of this novel is the best indicator of one's intellectual and emotional acumen. If you truly think you're brilliant or wise- read this book. If you don't like it, let me be the first to tell you that you are either an intellectual midget or a PC zealot, or both."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAUGH UNTIL YOU CAN'T BREATH","review":"If you love intelligent humor that holds something new at each reading then you MUST NOT PASS UP THIS OPPORTUNITY. Quite possibly the funniest book I have ever read. Brimming with oddball characters of every description and scenarios beyond belief this book is the Mona Lisa of humorous literature. Uproarously hilarious! The tragedy is that Mr. Toole's literary career was cut short by his untimely death."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ANTI-HERO PAR EXCELLENCE","review":"Initially, one is tempted to regard the protagonist Ignatius as a vile, offensive slob, but as you continue, you come to admire him for his gall, his meanness, his bloated self-confidence and his overwhelming self-righteousness. The plaisir du texte is of course, enhanced by the wonderful interweaving web of plot and subplots, and by the colourful array of characters. This is one of those rare novels that becomes so addictive that you compulsively read on between the fits of hysterical laughter. Not one word is unnecessary, not once sentence is superfluous. It is in fact, absolutely brilliant and for someone like myself who has no intention of reading Rabelais or Cervantes, it is sufficient. I recommend it also as a very effective cure for depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"My valve!","review":"This is the greatest book ever. Truly a masterpiece. Sad to know that John Kennedy Toole committed suicide over his depression when he could not get it published, then his mother took on the quest, got it published posthumously, and it won the Pulitzer Prize! I have read most of the Pulitzer books, and this is one that really truly deserves it. Read it, you will certainly be well entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed out loud until it hurt!","review":"The funniest book I have ever read.

Sorry to say anyone who doesn't love this book--has no sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Satire","review":"It's Ignatius J. Reilly versus the French Quarter. It's Ignatius J. Reilly versus the erotic Myrna Minkoff. Ignatius is a severely overweight man with an intolerable problem with his pyloric valve. One wrong emotion and it clasps shut and traps odoriferous gases inside his gigantic body. A wheel of fortune spins to define Ignatius' next move. He is forced, for the first time, to work for his money in lieu of sponging off of his poor mother. The real world is cruel to him, but eventually he finds his calling as a hot dog vendor, pushing a cart with the words \\"Twelve inches to paradise\\" scribbled on it. This is the story of man who cannot be accepted and therefore cannot except. John Kennedy Toole was a genius of the novel. He writes as a contemporary Charles Dickens. His satirical style is serious yet hilarious at the same time. A Confederacy of Dunces is by far the greatest representative of society in the United States of America. One can do nothing but laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Transaction...Ignatius would be pleased.","review":"I plan to give this book to my Mother for Christmas. It is one of my favorites.The book arrived in the condition I expected.Thank you very much. All the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"world of dunces","review":"The world of Ignatius Reily is very erratic but it is easy to identify with him. You are going to hate him at too many places in the story, yet there is something genuine about him. He does the most awful kind of things, but you never know whether he is doing that intentionally, full mindedly, absent mindedly or it just a part of his highly intellectual mideval, semi-selfish almost unemployed negligent personality.Apart from Ignatius Reily, there are more characters in the novel that are very genuine. I believe that genuinity of the personages gives a lot of vitality to the story.It is amazing to see that this book was written almost 30 years ago, but it is still very modern and the situation of Ignatius is absolutely not unusual to see at the beginning of the 21st century.If you like to read a book in order to think read this. If you do like to read a book NOT to think you can also read this because readability and having fun with the story are warranted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Characters, Colorful Humor, Deserved Better Ending","review":"A grand ball of entertainment. It's real flavor comes out if you've been through the Big Easy and the Quarters. I can well imagine how much New Orleans natives would enjoy it. Each character was pathetic enough to catch your attention, and kind of feel sorry for them. The way Toole relates each one to our tragicomic \\"hero\\" is the author's forte in this book. Looking at life through Ignatius's \\"worldview\\" was quite disturbing and comical. However, it seems like Toole hurried with the ending, as the book ends rather abruptly, and - I don't believe I'm saying this but - too happily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Optics Planet is difficult to deal with - item is out of stock","review":"I wish I had known this item is out of stock.

No wonder my kids are confused in this modern society. They believe that your book will dissolve all bitter issues between a parent and a child. In my opinion, this is not a healthy book for settling conflict. It only adds fuel to the fire of less than healthy relationships. Lines like , \\"I will enjoy seeing you disappear.

Garth Brooks is a complicated man, but instead of doing the research to get inside his head, the author just trifles through the facts of his life.

I'd give this book 0 stars if it was an option.

What we have here is a well put together game, complete with a challenging difficulty, good graphics, tolerable voice acting (and despite what some reviews have said, Optimus and Megatron ARE voiced by their respective voice actors, Gary Chalk and David Kaye), and the real star of the show, GOOD gameplay.

Classic megatron, starscream, Optimus Prime, Shockwave, Soundwave, Blaster, Tracks, Ultra Magnus...just to name a few of the excellent characters that are being ignored in this game.

This game is based on the Transformers Armada cartoon series, NOT the G1. Originally they were going to call it Transformers: Armada but then the cartoon changed to Energon and so they scrapped the Armada part. The Mini-cons are a part of the Armada and Energon worlds NOT the G1 world. The game play does take time to get used to but with some time devoted becomes much easier. This is not an easy game. I'd recommend this for gamers 10 and up due to the challenge. A great game for those not expecting G1 Transformers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"As a die hard Transformers fan I too was excited when i heard there was a transformers game being developed. However when i soon learn it was on armada i got a little disappointed. However i have read up on the development of the game and it is said to be based on the comic book armada by dreamwave which is of course a little darker and not so childlike. No true fan would pass on the opportunity to try the game and anyways the graphics and the gameplay are great. I was really impressed with the way they incorporated the minicons.

Also, I instructed and advised foreign troops. So, I read this excellent book differently than the other Amazon reviewers . Ford's book is also a metaphor for how we COULD have won the war in SE Asia. Our special ops people (SF & SEALS)had the right idea and the proper operations in place to win. Our guys won every battle, including Tet. The war was lost by careerists vs warriors, i.e.,too many career ambitious remf staff officerswho defeated the special operations mindset whenever they could.Also, the war was lost by nitpick meddling from elected things in DC and by a defeatist media. If you don't believe me, read what the miltary leaders of the NVA wrote in their histories of that war.Ford's book is a metaphor for this interpretation every bit as much as it is for the civilian interpretation.

The helmet looks awesome, it looks very quality and from handling it, it seems to be excellent quality, however the size is definitely meant for children. Based on the sizing chart from the manufacturers website (for adult helmets), my wife needed a small. So, we ordered a small. When it arrived she tried it on and it was way too small. My 11 year old daughter tried it on and it was even to small for her. It fit my 8 year old son the best, but it was pink so we opted to send it back instead of making him wear a pink helmet. We're going to order another, however this time we'll be ordering a large."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess I'm XXL","review":"I need a size 7 3/4-8 1/4 hat. I assumed that the XL would be good.

One of them was Lovers & Gamblers by Mrs. Collins... and the rest is history... after finishing Lovers & Gamblers I wanted to read all her books. To this day this is still one of my favourite books by JC. If you liked her other books then you will love this one. It has it all.... love, sex, drugs, scandal and lots more. I always like her characters some of them good , some not so good but all very interesting and at times complex, she definitely knows them well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I bought this book at a convience store while I was on vacation not knowing who Jackie Collins was.

It's an example of why too many people think that Jewish music is dull and old-fashioned. Judy's voice is thin and tremulous, the musical accompaniment is practically non-existent. One gets the feeling that Judy's loving family paid to help her make this recording on a shoestring. The renditions are so solemn, slow, and lifeless that this might be funeral music, not music for a joyful celebration of food, family, and freedom.Don't waste your money and for goodness sake, don't make your seder guests listen to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs of the Seder or Dirges of the Seder?","review":"This CD sounds like it was designed for a Passover Seder just after a funeral. Passover should be a joyous, exciting and fun holiday. Many of the songs are usually uptempo, uplifting and inspirational. \\"Songs of the Seder\\" slows everything down and turns exciting songs into dark, slow, sad pieces. Hee Nay Mah Tov, Go Down Moses, Dah-yay-noo and others all sound as though they are on the wrong speed. We were extremely disappointed with this disk, particularly since we read such nice reviews of it on this site.By way of comparison, try Cindy Paley's \\"A Singing Seder\\" which is full of life. fresh and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Buy It!","review":"Not really a Hammond B-3 record as much as a general purpose funk workout by very talented musicians. Every song is good, but particularly so is \\"Running Away\\" which became one of my all-time favorite songs of any type the first time I heard it. My two-year old daughter begs me to play this song every night, and I never get sick of it. The musicianship is excellent throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was a lower rating ...","review":"Have to agree with the other reviews. In looking at books on ghost hunting, this one comes in at the bottom of the pile. Poor writing, poor editing, and very little useful information.

Most of the others are a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor offering","review":"This is an extremely poorly written book. The gammar and spelling is atrocious and it does read like a poor highschool report (that would get a D or maybe a C-).

The author appears to be 13 years of age at best given his outlook on the topic and his general attitude. The advice given in some areas is bad at best and might get you arrested in a worst case scenario.I don't trash many authors as I know how difficult it can be to write something but there are only 2 valid reasons I can think of to buy this book. 1) To see how NOT to write a book about this topic 2) for firewood kindling."},{"rating":"2","title":"grace","review":"I discovered this book while searching the web for WWII info related to my father's experiences during the war and on the USS Montpelier.

And let me tell you, I was not disappointed! I do believe that this woman could make a grocery list read witty!Behold, Here's Poison is an entertaining little murder mystery with a \\"Clue\\" sort of vibe to it. The characters are a little wacky, but in a delightful and amusing way. There's the outrageously thrifty Miss Matthews, moocher extraordinaire Mrs. Matthews and her spawn...and then there's Mr. Randall Matthews, newly made head of the family. I fell in love with his quick tongue and smart remarks...made me laugh out loud a few times, drawing odd looks from my husband!Thanks to Danielle at Sourcebooks for the opportunity to read such a great book! I truly enjoyed it and I think you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MIGHTY ENJOYABLE MASTER PERFORMANCE","review":"The book itself is already highly enjoyable. Now this audio version by Hugh Dickson is MIGHTY enjoyable master performance if you ask me. I had been listen to it so many times over and love it every time because of the characters, dialogues, and the humors. Georgette Heyer + Hugh Dickson - BEHOLD, this book is a must read must listen and an absolute keeper.p.s. The plot of this book is great in my opinion. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I'm not a fan of Ms Heyer's regency romances, but I have enjoyed her mysteries. In this book, the tyrannical patriarch of a family is discovered dead in his bed. While his sister, sister-in-law, niece and nephew who live with him believe he must have died of a heart attack in his sleep and his doctor declares he died of natural causes, his other sister who comes over, takes one look at him and demands a postmortem, much to the alarm and horror of the rest of the family.The heir is loathed by all in the family for being irreverent and rude. But is he all that he seems? The results of the postmortem indicate that death was the result of poison. But how was it administered and who could have done it. Our Inspector Hannasyde is baffled at the lack of clues. There is no shortage of suspects ... it seems everyone had a reason to want dear old Uncle dead. In building the case, Ms Heyer keeps us guessing right until the last couple of pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to trudge through this one","review":"Even worse than The Unfinished Clue, this one is no fun at all...where's the mirth? Bickering family members nagging each other on the same topics again and again. Almost each one with a plausible motive and opportunity because supposedly the method of administration of the poison was not known. But if you're familiar with the methods of Murder She Wrote and how the camera zooms in on everyday objects because they are major clues, you will also understand how the poison was administered just after the murder because the author \\"zooms in\\" on the clue. Nothing special/clever about the solution. This was my 4th Heyer book and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of Heyer's better efforts","review":"I believe Georgette Heyer was hoping to make the cousin Randall an attractive bad boy a la Johnny Depp; instead, he comes off as simply repugnant, like Philip Seymour Hoffman in the indie film \\"Happiness.\\" Some of the other characters are simply caricatures. As others have mentioned, Heyer is tight-fisted with the clues, although the set-up is a clever one.Detective Inspector Hannasyde is an amiable and clever fellow, but readers would do better to instead read \\"The Unfinished Clue,\\" which is a better mystery with more likable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take me to your world/i don't wanna play house Tammy Wynette","review":"THIS ALBUM HAS TO BE THE MOST TREASURED I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND YET.

The \\"proof\\" on which the Rogue Warrior bases his decision to seek to punish the \\"bad guys\\" is a little thin, except that in the final momemnts he is proven to be correct. One only hopes that somewhere the goverment actually does have at least one real rogue warrior out there protecting us from the real bad guys. The world does need real SeAls to keep us safe.Having known a number of SeAls, the fact that the fictional Marchinko speaks several languages and can drop literary references is not at all farfetched.

To be specific he actually takes on several IRA splinter groups two of which(the Green Hand Defenders and another one called the True IRA) prove to be some of the toughest and best trained bad guys dick has yet faced.Like all of his books this one is true to life in terms of Counter Terrorist tactics, intelligence gathering and the deadly effeicency of the Irish guerillas.

Dirty Dick will warp your mind if you don't move fast, stay low and watch your six! As the author of FADED COLORS, knowing personally \\"Nasty Nick Grundle\\", \\"Indian Jew\\" and some of the other sorry lot of heroes, brave American warriors each, put nothing past these characters.

The story involves Chaym Smith, who offers himself as a decoy/stand-in to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., because he bears too familiar a resemblence to the good Doctor. Told from the perspectives of Dr. King and one of his aides, Matthew Bishop, the novel took us from marches to meetings involving heads of state to the breakdown of Chaym's personality, which was a complete 360 degrees from that of man he was hired to impersonate. The author was able to structure the personalities of the players involved and made the fictional charaters of Matthew and Chaym convincing and compelling. However, the book was so weighed down with thoughts and agendas that were so complex in context, that it was a little hard to get back on track, especially when you have forgotten where you left off, and you are still reading the book. A good read for those wanting something different and four-dimensional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, great ideas--but what happened to Chaym?","review":"A provocative novel from a wonderful writer set around a fascinating character--MLK. Johnson does well both in making Martin seem very real, yet in not \\"overusing\\" him--the real protagonists are three \\"Movement\\" members who move in his orbit and are themselves complex, interesting characters. Lots of food for thought here, including musings on the (sinful) nature of humanity, repeatedly amplified by the mythic story of Cain and Abel, which Johnson uses on several levels. The best part of this book is Johnson's thoughtful condemnation of extreme (intolerant) ideology, as exhibited by separatists black and white. The one flaw, in my view, was Johnson's failure to follow through on the use of MLK's double, Chaym. As the plot nears its climax Chaym is co-opted by the FBI, which intends to use him to discredit MLK--but then Chaym simply disappears from the story. Still, a very worthwhile book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frighteningly dull and boring","review":"This book was extreamly boring and it blabbed on for 250 some pages about these boring, flat characters which I didn't care about and only to end with some dumb philisophical ending saying, \\"We all killed Martin Luther King\\". If you want to read something good about Martin Luther King, read a non - fiction, because this was just a pile of trash. After all, I don't think many people want to read a book with some man (Chaym) that has fecal problems and buys japanese porn. My entire college class couldn't stand this book, so I doubt very many people can."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waist of Time and Money","review":"Dreamer, while a good concept it lacks something. The story does not grab the reader's attention and for this reason took a long time to read.

It seemed like they were just trying to fill the CD and didn't have enough so they included a bunch of remixes that I'm not very fond of. Luckily, I don't have to listen to them.

I do rather like it- but again I would prefer it more simple. And all those who think they can recognize Zimmer? sorry, but Badelt would not have been credited with composing the melody on Curse had he not done just that.I don't think Zimmers variations on the original theme do anything for the music or the film. I liked the original- a more contemporary treatment is just not my cup of tea- but it will be for someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first!","review":"I was greatly surprised by this soundtrack. I immensley enjoyed the first Pirates soundtrack, but at the same time, hearing the same themes over and over again got a little tiring. While still keeping some of the original themes, Hans Zimmer has incorporated some new themes into Dead Man's Chest. This cd has more variety in my opinion and some great new score. I particularly enjoy the new \\"Davy Jones\\" track... haunting, yet lovely, frightening, yet peaceful... that track sends chills up my spine every time I listen to it. The original themes appear in different tracks throughout the cd. Along with the dark and dangerous music, Zimmer also adds some of the light and cheery in different tracks such as \\"Tortuga\\". They also even added a bonus remix track that is quite fun to listen to, even if it is out of place. Overall, I think this cd is wonderful and I am going to be enjoying it for many more days to come. I highly recommend it to any pirates fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not nearly as good as the first soundtrack","review":"If you're a PotC fan, you'll buy this in any case. However, this soundtrack is nowhere near as good as the first one--Klaus Badcelt's soundtrack is, in my opinion, the best soundtrack ever made.This soundtrack, while more darker, has a more \\"synthesized\\" feel, which really doesn't fit with the overall movie. What really dissapointed is the last \\"bonus\\" track, which is an awful remix, and I have absolutely no idea why Zimmer even put it on there.I'm going to give it another chance, but so far, I am dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good.","review":"Not only is the movies great but the sound track will be great thing to add to the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed in this.","review":"It was like Hans Zimmer was too lazy to think of anything new.

I have faith in Freedman's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This was the first Freedman novel for me. I have since read the Disappearance and have just started Against the Wind. Above the Law was a great story, very suprising, suspensful, couldn't put it down. However, (and I know this is not Mr. Freedman's fault), there were MANY errors throughout the book. I was amazed. I have never read a book with more than one or two errors, but this had at least a dozen, maybe more. It didn't deter me from liking the story or reading another book by this author, but it was extremely frustrating. I didn't notice any in The Disappearance, but I did notice it was by a different publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"Though there were some problems, I did enjoy the first thirty pages of this novel: Nice dramatic plotting that grabbed me. Before long, the reader encounters developments which make little sense. Also,there are typos and really sloppy syntax which become increasing tiresome. I'm beginning to think we should all chip in for some of these best-seller authors to retake English 101. Simple sentence structure is obviously beyond many of them. The editors must have been on vacation when this one was published. About page 150, I just couldn't stand anymore of this tripe.Oh, it does not help that the protagonist is a jerk. A Muir County D.A. requests attorney Luke Garrison assume the role of special prosecutor. When he eventually decides to accept, he makes absurd demands, such on-demand use of air transport to and from his home (quite far away) and obscenely high fees for a financially depressed area. Were I in the D.A.'s office, I'd have suggested this egotistical SOB go take a flying leap!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"As one person stated, this book has many flaws. One, it needed a better editor, just like Freedman's last book I read- Key Witness. Two, like someone else mentioned, the first story in this book, had nothing to do with the rest of the plot and it did not add to character development etc. It should not have been included. Three, it was slow going for me to get into the mystery and story. It was nearly 2/3rds into the book that I felt the story was finally moving along and I was finally getting a bit interested.Overall, I think I had a hard time getting into the story because I just didn't care for any of the characters, not even Luke. Especially not Nora or Jerome. At least, after sticking it out I did like the ending, although I predicted it early on and it was a bit far-fetched. I would not recommend JF Freedman, while I enjoyed The Disappearance, I have not liked any of his other books and I don't plan on giving him any more chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre plot, OK characters, std liberal ideology","review":"Overall pretty mediocre. You must believe a lot of nonsense to get through this book without throwing it down: 1) guy is killed and death ruled a suicide in the face of the simplest clue 2) Lady DA is dirty 3) She thinks the DEA will eventually solve a crime through sheer persistence (completely laughable) and so hires a friend who she knows is real smart to pursue the case, etc.Writing is about 2 steps above poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Local cops and DA versus the FBI !","review":"This is the first J F Freedman book I had read but by now I have also read The Disappearance. If I had not read this book first, I might not be so interested in going backward into this author's work!I found it to be a page-turner, and was thrilled with the expert team the special DA pulls in to assist in his investigation of the circumstances.There are a lot of plot twists as well as many additional interests from the involvement of a native American tribe, a suspected drug felon, the DEA and other local versus national agencies.The denouement was never as obvious as in the Disappearance so I gave it an A+!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was extremely delightful--no nudity, no cursing, was a nice family film.","review":"I chose this rating because it was an over-all family film--good for us all & I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday for Love","review":"This is a great movie, but the video was in bad shape.

He is sent there by his company, Beane Tractor Corp., incognito; who is planning to downsize.And about a widowed mother (Melissa Gilbert) who, like most of the town, works for Beane's building tractors and can't afford to lose her job.

The story was terrible. The \\"acting\\" was amateurish.

I am not going to say the acting was bad(it is).A spacecraft twice the size of Yankee Stadium with an impressive crew of 7-rescues the only survivors of a ship that was attacked by space pirates. the rescued are 4 beautiful women and are soon revealed to be the pirates and they take over the rescue craft. The balance of this atrocity involves an egg-shaped, green glowing orb which turns the cast into flesh eating space zombies. Since the entire cast is 11-the zombies will be hungry pretty soon.There is one scene worthy of MST3K. The only survivir boards an escape pod as the ship blows up. The escape pod looks and is the size of a coffin. All the escapee needs is a pair of pants, a low cut tee shirt and a portable oxygen tank and mask. There is a surprise and I could issue a spoiler but the movie is so ridiculous no one would care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Is Steve Railsback forced to remake \\"Lifeforce\\" again and again like it is some sort of celluloid Flying Dutchman?This is bad.

A spaceship with a small crew has some sort of energy transmitter on board that is needed on earth. Without any real explanation the crew is then attacked by zombie like creatures, that boarded the ship claiming to be in need of being rescued. At first those rescued people seem normal but then they suddenly turn into zombies. And that's it .... really that's all there is to it, except of course the inevitable shootouts and fights between the crew and the zombies. Really, a bad flick if you ask me. The plot just stinks, cause besides the shooting nothing ever else happens, for some 80 minutes or so. Avoid, this turkey, because its not even worth renting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Children's Classic","review":"My parents got this book for us when we were in Australia in the late 80s. Reading it made me want to learn more about classics Australian children's books, (some of them are mentioned on the back cover) like \\"the Magic Pudding\\" and \\"Dot and the Kangaroo\\".

An album that puts everyone to sleep, if it doesn't annoy you enough to turn it off first. Me, I'll take Burl Ives singing \\"The Moon Is the North Wind's Cookie,\\" & an assortment of Mozart adagios for promoting a peaceful dreamland. Or Kristin Hersh's \\"Murder, Misery and Then Goodnight,\\" a collection of traditional folk songs she learned from her father. \\"Now the Day Is Over\\" thank heavens, maybe tomorrow won't be as boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innocence Mission is an appropriate name","review":"Not the worst cd I have and certainly not offensive.

I heartily endorse what a previous reviewer said about lazy consonants...first Karen was seeing fields of \\"gween\\", not she's warbling about \\"two dwiftas\\". Now her homeland is being blessed \\"fowever\\", making me wish for the blessing of Julie Andrews' diction.If it was a genuine speech impediment I would not carp.

We have a one year old baby, so a friend gave us this CD as a gift. For me, Karen Peris's voice has the \\"nails across the blackboard\\" effect on me. She has no range and her voice is cloying. I am not expecting rock 'n roll or anything like that, but I just cannot find anything attractive in her voice. She absolutely \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\\" a classic and a song that I want to associate with my relatively unspoiled childhood.

As I began reading the essays, I kept thinking the next one must be better because what I was reading represented the writing skill of a college junior.

My daughter gave me this book for Mothers day and we have been passing it around in the family for the past few weeks. We love the illustrations, too. It reminds me of James Thurber's \\"My Life and Hard Times\\". (Another Family Favorite)Even our youngest (in fourth grade)has been very much enjoying these lovely little stories. She said she has never read a story before about what it's like to have Attention Deficit Disorder. She has ADD, so that piece has been a source of comfort to her. She reads it again and again.The one about Jaquith stuffing herself with Cheese Doodles when her husband was out of town reminded me of myself.

Just get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is so funny--NOT!","review":"I am just baffled by all these customer reviews, and it makes me a little suspicious where they've come from. This book (and I read at least half of it) isn't the fantastic, incredible thing all of these reviews (self-promotions?) claim it to me. It's not horrible, either. It's just, I don't know, trying SO HARD to be charming and cutesy and folksey. Good, honest writing doesn't read like the author is trying so hard. Sorry to be so negative, but my wallet is lighter after buying this book, and I feel a little deceived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"I read the book in question and found it amusing and well-written. Not sure what all th brouhaha is about with these othre one-starred reviews.

This book is boring and, like someone else wrote here, like that of a college student, and not a very good one at that. The humor is insipid. The quality of the book is like that of a vanity press, and, sure enough, that's what it is! Look up Xlibris Corporation on Google and what do you find?

Pedestrian writing that insults the intelligent reader. Dorris' book rambles on with low-rent symbolism and meandering plot, resulting in nothing but drivel. I get the feeling that the book is so popular because of the large number of liberal pseudo intellectuals in the world who love anything to do with oppressed people and are too unsophisticated for Rushdie or Ellison (to name just two).

If it wasn't for that maybe it would be a decent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was about what?","review":"Where do I start with this book, first off the authour has some serious issues in regard to the relationships between children and those they should be able to trust. It is too much of a coinsidence that Michael Dorris had alegations poised against him of the same nature. Second the book goes no where it brought up all kinds of questions during the entire book that were never answered. This is a disfunctional family portrayed by a disfunctional authour. If there was zero stars I would give it that, I feel upset that I had to pay to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book wasn't deserving of such high regard","review":"My rateing should drop the average down a bit. I thought that the book showed little in the area of creativity, and the only interesting parts were when the story of aunt Ida unfurrled. I thought that the series of events between rayona and the preacher would have led to more of a dramatic conclusion then never hearing of him agian. I don't see why this book got any praise except for the fact that people are suckers for books about the trials and tribulations of minorities. Don't asume that I'm a racist, because really I'm not. I don't have any problem with the main charectures being indian (and rayona being mixed), but it shouldn't be aplied in the rating of the book.-- In my opinion this book would have only made two or three stars at most had it been about some white family. It shouldn't be that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a quick book to read, and an enjoyable one too!","review":"I had to read this book for my English class, so I was very happy when I got into the book and realized that I actually really liked it. Michael Dorris \\"braids\\" the stories of the three generations together in a way that keeps you wanting to read more. \\"...the rhythm of 3 strands, the whispers of coming and going, of twisting and tying and blending, of catching and letting go, of braiding.\\" Even though the women are all very different, their lives are intertwined by their similarities. The characters all seem very real and are well developed. The book is written in a fairly casual language which makes it a pretty quick read. The way the book moves back in time, was a very interesting and effective way to tell the story. I would highly recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"This book was one of the most interesting I have read. I found the telling of it backwards (so to speak) was both refreshing and enthralling. It made the story more suspensfull, and I just couldn't put it down. And the surprise ending is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story telling","review":"Dorris has captured a very intrinsic feature of the Native American way of life. Not including the way native american women feel and talk, but with the men in the story who played minor roles in a major way. The interweaving of three stories of Ida, Christine and Rayona clearly reveals the way the three women actually see their lives and their situaion. Loved it....It was easy to feel the emotions of the women due to Dorris excellent narration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real women","review":"You'd never believe this book was written by a man.

Told story with their own experiences and their view of one another. The best thing about this book is the hidden secrets from one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tale, filled with secrets.","review":"In this unusual layering of story about three generations of native American women, Michael Dorris reveals his remarkable ability to write convincingly in three distinct female voices.The stories of Rayona, Christine, and Ida begin as each is coming of age, each confronting her sexuality, and each struggling to confront and handle her relationship to her native American culture. The story works backwards, beginning with the granddaughter and ending with her grandmother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why isn't there a choice for no stars?","review":"The ending to this book was by all means, terrible. The only reason that I finished this book was because I had to read it for school. If I didn't have to read it, I would have put it down after the climax. In my opinion, the climax was in the first chapter when you begin to wonder if Christine will actually drive off the cliff."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I had to read this book for school and I first thought it was ok. But the story refused to start and I was stuck with no suspense to keep me reading. My advice is not to read this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have ever read","review":"This book was so boaring it was sad. I had to read it for Adv. Americna Lit and hated every one of the 372 pages. It had no plot, no theme the characters were horribly undeveloped. It left you feeling empty and wondering why you'd wasted the time you spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS BOOK LIKE NO OTHER!","review":"I would strongly advise against anyone reading this book unless they have trouble falling asleep at night. I was forced to read this book in an american literature class and the book became more unbearable as I progressed through it. The 300-some pages crawl at snail's pace. Apparently Dorris lived in my town for some time, a frightening thought because of his child molestation. As a last word, I would hope that no one will read this \\"novel\\", or even better, burn all the copies ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"ADEQUATE- BARELY...","review":"This novel was highly descriptive, and yet I was not impressed. However, this might be due to the fact that I read this after the superior \\"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\\" by Maya Angelou and \\"The Bluest Eye\\" by Toni Morrison (hail Princeton alumni)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not good","review":"I read this book for my \\"cultural expansion\\" unit in english my sophmore year. The story was one of cultural stuggle, and generational understanding. The author delt with the topic in a way that tried to make the reader empathize with the main character, but made the character make so many unintellegent decisions that i found it hard to empathize with anyone in the book. This book also tried to portray the native american culture and show how it has decayed over the last few decades. While this is all well and good, the author made me feel as indifferent as a history book for their cause. Do not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful End to a Long Journey","review":"Ok, here's the thing (and it's a trend I've noticed among all Dorris's reviews, you need to have faith that the read will be worth the time spent. It took me a couple months of looking at it in my bookshelf before I got around to reading, and even then I found the language easy and the plot somewhat entertaining. The thing you will notice is that its quite a long read and the book, broke into 3 sections, will most likely scare you away when you find tedium in some of the passages. I stuck with it (out of respect for Erdrich's choice of husband) and found that the last two sections really sold my interest into the story, as all the loopholes are backfilled and twists in plot are revealed. My first cynical impressions at the beginning were all destroyed and I found the characters more sympathetic and relatable. Give the book a chance, it was a wonderful finish, and it was nice to read fiction that taught me something valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chose this for my bookclub","review":"I chose this book for my bookclub and we meet this coming Wednesday to review it. I was surprised to see all the reviews on here from students who HAD to read the book for English. I thought the book was well written, it was confusing at the end, to have Aunt Ida on the roof with the priest and not know what happened to her, Christine and Rayona. However, I read that Michael Dorris wrote somewhat of a sequel to this book. Maybe if you aren't made to read this book you would have enjoyed it more, I thought the characters were wonderful, that Mr Dorris captured the female pysche in each woman. Definitely glad I chose this book as the April book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading in High School","review":"Michael Dorris weaves a tale of how three women have chosen their paths which affects their present and future going back into the past lives of Christina and Ida. The two women have secrets of their own that have affected each of them and how they treat their offspring.I read this book in my senior year of high school thinking that it would be another boring read. Instead, I found myself immersed into the book wondering how each female has led her own life. Rayona doesn't know why she is going back home and Christina doesn't know what she has done to make her mother Ida feel inferior to her. We don't know why Ida dotes on her late son Lee. The reader has to be fully absorbed into the book to understand each woman's story.We can't undue what has happened in our past but we can learn from it to make it a better future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate description of condition","review":"I purchased the audio CDs for my classroom. Although they were described as playing well, many do not. They skip badly. It's the first Amazon purchase that has not lived up to its description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhhhh.....","review":"If you look at all of the reveiws, you will find many high-schoolers reveiwing it, and it is this way for a reason: it is high-school quality writing. Everything from heavy-handed symbolism to a near soap-opera storyline brings this down. This is like one of those young adult books. You know, the books where the author can't really write, so he makes it \\"mature\\" (swears alot and fills it with adult situations) to make up for it. This is one of the most overrated books since Catcher in the Rye (both books make the fatal mistake of confusing a depressed, lonely, and abandonded character with a deep character. Neither author realizes that a character with only one or two emotions, no matter what they are, is a boring character). Still, it is an easy read, so feel free to try it out......"},{"rating":"1","title":"sink this raft","review":"Unlike most of the reviewers, I did not read this book for an English class. I'm a well-read adult who anticipated a powerful story (because of glowing reviews). I enjoyed the book up until Part III, when I thought Ida was going to tie everything together. She did no such thing. Her \\"voice\\" bore no resemblance to the character we met in parts I and II. Her story was a soap opera and completely unbelievable. This book was a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rafting","review":"Required reading for my son who is in high school and passed it on to me. The characters are very real and the secrets make it interesting. The writing was overly descriptive for my taste but the plot twists kept it rolling and I gave it four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for class a good one","review":"This book was required for my english honors class and turned out to be a great book. Thanks for making it easy to get since some of my classmates waited weeks for the book to arrive at the local bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to its reputation","review":"I had heard so many great things about this book, and had thoroughly enjoyed Michael Dorris's non-fiction work, \\"The Broken Cord,\\" but I couldn't finish this. It just felt like an aimless walk through a trailer park. I couldn't believe a single thing any of the characters did, and the capper was Rayona's rodeo ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"heartfelt and moving","review":"This book gets right down to the raw emotions. It doesn't try to hide anything, but presents its characters in harsh, unflattering daylight for all to see. There are no flimsy characters in here either, no simpering, fainting women who are afraid of the sight of their own blood. The story may not be ordinary, but it is certainly true to life. Michael Dorris allows the reader to get inside the heads of these three women, and experience firsthand their every thought, which is definitely not an everyday experience. The voice is appropriate to the characters and setting, and seeing as these women are far from being snobs, it is appropriate that the language be somewhat unsophisticated. All in all, this is truly a down-to-earth, amazing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"None too fun...","review":"Apparently, I'm not the only person who was forced to read this for an English class. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't all that great, either. It would have been much better if it had ended after the second section--you had a decent enough sense of closure there. But no, it has to go into this utterly irrelevant and pointless third part. Not a great read, I feel.

The Clanton/McLaury gang were cattle rustlers, but did that justify their being gunned down in cold blood? Tom McLaury was unarmed but still shot and killed by the Earps. Ike Clanton and Billy Clairborne were both unarmed and ran away, but still the cowardly Earps took shots at them.There were no \\"good guys\\" in the \\"gunfight\\" but there were players who were more in the wrong than the other, and those were the Earps. It's too bad that this movie didn't accurately portray this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed ...but flawed","review":"Among the unintentional laughs was the dramatic walk to the OK Corral by the Earps and Doc Holliday. This should have been released as a comedy.Another flawed, but still excellent, version of the Earps was \\"Tombstone.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyatt Earp","review":"A more historically accurate version of the Wyatt Earp saga. Less of the Hollywood glitter, I got a better sense of how and why he was what he was. I am a retired sheriff, I know how it feels to be the only one standing in the way, I got that same feeling with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good...","review":"I thought the HD video looked very good...sometimes soft in the long shots but almost always sharp in the close-ups. The audio was Dolby Digital Plus (640 kbps) and although not the best I've heard it was adequate for much of the movie. The surround sound stage was most pronounced in the two biggest gunfights - at the O.K. Corral and in the ambush scene in the rocky pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"A little drawn out, but still an awesome movie. Dennis Quaid is really good as Doc Holliday!!! I think it is actually better than Tombstone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not accurate, but a good one just the same.","review":"If your wanting to see a truly accurate portrayal of Wyatt, keep waiting as it hasn't been made yet (and knowing Hollywood it never will). But seeing Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Doc Holliday is worth it alone. I've heard people say this is more accurate than Tombstone but each movie has about the same amount of goofs. It's incredible that a movie made on an epic scale couldn't figure out a way to show Virgil and Morgans' shootings on different nights! (They happened three months apart)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Buying It Yet","review":"The movie is good, but I'll wait for the extended version (212 Min.) with commentary that will inevitably be released in the future.

I'll save my money until then and they lose a sale until then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyatt Earp","review":"DVD plays beautifully. Only problem I had with it is that there is nothing written on the DVD itself, except for very small print around the outside of the hole in the middle of the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyatt Earp rocks!","review":"I have seen every Wyatt Earp movie, documentary, etc. on Wyatt Earp, and there is no doubt that this movie is by far the best. I completely disagree that Tombstone is better. For one, Dennis Quaid is outstanding. This is the best performance he has ever done, and he puts Val Kilmer to shame as 'Doc'. This movie is also much more informative and accurate than Tombstone. Kevin Costner does a top notch job, and the expanded story line actually gives excellent insight as to why Wyatt Earp was so fearless, and why he acted as though he had nothing to lose. Great movie, should be out on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-done epic Western","review":"I cannot attest to the film's complete authenticity, but it starts out telling an often told tale. Young Wyatt Earp tried at least 4 times--beginning at the age of 13--to run away from home and join the Union Army. In the film Gene Hackman, playing his father, stops him and sends him back home. This scene and the one following where Virgil and James Earp return from the War are two of the most compelling in the film.The remainder of the two-disk film closes with Wyatt much older having survived the Western frontier and moving on to Alaska. It's a hopeful ending and a beautifully filmed one, too.The other aspect of this film I liked best was James Newton Howard's soundtrack. The ex-Toto musician can really bring life to a scene and more often than not when I have enjoyed a soundtrack, I've found James Newton Howard was somehow involved in the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyatt Earp","review":"Kevin Costner is really good as Wyatt Earp. Most stories about Wyatt Earp do not cover his entire life. This one does. Doc Holliday had TB. Dennis Quaid lost 40 pounds to play Doc Holliday. No one does more for a film role than Dennis Quaid. He puts his entire life force into every role he plays. He actually jeopardized his health and became anorexic for a short while. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday is a tough, tenacious guy with a sense of humor. Jim Caviezel is good as one of Wyatt Earp's brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I love this movie, great acting, lots of stars and an epic telling of one of the great stories in our history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wyatt Earp Not better then Tombstone..IMO","review":"Well This film is well typical for A Costner flick, Like most of his films around this time it is long (To long) and it is almost painful to watch. This Director decided to focus on the \\"Dark Side\\" of Wyatt Earp and it told the story that Tombstone did not while many would disagree with me I think this film is just as fictional as Tombstone only this film takes longer to reach the same conclusion.Not only is the film rather long but you get the same acting from Kevin Costner as you got with other films that came out in the 90's with costner in them (EX. Dances with Wolves). I did like some of Costers films but this one kinda made me mad with the poor acting and long drawn out story.IMO I would pass on this film expecialy if your looking for a action film Tombstone dose have alot more action and also has a little better acting....Of corse this is all IMO..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Biography","review":"\\"Wyatt Earp\\" is a very solid (though somewhat innacurate) biography of the legendary figure. \\"Tombstone\\" is a better Hollywood Western Shoot-Em-Up, \\"Earp\\" is a more understated drama. But any Western made after 1980 HAS to have Eastwood or Sam Elliot in it to be a real classic-- Michael Madsen is a much better gangster than cowboy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I own the VHS two disc version of this, and was very excited when this came out. I purchased it thinking it was the extended edition, but it was just the normal version with deleted scenes that were in the VHS version. I ended up giving this away. BEWARE!!!! If you want the extended version, it is only available on VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe more realistic, but not as good","review":"Much of the movie is a snore...it might be more historically accurate, but doesn't compare to Tombstone in terms of entertainment value. Buy this movie if you like the monotonous details of a history class, but not for the intensity that is so addictive in other movies. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday is particularly not worth writing home about, which is disappointing due to the very colorful nature of the real Doc. Better to save your ($) and 3 hours on something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay movie...but...","review":"Wyatt Earp is an okay movie...but Quaid's performance as Doc Holliday is laughable and has put me off not only this movie but all Dennis Q's movies forever!Oh, and I have to mention-How long is this movie?!If you'd like to see a real movie about Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday-See Tombstone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Dreadful","review":"Apparently this is Kasdan's attempt to turn the murderous old west into some kind of Spielberg-ian morality tale. Instead we get a film so stale and hollow it manages to make a mediocre actor out of even Gene Hackman. Uninspired dialogue delivered with all the craft of a voice-mail message. If the Old West isn't quite dead yet this one will do it. My biggest regret is that I had to contribute to this production in order to learn this. Comes with not one, but two cram-packed disks. Yippee-eye-ay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long.....","review":"Not realistic.....Wyatt Earp dunking Doc's head in the water? Don't think so! And a lot of it boring. Wyatt Earp was no saint I'm sure, but his character was so obnoxious at times I was almost rooting for his enemies! Enough said. Bad western...bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God for Fast Forward","review":"This had to be the longest, dullest movie I have ever watched. Though to be honest I did fast forward through a great deal of it because it was so incredibly boring. Way too much Kevin Costner! Dennis Quaid was okay as Doc Holliday, though Val Kilmer was much more fun and interesting in Tombstone. Lewis Smith as Curly Bill definately could have been developed more. He's a gorgeous guy and should have been in more scenes and given a few lines to speak. His character was spoken about amongst the leading characters quite a bit leading the viewer to think he was 'important' though his character never developed in this rendition of the story. In Tombstone, Curly Bill was definately a major character and I just wish Wyatt Earp had done the same instead of making the viewer wonder what all the talk was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent \\"Tombstone\\" instead","review":"This movie is entertaining, but not as good as \\"Tombstone\\" which was released about the same time. Kostner's Earp comes off somewhat flat and the script, while giving a hard, authentic look at life in the wild west, lacks the snap of \\"Tombstone.\\" Recommend it instead for the better casting (especially Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday and Sam Elliott)"},{"rating":"2","title":"superb and flawless effort","review":"I honestly do not know why so many critics panned this movie. It is a comprehensive, well-paced and exceptioanally well done story of a great American who provided law and order when there was none. Costner's performance as Wyatt is subdued but very effective, communicating the quiet resolve and intensity of the man while Dennis Quaid's Doc Holliday is perfection, equalling Val Kilmer's outstanding performance in Tombstone. The photography is deep and earthy, evoking the loneliness and gritty realism of frontier town inhabitants after the Civil War. If you love the old west and the courage and fortitude of those that had the guts to tame it, you will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Western","review":"I know there are detractors of both this movie and Kevin Costner but I'm not one of them. It is longer and more historically accurate than Tombstone but just as well made. It also features a more realistically stoic portrayal of Earp by Costner and an \\"I'm no slouch at playing Doc myself\\" performance by the unrecognizable Dennis Quaid who would have been the measuring stick had Val Kilmer not been otherwordly as Doc. This film also features a GREAT ensemble cast much like Tombstone and it amazes me how two separate casts can hit such a home run on the same topic. A must own if you are a western fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"wyatt earp dvd","review":"did not receive the movie only the case. there was another movie in the case that was not wyatt earp's. i had a bad experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Great movie with a great historical background.

While Quaid and Kostner do alright, one wonders about the rest of the cast. Harmon seems better suited to play Johnny Ringo than the ineffectual no-namer that does. Interesting to see a less than heroic portrayl of Earp (he's a good guy, yes, but a cold blooded killer as well), but that's all this film has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Any movie I begin, I tend to want to finish it. I had high hopes for this film as it began quite well, but it entered a downward spiral to the point where I realized I was wasting my time trying to finish it.I think my main beef with the film is that it begins with an honorable wyatt earp and ends with him being, in my opinion, anything but.I thought the camera work and some dialogue was good, but it turned out to be a depressing film that I wish I'd never begun watching in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Costner Would Make A Great Story So Boring","review":"This movie was a huge waste of time.

Excellent actors and good portrayal of the old wild west"},{"rating":"1","title":"GONE BERSERK ...","review":"After winning a lot of Oscars for the great \\"DANCE WITH WOLVES\\", Costner apparently wente berserk, and started to think he's the greatest actor of all mankind! One of the movies that shows this new phase is this one. The general idea is good, tryin to make a \\"real\\" portrait of Wearp, not a action-filled package as \\"TOMBSTONE\\". But Costner's acting is arrogant, boring, in a way that eclypses all the merits of the movie (mainly, Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday)"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"This movie is covers the life of Wyatt Earp from his mid teens to his late sixties. It spends most of its time in Dodge City and Tombstone.It is a OK film. It is three hours long and can get sort of slow. The first fifty minutes or so are hard to get through. But once you are past the 54 minute mark, things pick up and it gets more interesting.It is not as good as Tombstone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Wyatt Earp is one of my favorite movies. It's so well crafted and acted, it's one of those movies you can go to when you wanna just sit down and watch a \\"good\\" movie. I had a couple of issues, but really only one. The disc stopped before I could finish the movie. Not a fault of the seller which has been great for me in the past, but just some problem with the disc. Besides that it was a good transfer. I have both an HD DVD and Blu-Ray player and I tend to prefer the HD DVD's. Although I thought the movie was a little over dark, probably to compensate for the lack of blacks in lcd panels. I have an hd tube tv that doesn't have that issue, so to me it was over dark. Other than that it is a clean movie, hd but still keeping the feeling of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyatt Earp DVD","review":"This is an excellent movie that was somewhat overlooked on it's release.

It is a little long, but the actors do a good job playing their respected characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyatt Earp is top of the line entertainment!","review":"I absolutely love this film!It is the best Earp movie ever made.I like how they cover his whole life's story which is something I always wanted to see.Costner was fantastic as Wyatt. The rest of the cast was fantastic. A great job of casting parts!Quaid was unbelievable as Doc! Can you imagine what he went through to transform himself into this character? Nobody else has come remotely to Doc as Dennis has! Way to go, Dennis! You are one heck of an actor!The filming was great. Locations were beautiful.You couldn't ask for a better film on the subject!I am so happy to see this film finally coming to DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good","review":"Atkinson does a very good job of objective history writing even though in this case his overall perspective was limited to a specific combate area. He did stray a little with his personnel thoughts but is still an excellent writer of military history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political opinion? Say it an't so !","review":"It's sad that the author devoted so much of the book to his arrogant and condescending attitude. Its clear that his purpose was to get his political opinion across on the backs of American soldiers. He was \\"embedded\\" alright, right up to his shoulders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much political opinion","review":"I bought this book wanting to learn something of the 101st's drive to Baghdad. Having listened to years of political tripe I find the author's parroting of Doomacrat political posturing games to be a fatal flaw to this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attitudes and Prejudices Show Through","review":"I am a real fan of Rick Atkinson and have read his two books on World War II with great enjoyment. This book, however, was a major disappointment.Atkinson's hatred of the Bush administation and conservative news sources comes through in many places. This is so strong that it colors his view of the events he is narrating. He never seems to understand, nor does he have much contact with the common soldier. This is simply his views of his own experience in the conflict. Most of the time he was in well-protected HQ compounds. He has a jest made in poor taste about having found the \\"weapons of mass destruction\\"; a box of box-cutters.The most interesting and significant part of the book is his positive description of Genral Petreus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern combat as viewed from the division command level","review":"Rick Atkinson was assigned as an embedded reporter with the command element of the 101st airborne division for the 2003 Iraqi war. He spent most of his time with the division commander, general Patraeus and his staff. This is not a chronicle of heavy combat, but an interesting look at what it takes to deploy, supply, and direct a division into combat. There were many problems to be overcome. Sand wrecked equipment, sometimes food and water were in short supply, and the Iraqi soldiers continually changed their methods of attack forcing the US forces to adjust their tactics. The command also had to take advantage of opportunities as they were presented, but be cautious due to the nature of the 101st; light infantry without heavy weapons or armor. Though not on a par with \\"An Army at Dawn\\", it is an insightful look at the responsibilities and decision making processes at the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes good fire starter material on a cold night","review":"I really liked \\"An Army at Dawn\\" and thought this would be similar but I was WRONG. Of course, buying it for $.01 used should have given me a clue but \\"An Army at Dawn\\" was so good. I really wish that the author had focused on the soliders, their lives, and their experiences since he was right there with them instead of spending 2-3 pages every chapter discussing how the Bush administration lied. Lies or no lies the soliders are in Iraq doing a job we sent them to do and theirs is a compelling story to be told but the author decided to give us his story where these soldiers are nothing more than game pieces in a grand political shell game both his and the administration's. It is amazing to me how the author spent this time with these young man in extremely stressful situations and all he saw was some grand political scheme. I wasted my time so you don't have to waste yours because even at $.01 used, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the facts please","review":"I picked up this book at the library and glad I didn't pay good money for it. I expected to get an unbiased view of the front lines from the perspective of the normal foot soldier. Instead I got only the perspective from the commanding general, boring. The real combat was miles away. I also got the impression that the author of this book was more than happy to stick his nose up the general's behind and make the impression that the general highly respected him. Maybe so, but I doubt it.Rick makes several factually incorrect statements in this book at the expense of the Bush administration. Rick misses no opportunity to get his digs on the Bush administration. This is ok as long as the information is factual but it isn't.The bottom line is if you want a 10,000 foot view of the war, like to hear someone repeatedly pat himself on the back and hate Bush you'll love this book. Otherwise I recommend War Stories from Oliver North as a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"From reading this book I find it hard to believe this author won a Pulitzer. Other than some inside observation of General Petreaus, a man I admire and respect, I hated this book. The writing style is boorish and boring. Atkinson is in love w/himself. I really don't have much to add, the other negative reviews pretty much sum it up. Glad I didn't pay for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book yet to come out of this War","review":"Others will be hard pressed to equal or surpass this excellent book that offers a worms eye view of this most difficult war. The Authors respect and admiration for our guys shines forth but it does not blind him from telling the truth and observing those telling little points. (Like how the Supply system broke down causing the delay on the road to Bagdad) All I can say is GOOD TO GO!!!! That and keep it coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but flawed","review":"Mr. Atkinson is a gifted writer and this is a very readable book. As a military professional, I appreciated his conspicuous respect for the soldiers, officers and enlisted alike, with whom he lived and travelled. Embedding with the 101st Division HQ allowed unique access to the Division's General Officers, which yields an interesting perspective on their leadership styles and concerns sometimes at the expense of what might have been a more comprehensive account. I would give this particular effort 2.5 stars with the main downside being the author's clear and present disdain for the national command authority's decision to go to war in Iraq. I do not argue that the decisions made should not be scrutinized closely, but Mr. Atkinson addresses them only with matter of fact (and mostly contemptuous) comments. I enjoyed his writing enough to find An Army At Dawn in the library and am glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!! Don't bother.","review":"It is a shame that such a reverred and accomplished outfit as the 101st had the misfortune of getting Atkinson as an embed. I bought the book expecting to read about their experience in battle. Instead, the story is mostly a behind-the-scenes accounting.But worst of all, Atkinson uses the book to espouse his negative views of the Bush administration, inserting little pot-shots here and there. Perhaps he needed to do this to maintain his employment with the Post. It certainly improved his chances of an interview with NPR--which he got. But it's a smear on the legacy of the 101st to be associated with such vitriol.In the future, Atkinson should partner with the likes of Howard Dean or Michael Moore, not the courageous patriots of the 101st."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Account of the War and Military","review":"My expectations of this book was to read about a journalist following a military unit and documenting the soldiers daily lives during the war. I actually have the audio book version, but I could not even finish the first cd.About 10 minutes in, I hear the author say something negative about Bush and the War. It was a little out of place, but kept on listening. I said to myself, if he does that again I will have to stop listening. I just want to hear facts about the military and their efforts, not subjective opinions from the author.Another 10 minutes in, the author says something like, - then the US military planes cornered and \\"butchered\\" the Iraqi soldiers. I was done! I hit eject and that was that.Again, my expectations were different so others may like the book and his views, but it was not what I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the company of Himself?","review":"Absolutely the worse book on war I have ever read. The author goes on incessantly about himself, how smart he is, his education, his experience, how smart he is to get in on the embedded program, how smart he is to get assigned to a general, etc, etc, etc. Nothing about the character of soldiers, their experience, the Iraqi people, zip, nada. How the general was always seeking him to talk to out of all the reporters. Jibe after jibs at the \\"Bush administration\\", let's you know the man has a bit of a bias against the administration and doesn't believe in the reasons outlined for why we went in. Not one mention of fighting Al Queda in Iraq, which most of the other books I've read talked about extensively. Many snide comments about our combat soldiers.Bottom line, nothing constructive to say here, move along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Commentary","review":"This book is more about Mr. Atkinson's political feelings about the war then how the war was fought and executed by the soldiers on the ground. There is very little description of combat. Rather, a great deal of time is spent describing the poor living conditions and political commentary. From the description of graffiti on the latrine wall, to box cutters found in an Iraqi warehouse the author never misses an opportunity to make a political statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"In company of Remington Raiders ... BORING","review":"I've read other books by Atkinson, which were great. This one though well written from an English literature point of view, is BORING. Sorry. I read the whole thing waiting to get really interested, but it never happened. Following the Divisional HQ around isn't much different than reading about corporate america. Not why I read military oriented books. Look at others. Too many other great books out there to read. Pick wisely; not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading \\"The March Up\\" and \\"Boots on the Ground\\" I found Rick Atkinson's, \\"In the Company of Soldiers\\" a profound disappointment. Though it is well written, it lingers with a dull spark of high expectations. It is further dampened by Mr. Atkinson's petty observations about President George Bush. If readers desire a solid story, I am inclined to direct you to \\"Blinded by the Sunlight\\" and \\"A Fist in the Hornet's Nest.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book ever","review":"In the Company of Soldiers is an excellent book; very gripping. It shows that Gen. Petraeus is one of the best military leaders in American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing - Bad Politics","review":"The author spared no punches at constantly giving his personal disapproving opinion on the politics of this war. It almost reads as a Democratic Campaign leaflet against the Bush Administration's war in Iraq. It is horribly biased against the reasons for going to war. Atkinson makes it a point in almost every chapter to show how wrong and inept the Bush Administration's policies are. In the author's impressions of casual conversations, the attitude of the young men and women in the 101'st appear to also be very negative as to the reasons they are in Iraq and fighting the war. I would not recommend this book if you supported the war in Iraq.I highly recommend:\\"The March Up: Taking Baghdad with the 1st Marine Division\\"\\"None Braver: U.S. Air Force Pararescuemen in the War on Terrorism\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A taste of Disappointment","review":"Everyone has a right to their political opinion, but Atkinson should have kept it to himself. His book serves the cause of those against the war FROM THE BEGINNING, and not that of the historians (or journalists) fair, objective, and, if their good, thoughtful search for the truth. By all accounts, a majority of Americans supported the war, you won't get that from this book. The only \\"unease\\" felt by most Americans, was not at going to war, but at realizing how politics can blind some people to what has to be done. There are so many comments made by Atkinson that I could flag as bent, if not comically unfair, but I don't have enough space. The only really good thing I can say, is that the book is written well. But there are a lot of people who write well.I would not recommend this book. While Atkinson's \\"An Army at Dawn\\" is exceptional, this book is a tremendous let down and leaves a lingering bad taste after spending $25.00 on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the company of politics","review":"I purchased this book because I cajoled a young man into the Army prior to 9/11. He ended up in the 101st Airborne, the famous Screaming Eagles, who are the subject of this book. Instead of a chronicle of the heroics of this Division in Iraq (after their service in Afghanistan), this author confirms the liberal leanings of the media.

If they made any mistakes the auther fails to mention them. However, he did not fial to mention any negative things they said about the mission or the plan (ie Bush).I wish the author had give his personal thoughts on wether Gen Petraeus lied or Gen Franks lied. Gen Franks claimed in his book that the Pres asked each Gen if they had what they needed and they all said yes. In the book the author said Gen Petraeus said he told the pentagon more troops were needed.Finally I wish the author had included Gen Franks, Isreal, Saudia Ariaba, Jordan, President Bush 41, Predident Clinton, France, England, Italy, and the many other world wide leaders and countries who lied and said Iraq had those weapons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game when it doesn't crash","review":"Probably the best baseball game out there in terms of statistical realism, graphics, features, etc., but it constantly crashes, even with the patches that are provided on the 3DO web site, tweaking PC settings, etc. It's brutally annoying and frustrating to have to save the game every 1/2 inning, and constantly restart the PC when it crashes. 3DO offers a community bulletin board and free email, too, but this customer service can not overcome the overall lack of stability."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAMMY ROCKS!","review":"There's so many baseball games out there, that a lot of people don't know which one to buy. But I'll tell you something- BUY SAMMY SOSA HIGH HEAT BASEBALL 2001. I'm telling you it's the best! I'll tell you why: 1. you can have minor league people and trade all sorts of people. 2. It's so real it's unbelieveable! 3. It's just like a real game because people insult the visiting team while they're batting and fielding and if the visiting team hits a home run the people in the stands through it back! 4. Lastly there's homerun derbys, seasons, playoffs, CUSTOM LEAGUES, and batting practice so the fun never ends! THAT'S WHY IT'S THE BOMB!

It has almost nothing of what i listed above! )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so realistic after all","review":"I bought this game because I did not like hitting 50 home runs in 20 games in that other baseball simlulation (you know what I mean). So after the great reviews I had read about it, I gave SSHHBB a try, but I'm really disappointed. The game suffers from some sort of \\"keep scores close\\" programming when you play against cpu controlled teams. Once the human player starts scoring, the cpu controlled team suddenly hits everything. Example: David Cone hitting a homer of a Kerry Wood curve ball that was out of the strike zone low and away. Realistic? Give me a break! Besides the game crashes everytime you try to perform a double switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for your soul","review":"I simply cannot recommend this album enough.The Sarod is an eight-stringed short-necked, unfretted, waisted lute carved from a block of teak and covered with a skin belly. The music is an ancient form of north Indian classical music. Khan is the 81 year old master musican who, performing on the Sarod and accompianied by tamboura and tabla, creates soundscapes of beauty.Listening to this CD will calm you and educate you. It will transplant your soul to places located in your distant memory and to places found only in your imagination.Ali Akbar Khan's many awards and achievments throughout his long career are not unfounded. His performance on this CD and others could be described as a mixture of Ornette Coleman, Shostokovich, Bach and Beethoven.The CD contains a lot of groove and melodic beauty. It will also bring into your life a sense of peace that will withstand the overwhelming stress from the geopolitical wrangling of today. What more could you want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Best","review":"this is by far the best Ali A K CD i own. every note. his later stuff gets rather generic sounding; an indian critic famously said Ostad K, sadly, did nothing interesting after about the late 60's.

Most of the articles are very well written; they average 2-5 pages in length, so issues are reasonably well developed. But the work is rather unbalanced. It has less about African religion (whether indigenous or syncretic) than I had hoped to see, and, most notably, endless repetitive entries about very similar African-derived religions in the Americas. The same explanations of Yoruba orisha, protection of African religion by adopting outward aspects of Catholicism, etc. appeared in too many articles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Call for Christian Compassion","review":"Once again, Dr. Andrew Linzey has delivered a wonderful and inspiring appeal for Christians and peoples of every faith to embrace the highest virtue - EMPATHY.

A commitment to jump off our \\"human\\" pedestal and experience the wonders and beauty of God's creation in a humble and respectful manner is the true essence of Spirituality. \\"Animal Gospel\\" is a truly enlightening exposition."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good to be bad!","review":"If you enjoyed City of Heros you will enjoy City of Villains. New Achetypes and powers, new costumes and new areas to explore all add to the flavor of being a bad guy. Many of the powers are duplicates of the hero's powers, but that shouldn't really be a surprise, what is nice is they are combined in different ways requiring different styles of play to achieve your goals. There are subtle but important differences to playing a villain which bring hours of fun. City of Heros also introduces bases which can be built by the players once they have gained enough influance. Putting your very own torture chamber into the dungeon is hard to beat. Another good point for this game, you only have to pay for one subscription to play City of Heros or City of Villains. So what are you waiting for, release your inner megalomaniac and join the villains in crushing those self rightous do-gooders and make a few bucks on the side."},{"rating":"2","title":"to gamer7","review":"my computer had the same video problem when issue 5 was released. on the main CoH screen where u log on there was a message that said my vid card drivers were old and it may not function properly. i have a radeon 9800 pro and i downloaded the 5.1 catalyst drivers and everything worked fine after that :D.anyways CoV is an awesome game. new maps, cool new missions, powers, archetypes, costumes galore! love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's dead, Jim.","review":"This game, as well as all City of Heroes games, should not be sold or purchased.

Her last album was the country and folk laced It Won't Hurt, which had more than one bona fide all-time classic song. Queen Of Mean is a return to the more rock and punk side of her earlier DQE days but with no let up in the quality of her songs- there are still songs you could whittle down around the campfire. And her melodies on some songs are major-league hooky. If the Ramones had recorded a folk album it might sound like this. Iris, Buckner and Braun are very dissimilar, but they share a common thread of being great songwriters, and with this album, I think Grace takes the lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"TEENEY TOME, TEENEY DOGS, BIG HEART AND SOUL","review":"The title is all wrong: Yes, these pooches are lightweights (in the sense that they weigh so very little), but canine conisueers will find Sharon Montrose's photos weighing in with lotsof cute, captivating charm.

I used this on the day I bought it for drilling twelve 5/8\\" holes and it had great power. but three and a half weeks later as I used this for the third time to screw in four long screws, the trigger lock got depressed inadvertently and now it does not unlock. But the funny thing is, the unit does not stay on like you would expect of a trigger lock. Rather, when the variable speed trigger is depressed, it goes straight to high speed bypassing all the lower speeds. ARRG! I have to take this in to the factory repair shop now which is quite inconvenient and then I have to go pick it up in a week.

It gives great advise on how to approach many different sewing projects so as to maximize the value of serging over sewing and save you time and hassle as well.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because although it has great diagrams (and plenty of them), I prefer actual photos (in color)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to find basic information","review":"I checked out all the books on serging at the library after purchasing my four-thread machine.

I am currently starting to peruse the sections about serging different kinds of projects and garments and it keeps being a good book, giving generic notions and how-tos instead of being yet another collection of patterns.Maybe, if you got your user manual and an expert friend willing to get you started, you won't need a book like this, but to me it was just what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITELY not the book it should be!","review":"What a disappointment! There is nothing in this book that hasn't been done and done MUCH better in other books. There are next to no instructions on techniques.

It tells you you can gather over cord, but doesn't tell you how. As mentioned in other reviews there are no actual pics, just line drawings that are of little to no help.

Greg Kinnear is the standout performance in this film, he is a great and a solid actor but I can't say the same for teen star Miley Cyrus! Cyrus has absolutely no range or depth to take on such a serious role. The way she says her lines are completely lifeless and monotone. She puts no effort or feeling into her screen time, she brings nothing magical to The Last Song so bascially what I'm trying to say is...she ruined this drama for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Amazon Instant Video","review":"Amazon Instant Video is always smooth and high quality.

It turned out to be a nice little movie - a couple things were a bit hard to believe (the kids finishing the stained glass window for instance) but overall a nice family movie.Miley Cyrus has a bit of way to go as an actress - but she did pretty well. But the male leads in the movie were just outstanding! Greg Kinnear turned in an elegant, understated performance and Liam Hemsworth and Bobby Coleman lit up the screen (can't wait for more from these two!).

I love Hollywood musicals and have always been a huge Gene Kelly fan. \\"On The Town\\" is incredibly insipid when compared to other Kelly movies and a miserable waste of Ann Miller's wonderful talent.

Of course, Betty Garrett, Ann Miller, and Vera-Ellen are three attractive, drawing icons in this unforgettable M-G-M musical. Though the story was wonderful, the songs and dance numbers took (no pun intended) center stage. The main romantic element was, undoubtedly, the all-too-brief affair between the sailor Gabe (played by Kelly) and Ivy Smith (played by Vera-Ellen). While the ending was happy, I believe it could have been happier and wish it had been. But still, I did enjoy the movie.The songs \\"New York, New York\\", \\"On The Town\\", and the musical dance number \\"A Day in New York\\" practically pull me back to watching this film which I rented and saw many times before I bought it and have seen many times since.

I loved it, it's definitely one of a kind. I reccomened to everyone who likes Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, who are both great in this movie. Of course it's hard to forget Vera Ellen, who is very talented and beautiful in this movie. I wish someday to see the rest of it, and I am going to keep looking for it everywhere.

This is not the Olympics. In a word, lame. And the perspective makes it that more difficult. A 3D game should not have platform jumping as a major gameplay feature. In addition, the game AI is weak and unchallenging. There are instances wherein the enemy just \\"sits\\" there and you hack away, without any effort or fun. There's a online multiplayer portion to the game but I didn't purchase the game for that reason. Anyhow, as strictly a single-player experience, I'm giving the game a generous 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Same old","review":"Well, this game is fun for the first 2 minutes of play.

Which is a shame, because the opening sequences were well done and promised a good, solid FPS/3PS with a unique feel, and it performed well and looked very good on my computer. I especially enjoyed the underwater sequences with floating bodies, a sunken ship, and nasty looking fish, but the game soon deteriorated into endless hacking and chopping of an army of large crab-like beasts through never-ending caverns, all the while on my knees. Combine this with a monosyllabic \\"hero\\"....no, wait. \\"Monosyllabic\\" implies some form of speech or communication. This Neanderthal doesn't even grunt.

Perhaps you will have more patience than I."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This game could have been so much more. The hack and slash action is not even fun, it just get's tedious and boring. I have to admit the graphic's are spectacular, but that does not make this a great game. Rune contains lot's of jumping from object to object, which will get boring after they first introduce it into the game. The game also had no depth whatsoever.

In my opinion, if you are going to get a hack and slash action game GET BLADE OF DARKNESS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rune-a disappoinment","review":"I read a couple of decent reviews of this before I bought it(Games Domain.com) and as I'm into a bit of action and adventure and thought Severance to be superb, I shelled out my cash for Rune.Rune has a great story line running through it. Thats about the best thing in the game. if you liked Tomb raider, then this is Tomb Raider with Vikings (with few challenging puzzles)!! Lots of ledge jumping and climbing, swimming and swinging from vines and stuff- very disappointing.The enemies did nothing for me and the combat system is basic to say the least.The graphics are good (so they should using the Unreal Tournament engine)but even so at some angles Ragnor becomes transparent.All in all don't waste your money on this unless Tomb Raider style jumping is your thing. If you're over 18 buy Severance because its ace!!You might also try Heavy Metal Faxx 2.

Every time a shot was fired down there, there would be at LEAST six or seven loud, cartoon-like ricochets. The fact that this might really happen when all of the walls and ceiling are solid steel does not take away from its comic effect.

MAGNUM FORCE attempts to shed some additional light on Inspector Harry Callahan's professional and private life, but fails. The film isn't made that way. Instead it's a spaghetti western set in (1973)San Francisco, as if Sergio Leone went for dim-sum in Chinatown with Ted Post and writers John Milius and Michael Cimino, and churned this one out waiting for the next cart to arrive.

The story is interesting and we see Clint Eastwood playing it a little more tongue and cheek in this one(posing as an overseas airline pilot). Which is a good thing because you can't take this stuff too seriously. I like all the \\"Dirty Harry\\" films and I am sure where I ranked this one as I am watching them all again as I review them. I have seen them all several times, but I am watching them on DVD in my Home theater and there is a huge difference seeing these films on a big screen.

The film offers plenty of 44-caliber action and some classic Clint one-liners (\\"A man's got to know his limitations\\").

A brilliantly filmed, edited and acted movie. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the first crowded scene outside the courthouse to the last scene in the ship yard..I also liked Dirty Harry but it did'nt have as much action.

Highly recommeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie - Misleading Packaging from Amazon","review":"This is not a review or rating of the movie itself (there are plenty of other good reviews here) but rather a comment / complaint on an admittedly small but misleading detail in Amazon's description of this item.If you look at this item's picture (at the top of this web page) you see a \`bullet hole' at the end of the gun's barrel. That hole is NOT part of the picture, it is an actual jagged hole in a clear plastic sleve that slides over the DVD case (the glass cracks are also printed on that sleve).If you are a collecter of this (Dirty Harry) series and have other movies with that bullet hole sleeve you should be aware that this movie ordered from Amazon will NOT have that sleeve even though it is shown in Amazon's picture. C'mon Amazon, pay attention to the details. Either furnish the DVD case WITH the sleeve or correct the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eastwood's best film in the Dirty Harry series.","review":"Magnum Force (1973) My personal favorite of the Dirty Harry films and the best of the series for my money. Clint Eastwood is at his peak here as an avenging super cop out to defeat a cabal of vigilantes who make him look like the Easter Bunny. Hal Holbrook provides an excellent foil for Clint as his intolerant boss. The final line (\\"man's got to know his limitations\\") is priceless. Look for 70's TV icons David Soul and the late Robert Urich as Eastwood's fellow law enforcers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Melodic Rock","review":"Shadows Fade is a very good melodic rock disc with the unmistakable sound of Alex De Rosso on several tracks. In particular \\"My Ocean\\" has the signature sound of Alex's work. Though most of the CD is slower than my normal taste being a fan of Alex and his sound more than makes up for the slower tempo. It is truly amazing what two men and technology are able to do. If you are a fan of early eighties music such as Asia give this disc a listen you might be surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"jazz as its supposed to be","review":"This is classic material as jazz is supposed to be: not all hyped up with excessive instruments, vocals, or extraneous filler (i call mixed junk).

Unfortunately the only noise it managed to completely suppress was when someone wanted to talk directly to me. Other ambient noises were muffled but still clearly audible. That was with the headphones turned off. Turning on the headphones only served to reduce sound quality. It created a sort of white noise like tuning to a non-existent channel on your TV. So I used them in the off position for a while thinking that they were fine for what I spent on them. That was until I moved my desk chair and turned my head at the same time jerking on the cord. It must have pulled the cord loose because now they crackle when I turn my head and the right headphone will stop working. Granted it's not the fault of the headphones, but clearly the cord is too short.

These are the good things I can say.Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good.The cord is very thin and flimsy, and I'm afraid it would not last very long. I bought these at a store and they are going back. The noise cancellation does not work well. When you turn it on, a hissing noise starts, and the outside noise is not perceptibly diminished. In addition to normal household noise, I tested them with a violin playing in the same room, and they failed that test spectacularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I didn't notice a difference between puting them on and putting my hands over my ears.Want one for cutting out/down the background noise of the TV so I can concentrate on reading.

I had the same issue the first time around and was dumb enough to exchange them (thinking it was just a faulty pair). So it seems like these headphones short a lot, and the noise cancellation was just a big joke. The only good quality was that they were comfortable to wear and were fold-able. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent headphones - No noice cancellation","review":"I use these at work and they work well as headphones but very poorly as \\"noise cancelling\\" headphones. That being said, I have tried on many expensive \\"noise cancelling\\" headphones and have found all of them to be poor at cancelling out noise. As such, these are basically as good as any more expensive brand you can pick up. Any noise cancelling headphones requiring a battery, I am dubious about.

I wear them when I work at home and have had them on for hours without any problem. The ear area is wide so that my ears aren't getting flattened by the foam and the foam is nice and soft on my head. I tried the noise canceling feature but I really couldn't tell a difference with it on or off so I just took the battery out and have never turned it on since the initial testing.

Actually, the main character Trudy is kind of pathetic, she is stuck in a routine life, with a boring job and a boring man. After she is violated she decides to \\"take control\\" of her life and get a new job and a new outlook on life. Unfortunately, her taking control causes more trouble and she finds herself in another situation that leads to nowhere good. Even though Trudy leads a depressing life, Monroe makes it a very engaging story. I think a lot of women can identify with Trudy at one time in their lives or another. Life sometimes gets routine with waking up, going to a job you hate and coming home watching TV every day. But Trudy manages to spice things up and therefore allows the reader to do so as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Waster","review":"Although the reality is that this could happen.... this was a boring book.

However, even if some modern, revisionist critics have been intimidated by Bergman's reputation into finding this movie \\"an important stepping stone for his later works,\\" why watch it?

I rushed to the store and bought it and excitedly listened to it. After that I sold the album to never check out any of their new music. It was a real disappointment. You still couldn't pay me to listen to it. The only song I like is \\"Whole lot of loving\\" and may be the only reason I will ever consider buying the CD -- used.

Age seems to have mellowed Barry's demons, and the switch from pen and ink to brush and watercolor has definitely taken the edge off her graphic style. It would be nice if some publisher seized the moment to re-issue more of Barry's early volumes that have fallen out of print, such as \\"Girls and Boys\\" and \\"Big Ideas,\\" which are hard to find even on the net.

I mean, there's no other way I'd shell out the $7 I did for a single by anyone else.This single contains (in a very neat package) a re-orchestrated version of (I was made to love) Magic, and the album version of Northern Sky (from Bryter Layter). Northern Sky is an awesome song, as anyone will tell you...One of Nick's best in my opinion.You may or may not have heard Magic before, which was released posthumously as \\"I Was Made to Love Magic\\" on the Time of No Reply album (part of the Fruit Tree box set, if you're lucky enough to have one). The orchestration is beautiful and poignant - this version of \\"Magic\\" is a rich arrangement that Nick would have loved.

There's not a whole lot going on in the way of special featues, except for a short preview of season 2, which isn't much at all and a preview of the video game.

Even Farscape gave you two episodes for ten bucks when they first started to be released to DVD and tape. However, the release date may be a bit of a clue to the two-parter DVD. Most likely they are trying to drum up business for the show before its second year summer premiere.As for the show, I liked it as a whole. Granted, it's obviously a Stargate clone. The characters are characters we've all seen before and when you compare them to the originals, they do come away second best.

Granted, cultural and literary references were plentiful and cleverly integrated, but I too often found the dialogue tedious.2. Many of the plot situations were over the top and just not that funny to me---a tribal roasting interrupted by skin heads??? I felt these silly plot gags were at odds with the often deadpan pseudo(?) intellectual dialogue. The tone of the movie veered from one extreme to the other.3. There really was not much of a plot, which is ok with me if there is sufficient character development. But I didn't find much character development here either. Lots of characters, but what do we learn about any of them? Not much.

This Prestige CD collects Pucho's first two albums for the label, \\"Tough!\\" and \\"Saffron Soul.\\" With two original albums presented in their proper sequence, you might expect me to say this is my best Pucho purchase yet, but alas it is not. While the numbers here are very good, the band really hits its stride from albums three through six, collected on the aforementioned discs. As I stated in my earlier reviews, Pucho's material varies widely from latin jazz to funk, and in its finest moments the band creates a sound that is best described as the missing link between the mambo of Tito Puente and the rock of Santana.

If it's their turn for the closet, they're on the 3-tier shoe tree.If you play your cards just right, you can spin the thing for easy access. It holds a lot of shoes.That's the good news.The bad news is you'd have to pay a whole lot more than this price for a revolving shoe tree that would (a) hold lots of shoes, (b) revolve for each access, and (c) not go wobbly on you from time to time.Yes, it goes wobbly.

If you put 4 pairs per tier with an empty holder in between each pair they will fit nicely, so 12 pairs is ideal. It was fine with me, I was replacing a 12-pair rack so it worked out the same for me.

It appears to have been translated into English without editing, as many sentences are clumsy, grammatically incorrect and just plain inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quality","review":"This camera was sadly disappointing. It is powered by only two AA batteries, which last only one photo taking and sometimes less. In Gateway's defence, they do provide two rechargable batteries with the camera, but that doesn't make up for having to change the batteries daily.I have had the camera only a week and have already had trouble with it accepting the memory card. At times, it said that there were no images. . . I jiggled the memory card around a bit and my hundred+ images reappeared. Very annoying!As for quality. . . No, this is no 4.0 megapixel camera. My older 3.0 camera takes better quality photos than this one. They tend to be grainy and fuzzy, regardless of settings, and close-up shots simply are NOT possible--despite the macro settings.It does have some nice \\"bells and whistles\\" with lighting and color options, but that simply doesn't make up for poor quality photos.

At this point, they refused to allow me to return the product stating that they do not accept returns for replaced units. They have no concept of customer service. I am now stuck with an inferior product that is essentially useless for its intended purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stay away from Gateway","review":"As with many others that have reviewed this camera it sucks batteries and doesn't take great pictures. To get decent images from this camera you must have the resolution and compression set at the highest quality memory robbing setting (41 images on a 64 MB card). Mine zapped a set of 2000 mAh NI-MH before even filling my 64 MB card. I got this camera used and called Gateway about having work done on the camera due to a focus problem and I was informed that they don't even work on out of warranty products. I ended up buying a Fuji FinePix 2650and it can take better pictures than the gateway, and the Fuji is only 2MP. In the Gateway's defense, it does have a lot of manual controls, which mean nothing to me.

Learning to live the peaceful country life brings anything, but repose. Georgette Heyer's, \\"Footsteps in the Dark\\" with its conventional, but welldrawn characters will have you laughing outloud when following her crisp dialogue.Clues and red herrings bounce down hidden staircases and mouldering crypts as Heyer, at her very best, leads the reader through a labyrinth of mystery and suspense interspersed with a light romance. First written in 1932, it still has the power to enthrall. If you've ever dreamed of an old house in the country, this one has all the aspects of reality without electricity or a phone.

The characters are very generic, the 2 younger women in particular having no particular traits at all. The police have no method, the officer also seems to have no real personality except an occasional feeling of annoyance. The love interest for the unmarried sister is completely inexplicable, odd considering the author's expertise in romance.

A variety of editors speak openly and candidly about the publishing world -- what makes a best seller, what makes a winning nonfiction proposal, what they want (and don't want) from authors. From small university presses to powerful New York publishing houses, Judy Mandell conducts over 40 interviews and asks editors the questions I've always wanted to ask. How are advances determined?

It doesn't sink in first listen, but you have to take time to really listen. The idiot below who panned the album probably listened to it once and wrote his review. Get a life.

That is why I have recently rediscovered PJ Harvey. Her latest album \\"UH Huh Her\\" seems to be more mellow than her last ones, but, it is still beautiful. Her voice, her guitar, her keyboards, and all of the other sounds that she creates, catch you and keep you entranced to the end. She once again shows how versatile she can be. I hope to get a chance to see her in concert one of these days...so that I can experience her live sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rawer than raw","review":"If you want to hear PJ Harvey bare her tormented soul again, you've come to the right place. Personally, my youthful angst has faded, and I thought hers had as well, based on her previous CD. Wrong. The feelings here are no less fierce and raw than on Rid of Me, and the instrumentation, while as spare as that early masterpiece, is a bit gentler. Though the lyrics don't suit me personally as much as those on Stories From the City, they are powerful and poetic, and cannot fail to please any longtime fan. Musically flawless, lyrically powerful, but from my perspective a step back from the musical experimentation of Is This Desire and the personal growth expressed in Stories From the City. Those who disliked the slickness and accessibility of the latter may be pleased by this new offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the PJ Harvey sound I fell in love with","review":"On the surface it seems like she's gone back to her early days of gritty raw sound, but the songs are just not up to par. \\"Cat on the Wall\\" and \\"The Radio\\" have got to be the worst songs on the album; annoying melodies/hooks- discordant with no resolution, no buildup/climax/suspense, it's like random whining. I have nothing against minimalism, but the riffs are uncreative. \\"The Letter\\" is not bad, \\"Shame\\" is catchy/melancholic, wished it could have been developed more. If you're new to PJ Harvey, get 'Rid of Me' and '4-Track Demos' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horribly shallow and pretentious record","review":"The entire of this album could be summed up in the sound of a once-talented rock and roll heiress laughing as she passes what amounts to four years' worth of bad demos and horribly-produced rubbish off on her faithful and blinded fans. A true mistake and cause for someone to be dropped from their label HARD. I can think of nothing more insulting to truly talented musicians trying to make it out there than to have something like this on a major, and to have its cover art disgraced by a logo THREATENING me not to COPY the thing (as if anyone else would want it) is beyond mind-numbingly hilarious.

Dr. Moore's book demonstrates that the more things change, the more they stay the same! Faith is easy when things are going well, but it is only under pressure that faith is grown. The challenges remain the same today as in the time of the kings of Israel. Does one remain faithful even in the midst of injustice? Is it more difficult to keep the faith when things are too good? Faith unchallenged by the pressures of life, the same kind of pressures now as then, may get flabby and flat. It is only under the pressures of life that faith is challenged to grow, and with each challenge is the reward of a higher level, a greater faith. Dr. Moore has made the study of the Old Testament come alive as he shows parallels to the issues and temptations of our current culture.

This time around they would like his help in solving a multiple murder. An Air Force Colonel and her 2 children have been slaughtered. Lieutenent Simon Santos, chief homicide investigator of the Arlington County PD, who requested Collins, is working it from the civilian side. As Collins and Simon work together, they find that the government and the military seem to be covering up a defect in a popular aircraft.Character development and a steady pace with many twists and turns makes this a good read. Secret files, misleading clues and many suspicious characters, will keep you guessing. Beware the power of bureaucracy.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the correct sensor as advertised","review":"Guys,If you are ordering this for a W124.034 or 124.036 mercedes, the sensor wire is WAY too long.

They're finny, low-slung, boldly colored, muscularly motored, classy Corvettes--even if they're a trifle over the top. If I owned a 'Vette, I'd WANT it to be over the top, if not, then what's it all about?

So why buy it? This one is superior in several ways. First, the sound quality is amazing! There is no claim that the tracks have been remastered, but they sure sound like it. Second, I believe the track selection is better. The album contains the best tracks from the \\"Sound of Money\\" album, (most of them), plus some older Eddie Money material as well a couple of tracks from the \\"Right Here\\" album. The result is basically, the \\"Sound of Money\\" album, updated and improved. Interestingly, this album is made in England and appears to be an import. The price certainly does not reflect this, so it's quite a bargain. If you get this album and Eddie's last album, \\"Ready Eddie,\\" you will have the best of Eddie's rock hits.

Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis's tough tenor is well-featured with his regular group of the time, a combo consisting of the powerful organist Don Patterson (who dominates many of the ensembles), guitarist Paul Weeden (talented but quite obscure), drummer Billy James, and guest bassist George Duvivier.

She correctly states that to use \\"they\\" when referring to a singular person is incorrect. She advocates that singular pronouns also be avoided when the person to which it refers is unknown. She states that the use of the masculine pronoun in such cases is \\"offensive\\". This is a change in the rules of English grammer. She has allowed her feminist views to influence the book.

Simenon's Eddie Rico is a cog in the organization, but he's done well, as have his two younger brothers--or so he thinks. When he receives a simple request from his mentor and family friend, how can he say no? By the time Eddie figures out the real reason his help was needed, he can only sit back and watch the train wreck happen. (Fans of Phil Karlson's marvellous film of the novel will be especially surprised by the novel. It ends exactly where the film should have ended--only 1957 audiences wouldn't have liked it.) I can't image why a new edition of The Brothers Rico hasn't been made available. This novel is too good to be so hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover art & title are a little misleading","review":"This is a pretty good book, but not if you're expecting stories from the current era of NASCAR stars, for example, Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Most of the stories relate to the older stars, and that's fine, but considering the cover art and the lead in for the title, I expected a little more of the \\"new\\" and a lilttle less of the \\"old\\" stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"OKAY - BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"This book is an easy read.

Boston TV critic and newspaper commentator Daniel M.

Chapters are lively as The Fourth Network explains how a risky launch turned into a billion-dollar creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate and dull","review":"An expose of the network that replaced News with lies and deception? Not at all. Everything suggests Faux News paid for this book to draw readers away from in depth inquiries.Kimmel must have been working from clippings, because you won't find any personalities here.

Two chapters later Kathy is buying a dress saying she is either a size 10 or 12 depending on whether she ate a danish or not.Usually I can read a book in a day, if its a great book and I have the time.

This book is not inspirational nor is it truthful to what could happen. Noticably, the author lacks the full truth in most of the circumstances and twists words to suit her, which she has had plenty of practice with.

Gimme a break Dj IMAGE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's A Clue: Shut Up","review":"What the hell is DJ Clue's problem? He is so annyoing. Once again I was drawn in by DJ Clue's guest performers & once again I am disappointed by tha fact that he has 2 ruin every song by yelling something stupid. This could be a damn good album if it wasn't for Clue's constant chatter."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get a clue","review":"Is it not a given that when you release a new album under no alias' and you're name and mug-piece is smothered across the cover to be seen by all that it's YOUR damn project? So why does Clue thoughtlessly drop those booty self-shoutouts and apparent truths about his sh-- being \\"new\\"? Could it be insecurity? Who knows. I'm not so sure I'd be singing praise about material that is in desperate need of an adrenaline rush. The bulk of the tracks are lifeless and could easily be mistaken for a kiddy record if the MC's were absent. It's THAT Mannie Fresh and Master P-like in aural quality. OK, so Jay-Z flips it lovely over Nyshiem's \\"Who Shot Ya\\" track. Of course the Funk Doc is gonna wild out...over any track. Then what? Then keep your No-Doze handy if you plan on staying awake because this long-winded, annoying material is as dry as the crew DJ Clue runs with. It's the desert...without the storm."},{"rating":"2","title":"PICK THIS UP!","review":"this is the best rap compilation ever. the best song is what the beat by eminem method man and royce the 5 9. royce is one of the best rappers i have heard in a while. so i suggest you pick it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the correct price","review":"I found this on Renovators supply for $149 and when I attempted to buy it, the price went up $40!, same with the faucet that you have to buy which went from $89 to $119. When writing customer service they made the excuse that the costs had gone up in their current catelogue and was not entirely changed on the web. SO, you need to update your link as the cost for this item is MUCH higher."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"articulate modern poetry, a bit disjointed for me, but the person i got it for will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a coney island of the imagination","review":"One of my all time favorite rainy-day-in-a-hammock classics,is Lawrence Ferlinghetti's \\"A Coney Island of the Mind.\\"Ferlinghetti's mystical street wisdom makes him my favoriteof the beat poets. Beat poetry is a celebration of the rhythmand textures of language. It is universal and it is politicalin that it is extremely personal, honest and grounded. It isa celebration of life and freedom. And it is so cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I am perpetually awaiting a rebirth of wonder.\\"","review":"I love Lawrence Ferlinghetti and I always have ever since a friend first read number 5 to me in college. It happens to be a wonderful allegory to Jesus and one of my favorite lines from it is \\"they stretch him on the Tree to cool.\\" The author's language is exquisite although sometimes his wordsmithing manages to out-resonate his message. This is poetry at its best as it is both challenging and accessible. Practically every entry in \\"A Coney Island of the Mind\\" captures one's interest. Even the introductory phrase from this collection, \\"In Goya's greatest scenes we seem to see,\\" is highly memorable. Some of the later poems are excellent such as the anti-materialistic \\"Christ Climbed Down\\" and \\"2\\" from Pictures of the Gone World. What Ferlinghetti offers up is life lessons along with a treasure trove of human feeling and description. I read poetry rarely but still savor the works of this twentieth century master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike others, I am not impressed","review":"After purchasing this book on recommendation of a good friend I was highly expectant - almost excited. I expected a labyrinth of capturing poems and prose. I am highly surprised at what I did receive however. Compared to Emily Dickinson, Wilfred Owen and other such greats, this poetry did not strike me at all.I recognise that it is popular with many but for people who expect poetry to be colourful, captivating, evoking and grasping, what is delivered here are consistently unrecognisable words and phrases (my interpretation - yours may be different), not related to personal experiences that hurt, entertain or allow poetry to be written effectively.Whilst the poet is well recognised and I have no problem with people who are fans of Lawrence, I am not impressed at his inability to make be breathe sharply and say \\"Goodness. This poem has affected me in an emotional way\\". Sorry about these comments, but it is what I feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coney Island","review":"This was the first Ferlinghetti I ever got my hands on, and it swept me away into a world from which I have yet to return. The preciseness of his words and the incredible attention to detail make this book well worth the read. It made me fall in love with poetry...and the passion of the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applebottom Jeans","review":"I love the jeans. They were just as described and was a perfect fit. The price was excellent! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install","review":"The filters were surprisingly easy to install. The instructions provided in the package were well written and understandable and I had my new filters in place and operational in a minimal amount of time. Our water is now drinkable again.As for the vendor, we received the order in the amount of time stated (7 - 10 days) and had no billing errors so we're happy on that front as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"extended life","review":"These same filters used to be rated for twice the life. My plumber, for his own system, resets the dial and doubles the life of the cartridges. Would be nice to have actual test results but I am following my plumber's advice anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"LET US MEET...","review":"This is an excellent, well-written work of historical fiction in which the author draws the reader into the world of the Quakers, from their start in 17th century England, as a much persecuted group, to their passage into the new world and their part in the creation of Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love.The author masterfully introduces the reader to the tenets of the Quakers and how, as a religion, it evolved into what it stands for today. It was fascinating and well done, fully immersed in the historical context out of which it developed with interesting characters, some real and some fictional.For those who enjoy the historical fiction genre, the author takes the reader into a little known segment of history and brings it vividly to life. It is definitely well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair pins that shouldnt go in your hair.","review":"They are a perfect match to the actual pins from the anime. However, they are made with metal bobby pins that have no give at all. Getting them in my hair was hard enough, but getting them out left me with a few less hairs in my scalp. These will be great for my halloween costume, but overall they are cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough little barettes","review":"The metal holds tight. I think this would be better to hold a bun of hair rather then holding peice away from the face because they get stuck and rip the hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Made","review":"My daughter asked me for these for her birthday, and then again at Christmas. I finally got them for her. They look very nice and appear well made.

They won't even go into your hair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for actual use","review":"I was surprised by the size of these hair pins. They're also pretty. However, they don't hold any hair. The ends are kind of blunt and it's easy to hurt yourself while trying to get them to stay put. I actually used regular bobby pin to hold the hair pin in my hair. That's so ridiculous. If you like Bleach, they're a good collector's item, but the practicality is 0."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect","review":"I worked them August 21st and not just for my uniform but everyday use. They are the same ones I saw in hot topic four years ago even have are made under the series name. My hair is very thin and fine so I did have a problem first but if you open the pins up more it helps :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable....","review":"I used this to cut a kinda thick metal pipe and it's totally obsolete now.. but amazon sent me another, so we'll see how it holds up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad reaction to this product","review":"I bought this product from another company for my husband. He tried taking it several times, but each time he had stomach cramps and felt like he was getting sick. Then he would have diarhea. So after ruling out that something else was causing his problems, we decided it was caused by this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Language of Flowers","review":"I too bought the paperback, this is horrible. It is very cheap paper, the illustrations are badly copied with lines through them. The format is a small book copied onto large stock but not adjusted, so the left page has a 3 inch margin on the inside and the right page has a 3 inch margin on the outside. Since I have a Kindle, I don't buy books often and I thought this would be sweet to own ~ sadly mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowers but No Piictures","review":"The Language of Flowers: A NovelI was highly disappointed when I received this book.

Item was recommended to me by the public library. It shipped fast, and I'm pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew!","review":"Right. I bought this after watching Dig! - mainly because the music sounded wicked-cool and the visuals rocked. Impulse purchase, I guess.For the most part Tepid Peppermint Wonderland is great, the only problem is that there's so much material on the two dics! There's simply no way to listen to this record and go - 'Wow! I'm totally hooked!' and leave it sitting in your CD player for three weeks - just too much going on, I'm afraid. So for now I'm patienly getting to know (and love) this record little by little. Just don't buy this thinking that it's going to instantly make BJM the greatest thing you've ever heard. It takes a bit of time, but it is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"DiG","review":"If you've never stumbled across this band before, this collection is the bargain of the century (I know, the century's young, but...) I've picked up a few BJTM albums here and there, and while I've never failed to find them fun, they can be uneven. But whoever selected and compiled this 2-CD bonanza should get some serious recognition: This is the BEST of the band, lovingly culled from beaucoup (sp?) albums, and the price is ridiculously low. If you ever liked anything about the 60's, The Stones, The Doors, The Byrds, etc. etc. check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gems sparkly like diamonds","review":"Run buy this product now! Discontinued by the manufacturer. 13 copies remaining?! Song quality is spotty, but same goes for the albums. The gems sparkle like diamonds. It's a shame Anton was crazy and couldn't keep a band together. They could've been the next Beatles or Stones. This man put his heart on the line for all to hear. And the music is timeless. In a perfect world, this would be heard on the radio as \\"classic rock\\" a few years from now. But all we have is Amazon.com, so buy the freakin' disc already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone who enjoys good music...","review":"I admit that until the release of the film Dig, I had no idea who these guys were. Anyhow, I was intrigued when I watched the documentary and heard their music. I soon after purchased this album, along with a copy of Dig. A week later I saw that BJM was coming to Salt Lake. The show was amazing! They played all of my favorites (Servo, Nevertheless, and When Jokers Attack). I also got to meet Anton, and was surprised at his down to earth nature, quite a contrast to the egotistical character that he appeared to be in Dig. Anyhow, the music is so real...the kind of songs that produce feeling rather than just entertain or amuse. This particular album is the way to go if you want an introduction to BJM. There are a lot of songs here, something for everyone.Really, this is something I would recommend to any true music lover..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock N Roll.","review":"This is a great starting spot for anyone interested in getting a taste of what these guys are about. Regardless of what L.C Schlueter says in his \\"review\\" (click on his other reviews and check out his raves, Red House Painters & Low (snore). Dude, you have no reason to be at this party. You weren't invited. My favorite quote of his review, other than the fact that he gave it one star without actually hearing it (?!?!) was \\"depraved human beings managing to somehow convince otherwise sane people in the industry of their talent\\" Um, otherwise sane people? Are you a lackey at Capitol or something? Anyway, go buy this record if you want to steep yourselves in some pure, blissed out rock n roll energy. Everyone I know has their own BJM favorites and this collection skips over a few but all in all it's very solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to describe and thats how it should be","review":"BJM really is amazing. The influences range from the obvious psychodelic 60s bands like the Animals all the way to Cure, The Kinks?, Dave Clarke 5 et al. The CD really sets a mood and if you are inclined to put your fold up chair on the apex of your roof and bring out the party favors of your choice then BJM should be exactly what you are looking for. Oh, and Open Heart Surgery is like one of the best songs I have ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"For fans and wannabes only","review":"This CD is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical.A better alternative would be to listen to either:a) the original artists who influenced this bandorb) someone at least trying to do something new with music.To enjoy this CD you'd have to really want to like this band, either because you liked Dig or because you're attracted to their super-cool reputation.If you're afraid you're missing out on something by not owning BJM's back catalogue don't worry, you're not."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOD ANTON!","review":"The Brian Jonestown Massacre are the best band you've never heard of. I've always liked them from the beginning and have talked to Anton Newcombe after several shows. He is just the most ordinary, coolest guy ever, except don't mess with him because he don't take lip. He's also got a very sensitive side also and just wants everyone to listen to his music and start a sort of peaceful revolution, just like in the 60's when they used to make music that was halfway as good as this. He's like ALL-IN-ONE, just like God. Everything he says is like scripture, especailly that thing about Eric clapton's baby-he sucks!!! LOL. All you people are idiots for not listening to this band becasue you're too busy listening to hip-hop crap. VIVA LA UNDERGROUND!!!If you just got into Anton because of D!G, you're just a poseur. I heard of them like back in 2003, so there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Beatles","review":"This double CD is fantastic. I highly recommend it. Surreal rock songs incredibly played and powerfully sung. After first hearing this American band while in France, I have listened to this CD over and over since buying on it Amazon after I returned to the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the heart, mind....","review":"Laraine Herring has written a book on father loss that really applies to mother loss as well, but specifically the father. As a reader, I gained insight into parental loss, and with the addition of her own poetry there's a personal journey that takes us beyond sheer intellect (which is very evident in this book, well written, intelligent). I'm left with the feeling that Ms. Herring is a woman of heart and mind, and with this balance a healing takes place. It's the kind of book you want to mark up, bend the page, read the poetry out loud, share with a friend, a group. Read it more than once, enjoy the process of heart and mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one extraordinary book!","review":"This book goes deep into the human mind. It poses questions to long taught knowledge. Makes you re-think everything you've ever learned. It also makes you queston human nature and human drives. Whether humans have instincts or not? I suggest reading the Tao before the first chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: HARD BOOK!","review":"I am a huge C.S. Lewis fan. I have read most of his works and I think they are great. This one is, on a scale from 1 to 10 in ease (1 being Dr. Suess and 10 being a Neurologists formal report) about a 9. Much more in depth than his other works I have read. A lot of backround knowledge is required. If you are a beginner I would suggest something easier and more fun to read such as \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" or \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\", for intermidiate I would suggest \\"The Great Divorce\\" or \\"The Four Loves\\". If you are advanced then go ahead and buy this one, I'll be puzzling over it for the next month."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will learn how not to think.","review":"Just read Dan Lawler's 2 star review and the subsequent conversation he has with Wessexman. It's better than the book. Lewis basically rips apart a book called \\"The Control of Language: A Critical Approach to Reading and Writing\\" but changes the name of the book and it's authors as if he didn't want you to read it for yourself and come to your own conclusions. Shame on Lewis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased, religious, and logically flawed.","review":"While this is a great piece if you want to step inside a virtue theorist's mind, as an actual philosophical text it is rather poor.While it is obviously religiously biased, it is Lewis' own circular paradoxes that lead to a flawed system of logic that can not support itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Optimistic Jew","review":"\\"The Abolition of Man\\" rejects moral relativism and affirms \\"the doctrine of objective value, the belief that certain attitudes are really true, and others really false, to the kind of thing the universe is and the kinds of things we are.\\" This very tiny book makes cogent, witty and eloquent arguments against a nihilistic view of the world that has become the foundation of postmodernist deconstructionism. To proponents of this intellectual pose he says: \\"...you cannot go on \`explaining away' forever...You cannot go on \`seeing through' things forever...To \`see through' all things is the same as not to see.\\" This book reinforced my basic instinct that the pessimistic nihilism of postmodernism (as well as Jewish post-Zionism) are wrong at some very fundamental level. It's theme was one of the forces driving me to write my own book \\"The Optimistic Jew: a Positive Vision for the Jewish People in the 21st Century\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Favorite book","review":"This book is very well written and is easily understandable. i love how the author adds true life stories and experiences into the book to make the information and points more relateable. I will definately read this book again and keep it on my shelf for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Around","review":"This book is a must have for anyone who has even considered breeding a mare. This book helped lower my blood pressure and warded off gray hairs the first time I bred and foaled out a mare. It had me so well prepared (and I had an animal science degree, too)! It is, by far, the best foaling book I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A resource I reach for often...","review":"The title says it all...Reach for this if you are new to breeding - read it and you will see, it is a long process to breeding a champion. The mare is definately where to start and this book should help. It is a great resource Click - http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0876058489/mcfarm"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for self-checking your work","review":"This reference book is a great tool for prompting the editing of your own work. Often I will write something and after I have edited it then I will take a look at a few random sections of this book and make sure that my writing is in line with what this master wordsmith suggests. A bit of an erratic method of editing, but it serves a purpose of making me seriously think about if something applies or not to my work. However random, I am often surprised by the things that I turn up via this method.In striving to be a better writer, complacency and comfort are your enemies. Garner has helped me break out of my self-made box. I gave it four out of five stars because there are times I am left wanting more from a few of the sections in this book. If there was a 4.5 star rating, then this book would have my vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reference book","review":"This book was recommended by one of my legal writing teachers. It has turned out to be a fantastic reference book and I have it bookmarked in a half a dozen places already."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I found something strange in most books that talk about style; they all another copy of William Strunk book \\"The Elements of Style,\\" and the authors try to add one or two chapters without any practical examples.

The sound and picture quality was extremely lacking; even my 7 and 9 year old grandchildren said it was the worst cartoon they had ever seen-imagine that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marred by Error","review":"This book is not without error and at least one of them is significant because it involves a major player, Senator John Tyler Morgan.In the verion I read, the author has Morgan as being from Louisiana. Tyler moved to Alabama from Tennessee as a very young child and was involved in that state's politics for more than 50 years, 30 of them as a Senator. Louisiana never sent anyone named Morgan to the Senate (and only one to the House).The book reads well, but a sloppy error like that makes you want to backtrack a lot of other information."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD TITLE BUT MISLEADING","review":"A key document in this book is shown on page 185; it is a copy of a list of rich New Yorkers who had subscribed to the New Lesseps Company, when it was formed on October 24,1894 and sold their shares at a profit in 1903-1904, when the Company was sold to the US Government. But these shares represent only 4,662 out of a grand total of 650,000, which is less than 0.7%! The reader will decide if this is enough to justify the title of the book: Wall Street was there but for so little!The whole book is like this, based on \\"personal\\" interpretion of facts by the author to serve his goal.It is nevertheless spectacular for its title. A well thought marketing gimmick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - held 1 month's worth of toiletries with some left over","review":"I recently traveled for one month and used this organizer every day.

Other than that, having listened to the CD several times, and been a popular music fan all my life, I'm not sure what I heard except a bunch of kids playing around with electronics. Many groups have experimented with new musical forms, themes, lyrics, and so on, over the years, sometimes with results that have a significant impact either immediately or over time. Far from being a trendsetter, this CD, in its better cuts, temporarily entertains, while overall, it costs much more than it is worth and resells at a very steep discount."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Aint your Daddy's Clutch CD!!!","review":"Gone are the days of \\"Binge and Purge\\" and \\"The body of John Wilkes Booth.\\" Welcome to Clutch in the 21st century! Shorter, angrier songs such as \\"Animal Farm\\" have been replaced with 10 minute-plus jam sessions such as \\"Braisenhead\\". Ill tell ya something, I dont mind it at all. Clutch continues to mature before our very eyes with their latest offering, \\"Pure Rock Fury.\\" The entire CD is one giant piece of grooving rock and roll. It opens with the aggressive \\"American Sleep\\" which will get your eyes and ears opened quickly. \\"Open The Borders\\" causes the body to shake in tune slowly back and fourth, while \\"The Great Outdoors\\" will quickly become my newest \\"Fishing Weekend/beer drinking\\" song. \\"Frankenstien\\" has a great chours, and \\"Smoke Banshee\\" just flat out kicks. There is only one song I dont care for (Ill remain silent), but a live version of \\"Spacegrass\\" more than makes up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album I've bought in 2 years","review":"I actually discovered Clutch off of the internet streaming radio station Spinner with Careful with that Mic and I've been hooked ever since. This album is one of the best albums in my collection with truly stand out songs like Brazenhead, Sinkemlow, and The Great Outdoors! Sinkemlow is a post-apocalyptic gospel rock song, Brazenhead is a kick a hole in your wall and dance around with a broken foot it's so cool, and finally The Great Outdoors! is what is left of you at 3am to be scraped off of the floor of a seedy bar. If you've been wondering where the rock has been in the past couple of years, I suggest you pick up this album and find out! Radio and MTV/VH1 should realize that bands like Clutch and even Big Sugar are much better than anything that they are currently playing and deserve the exposure more so than what is currently out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely a great record","review":"you just cant beat full on hellyon rock n roll mixed with ferocious hardcore vocal tracks. clutch is the only band i know of that has meshed these two elements perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another awesome album from Clutch!","review":"This is the fifth studio album from Clutch, and they show no signs of letting up at this point. Has all of the funk of the self titled album, but faster, harder, heavier, and more rock. Most of the album is hard rocking and fast paced. There is a rap-ish song thrown in there \\"Careful with that Mic...\\" that shows off Clutch's style in a different light. The album slows down a bit at \\"Drink to the Dead\\", and then transitions to a sort of treat with a live version of \\"Spacegrass\\" (original is from the self titled album). If you enjoy the self titled ablum, Elephant Riders, or Blast Tyrant, I would think you would enjoy this album as well. There are a ton of good songs on this album, though if you aren't familiar with Clutch, you may need to listen to this a few times to really get into it, like most Clutch albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a Clutch fan buy this CD","review":"This isn't my favorite Clutch CD, but its still very good. Its just not as heavy as Elephant Riders or their earlier work. I like heavy, others may appreciate their toned down style more. Buy all their CDs and decide for yourself which is the best. Personally, I like their self-titled album the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Histerical!","review":"I loved this book!! It's a short, quick read, and definitely worth your time. I really enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone. Very funny and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilde at his best","review":"Oscar Wilde is a wonderful playwright--truly a literary genius. Earnest is probably his best play because he has developed past the Problem Play genre and focuses all his talent on pure wit and the criticism of the frivolity of Victorian England. Where his other plays have a touch of serious Melodrama (though they, too, have their wonderful aspects), The Importance of Being Earnest is Melodrama and Comedy of Manners at its height, providing humor for all generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful comedy","review":"Oscar Wilde's play about a misfortunate 'foundling' is, hillarious and thought provoking. That is to say if you appreciate the English aristocracy.A word of advice, if you know of this work playing at a theater somehwere you can get to, do not miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but goodie","review":"This is a subtle comedy at its best. Good to read from the perspective of a young or older person."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Importance of Being Hysterical","review":"Oscar Wilde's \\"The Importance of Being Earnest\\" remains one of my favorite comedies of manners. As Wilde takes aim at the superficialities of his time, he captures the universal foibles of human nature. I have shared this play with tennagers from more than 70 countries over more than 10 years, and it is always a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Masterpiece","review":"This is one of the best plays I've ever read! I had seen the movie, of course, and knew what to expect, but somehow reading it was even better. Having a general idea of what was coming also made some of the smaller jokes more evident. Trust me, this is one you don't want to pass by!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tHE iMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST","review":"MY 16 yr old grandson was in this play at school.

Plenty Of witty sayings, classic Wilde."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Earnest Review","review":"This masterpiece by Wilde shows his wit and mastery of the English language in just a few pages with The Importance of Being Earnest. This play is free, so there really isn't any reason to NOT get this for your Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Importance of Being Earnest","review":"Great book and very humorous! Very glad I read this book and will be reading other books by Oscar Wilde."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Importance of being Earnest","review":"What can I tell you it is an Oscar Wilde, witty, so true to life for the period it is set in, that the characters come alive and jump right off the pages. There is humor, so many of our human shortcomings are beautifully hinted at, but never in an insulting or perturbing manner. If you like a little tongue- in- cheek,highly amusing description of a Britsh form of \\"pomp and aplomb\\" don' t miss this one. By the way , the plot is for you to find out, not for me to tell you. Rosemarie Conover Laco2P.s. my son, knowing my taste well, bought this at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out Loud","review":"I resisted reading this for the longest time just because the topic didn't excite me. However, after spending a little over an hour reading this, it was actually pretty enjoyable. There were some areas that I openly laughed and got these weird looks from people in the coffee shop. I didn't care, I enjoyed the read and the good laughs. Wilde wrote and edited a nice story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal plus free shipping","review":"I love buying online when I get free shipping. I signed up to try Prime for a month and bought everything I needed for class with free shipping. I needed this book for drama. It's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Play","review":"It is Wilde's last play. The play concerns visiting Mr. Bunbury. I am being facetious, of course. It is words masking the confused identities of two young men in search of amusements and loves. The names baffle even the chief characters. Wittily it is allowed that it is possible to make an accommodation to the prospect of a considerable fortune. Character is considered, but more in the breach. Wilde wanted the charm to be in the dialogue, and it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stellar example of too much hype, too little satisfaction","review":"Mother once told me \\"Strawberry shortcake is such a wonderful dessert...\\" but when I tried it - it was just strawberries and whipped cream on angle food cake.I felt the same way about Earnest. I'd always heard it was a really wonderful play, but halfway through I still had no idea who was whom and what was going on or what they were going on about. Perhaps I'll try it again, later - but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take your time","review":"Did not read much of this will come back to it when i can spend more time with it. not light read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great version of the Classic Play","review":"The Importance of Being Earnest is a fantastic play. It is an easy read, and is not only well thought out, but hilarious.I liked this book of the play especially, because it includes helpful notes in the beginning, but more because it has a glossary of difficult terms in the back. Every time I came to a word that I did not know, it was sure to be defined in the back.If you love theatre, this is a great play to read. I would highly suggest this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny!","review":"Even over a hundred years after its original publication, this tale of mistaken identity and silly social farce continues to not only entertain, but you will be laughing out loud! Jack and Algernon are best friends, who amusingly get tangled in the web of being mistaken for Earnest and falling in love with women who are mesmerized by the name Earnest, which as Jack's object of affection Gwendolen puts it: \\"it inspires absolute confidence\\". When the four lovers visit Jack's country home at the same time, the proverbial custard hits the fan. But never fear, a convenient twist resolves matters to everyone's satisfaction all with wit, fun, farce and its hilarious!Just read it! It's just funny, funny, funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby","review":"I mainly appreciated this version of the play in audio format because of its length. It runs just under 2hrs as compared to one of the other ones that is almost 40 minutes longer. I was having to read the play again (I've read it several times for different theatre classes), and it was a great way to refresh myself with the text and to shine new light on some of the ideas. I enjoyed Lady Bracknell and Jack's performances more than the rest of the company, but overall, I feel it was true to the text of the play itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Importance of Being Earnest","review":"It is an interesting and clever play but asks for too much of a stretch of imagination to be meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, fun & quick read","review":"The Importance of Being Earnest is a great play. It takes just a few minutes to catch on to the witty undertone of the writing as well as get pulled in to the fun family drama. I read this on my kindle while waiting for my car to be fixed at the shop and I was so glad this was my choice! I appreciated the details and subtle humor throughout. This read won't change your life but it sure will make you smile! You won't be disappointed, for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar Wilde play","review":"Delightful play though unlikely to be theatrical hit. Funny. Cute play on words with the 1800's Victorian setting.

It was like getting a souvenir."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny","review":"i know this book is supposed to be a satire of the british gentry, but that was a hundred years ago and those people are dead. so what's left is a very witty play about some very funny (dead) people. some wag called \\"the imp of being earnest\\" a \\"verbal opera\\". this description is apt. read the book and find out why..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my cup of tea","review":"I didn't get far before I stopped reading this book as I found the content to be silly in its attempts to be vacuously clever - the title exemplifies this - and the storyline uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite amusing","review":"This play is quite amusing and it is not very difficult to read. I think it does not earn more stars because you already know at the beginning how this play probably will end. Sometimes I had to wonder about the stupidity of the personnages, I mean they act in such a stupid mannor. I do not like the end because the author did not think about a fitting end before writing the book and so I had the impression that he just invented the end. This play is quite amusing to fill up time, but it is not so good that I would read it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsequential Style","review":"Oscar Wilde is a witty man. The Importance of Being Earnest, Wilde's most well-known work, is dripping with sharp humor and clever epigrams. But let's face it, it's fluff. The \\"social satire\\" that most reviewers cite to hold this book up as High Art is as pointed as a teaspoon and as sincere as a used-car salesman. Wilde was a libertine dandy who admired the snobbery and elitism of blue-blooded Britons. The Importance of Being Earnest is, in many ways, like MTV--stylish and entertaining, with some pretensions, but ultimately just a vacuous time-killer. If you need to read it for class, or even better want some literary [bathroom] reading, fine. If not, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so funny","review":"I have decided that since so many people are obviously blind to how dumb this play is, I should write a review to enlighten anyone that might read it. The humor is dated and because of that, very boring. The situations are completely inconceivable and it makes no sense! The characters are flat and serve no real purpose. I suggest that no one else ever ever read this play."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Play to be Recommended","review":"The story is about the two dandies Algernon and Jack who invented an imaginary person to have an excuse to go to country or to town. Both of them fall in love, but because of the double personality of Algernon and Jack there is a lot of confusion. At the everything clears up and there is a happy ending. We liked to read the book and can recommend it to everyone. It is really very funny. The characters talk a lot of paradoxical things. Oscar Wilde plays with the adjective earnest and the name Ernest. The motto of the play is: \\"In matters of great importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing.\\" Oscar Wilde said once: \\" We should treat all the trivial things of life very seriously, and all the serious things of life with sincere and studied triviality.\\" At the beginning everything they talk about seems to be nonsense, but if you think about it you see that some things they say are quite rig"},{"rating":"1","title":"General Books Problem...Not the book","review":"I ordered this for my daughters birthday and Amazon delivered right on her birthday. My daughter is a huge Oscar Wilde fan! Unfortunately, the book was full of garbage text. It was printed by General Books the day I ordered it. I then requested a replacement. Once again, it was printed the day I made my request and it contained the exact garbage text that the original order contained. Here is an example of the garbage text that this book contained...(Jk*he$. HeL*) This was all throughout the book. Then half the book looked like some bizarre glossary that didn't even belong to this book. The entire book was worthless both times and I requested a refund.

All the synonyms for trite and stuffy apply. I was taken back to high school Literature days, when some of the assigned classics felt like punishment. Sorry Oscar, this one isn't timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest literary work I have ever read!!!","review":"'The Importance of Being Earnest' is the greatest piece of literature I have ever read. We were forced to read many books in school, but why this play was never mentioned is something I don't understand. Simply, this play is the most clever, witty, and entertaining thing I have ever read in my life, period. You definitely won't find any great meaning or significance in this work, but so what. You'll simply laugh your butt off for most of the 70 to 75 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun.","review":"I always expected this would be dry and tedious, from the title.

Patti Moran provides an abundance of great information and points out things I've never even thought of. The only downside of this book is that it is a bit out of date, but not so much so that you wouldn't be able to relate to it. It is a great tool to have before starting up. I am very pleased with this book and will more than likely buy the next version should one be written.Shame on all of you who are putting down Patti Moran for mentioning her products in this text! She only mentions her products a couple of times throughout the book and I find these mentionings to be quite appropriate and helpful.I urge anyone thinking of starting up this type of business to purchase this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good primer for dog sitting","review":"This comprehensive book offers a lot of substance regarding the dog sitting business.

Too much emphasis is put on employees, i.e. hiring, training, motivating, even nutrition for your employees! Most of the books information could be found in a generic business text.

Both were recorded using the house PA system--not the best for recording players of this quality. I do not think the effort was originally intended for release. If you are a die-hard Hubbard fan like me, then go ahead and get both albums. Just do not expect much in the way of sonics.Whoever was recording with the house PA system just let the tape run between tunes. This is one of the novel features that can make a live session really come off as the banter between players and the sounds of the audience lend a feeling of being there at the club.

Much of the cheeky humor is replaced by grinding, heavy metal guitars, making the album almost sound like industrial rock. This works quite well sometimes (Scrood Bi U, Slave to Love) but not so well other times (Glad I'm Not God, Feed My Hungry Soul). As I said, the humor is sadly missing from a lot of the songs, with only Rover Take Over and I Like It really bringing any laughs. At first I was a bit disappointed with their new style, but after a few listens it really has started to grow on me. It definately goes a long way to fill the void left by the break up of KMFDM. If you're just getting started with LOA, go with VooDoo U, but if you're looking for a good guitar/techno hybrid, go with Farstucker."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"Oh yes!

But, all the other songs are just as good, I just like those the best.

For the most part they are all great late night coding music for me. Usually an album has 2 or 3 really great tracks, and the rest tend to range from good to just ok.This CD contains many awesome tracks, some that you will want to play so loud your ears bleed. All of the tracks seem very well polished and professional (gasp!). A few have some repetitive bits in them.All of the LOA albums are pretty edgy, but this one seems a little tamer than the norm. Perhaps with a few tracks that could even play on the radio. Now, don't get me wrong... even a tame LOA CD is MUCH MUCH more graphic and vulgar than any other CD you are likely to purchase. They are definitely out there, so be aware.So... if you are an LOA fan, buy it, you won't be disappointed. If you are hard core techno fan looking for something edgy, buy it.

And the sensitivity of the touchscreen was inhibited by the screen. It does protect the Treo touchscreen from scratches and is completely washable and reusable. But application even with the supplied applicator does not easily flatten out the air bubbles when applying to the Treo. The screen is a dust magnet and natural oils from your fingers cannot easily be wiped off. So, once applied, the dust and fingerprints are visible to the naked eye.

Probably not as there are so many other toys out there, but it's unfortunate.Anyways -- parents please be careful and check all of the pieces periodically!

The software is simply not reliable in terms of availability. I have been using this software for several years, and so far (March 2009) there have been times when the software simply refuses to load or the licensing protection prevents the software from loading, i.e. the licensing protection claims that I have no license when in fact I do.

Has chapter titles like \\"Synthesis 9: Lausanne\\". A reader who doesn't grin at that may enjoy this book, otherwise not.I only read it because Jute wrote a not-very-good book about how to write, and mentioned this book of his as an example.

But the tracks that are not on those discs are well worth the price, and some of the duplicated tracks are alternate mixes (\\"He Bite Me,\\" for instance, has got a lot more vocal action!).

After wearing them a few times with jeans, I noticed the stripes on the outside of both feet had faded a bit, so they aren't truly black anymore; instead, they are a shade of darkish gray. Otherwise, I love them and try to wear them as much as possible. Very comfortable and I think they look great with jeans. Perfect for casual Fridays."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good classic","review":"Good for those who may desire to know fundamental concepts of meteorite research with a historical perspective. When I pick up journal articles on the subject (i.e. ALH 84001--the \\"famous Allan Hills Martian meteorite\\"), I realize the \\"smallish\\" volume delivers in the fundamentals but elicits a lot of curiosity and an honest desire to say: there must be more within the subject area. Having said that much, the book retains the original author's intentions of rigor (although it is updated to approximately 1992). I do recommend the book with caveat: if you need up-to-date information you will need to \\"comb\\" primary literature or spend much more cash on other volumes on the subject. But, it is a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Something that Works!!!!","review":"I have tried many different types of rug grippers and they all have very poor results.

Not only have I learned a lot about my mother and grandmother, but they have learned about themselves. This book makes a thoughtful gift, and I plan to buy several more for Christmas presents.

However, if you love beautiful music to listen to while working, this one hits the spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music","review":"I have always admired MWS's ability to arrange music and his great talent for write music. Occassionally, on his Christmas albums and instrumentals on his regular recordings, we catch a glimpse of this. I have also always thought that his weakest skill is ironically his voice. Many times his vocal capability limits his musical creativity. With this recording, those shackles are loosed and he is free to write great music. Listening to this tour de force recording of just his music is such a pleasure. His arrangements are so emotional and span the scope of powerful/majestic to soulful/sorrowful. Hopefully, this will not be his last foray into this style.

I own just about every CD he has released and also enjoy seeing him in concert. However, this CD is very different. When I purchased it, it was not advertised as an instrumental CD. That would have been a red flag for me. I would encourage people to listen to a sample or two before they buy it, because after listening to it once, I realized I made a mistake. Don't expect traditional Michael W. Smith and you won't be disappointed.

Instead you get alot of electronic boogie, which honestly is not that great for breaking too. There are no well known tracks like Run DMC's its like that, Afrika Bambaataa's Planet Rock, Wildchild's Renegade master, or any Rock steady crew songs. I personally like to break to Bomfunk MC's, or Freestylers and so would recommend those titles over this one. Nevertheless, some of the songs are quite good but the album as a whole is just not worth it. The songs are so similar and many are just remixes. Any aspiring Bboy should not get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Awaited Dissappointment","review":"My Side of the Mountain has been an annual event for me for many years. I was thrilled to find out that the author had finally come out with a sequel. But like many sequels it was a dissappointment. I hated it. I wish I had never read it. Jean takes the idealistic '50's Boy Scout viewpoint and weighs it down with '90's political correct/eco-freak/feminist babble. She preaches green peace style conservation and responsibility when what made the first book so good was escape from the hyper-sensitive viewpoints of today's \\"enviromentalists\\".

Dweezil's brother Ahmet, who is underrated and a terribly good vocalist, sings on \\"You're a Mean One Mister Grinch\\", and Lisa Loeb makes an appearance as a secretary in \\"Dick Cinnamon's Office.\\" Blues Saraceno, Mike Keneally and others play on the record also. Coming out on Steve Vai's record label Favored Nations, it's no surprise that it's a brilliant record from a guitar point of view, and you won't tire of it quickly. Highly recommended.

The only problem is it hops up when firing from a long distance, which is to be expected I guess, and it does not work with .20 bb's. They go about six feet and drop down.

Shepp received his share of criticism during this time, both for his political convictions as well as for his progressive approach toward the jazz medium. Most of the controversy stemmed from his involvement in black freedom movements and his open admiration for Malcolm X.Shepp's Impulse years feature some of his best music, featuring quite unusual readings of \\"Naima\\" and \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\". This CD offers a nice sampling from the mid 60s to early 70s, giving newcomers to Shepp a good place to start from.

I was pleasantly surprised and glad that I made this an addition to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dunno","review":"i listened to this and id have to say this is a horrible cd for jethro. i know them very well i have been a fan since day 1. this cd has no guitar. if you are a fan of tull for their ROCK music dont buy this there is like no electric guitar in this cd. its mostly flute music. i hope jethro comes back to rock soon because after track 5 of this cd i hate it"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's come to this, has it?","review":"I think someone bungled in his jungle and mixed up the intended cover with the cover of \\"The Jethro Tull Halloween Album\\"--gabled haunted house, foreboding bare trees (rather than frosted evergreens) with ominously (and unrealistically) twisted branches.But I'm here to review the music, not the cover....Oh, never mind. What's the point? You've heard these songs before. Now you get to hear them recut by a tired, uninspired, rundown band and a singer whose voice has expired.Whatever. See you in Vegas then?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CHRISTMAS CLASSIC","review":"This is an absolutely phenominal collection of holiday treasures. The instrumentals, in particular, are mind blowing. These renditions take you right into the holiday spirit in 3 seconds flat.I was always a fan of \\"Songs From the Wood\\" era Tull and wished they'd spent a bit more time exploring that avenue back in the late seventies. Well, I just never figured it would happen over 20 years later. This one is worth the wait.This CD was released a few years back but still stands in the front of the line. Other rock xmas albums come and go but this one kicks all of their butts year after year after year!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all Jethro Tull fans","review":"Just when I thought that Jethro Tull was mouldering in its grave,out comes this wonderful album.It is darker than the early Jethro Tull of Heavy Horsesand Songs From the Wood.But more mature and earthier , you can tell that the decadeshave added strength and flavour to the fine wine of Tull'smusicAdolesence is over and if cynicism accompanies the songs, it istempered by compassion.I only wish that I could rate this album 6 stars.Buy this one even if you have to sell yourself to get the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Holidays From Jethro Tull","review":"The holidays have gotten even brighter with Jethro Tull's marvelous offering for this time of year, \\"The Jethro Tull Christmas Album.\\" Ian Anderson & company serve up a hearty yuletide blend of new Tull Christmas originals, including the terrific \\"Birthday Card At Christmas,\\" \\"Last Man At The Party,\\" and \\"First Snow On Brooklyn,\\" as well as new re-recordings of old holiday-themed Tull favorites like \\"A Christmas Song,\\" \\"Another Christmas Song,\\" \\"Ring Out Solstice Bells,\\" and the signature Tull tune, \\"Bouree.\\" Along with that classic instrumental, the band give us some more wonderful instrumental tracks, like the brilliant jazz take on \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,\\" \\"Pavane,\\" \\"Greensleeved,\\" and the beautiful closer, \\"A Winter Snowscape.\\" The band play brilliantly, and Anderson's voice and flute are still in pristine form. \\"The Jethro Tull Christmas Album\\" is a magnificent gift from one of rock's most enduring acts.

This follow up to the Chesapeake Trillogy continues the story of the Quinn men. Seth is grown and has become an artist. I was pleasantly surprised, as an artist myself, how she gets what happens in the creative process. Cam, Ethan and Philip continue in character and though they have matured into middle aged men, they maintain the relationships with their wives and family that began in the first parts of the trillogy. They are relationships that work because the characters stay engaged with one another. Nora Roberts has such a story telling talent, the characters seem flesh and blood and her descriptions of the physical place conjer up the scents, temperatures, sounds so well, I'm there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great end to the family drama.","review":"The book was entertaining and kept you on your toes.

The book had me hooked from the begining, taking us back to the fateful car ride to Maryland with a 10 year old Seth. It jumps us to the \\"now\\" with Cam, Ethan and Phillip and their families still loving and living at Ray and Stella's home by the shore. Seth returns running from his demon and wants the security that was always home. He is a young master painter who has travled the world. He comes back to St. Chris and meets flower shop owner Druscilla, who is running away as well. The true wonder of the story is the rich comlexities of the brother's relationships. Ms. Roberts blends in humor and more importantly--overwhelming love. I wonder if the Quinn's would adopt me. I could see a book for Aubrey, but time will tell. Thanks Nora Roberts for the amazingly complicated Quinn Boys.P.S. Thanks for Stella, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I hated that he had been paying blackmail to Gloria since the age of 14. She had nothing to blackmail him about.The other thing that was even worse was the illogic of Gloria at all. Someone who is a prostitute and addicted to drugs, simply is not going to live that long. If she does manage it, her brain would have been fried and she would have been in no shape to manipulate anybody.I am also disappointed that the romance did not involve Audrey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chesapeake Blue","review":"This was a wonderful book.I hated for it to end.

The language/expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff. I don't live with people who talk like that, and I don't understand the purpose: \\"sophistication\\"? To my mind, the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with @%#&*s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Finish to a Great Series","review":"I bought this the day it came out and stayed up half the night to finish it. The story fast forwards about 15 years,Seth is now in his late twenties. He realizes that no matter where he may roam, St Chris is home. It was great to revisit with Cam, Ethan, Phillip and their families. But the main story is still about Seth and how he sees himself. A part of his brain still sees himself as a scared little kid, being victimized by his mother. He would do any thing to prevent this from touching his family again, even paying his mother off to get her to leave him alone. By the end of the story he finally realizes that no matter what, Gloria will always be there but his family is stronger and tougher than her."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I found this one to be quite disappointing and predictable.

I really enjoyed this book and am now reading more from Nora Roberts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"If you are a fan of Nora Roberts's many action-packed novels with a little romance thrown in, you may be sorely disappointed with this book, and the 3 leading up to it. I have loved every NR book I've ever read, up until these. I usually always stick with a book even if it's not holding my interest, but all I could do with this foursome is scan through briefly just to get the gist. If you like books that are strictly romance, you may like these, because that's just about all you're going to get. If you want murders, mysteries, and adventures, read some of her other books.If you like typical books about slovenly men who need women to pick up after and baby them, and of course in the end everybody gets married and has babies, then this series is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as described...","review":"Received this book in the description described. Price was excellent. Received it in a timely manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chesapeake Blue is boring","review":"Chesapeake Blue is boring.The characters are weak,the dialogue forced, the conflict predictable and the resolution a tad too tidy.There is nothing to learn from this book nor is it entertaining. I live on Maryland's Eastern Shore and I can tell you that Ms. Roberts has fallen way short in her descriptive of this beautiful peninsula and its blend of residents. I don't give it any stars but the minimum I can punch in is one. There is not time enough to read all the wonderful books written. Don't wste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Great sequel","review":"I've been reading Nora Roberts' books for a while now, and my favrite series was the Quinn brothers trilogy. I was very excited to find this book--a sequel to the first 3. We get to find out what happened to the 3 Quinn brothers and to Seth, their \\"brother\\". This is an excellent continuation of the original 3 stories. Read this book--you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are these two even together???","review":"Since I'm an owner of all three other books in this series, I was very excited about getting to finally read Seth's story. However, halfway through the book I was already disappointed. The chemistry between the main characters just wasn't there. In fact, I didn't like the heroine (Dru Whitcomb Banks) at all. All she does is whine about her life and make rude comments to the people around her (especially Seth). It just was NOT believable that these two were in love. The only reason why I finished the book was becasue I wanted to know more about what happened to the other Quinn brothers. Nedless to say, the book was very anticlimactic and Seth definatly deserved better...maybe someone more like his very interesting, very loving niece/cousin/sister: Aubrey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora does it again","review":"CHesapeake Blue is the story of the youngest Quinn brother. What a treat to go back to the Eastern Shore. One of my favorite parts are the conversations that Seth has with Stella, they are great. Nora Roberts once again writes a great story and I for one, enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete, Complete Rubbish!!","review":"This is the first time i read this author's novel by some recommendation and this will be the last time.Don't even know what to say about this book. The plot and characters are beyond shallow and boring. There is no build-ups, logic, don't even mention any kind of climax. It is just horrendously boring! A 200-page long rubbish!!! Can't believe i wasted my time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' Bother","review":"Let me first say that I loved this series by Nora Roberts. It was one of my favorite series to read! That being said this fourth book in the series isn't worth your time. This book was nothing like the first three books. I was so excited to read this one because it is about Seth and you get to see how things turn out for him. I was very disappointed. I didn't like the women he falls for...and didn't think they had much chemistry at all. I actually quit reading this book in the middle of it because I was so bored and started another book. I came back to it a few months later and finished it out of obligation to finish the series and know how it ends. It was painful though and I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Conclusion to the Quinn Saga","review":"A great ending the the story of the Quinn's. I could not put in down. It was great reading about the Quinn's grown up with families, seeing how they turned out.especially how Seth grew, etc. Read it you will love it. Thank You Nora Roberts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seth at Last!","review":"I must confess that I just knew that Seth and Aubrey's affection for one another in the original trilogy would roll into something more in their adult years. Perhaps if the age gap had been shorter. However, I really really liked how Seth turned out so strong and confident in his talents and as a man. But I guess with brothers like Cam, Ethan,and Philip, it couldn't be any other way. And I must say that I was pleased to see so much of the characteristics of Phillip in Seth (fine taste and an appreciation for delicate lingerie) since he is and was my favorite Quinn. Well, since Aub's out, I'm glad Seth ended up with Dru, for whom I developed a little admiration. She did make a nice break from the fold to make her own mark. If I can't fault her for that, I certainly can't fault her falling for Seth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chesapeake Blue","review":"Wonderful story - continues the grasp Nora Robert holds her readers in.

For those who need a refresher in using common sense this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Paradigm","review":"Adler and Barnett have edited, revised, and given contempory notice to an under-utlizied concept in ir scholarship: security community. This project began in the 1950s under a study published by Karl Deutsch which looked at states that seem to have transcended security competition. However, the extension of this concept is largely ignored and it was definitely in need of some revision. This volume (which examines nascent and ascendant security communities in various regions) is an excellent primer for those wishing to familiarize themselves with the concept. Also, for scholars associated with Deustch this is a good start to \\"update\\" and apply Deutsch's concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did Strathern write this book?","review":"I've observed that there are roughly two groups of literary people: those who appreciate Dostoevsky's works and those who don't. The author of this book sits firmly in the latter group, which begs the question, \\"Why did he write this?\\" He is quick to point out the faults of Dostoevsky's major works, but then trips over his words and arguments in meager attempts to describe the positive attributes. Indeed, if I were to base my opinion of Fyodor Mikhailovich and his works solely on this book, I would be quick to label him a neurotic right-wing nut job who couldn't write his way out of a paperbag. In short, if you're looking for a book that will help you better understand Dostoevsky and his works, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT MOVIE","review":"Some man must think about his life after this film.

This is a haunting story and its message is deeply profound and moving, as well as important to our modern age. Bertrande as the \`Wife' is a classic representation of the dominated female in a patriarchal society. Lewis tackles some of the greatest moral and spiritual issues of mankind in this little piece.The novella explores the theme of Truth vs. Expediency (doing what's convenient) and tells the true story of a young woman's struggle in 16th century France, to deny her happiness in behalf of her moral and spiritual convictions, or to deny the truth. It presents a controversial dilemma that will bother the reader and yet keep us thinking about the meaning of life and the foundations of our convictions long after we have finished reading it.\\"Madame, I would have you still deceived\\"...I studied this text for my year 12 and I wish it were more widely recognised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and challenging","review":"A great read that poses the difficult question: what ought to come first--one's children, or one's cause? Especially challenging when the cause is the end of apartheid. Gillian Slovo is bitter that she didn't have her parents because they were busy trying to free South Africa. Understandable from an individual point of view, but the contribution of the Slovos to the anti-apartheid movement was invaluable. I don't know the correct answer to the question, but I do know that this is a good and engaging tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same first name, very different voices","review":"This CD, which is a different artist singing the anthem written for Charlotte Church, the now 15 year old singing sensation from Wales, is very poor. Not only is the recording itself very poorly done, but the artist should have saved herself the embarrassment of trying to imitate Ms. Church. Ms. Russe clearly does not have the vocal tone, quality, or pitch of Ms. Church and therefore should not have recorded this CD. Better luck next time, Ms. Russe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the warmth and feeling?","review":"This artist, who is imitating 15-year-old Welsh singing sensation Charlotte Church, clearly has no warmth or feeling. While it is evident that Ms. Russe can hit the high notes, her words are sharp and irritating. My advice to anyone who reads this is: BUY THE ORIGINAL. Ms. Church's version, though she was only 13 at the time of the recording, is warm and pleasant, like the song should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gun!","review":"After reading some reviews on the gun i though i might have wasted my money. boy was i wrong! it is a great gun, worth every penny ^w^"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it that much","review":"This gun sucks.

The idea of taking off the top is kind of cool, but the pistol begins to act up until it breaks.(p.s. this is my moms account)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"I recently bought this gun, about 5 days ago. I was a little worried it would come, and suck. It didn't though, in fact it exceeded my expectations. I bought it for the 2 clips, and the looks. The clips are hard to load, and would be tough during a game. The looks are okay, but there seems to be orange paint from the barrel on the gun. It came off but was annoying. The silencer is pitiful, but it works. The knife is a rounded peice of plastic, that comes out when you cock, and shoot. Do what I did and remove the knife, but leave the remainder of what was holding it in on. Thats the second hole, in the picture. It shoots okay with .12, but I go with .2 which works as well. Overall this is the backup to my .50AE Desert Eagle, and my flanking gun.

He also made a lot of statements with nothing to back it up. Maybe he thought we were one of his children that shouldn't have things explained to them and should just happily want to do whatever he suggested. I am a young mother, but I guess my view in his light are old fashioned. I think this type of psycho babble leads to the irresponsible adults that I now unfortunately manage- that think that everything should have some kind of reward. Please if you love your children and want what is best, don't follow this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what's new?","review":"Common sense, but hard pressed to find anything new and enlightening. I was suspicious about the author's over emphasis on the parents being the \\"boss\\" all the time. And I was even more suspicious why the author left out common ideas about parents investigating their own childhoods and their issues from childhood being resolved, unresolved, or still in denial about. Or, to put it another way, what negative or shadow parts of parents are likely to be put onto their children. A very simplistic book with no guts and void of suggesting current parents deal with their painful past. No wonder he is popular with a society in massive denial and addiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark....","review":"I have never read a book of child-rearing that I disagreed with more. I believe it all stems from the fact that Gray starts with the belief that children are born good. As a Christian, I realize we are all born sinners. Punishment, done with love, is necessary. Not holding children accountable for their behavior is dangerous. In an ideal world with children of pure heart, this book would work. Read this book and do the opposite!

There are even typos in the book (he uses \\"where\\" instead of \\"were\\" and other spell check glitches...). Seems elementary. I couldn't read more than the first half and then I put it down. I was hoping for something insightful, but just got a dozen theories all jumbled into one book without much explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Guide","review":"This book could definitely use some editing, but the ideas are wonderful. Even better, he gives actual scenarios and things to say to your children - actual steps to follow. I've been using the tips with my 2-year-old son, and it has worked wonders.

Not only the western new age free world is facing parental problems but Indian culture is also on a shift notion to face challenges tackling parental challenges. The five messages and the wise advice of the author makes it very clear to follow by parents to get the parenting skills. Love base parenting accepts kids with their negative emotions, desires and needs, being different but setting reasonable limits and making the kids aware that they are to be respected is the message flow in the book. Children are innocent and born with a difference and needs rewarding and not punishment. They need to co-operate and both parents and kids need to build a close bond to pull out of parental stress, kids stress and the crisis hovering over parental and kids issues. A good pick by a gem author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful audiobook!","review":"John Gray is not only one of the most inspirational authors working today, he is also one of the best at reading his works on audio.

I can't believe I wasted the time it took to read this book. It's only value is to showcase the arrogance of Western (mainly American, i.e. George Will and his ilk) conservatives who believe that the entire world should adopt the liberal democratic political model. Fukuyama makes a number of questionable claims about global politics and the state of democracy in the world, and the book is too full of contradictions to list here. If you must read this book, then simply read the introducton, since he makes all his main arguments there, and then skip to the last few paragraphs where, as I mentioned, he contradicts his own thesis. Readers would be better off reading the actual works of Hegel, Nietzche, etc. than Fukuyama's sloppy re-hashing and \\"development\\" of their ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider the source . . .","review":"I did enjoy this book when i first read it two years ago. However, with the invasion of Iraq, I discovered the author, Professor Fukuyama, is a member of the warmongering group (Project for a New American Century PNAC) along with Rumsfield, Pearle, and i think Cheney.Upon relection, it seems this book serves to propagandize to assist in the inflicting of The American Way on weaker nations.Noam Chomsky is a much better source of information on what kind of democracy is practiced by the powerful nations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fully understood misunderstanding","review":"Fukuyama misunderstands history in a way that is not entirely his own.

That is, the growth of democracy, and it's funny how that growth has been curbed in the past 10 years or so. Time will show this book to be Fukuyama's Folly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what an idiot","review":"Hasn't this author committed seppuku by now? His thesis is ridiculous.

Contrary to the claims of the right, Fukuyama does not conclude that western liberal democray and economic liberalism are the highest form of evolution. He explores this question and in doing so embarks on a fascinating journey though history and political philosophy. There is no airtight conclusion or doctrine being espoused here, which may trouble some. However, the questions raised are critical to understanding modern society, where we have come from and where we may or may not be going. Some have criticized the book for being wordy and repetitive. Though the same themes do appear over and over, they are always to look at new questions. On the contrary, I wish I could have read on."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Be Frank - A Load Of Old Rubbish","review":"Fukuyama's far fetched and frankly irrelevant theories bore me, I'm afraid to say. This was the book that introduced me to that way of thinking - it's basically written by a wealthy American academic (who has spent most of his life employed by the US government), claiming that the American capitalist system has conquered all political alternatives, surpassing even that of democracy and especially that of communism. Capitalism is, for Fukuyama, the end of the evolution of man and the start of an eternal status quo. This idea is laughable in concept and is further ridiculed by his over-selective choice of material which is already outdated. Clearly it is his ideal world - but I not sure that everyone shares it and even less sure that we have reached it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Such Animal","review":"There is no End To History. It goes on in multiple ways, no matter how much triumphalist rhetoric celebrated the illusory, temporary \\"victory\\" of a fleeting form of neoliberalism (not true democracy) in the late 20C. With such a foundation of sand, the pretentious Hegelianism that rests on it is superfluous and insupportable. Two stars for stimulating debates (mostly the original article), and for coining a neat phrase. But there's no \\"there\\" there, at least not enough to successfully transition from article to full-length book. BTW, Fukuyama's institutional connections do not impress. Like many intellectuals who align with statist and corporatist views, he prefers to hide in unaccountable think tanks that function as echo chambers. Facing bright students in open and honest class discussion, let alone the peer-review process or independent-minded academics, is not for the likes of him."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most relevant books I ever read.","review":"I bought this book titillated by its title: it was eerily reminiscent of a story I had read or heard somewhere about those who were seriously suggesting in the late 19th. century France to close the Patent Bureau, since \\"everything that had to be invented was already invented\\". (Can anybody help me find a bona-fide printed source for this gem or is it just an unsubstantiated annecdote?). What a surprise to find how wonderfully and intentionally misleading (or titillating?) this title was.This is one of those books which, in spite of reading it with a pen in hand and marking it up copiously, when I reached the end I felt a compelling need to read it again. It is not a question of agreeing or disagreeing with the author, but a question of getting intellectually stimulated in a way few books did it for me.

After trying every way possible I finally figured out a sequence to get it mounted. The jumper must be in the CS (Cable Select) position first.

The Sabrent wouldn't get a SATA connection with the Blue so I left the old drive in the laptop and hooked the new HD up instead. The copy process would work for a while, getting slower and slower, and then fail due to an error on the new drive. Came in several mornings hoping for the best and ... nada. Spoke to Sabrent tech support a couple of times, tried their suggestions, and then returned it at their request.

Well, it does NOT work with my 2.5\\" SATA Fujuitsu drive. My drive is not bootable so I was hoping to be able to hook it up to my desktop and get some files off of it. I waited a week and a half for this adaptor to arrive and the cables won't even connect. Am I missing something?? I know HOW it's SUPPOSED to connect, but the Fujuitsu drive seems to have a plastic piece blocking part of the area the adaptor's SATA connector is supposed to go. There is NO way to remove this piece from the hard drive. (sigh) Anyway, I gave this adaptor two stars. It MAY work for some, but this USB adaptor does NOT work with ALL the drives it claims it does.

Robin let John Lennon handle that one friend no ofense.Over all Cheap Trick fans won't be disapointed.Just remember its not Live at Budakan and you'll be alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap trick - cheap guitar playing","review":"First of all, I love Ct. Tom Peterson has always been one of my favorite bass players. That 12 string bass on Gonna Raise Hell is just awesome. I consider myself a die-hard CT fan, but the recording on this cd is really bad at times, not to mention Rick's guitar playing. I couldn't believe the guitar solo at the end of She's Tight. Awful to say the least. His overall guitar playing is really bad. Listen to Budakon, the guitar playing is almost flawless compared to Silver. Even the recording quality on Budakon is better. I've noticed that at live performances as well. The last few times I've seen CT, Rick's Guitar playing was terrible. I own almost every CT cd, but I must say, this one is at the bottom of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightning In A Silver Bottle!","review":"Easily the best live release of Cheap Trick's since Budokan. These versions of their hits are taken from a special anniversary (25th, their SILVER) show done in the city that spawned them, Rockford Illinois. In addition to special guests like Slash and Billy Corgan, they are joined by a full orchestra on many tracks. The sound is live, but well aranged and mixed for a much smoother live sound then the last live release, Music For Hangovers. I cannot reccommend this set enough if you love this band. These are very fresh and exciting versions of these songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There all here and LIVE!","review":"I saw Cheap Trick live in Rockford before the went on the japan tour and they were wild, crazy and fun. Talented lead vocalist, crazy, goofy and talented lead guitar backed by heavy base and drums, this was good rock and roll. When they slow it down for songs like THE FLAME they got very emotional.This Silver Live has all the songs I loved done with good sound reproduction and of course the crowd. Put the head phones on and image you are there."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a surprize here!","review":"Every track on here is LIVE. There is not one studio recording on the whole set. I don't see anything on the cover saying so. I almost NEVER buy live recordings so I'm just a bit ticked right now. If it had been all album versions this would have been an awsome collection of thier best work IMHO. If you want a huge comprehensive collection of thier songs live, here it is. I now realize the one I was looking for was \\"Cheap Trick, The Hits\\" released in 2002."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, poor recording","review":"Scott Joplin was a master, his music depicts the 20's era wonderfully. I was sadly disappointed, however, with this collection. The recording is obviously modern (I could give it grace if it was an old recording) and the microphone was evidently not modulated enough, there is an annoying fuzzy sound whenever the piano gets at all too loud. Also there are artificial echo/twang-reverb effects that are just barely noticeable, and no doubt intended to compliment the style, but it comes off feeling more like it's approaching canned music.The music itself, while brilliant, is very repetitive in style. Be prepared to listen hard to be able to distinguish one song from another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Action","review":"This film was a good action movie. it ws an added bonus to see my favorite actor play the leading role as a hero.

The plot was dodgy and I actually had to watch it in two segments because I couldn't will myself to sit through the whole thing in one shot. Kevin Bacon's horrible British accent and poor acting really makes me re-evaluate him as an actor. The whole premise of the film was predictable and the violence and action scenes were never fluid or purposeful. The main character of the story, Church, manages to evade bullets and when he does, he heals magically and is ready for combat by the next day. The only reason I would watch the movie is for the cool guns. Otherwise it was a giant waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"B movie, bad acting","review":"VThe main actor in this movie is Djimon Hounsou, not Kevin Bacon. Djimon Hounsou isn't the most versatile actor, and the producers probably failed to notice that. Kevin Bacon's accent seems like a joke in this movie.Djimon's character is always out trying to get new guns, and threatens to shoot if he doesn't get his guns and does it in a very unconvincing way everytime. The fighting/shooting choreography was horrible, so even if you're looking for an action movie and don't care about the storyline this would still be disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to improve your manners....","review":"...then get this book!

It's one of my top favorites from now on. ''Roswell conspiracies'' is a very well written cartoon. I feel tempted and attracted to some of the characters. There are many good characters in the cartoon, and the animation is good. It's not bad, considering it was done in 1999. And what I like most is that it keeps me wanting more and more. I believe the story didn't go so well because of the plot or animation. And I do not understand it. The cartoon is really, really good.What disappoints me most: is that the project was closed and there will be no more episodes. I wish I am wrong. The cartoon has a great potential. It is it's characters, and it's plot. It has this balance of everything that I like.

Unfortunately, the set suffers in two huge respects. First, the sizes of plates, bowls, etc., are out of the ordinary. The plates are either too small, or too large and heavy. Older folks will have problems picking up the large dinner plate. Second, and more importantly, this collection is totally unmicrowaveable. No, they will not break, but they will heat up to above boiling temperature and immediately blister your skin if touched. If you need a dinner set that goes into the microwave, this certainly is not it.Overall, I give the set a 9 on looks, a 5 on usefulness, and a 2 on microwave compatibility.

It's absolutely focused on teaching Solidworks in a systematic - \\"bs free\\" method. For those who complain about the pizza cutter - please - get a life. Also, the book points you to it's website to download a detailed update (18 pages) covering mostly cosmetic differences (dialog boxes) in the latest Solidworks version ... Highly recommended 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Filmaker at Work","review":"New Bedford is in Massachusetts, not Connecticut but why carp....John Huston,s \\"Moby Dick\\" is worth the viewing. Anyone who would dare to bring this great novel to the screen is certainly to be applauded. All the nuances of Mellville,s saga is almost impossible to depict. John Huston stamps his signature on this wonderfull film with his subtle framing of scenes and , with Oswald Morris, a mix of color and sepia that is \\"real\\" for the period. Richard Basehart does a nice job of narration and I must confess that I might watch the film just for seeing Orson Welles deliver that sermon as Father Mapple..it,s pure Welles. Finally, There will be other filmakers that might try their hand at this drama..I dare say that this film is their benchmark...!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby Dick will not play.","review":"Based on the description, I fully expected that a DVD sold by Amazon in Region 1 (U.S. and Canada) would play in Region 1. However, the DVD I received apparently plays only in Region 2, so it would not play on any of the three DVD players I tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Great Classic Movie","review":"Action packed...adventure filled and some romance thrown in make this Classic timeless !! Highly recommended..a must see version..Gregory Peck's performance..outstanding !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the book","review":"I'm sorry but the book is boring. More time is taken on minutia and actually very little on what may be the best story line in any classic. John Houston captures the story line, develops the characters as Melville never did, and made a movie that everyone should see. The acting is superb with Peck delivering a performance equal to his work in Mockingbird. Basehart is outstanding without conflicting with Peck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call me Ishmael...","review":"My only objection to this film is that when I read the book I hear Gregory Peck's voice! Despite the advances in special effects that might diminish this work in the eyes of the video generation I found this to be a masterwork, especially the film coloration that served as a \\"background wash\\" for Ahab's hard-edged reality. Orson Welles' portrayal of Father Mapple is worth the price of admission in and of itself. Visually, this is a magnificent film. A must for coffee drinkers who wonder who Starbuck's coffee is named for..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby Dick","review":"I have read Melville's novel several times, it's a favorite of mine. I saw this film 20-30 years ago, and just received it on DVD, hoping I was wrong then: that this movie was a disaster, to the book, to movies.I was unfortunately hoping in vain. It's the ultimate disaster. The dialogue tells the pictures, the pictures tells the dialogue, the music (horrible and horribly used) tells the dialogue and the pictures, and backwards ... it goes on and on. Unbelievable that for instance Kurosawa about the same time shot Seven Samurai."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is very boring and is not very good. While watching this shameless movie, I fell asleep. It is about Ahab and his obsession with a white whale (Moby Dick). If you are looking for action this is not for you. It gets somewhat suspenseful in the last half-hour. However, I do not recommend it to anyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I watched this movie as a child and it stills captivates me now. The screenplay is amazing and the acting of Peck is magical, the kind you no longer see in Hollywood. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. If you enjoy great cinema, you simply must watch this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic movie worth being in your video library","review":"This is a classic movie worth being in any video library.

What a great line and what a great way to begin a wonderful story. John Huston, Ray Bradbury, and Gregory Peck are all at the pinnacle of their craft. Peck's portrayal of the vengeful Ahab is nothing short of brilliant. Huston creates a creepy atmosphere which makes my hairs stand on end and knocks the wind out of you with its foot on your chest until the tension is released with a haunting climax that will not leave you for hours. This is truly one of the great feature films of the 20th century and it deserves a better release than this but at least it is available in a decent print. Some of the best dialogue ever uttered on the screen is here. \\"From Hells heart I stab at thee...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't play on my DVD.","review":"Although this movie was one of my favorites while I was growing up.

I did not have this problem with other DVDs. Fine performance by Peck, et al."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Huston than Melville.","review":"More a lean Hemingway adventure than Melville's mad encyclopaedia - and even more a typical Huston fable about men and failure. Ahab the maimed tries to recover wholeness by destroying his destroyer, a non-starter of an idea. It needed someone with a less cautious imagination to make this, someone who didn't care so much about plot, who could plumb the depths, soar the heights, the rites, the lunatic, magical, incantatory pagan/religious/philosophical mish mash. Only the eerie scene of Queequig's decision to die even comes close. The whaling sequences are the best, full of a real, almost documentary danger that brings the film nearer to Herzog. Herzog doing 'Moby Dick'? Now there's a thought...Kinski as Ahab...mmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE POLY SCI MAJOR WAS FORCED TO READ THIS","review":"The last thing i wanted to do was invest time reading this massive Tomb.

I enjoyed the movie, the delivery came as promised, but I don't think I will be buying any more European DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Huston does himself & Melville proud","review":"Huston, although necessarily simplifying the complexities of the book, Moby Dick, was faithful to the characters, their dialogue and the plot line. Huston also displayed the dangers of the charismatic leader whose obsessions can doom his followers, perhaps a warning to Americans given the politics of the fifties when the movie was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, false advertising","review":"One of the truly great movies by John Huston and the first to give you a real feel for the old wooden ships of the era not equaled until Master and Commander by Peter Weir.

I consider it a good book for a beginning counter. The intermediate player may be able to glean a few helpful tips from it as well. But the advanced counter will gain little, if anything, from reading this book. As with Wongs other books, there is some information that is still useful in todays game and there is other information that is totally antiquated. If you can't discern between the two then reading this book can lead you in the wrong direction and wind up costing you a lot more than the cover price. This game is extremely difficult to beat.

Although all of the above have been previously available on CDs like \\"Behold The Beginning\\" and the re-release of \\"Lightning...\\", what puts this CD above the other early DH compilations is that it has all four tracks from the 1981 \\"Diamond Lights\\" EP (\\"Diamond Lights\\", \\"We Won't Be Back\\", \\"I Don't Got\\" and the remix of \\"It's Electric\\"), never previously available on CD, and all great songs (although the remixed \\"It's Electric\\" really isn't all that different than the \\"Lightning...\\" version).

They have their own biases and axes to grind, as they link you to rightwing websites full of lies and distortions of their own. These folks want to squelch and slander anyone with a differing point of view, especially regarding Cuba. When talking about \\"agents of influence,\\" it is pertinent to remember these \\"reviewers\\" are likely themselves members of organizations sent here to trash this book.Mr. Gott is a well-respected journalist on Latin American affairs, one who has been avowedly sympathetic to the Left, armed struggle, and the Cuban Revolution. However one may agree or not with his views, they are necessary to read if one would wish a well-rounded education on Cuba. Beware anyone who tries to suppress this book, as they are guilty of the same thing of which they accuse Fidel Castro."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there","review":"If you're looking for a fast, shallow treatment of Cuban history, written by a largely uncritical supporter of the Cuban Revolution, then look no further, you've found it.I've read Hugh Thomas' book \\"Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom\\" (which is 1800 pages long or so, it's only flaw being that its coverage of history ends in the late 1960s). Naturally, I expected Gott's book to pick up where Thomas' book left off. And, while Gott's book does cover the revolution between 1970 and now, it does not provide any real depth or insight. Thomas' book was obviously written by a scholar who is looking to form a complete picture of Cuba's history; Gott's book, on the other hand, reads more like a newspaper article - perhaps because Gott is a journalist by training.If you're looking to really learn about Cuba, definitely get Thomas' book. Gott's isn't TOO bad, as long as it's what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing historical view of Cuba","review":"Very good and accurate view of Cuba.

He has brought equality by bringing everyone(except the party elite)to the level of medieval serfdom. I lived through the revolution, and saw personal liberty squashed into nothingness, in a system where neighbors turn you in for expressing your views criticizing the government, or having too many friends visiting you. Yes, Batista was a thug, but at least you could come and go as you pleased.

In books about these d4 deviations you usually only see the bad lines for black and the best ones hidden to make the openings look good. In al the lines John gives black is playing simply the kind of positions the white player doesn't want and usually in the end you get a = position or even =+.

I personally think Microsoft took a step or two backwards on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too complicated","review":"2003 gave me all the feature I wanted and they were easy to find.

Vista is a letdown. Two major oh-no's:- The help is useless. Searching for a unknown term or reference produces a long list of possible articles, but the searched term may not show up in any of them. I don't have hours to puruse through mindless unrelated articles. XP help highlighted the searched term; it worked fine. Why did they ruin it?- The location of various menu items is scrambled. I don't mean 'rearranged', I mean scrambled. Drawing in Word or PowerPoint is an exercise in frustration. It's one menu to create an object, a different one to flip or group, etc. I'm sure the new arrangement makes sense to someone, I'm just not sure that someone is playing with a full deck.I'm still looking for redeeming features. I'll update this if/when I find some."},{"rating":"2","title":"A huge improvement","review":"Office 2007 was a very nice improvement over previous versions. The program was stable, for me at least, and the new interface was very nice. It may take a few minutes to find where some commands have been moved to but the result was a much cleaner interface.

I am working here...don't have time to re-learn staples such as word processors, spreadsheets, and databases. Jeesh! Give me a break Microsoft! In addition, I think it has to be the buggiest version yet. It is also a huge problem transferring important files to clients who are still on the older versions of Office...that part alone has been a disaster.

I have compiled a list over the years of features and handy tools that I wish were incorporated into the product and I can honestly say that mine and other coworker's expectations were either met or exceeded.

I have never had the displeasure that I have now since purchasing this software suite. Imagine everything you know about Microsoft Office being stripped away and being replaced with a new program that has the same exact functionality (nothing new what so ever), only every button, check box, function, and flexibility being stripped away.

I may actually have to read the instruction manual after being an Office user for over 15 years. Ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbed-down, slower, and harder to use","review":"The new ribbon design is supposed to make it easier to learn and use. It may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. This version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. This is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. Once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. If Microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. The new version does not run macros as fast however. My recommedation for existing users: keep Office 2003 for as long as you can and consider going to Open Office when Microsoft no longer supports 2003 (unless they restore the functionality in a newer release of 2007)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I got my upgrade from Amazon for $280. And while it's a little expensive, it is a suite, not just one program. The changes are great, once you get used to them. If you are a long time user of MS Office, you're in for a shock. The entire GUI has changed. All the menus are gone and you have a bunch of buttons along the top seperated by tabs. The shock wears off after a few weeks once you figure out where everything is at. The reason I don't give it full stars is that there was little documentation to cover the changes for someone used to the old style. I was on my own to learn the changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not Waste Money on Office 2007 Upgrade","review":"Office 2007 offers no new or useful function to Office 2003 users. It does have a new and confusing user interface so that you will have to search for even the most basic functions to save or open documents.So far, I have not found any fault in 2003 that has been addressed in 2004. I only purchased it because 2003 would not load in Vista 32.However, due to a hardware failure I found that Office 2003 does load and operate in Vista 64. Spend your money on a 64 bit processor and keep Office 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"2007 Office Rocks!!!!!","review":"Wow! I must say that the new office 2007 is way better than the 2003. It did take some time to get the hang of it because Microsoft changed around the icons and buttons. However, I do like it because now in Word, Excel, and Powerpoint 2007 you can creat charts and you can also preview how backgrounds look before appling to the slide. In the end, I think the 2007 is much more user-friendly than 2003.

The unfortunate thing about this is that the sensors are internal and require almost 20-30 minutes to adjust from your house to new surroundings like the outside. But it is very useful and durable nontheless. I would have loved it more if it had another row of numbers like some other stopwatches.

We need something that times up to 15 minutes normally sometimes more. As well we needed something that read temp in C not F as well humidity.

I didn't recieve it till Thursday afternoon the next week. But other than that I'd give it a 4 out of 5.

This book is about an acholholic Canadian agent that gets canned. I found it quite boring and what came across to me was a constant whine from the author. In short it was a drag and not recomended. A boring non fiction spy story.

This book is, as are all of his, an excellent picture of life in the wilderness. It focuses on the life struggles and amazing world of a female polar bear named Kalak who lives in the far north. Though it is perhaps not as addictively exciting as some of Kjelgaard's other books, and therefore rated only 4 stars, I definitely recommend Kalak of the Ice to any young reader interested in wildlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the computer doctor ordered!","review":"Got an older PC you want to upgrade?

While the author should be commended for tackling some advanced items such as copy constructors and their use, the presentation is poor. As the reader goes through code samples, he/she is invariably sent to a previous chapter for part code as the author, for whatever reason, couldn't be bothered to include. One of my favorites is Display 5.20 on p. 305. the code is for an equals method with a superimposed author comment, \\"The complete definition of equals is given in the answer to Self-Test Exercise 37, and is a better version that the one given in chapter 4.\\" Huh?

Most every song here consists of a single lyric repeated for three to four minutes. This tries my patience. Sixty repetitions of a single two-word phrase is too much.\\"Pope Adrian\\" has none of fire, originality, or energy, of the band's earlier work. The song length, repetition, and total absence of hooks together result in an album that consistently fails to involve the listener.If you are new to RP, this is the worst place to start.

They are among the rare few who have strong creative ideas and they're using the electronic tools to advance those ideas and put them out there.I completely disagree with the reviewers who have said this record has a lot of filler.

Not one song with any substance here--www.memory being the only one with any potential. Cheesy lyrics and overdone themes.

If your budget is tight, you can choose non-certified router and PC card from the same manufacture.The SMC tech support people worked hard to help me, but it just did not work. I sold it and purchased this orinoco card. It's certified, and it works out of box.

The ending was horribly abrupt, the plot was both hackneyed and ridiculous and the characters .. what a disappointment.Ms. Forster seemed to want to paint everyone with such a bad brush that we couldn't help but love our heroine in contrast. It didn't work. The sex scenes were rather hot - quite nice in fact, but not enough emotion in them to convince me that these two should be in love by the end of it. Mr Forster gets a star for realism, not having a virginal heroine, and incorporating child who isn't a vision of sweetness and light.

That was bad.\\" and immediately put it into my giveaway pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"blush","review":"I really enjoyed my first book by the author and would definetly buy more of her books.

If that isn't spunk I don't know what is.

We live in a fourth floor condo and use this cart for much more than just groceries. It's roomy enough to handle odd shaped items, and sturdy enough to handle heavy items like paint cans and crock pots.My only criticism concerns the wimpy pins used to secure the front wheels. There is a tendency for one to turn the cart without lifting it onto its back wheels which then puts stress on the smaller front wheels, thereby breaking the front wheel pins.This is easily fixed by spending another fifty cents on stronger pins, but an inconvenience nevertheless which accounts for four rather than five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers beware: Seriously toxic and clearly a waste of your money!","review":"This cart is made in China -- like most products today. However, this particular cart must have come from an assembly line that is especially beneath contempt.

This makes a tremendous difference to the enjoyment of the score. Heard seperately, the songs are good but not great; put into context, they work wonderfully. Ron Raines and Kim Cresswell are the equal of their predecessors. Avery Saltzman gives what seems to be the traditional reading of Sancha - squeaky voiced and is as effective as anyone else playing the part this way. It is a shame that a different approach couldn't have been found with this character. The smaller parts aren't as sharply characterised as on the earlier complete recording.

I use this item to heat water for soups or soup itself. When I use it for soup it needs a good cleaning after. More often I heat water to add to dry soups. The best thing about this is that it is the only way I have found to boil water in my car. Electric kettles for home use overwhelmed my converter. The reason I gave it four stars is that, when boiling water, condensation on the lids inevitably falls out when removing the top.

After about an hour of waiting for heat, I decided to see if it could be fixed. It is very easy to take apart. The leads for the heating element were loosely wrapped around the connectors, but not soldered.

The lid fits well enough to prevent spills if supported in an upright position (wedged into my passenger seat against my luggage), but is by no means water-tight if it happens to tip or get bumped. The adapter does not fit tightly into my cigarette lighter, so I have to keep an eye on it, as it does occasionally pop out.

The lid doesn't close watertight, and it snaps on and off, rather than screwing down, so be careful when you pop that cap off a pot of boiling water. There has to be a better device than this one. I didn't find it before this last camping trip, but I will be searching diligently between now and the next one. I'm giving this hotpot two stars, because - eventually - I did get my cup of coffee.

When I grabbed the Hot Pot, its was very hot and the steam from the BOILING water burned my fingers!!!

Battling a massive onslaught of violent crime, a serious superman does battle as the gangsters continually ratchet up the violence.

The 1951 movie, Superman and the Mole Men, which is the precursor to the television series, is really good. The first episode introduces Superman from the Planet Krypton to Earth and takes us through his childhood to his job on the Daily Planet. The quality of the film and episodes is also outstanding - the digital remastering has been expert, to say the least. For all those Baby Boomers out there - I would be very surprised if you didn't absolutely love this set - to say nothing about the hunky Georges Reeves! Bring on Series 2.

The set was advertised as \\"new\\" and it was packaged as so. When we played the first disk, the first three episodes were fine but the last 2 got hung up and did not play. The second tape was just as bad and the 3rd tape seemed fine with just minor stopping and starting. We have not played the last 2 yet, but I am expecting the same. I am disappointed in the quality but as my husband told me: you just get what you pay for. There was another set like this one selling for $30.00. Guess I should have paid the higher price and hopefully would have received a better quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased:-)","review":"I can't believe i am watching this again!, i used to watch it back at the end of the 70th when i was only 5, i used to come from kindergarden ad turn on the T.V (black and white) to watch superman. I used to watch it spanish, now that i speak English i can hear their real voices:-)Looking forward buying the other series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Duper in glorious black and white!","review":"Okay! The original prints are not quite perfect. Who cares! Look for the first twenty-four episodes uncut in black and white-thank goodness! plus \\"The Unknown People\\" two parter from the cinema release that no one I know remembers being at the theater. Lots of extras. Thankfully, the DVDs are one sided! A quality production that plays perfect on my DVD player. Hopefully, season two is in the works.

Got it for my 6 y. old for Christmas - big let down. Too much weak writing and dialogue - not enough Superhero rescues. Spend the dough on Batman instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Invincible Superman","review":"Thanks all of you for the terrific reviews for the nostalgic necessity of owning this gem on DVD. I just wanted to add a quick look back on our super hero and see if any of you remember the funniest flaw we endured in those innocent times.Can you remember when someone would shoot at Superman he would stand with his hands on his hips and the bullets would bounce off him, well, because he's Superman. Then the thug would toss the now empty gun at him and our Man Of Steel would DUCK the approaching pistol. Why ??? He's Superman !!!! What're ya ducking for ?????I love the Fleischer cartoons and Christopher Reeve but most of all it was George Reeves that was the real Superman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ever","review":"Looking at these episodes, 45 years after I watched them as a child, I can only say that they have truly held up to the test of time. Thinking of when they were made, and how they were made, allows me to have more respect for all the participants, and the production itself.Truly outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look, up in the Sky, it's.....","review":"I originally purchased this as a gift for my husband's birthday. He loved this program as a child, and I thought he would appreciate a flashback to his childhood.Not ever having watched this program, I can truly say that I am enjoying it just as much as my husband. So, whether you watched The Adventures of Superman as a child, or in my case, for the first time -- you will love the flashback of this TV program. They are good, clean shows for children as well. We loved Season One so much, I ended up buying all Six Season disks. Break out the popcorn, turn the telephone off, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Did I Wait So Long ???","review":"I saw the customer reviews for months and months, but for some reason could not order this dvd set. When I finally did, I was so glad. It brought back so many happy memories. The picture was cleaned up so well with very few dust particles I remember from watching them on TV for years. I don't miss the commercials either. Watching these episodes gives me so much pleasure, even the bad scenery doesn't bother me. I know I'll have to order more seasons, but the first & second seasons got the best reviews, before the violence was lessened to make it a more \\"kid friendly\\" show (per other reviews). Wow, 26 shows for such a low price (I got these first two seasons of 26 episodes each somewhere else for $19.00 each). 5 Stars...most of the 52 shows are classics. I hadn't seen many for over 20 years and really enjoyed them again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relive your youth!","review":"Get this for your very own even if just to remind yourself of your innocent days as a kid. I don't believe I know anyone that didn't love George Reeves (no relation to Christopher) as Superman. These episodes have a certain charm all their own. Before we became so sophisticated we thought Superman was really the bomb. I must say though, even as a kid, I could never understand why nobody could see that Clark Kent was Superman. All he did was wear glasses as a disguise. I still think George was pretty darn good looking back then.Your older kids may think Superman is lame but the younger kids might get a kick out of it. All of the Superman episodes are kid friendly. You may have to explain the concept of watching tv in black & white though ;) They are still fun to watch and you'll be surprised how much of it you remember. It's wonderful that they finally put these together for us. These will go fast. New viewers will enjoy also. Better pre-order one today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality & Variety","review":"The \\"Man of Steel\\" original w/ George Reeves is the best!Just like I remembered it to be from my youth.

Warning though, superman fights gagsters not super villains and people do get shot. I think it's better explaining that guns are dangerous and people can die from them instead of today where a thousand shots are fired and no one gets hurt. After all, good always triumphs in the end. CLASSIC STUFF!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Warner Brothers","review":"All Fans know how good the stories were very suspence full and the edge of your seat music, I was happy to see that Warner Brothers cares and did a great job mastering this 1st season the term Glorious Black and white really applies here, Theres just one that they could of done better and that was The Stolen Costume a lot of film flicker, Other than that its great video and sound.One thing about George Reeves he really looked like Superman all others looked more like Superboy including the upcoming Superman Movie coming out in 2006.

Take the \\"Syl\\" off, and you have his real identity. I have never read this book, and I never will. Endorsing this man and his work is an insult to Celine herself. Sylvain says he has all these contacts with Celine, her staff, etc. but he has never met her, which I find very odd. If you REALLY want to know about Celine, read her AUTHORIZED biography and autobiography. If you really love and admire Celine, DO NOT humor this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Spend Your Money","review":"I think I now know more about the person who wrote this book than I do about Celine. Buddy, no one cares!According to Mr. Beauregard, Sony and the entire music media business would crumble and collapse without him. His \\"passion\\" for Celine goes far beyond being a fan and straight into obsession. I think it would serve Ms. Dion well to post a guard outside her door when this guy is around.There is some interesting stuff in the book, but it's nothing that's not in any of the other books about Celine Dion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"This is what you call \\"overkill.\\" How many books need to be written on Celine? The only book you need to get on her is the official biography and maybe her autobiography. This book by Sylvain is a waste of money. He is widely known among the Celine Dion community on the Internet as an arrogant loud mouth who spreads rumors that turn out to not be true. I don't know how in the world he got this published. Trust me, if you want an accurate book on Celine buy one that is official."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the collectors","review":"Hi I think this is a great book for the collector, not for the \\"I'm just a fan\\" fan. I've used this book myself as a source of information for our own website (www.celinedion.nl). Translated the information and sometimes add some info to it. I admit there are a few mistakes. But that still makes it a great book, I'm using it a lot really it's always on my desk so I can grap it when I need it.

The Art of Drowning is by far one of the best punk cds ever made...filled with rage, fast music and beautiful lyrics...AFI is one of the best bands out there right now, and you can count on them to put out a great cd that you will find yourself never reaching for the fast forward button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good God!","review":"WHAT?! You don't have this yet?! This has got to be the best music I've heard in a loooong time. True, it took a while for me to get used to Davey's voice, but now it's hard for me to listen to anything but. The lyrics are not the usual jibberish-written-in-5-minutes, Jade's guitar riffs can hardly be more harmonic, Hunter's bass skills never cease to amaze me, and Adam has drumsticks faster than lightening. What else can I say? AFI's a truly talented band."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI's best album to date...","review":"Making the transformation from just some annoying hardcore band to a darker goth/rock type band was the best thing AFI ever did. This band freakin rips and Davey Havok isn't so annoying on this cd, plus the music is just awesome. I mean come on no other band really sounds like AFI...well, except Danzig and The Misfits, but anyway AFI really does have talent. Songs like \\"Days of the Phoenix\\" and \\"Wester,\\" just to name a couple, are amazing and always get me hyped up and ready to rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Ok,lets start off with saying that AFI is not punk, they are Easy Bay Hardcore, but that really doesn't matter. AFI's newest CD, one of the best Cd's I have. Great songs, catchy tunes, what more could you ask for. Don't think twice about buying this CD for it is Great. Of course I gave this CD 5 stars because the songs are around 3 minutes long, showing that they wrote it and planned it out to make a good CD. So all in all, BUY IT. And watch out for AFI's new album coming out, I don't know much about it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"AFI Madness!","review":"Let me tell you of a \\"Story at Three\\". When the radio was bruised, battered, and bleeding. Disguising pompous and cacophony noise to \\"Lost Souls\\" as music. The radio was heading to a \\"Despair factor\\", it needed a \\"Morningstar\\" to help it rise from the ashes. The \\"Day of the Phoenix\\" did just so and although it only stayed from \\"6 to 8\\" the town of \\"Wester\\" \\"Caught the hot one\\" and approached the winged victory with \\"Greetings and Goodbyes.\\" The Phoenix however did not speak a word, but only noded as it flew off with a \\"Smile.\\" I hope you appreciate and enjoy this album as much as I did. Three cheers for Havok and his entourage,by the way that story is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bestest band ever","review":"Contrary to what many of you have said Davey does not write the lyrics to AFI songs Jade does. This CD is good but wait until Sing the Sorrow comes out I have already heard it and it is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ohhhhhh my","review":"Simply put, this is one of the best albums ever made. AFI rules. If you like this, go out and get Black Sails. It's similar to this and their 2nd best according to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doom and Gloom","review":"Afi's The Art of Drowning, breaks the boundries between both punk and goth. It has the melodies of great goth bands and the ferosity of a punk hardcore band. Davey havoks voice screechs louder than before and expresse4s the music excellently. Both Hunter and Jade preform and excellently on the record as do the backing singing from X-13(offspring backing singer) and Lars from Rancid. In all this album is the most gloomy from them to date, and tells the world that its gonna end one day. Songs like Wester and 6 to 8 are the best followed byMorning Star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scores high on the Prichard Scale...","review":"AFI is it's own music. Stop labeling it and comparing it to other bands. If you want to be amazed by poetry and taught a thing or two about emotional music, buy this CD! It's not all fast, loud, and crunchy, and when it is, it still sounds amazing. Davey Havok's voice is beautiful at any given moment. His words enhance that. If you can, go see AFI live. They will blow you away. The intimacy between the band and the audience is superb. AFI is taking over the underground world. Once you hear AFI, you either love them or hate them. If you love them, you're forever changed because now you are a non-conventionalist. You don't care if it sounds crunchy or if you can bang your head to it or if other people like it. You like it because it's about the connection the band makes with you. The way they make you feel like you're in a fantasy world.

It has everything on it like punk, hardcore and goth. Every song is really excellent. If you like afi at all, buy this.

There is even a hidden track called Battled. Buy it now!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this supposed to be the \\"mainstream\\" album?","review":"I listened to this album several times wondering what the .... was wrong. For example, why did it sound like every other punk band out these days? Why did some of the songs sound like blatant Danzig ripoffs? The whole thing is really boring and melodramatic and I see no positive progression from Black Sails to this album, as there was with all the other albums. If anything, it shows a sharp degression. If you're not ready to put out more material, DON'T PUT OUT ANOTHER ALBUM. To be honest, I expected a lot more from a band like AFI. What happened to the energy? Why is Davey taking this whole Goth/Misfits/spooky image so far? What the .... is going on here? Why is AFI doing ...... 80's metal ballads (the last song). This album is just embarrassing. Don't buy it. It sounds like the offspring mixed with 80's metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this.","review":"i wish i could give AFI 0 stars. all they make i s meaningless goth rock, while claiming to be \\"hardcore\\". just a bunch of pussies with makeup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiddie-Core to the max","review":"(...)

I was so addicted from the start I begged to borrow it so I could burn it for myself and return to my cousin her own wonderful, wonderful music.Wow. I loved this. I mean love, as in present tense. ^^;My favorite songs have to be Despair Factor, morningstar, Sacrifice Theory, 6 to 8, and Days of Phoenix (wow, that's a weird word to spell!)

I just felt like writing a kids review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than Black Sails","review":"BSITS marked a transitional phase for AFI, and this album just confirmed that they had permanently left behind their \\"hardcore punk\\" days. Never in my life have I heard anything so beautiful as far as Davey's lyrics...and that voice! Jade is truly a force to be reckoned with, his abilities with a guitar simply dwarf just about anyone out there today. I can't say enough good about these guys. Becoming a fan isn't just a part-time endeavor....it's a lifetime commitment, but one I am more than happy to make. I can say with pride that I am truly obsessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"The Art of Drowning is more punk than hardcore. It's very melodic, and probably their softest CD to date. Not that it's a soft CD by any means though. The lyrics on this CD are very poetic, even more so than on Black Sails. Davey's singing is better than ever (but still not as good as on Sing the Sorrow). My favourite songs are the Lost Souls, Wester, and Days of the Pheonix. Get this CD! It rox!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great street punk gothic style album","review":"I never got into A.FI, but always been into the NYHC scene and love punk rock (Rancid, H20, Sick Of It All, Social Distortion, etc.). Thanx to Amazon, I was just on this page listening to this album the other day when I was blown away and just ran out and picked up a copy. The singers voice, I think is awesome and really distinctive. Reminds me a bit of Danzigs voice, but much more pleasent and fresh. This album i recommend for anyone that loves bands like Rancid, or H20. Actually anyone that loves good hardcore punk. The double bass on the drums are thumping along with great bass lines ( on some tracks it sounds like Matt Freeman playin the bass , it's so good). This album was worth the buy. I heard AFI's newer stuff on the radio, but it just didn't have that hardcore punk sound like this gem of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"Mix the vocals of At The Drive-In's El Gran Orgo and the beautiful guitar work of Propagandhi's Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes, and you have Art of Drowning. I love it. My only complaint is that they go a little overboard on the whoa-oh-oh's, but I like even that. This is a dark album, though, kind of like the latter album above, except darker. I don't think Propagandhi could make a record and manage to make all the songs dark and serious. Not that that's bad. AFI does a very good job of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"An extremely good album. Second only to their previous release, Black Sails. A very hard core album with just enough, but not too much melody. A good sing along album. And best of all, decent lyrics, there almost poetic, none of that whinny pop punk like Blink 182. Deep lyrics, not some guy bitching about his life as is the norm. Ever see these guys live? Some of the most energetic (and violent) you'll ever see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean","review":"The Art Of Drowning is one of the most amazing CD's out there today. AFI's unique blend of hardcore punk and 80's style goth is simply a refreshing sound when most punk bands sound the same now-a-days. AFI's music can be blistering hardcore and the next second very somber and melodic. While it isn't as hardcore as Black Sails in the Sunset or Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes it is still an amazing record. Davey Havok proves that he is the best songwriter in the punk genre, and the rest of the band are amazing musicians in their own right. BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next step for AFI","review":"This is a good CD, furthering AFI's musical evolution. Everything about this album is good, the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is becuase it's not as good as Black Sails, but that was an amazng album and hard to follow up. My favorite songs on here are Sacrifice Theory (classic AFI), The Despair Factor, The Lost Souls Club, and Ever and A Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Art of Drowning is a great release!!","review":"... The art of drowning was a great release. It got old. fast. real fast. Davy Havok's voice got really obnoxious and agrivating. I really dont like this anymore.

I would also like to dispell what I said before about liking blink 182. i dont. i kick myself for liking them. if you want to here some good punk rock, dont turn on the radio, travel out to a decrepit, yet \\"cultural-full\\" neighborhood. find a small record store/club listen to the music. enjoy. bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"A.F.I.

The simple story and illustrations were a wonderful introduction to many of the things she encountered at the beach including the waves, shells, seaweed, sandcastles, and crabs (but as a Maryland native she already knows all about them - steamed with plenty of Old Bay seasoning, that is).

He even bites Eminems style on more than one song. Method Man has sold out as just another punk-ass rapper/bad actor wannabee who whores their name out to everything and his 3rd effort has paid the price.

With the exception of The Motto (track 5) and Turn (track 7), theres hardly a listenworthy track. This may not be Meth's fault from what I hear, something about def jam wanting a more commercial type record, but its still a weak effort. His cameos seem stale except for Raekwons, and who knows what missy, busta, or snoop dogg are doing on his tape. Track 5 and 7 sound like some of the older wu solo tracks, which I think are the only songs worth listening.

I think Method Man has found his new sound. Even though, his style is still the same (I wouldn't change a thing) but hey, that's just Meth. The material on this cd is completely different from his previous work. It's not that is isn't good, it's just different. Meth cannot stick with the same material with each album he puts out. It has to be different in order to sell. The guest spots on this album are to help add flavor to his mix. And he use's the hottest acts out today and comes up with new banging tracks. As for Meth's flow, it's Johnny blaze!!! He's still keepin' it real. I'm sure when it comes time to drop Wu Tang material, he will bring us back to the old days. But this cd is not Wu Tang material, so don't expect it. This cd is just something new and different from Meth.

Method Man isnt BAD on this album, its just he can do better, and there's too many guest features on it. Does have some nice tracks, but you're better off just downloading the better songs of iTunes if you're a Method Man fan.I'd recommend the original Tical album as a better display of Method Man's skills, or Ghostface's 'The Pretty Toney Album' as a better Def Jam/Wu-Tang release released around the same time as this album.Top 5 Songs:The Afterparty feat.

C'mon Meth, you're a Wu member, you have RZA, Mathematics, and Tru Master to get beats from, you don't need P Diddy and Missy Elliot, who are horrible producers anyway. If you can't get production on your album from your own crew, because of your record label, then guess what? LEAVE DEF JAM. There are a few good songs on this album, including The Motto and The Turn with Raekwon (Which is the only RZA produced track). I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this album, it's not even worth the 9 dollars I could buy it for at Best Buy.

I know RZA is busy and all, but if he could've produced every song on this album, it would've been better, for sure.

If you liked TICAL, TICAL2000, BLACKOUT or any Classic WU TANG release you will not like this album.

The lyrics and beats have been dumbed down to suit the current state of Hip Hop in 2004, Alot of party/thugs-in-love tracks that the once grimey METHOD MAN should be ashamed for doing. There are too many cheesy guest appearences by the likes of PUFF DADDY, MISSEY, LUDACRISS, CHINKY, and BUSTA, that are aimed at attracting the 12 year old mall girl market, not the hip hop head.

It is far too depressing to listen to this album, what a waste of talent.NOTE TO ALL WU TANG MEMBERS. Get RZA to produce every single track, without him YOU ARE NOTHING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five years for this?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!","review":"First, I am a hardcore meth fan, until now. I got excited with the intro, a gritty old-school Wu jumpoff, then the next song was gritty, and getting me more excited...and thats where the entire album should have stopped. This is the most disappointing thing that Meth could have done. I can't believe that it took him five years to make this miserable piece of junk. I hope that there will be a good follow up to this, but I won't be holding my breath. Also, why is P diddy on the album? It seems that he is the exact opposite of everything that the Wu is, him being on the album just feels like a huge sellout. Well Meth has the series coming on fox, hopefully his acting only gets better, cuz obviously his music is getting worse. I guess I at least have a new coaster for my coffee table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Method Man was too busy...","review":"Meth was too busy at SmackDown! on November 11th to release this CD..

Meth is one of my fav. member, but i don't know what happened in this album. To tell you the truth he didn't give it his all. Meth is a really creative person, but he was creative enough for this album. The beats are boring and the lyrics are just alright. Honestly the only song i liked are \\"The Turn\\" this song is def. 5 stars. Some alright songs that might catch peoples attention are ... \\"The Show\\" \\"Who Ya'll Rollin Wit\\" \\"Crooked Letter I\\" \\"Baby Come on\\" \\"Say What\\" and \\"Whats Happenin\\". Those songs are somewhat stand out tracks for the commercial fans, but personally those songs aren't my flavor. The other ok song in my eye is \\"Afterparty\\". But for the most part the cd is terrible, No disrespect Meth. is very talented but not on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.......","review":"I was so hyped when I heard that Meth was coming out with an album two years ago. But, after waiting two years for this album, this is HALF ASS. The production is so out of control that no tune or song really exists. The only good tracks are The Turn, The Motto, Afterparty, and We Some Dogs. There are also too many f-ing guest spots! I wanted to hear Meth rip tracks up and for him to actually make good songs, but no. Instead, this album had to go mainstream. You won't find gritty, dark, raw tracks here, like what Method Man has made in the past. Just flashy, beatsy crap. I cannot believe Meth said he was satisfied with this album because now, I truly believe the Wu is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars","review":"This album was basically garbage i am not a huge Method Man album but i was really lookin forward to get this cd. But when i got it i listened to it and was just disappointed. Only one single was released from the album \\"Whats Happenin\\" feat. Busta Rhymes which slowing died on Bet. A Second single was never released because there wasnt another song on the album that was any good. \\"Rodeo\\" a song feat. Ludacris was ok. But I would not go buy this album. I would stick to his first album Tical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call him Cold Nix instead of Hot Nix","review":"I just listened to the whole cd from beginning to end, and I'm dissapointed, but not alot because I wasn't expecting alot from Method Man on this CD. One of my main complaints is why in the **** do the good songs such as #7 and #15 barely last 3 minutes, while his \\"garbage\\" songs, such as #11, last for 4 1/2 minutes!!!!!! The M-E-T-H-O-D Man has definitely went commercial....in other words he pulled what I call an \\"Ice Cube\\".Yall remember the \\"old\\" Ice Cube before all the movies and how nobody on the west couldn't touch him. Thats how Meth was, but sadly we may never see the \\"old\\" Meth again. On a good note #7 is str8 FIRE!!!!!! but too d*mn short.

Mef is so much underrated!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the cd meth wanted...","review":"If you follow Wu closely, you know this cd is not the final product Meth wanted. We all know Def Jam controls the artists and doesn't allow the artists complete creativity. Rza had reportedly produced around 10 tracks, and in Meth's contrack they said he could have RZA produce a lot of tracks if his albums went gold, which they did. Mainstream people may like this, but true Gods know that this album would have been amazing if Def Jam weren't such control freaks. Only song I like is afterparty with ghostface killah. Buy Masta Killa- No Said Date, due out on June 1st. Going to be an amazing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steamin Pile of...","review":"This album right here was a total bust, not because of Method Man's rhymes ( they never fell off) but because of the wack beats he rhymes over. Some of the beats border unlistenable. His beat selection is worse than Nas & Jadakiss combined. Wack production. Method Man keeps his usual velvet flow and wit on this album and even gets some interesting wordplay and metaphors in there but they are overlooked becuase of terrible beats and it's a shame. After hearing 'What's Happening' I expected this album to be a surefire banger...boy was I wrong. THe only songs I'm feelin are What's Happening, Say waht, The Motto, The Turn, and AfterParty after that cut the deck. This album is not worth any of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the hype","review":"i love Method Man and hes still sick lyrical wise, but this album really lacks in beats, and there are way too many quest appearances that shouldn't be on here.

My first impression is that I'm kinda dissapointed. Method Man is really lacking in things to talk about, has the same flow on every song, and uses a lot of connectors that I've heard before. The beats are definately below average and some are even just plain weird. Also, I have yet to find a single track that just completely bangs. Some are better than others, but there are no real standouts. Maybe the CD will grow on me, but with the poor production and lack of lyrical content, I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is not that bad, it grew on me.","review":"This cd is worth buying and listening to.

The continual heartfelt and subposedly intellectual knocks on the foundations of the Bible made me feel like I was sitting in the classroom of an aggresive, atheistic college professor. The profanity, though considered mild by today's standards, was nontheless gratuitous.Though the humanitarian personality won out in the end, it was a hard fought battle that left the dessimated bodies of theology in it's unworthy wake.I give it 2 out of 5 stars, for a some what interesting read but am shocked that this is the work of a respected minister capable of a work such as The Robe."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs to be DONE over.

However, being a musician, it has been continuously pleasurable over many listenings. Robben and Vinnie are as good as they come. It's a fabulous recording audio-wise, but it might be tough to dance to...that's not what it's for..This group strikes me as a coming together of three fabulous musicians doing a project that is driven by their own tones and desires, and not commercial popularity. This is very evident by the skeletal nature of many of the tracks on both studio records, and extrapolation over those musical vehicles taken to extremely groovy places.

On the same sample point it would match a normal thermometer sometimes and be as far off as 10F other times. I then read the specs and they only guarantee an accuracy of +-10F over most ranges. I figure this is probably typical of this type of meter???? I kept it because it is a nice form factor and I can use it for reading temperatures on motors and electrical boxes but I found it not accurate enough for real precision work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived non functioning","review":"Opened the box, read the instructions.

Here is yet another case.It's well known among the \\"techie\\" community that Orinoco's (either silver or gold) are the best wireless cards, and by a wide margin.

Also unique and very clever is that, rather than wondering \\"who done it\\", the burning question throughout the novel is \\"who is the anonymous caller\\"?Very engaging, a good read...HOWEVER, unless I missed something we never do find out the ultimate fate of the cop who gave Dillard a lift when he ran out of gas.That aside, I'm looking forward to reading more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up Jumped the Devil","review":"This author has some issues to deal with.

It is this very attitude of self segregation that leads to the gulf between the races that the author decries. One quickoy tires of \\"brother,\\" \\"sistah,\\" and all the other ghettoisms that the author relentlessly pushes down one's throat. This book does a disservice to the very people it tries to elevate and represent."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not how good it is, but who you know in the business","review":"I read UJTD for two reasons. Someone suggested it was good reading. Secondly, as an aspiring novelist, I like to see how I measure up. Obviously a subjective assessment. But isn't this a subjective business anyway. I thought it was boring. The Androgeneous One was lucidly a drag. Super hero beat reporter?

Walker has an excellent ear for conversations, and an excellent eye for real life situations. There is little need for suspension of disbelief, so well structured is the plot and the characterizations. A nice blend of public and private, suspense and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Uneven","review":"it is hard to tell whether the author is trying to tell a story of a writer from the black perspective or if he is trying to tell a story. Either way, one minute it feels as if he is trying to tell a story about the ugliness of racial, ethnnic, and religious bigotry through the use of three men who style themselves as white supremecists. The next it is a story of a black man's perceived struggle on a major newspaper with white management to whom, from his perspective, he won't \\"bow\\". Once I was able to get past the dual story which didn't mesh well it was an interesting read. The book did not hold my attention in a way that compelled me to keep reading but when I picked it up I my interest was held for several chapters. The number of chapters I read at a time often was determined by when the focus of the story changed. Both storylines were interesting, just not compelling together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad but true.","review":"Great idea, great acting, great production value and crap directing. Unless you get excited by people sitting and talking, noting happens that's even interesting till almost 55 min. into the movie, seriously?

The acting is great for the genre it's in, you can tell that people put a lot of hard work into the movie. All of these people deserve to move up in the world of acting -- they fake bad acting and seriousness all at the same time, it makes for an extremely good laugh.Also, this is probably a great movie for a drinking game.....there's a signal phrase or action in there somewhere, I'm sure of it.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont even know what to title this","review":"This movie was strange. There were witches, zombies and lesbian coeds and even they werent enough to save it. I watched from the beginning to the end and it really didnt do much for me. Vegan Zombies were more along the line of grape zombies. One fun thing about the movie was the grapes of wrath. The grapes were just very angry. Regardless, if you have nothing better to do and have some time to waste between other movies you can watch this. Otherwise it is a pass. Unfortunate too because it had a decent premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bad movie.","review":"This movie is a poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted,micro-budget horror film. The attempts at comedy fall incredibly flat.The plot, such as it is, takes forever to pick up, and when it finallydoes things just get worse.With a name like \\"Attack of the Vegan Zombies!\\" it's obvious that thefilm does not take itself too seriously. However, even with that inmind this movie fails on every level.The special effects are laughable, character motivation jumps randomlyfrom one scene to the next, the comic relief is forced and unfunny, thehorror elements are clichéd and not even remotely frightening.The positive reviews posted here that suckered me into believing thatthis was potentially a clever horror spoof must be written by peopleinvolved with the film.

Both these musicians have albums of their own in the same series. Each of these volumes include two original lp's from the late 60's to mid-70's. In this case, as is most often the case with the Legends of Acid Jazz releases, the first album is better than the second. Still, both have great beats, good soloing, and feature generally inspired playing. The lay out of this series is awful. Cartoonish and tacky, whoever put the graphics together should have used the original album covers. The title of this series should be changed as well.

Peters has a wonderful grasp of human emotions in this book, and draws a very clear picture of Medieaval monastic life with its limitations and its glories, making us feel as though we fit right in even though it's 800 years later.

Still, it is just so nice to see a good-feeling kind of song out there. With Jason Mraz, a boy from the south, he scored a groove that reaches out to all boundaries. That can definitely be explained with his debut song, The Remedy (I Won't Worry). It is just a good song that makes you want to just not worry so much about worrying about life and everything in between. Which is nice, because there are not that many of those songs out there right now. It is a remarkable song that makes you just want to get up and dance.

As for the rest of the album, I like the whole second side: \\"Hang On To Your Life,\\" \\"Coming Down off the Money Bag/Song of the Dog.\\" And the title track is pleasing, but I'm only 16, so some of the tracks are a little too old for me.

Later I got the CD (with the bonus tracks) but personally rating just the album, it was far better then \\"American Woman\\" in the way it was put together.

And this is where this disc falls short.Although most segments sound pretty realistic in isolation, when you listen to the disc from start to end, you quickly get the sense that a sound engineer has \\"faded in\\" the sound of a brook and then later \\"faded it out\\" to give you the impression of walking past it.

From the outset it behaves as if it were written to please IT specialists and others whose careers depend on things being complicated and incomprehensible to mortals. Even when Retrospect is being directed to do something simple, it is not simple to do because it speaks some alien jargon. It could really serve as a model for bad interface design.It isn't much discussed, but the Mac is really lacking quality tools for backup, file synchronization, and similar critical tasks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giant Disappointment","review":"'Bought it, and sent it back for a refund. I should have believed all of the negative reviews that Retrospect received (on the Amazon site).

My rating of Retrospect is \\"Junk\\". Worse yet, I could not find a Help Line telephone number to talk with a real person - that might have made a big difference. They want you to use their website for ALL problem solving. Well think of this: if their instructions included in their big manual didn't work in the first place, why would you expect the website to work?

This is NOT in the 'Girlfriends Guides' vein, it's more a personal bio and idea of raising her own family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I really thought I was going to enjoy this book.

I'm off to scrapbook, which is really just an extension of what our mothers and their mothers before them did in keeping a journaled photo album of our milestones.A gift I treasure to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the book","review":"I was looking for a fun read and this was it. A quick book that pokes fun I guess at some sacred cows like scrapbooking and overindulging children with toys. Geez, apparently some scrapbookers are taking great offense to Muffy, but I didn't feel her writing was mean spirited at all. I think some of the reviewers are mean-spirited, though. Touche. Lighten up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cynical Look at Parenting","review":"Played as a humorous book on parenting in the press reviews I read, I was disappointed that \\"Slacker\\" lacks any traditional humor. It is a cynical look at everything that is wrong with parenting guideance and marketing aimed at parents today. Her attitude seems to be that children should only get the bare minimum in terms of attention, praise, and support.Some of her points are valid, such as the alternatives to giving into every toy whim in \\"Toys Aren't Us\\", but I found it most hypocritical for someone raising her children via a nanny to be giving advice on parenting. I am suprised with her don't-child-proof-life attitude that she did not just leave them home alone to fend for themselves!For real humor regarding parenting, borrow your mom's old copies of Erma Bombeck's works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for Muffy Mead-Ferro!","review":"I loved \\"Confessions of a Slacker Mom\\" and read it in one sitting. The author's no-nonsense approach to motherhood really appealed to me and I especially loved the chapter entitled, \\"Toys Aren't Us.\\" I, too, grew up in Wyoming and as a child I played with sticks and built forts for entertainment. So the first time I walked into Babies R Us, I felt completely overwhelmed by everything I was \\"supposed\\" to buy. After reading this book, I know that I am not the only mom that has not purchased a silly wipe warmer. I consider myself a high maintainence person and not so much a slacker mom but very much appreciated Mead-Ferro's advice about listening to my inner voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a relief!","review":"There wasn't one page of this book that didn't make me sigh in relief!

I know there are some parents who will never think it's okay to go anywhere less than overboard when it comes to their children but kids would benefit more if parents gave them a little more freedom and showed a little more faith in their ability to do things for themselves. What we're trying to produce as parents is self-sufficient and resilient human beings and we won't achieve that by doing everything for our children and always protecting them from everything in the world around them. I really enjoyed the stories from the author's childhood on a farm because I think most of us were raised by parents who were a lot less hyper about it than parents today, even if we were in the cities and suburbs. I would definitely recommend this book to other parents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why is the kindle edition more expensive?","review":"No I have not gotten this book I bought a 200$ kindle and yet the kindle price is almost 5$ more than the paper back...

In this age of \\"so serious\\" parenting, a breath of humor and satire is most welcome. Good sense certainly is evident and highly recommended, but what spoke to me most was the love story she wove throughout the pages. Yes, a love story about her Mother and Grandparents. The way in which she opened bits of their lives to her readers was subtle and heartwarming.Back to the humor - I CANNOT wait until Belle and Joe reach their teens and Muffy treats us to her views on that delightful stage of parenting.Signed: A Grandmother & therefore, a teenager parent survivor!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and annoying","review":"I bought this at a book fair at my child's school, mostly to support the school but also because the cover drew me in. I want to be a slacker mom, but society has made that difficult. Once I started reading, however, I was immediately annoyed and disappointed with my choice. The cover shows a woman in high heel pointy toe shoes relaxing on a couch. The book is about a woman who lives on a cattle ranch who shuns scrapbooking and children's toys. Puh-lease! Do yourself a favor. Buy another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I came to this book as a single mom looking to find some humor and relief in a book that would combine a bit of reality with the goals of good parenting. Instead, I found it to be rather condescending and dismissive of other parenting styles. There are certainly flashes of wit, but in truth the ideas could have easily been contained in a few paragraphs. I felt that my time was not well spent in reading this book. I knew about half way through that I didn't like it, but I kept going in a hope of finding the \\"good stuff\\". My hopes were not rewarded. The author has a nanny. That's not \\"slack\\", it's wealth. I couldn't even pass it on to my friends because I really didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slacker Mom too extravagant praise for this one!","review":"There is a difference between being a \\"slacker mom\\" and being downright negligent. Her flimsy justifications for letting her children hurt themselves cross the line between the two. I kept waiting for the chapter where she lets her children find out the consequences of not wearing seatbelts by having her slam on the brakes while driving and letting them fly through the windshield. This book is un-funny in the extreme, and if I could give it zero stars I would gladly do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right message - lousy execution - very negative - not funny","review":"I agree with the basic premise of the book and I actually am pretty much a \\"slacker mom\\" as described in the book; don't over indulge kids, let them learn from their mistakes, etc. But...the author feels the need to paint caricatures of moms that do things a bit differntly and to put them down in order to justify her own high and mighty opinions. She accuses moms who do scrapbooking of creating \\"shrines\\" to their children. Makes her living in advertising but complains about the pressure to buy, buy buy. She writes as if parents who stay home, enroll their kids in a few classes, go to some of their kids games, etc are all idiots. One reviewer said this book has a hidden conservative agenda, a friend thought it was written by an extreme liberal -- call it what you want, it's just extremely bad. This book is not even funny. The worst book I've read in memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading","review":"I can sum up everything quickly for you: Muffy doesn't believe in toys, preschool, scrapbooking, gymboree or any modern convenience for you and your baby. If you are a mom interested in reading parenting magazines, attending baby play groups or enjoy treating your child to the new Leapfrog toy - don't read this as she sucks the enjoyment out of you. This book will not teach you anything, nor will you have a good laugh. It's not a confessional, it's her explanation of why her way is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conservative agenda masked as humour","review":"I looked forward to reading this book, expecting a humorous take on parents who overindulge their children - the kind of humour of \\"The Nanny Diaries\\" or the Shopaholic books. Instead, I found a conservative agenda masking as humour. Yes, there were some funny parts and Mead-Ferro makes some excellent points about not buying all the latest gadgets for children, that parents can parent with less paraphernalia and should let children figure things out for themselves (learn from their own mistakes). But a lot of it comes across as whiny justification for Mead-Ferro's \\"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\\", no-nonsense attitude. And when she says it's okay to hit your children once in a while if you're really mad and want to get something through to them, well ... if anyone wrote a book saying it was okay to whack your wife once in a while to get her to listen, there'd be an uproar.Don't bother with this book. Spend the time hugging your children instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mind-relieving book!","review":"This book made me LAUGH OUT LOUD, and generally helped relieve some of the stress of parenting. It also helped me feel I was doing some things right, like trying to take time for myself. A must read for moms, and dads!After my daughter was born, I read a lot of books and articles in magazines. The more I read, the more I got stressed out about all the information, and not doing EVERYTHING exactly like all the books/mags said. Eventually, I learned to stop reading all that stuff and follow my instincts. I only reference books now for medical reasons.You could say I'm on the stricter side of parenting by the way, and this book supported this, not that it's at ALL about how to parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a mom, read this book!!","review":"What a fun book! I laughed all the way through...and nodded my head in philosophical agreement. Mead-Ferro has whittled parenting issues down to their base level, challenging many to review their motives for parenting choices.For us fellow-slackers, she's provided an easy read (making me feel accomplished that I finished a book while raising 3 boys under age 5), as well as constant belly laughs that are key to surviving parenthood!A great gift book, especially for a first-time mom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Execution of a great idea","review":"I bought this book because I thought the premise was fantastic. At what point in our lives did we decide that everything must revolve around our children? However, this book does a very poor job of fully developing and talking about this idea. Additionally, she never comes out and says what the age of her children are which leads to me to believe (at the time of publication) the author was not even in a position of authority to really understand about being a slacker (i.e. she had not gotten into her kids wanting to play soccer, baseball, do ballet, art, cheerleading, etc. etc.). However much I paid for this book was too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I hoped for a witty novela crammed with wry observations about being a \\"slacker\\" mom. Instead, I got a Baby Boomer doling out common sense advice.I think the term slacker was used inappropriately here. During the last decade plus, most use of the term usually refers to Generation Xrs. She uses the literal term in this book and her even more dismal book- Slacker Wife. If you want something good- check out Ariel Gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing 2!","review":"I just read this book and it was a breath of fresh air. It doesn't bother me that she has a nanny, lucky for her is what I say. I love the basic premise of the book and realize that it has a lot of good points in it! Our kids are wonderful and I love mine dearly but they don't need EVERYTHING and do need boundaries. The current age thinking is not on track IMO and I think a little throw back to the \\"good ole days\\" would do us some good. I am not advocating child labor or anything like that but just wishing a little more common sense would come back into style besides hoping that someone else would tell you how to raise your kids right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No laughs here.

She accuses moms who do scrapbooking of creating \\"shrines\\" to their children that will over-inflate the kids egos - I don't \\"scrapbook\\" but know that those that do use it as a hobby or creative outlet that may be appreciated some day down the road by their kids, not something that will make the kids selfish.

Out of all the writers there is one or two that keep your attention but for the most part the writers have done a very poor overall job. You buy this book thinking you will be reading about hero's of WWII and you get stories about a little boy who helps in an aircraft hanger building an experimental aircraft.

Even so, this story is great and I can't imagine how anyone could not want Nat to succeed or understand his position. The \\"white woman infatuation\\" charge is ridiculous in my opinion. Nat lived in the house and was treated as an equal, the woman was kind and beautiful, it would be racist to think that Nat shouldn't be attracted to her or worthy of her love.

The fact that many Confederate apologists want the names of Turners \\"victims\\" put onto a memorial monument sails close to this joke of a book. A memorial with the names of very black man, woman child killed during slavery in the US would be closer to the truth.

I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union! As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife. William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity. Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surely It Was Like This","review":"If a novel like Jakes' North And South showed an unrealistic picture of the old south, then this book is its antidote. Slavery and daily life in pre-Civil War times as it surely must have been. Telling his life story as he spends his final days in a Virginia prison waiting to be hanged, Nat Turner reveals to us his secrets and the nature of his mission from God, to free the black race and punish the sins of the white man. Because its violence is kept contained until one final moment at the book's end, it seemed more shocking and visceral to me than tales of mega-death and mayhem so common in other books that chronicle bloodshed and uprising.

It's notable mainly for the marathon 13-minute version of Roberta Flack's 1974 hit, \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\" (written by Eugene McDaniel), which was also released as a single in 1978. Track listing:1. Use Me2. I'm Gonna Have To Tell Her3. The Ten Commandments of Love4. Feel Like Makin' Love5. Hobosac and MeThe CD has four of the five tracks from the original LP, substituting the previously unreleased instrumental \\"Hobosac and Me\\" for \\"Good Love 6-9969.\\" \\"Use Me,\\" of course, is a Bill Withers song, and \\"Ten Commandments\\" is the old Moonglows doo wop classic.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I ordered a NAS drive from CompUSA.

Their customer service was awful I was on hold for 90 minutes trying to get a refund and still got the run-around. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM.

And could they have had the kids singing the songs?! Like that Fizzy song was pathetic! We found a kid who could sing that song better in our school, so in the entire world of kids who speak english, can't they find anyone?! And the bugsy malone song?! A guy singing, \\"everybody wants that man\\" Now that's just plain wrong! Okay a song that goes, \\"He's a sinner, candy coated...\\" is meant for girls to sing for God's sakes!The directors of our play made us watch this movie, and I was so close to jumping out the window so I wouldn't have to watch the movie anymore!

I ordered it as a gift for my kids so I went ahead & watched most of it, and it is as fun as I remember it from my childhood. There are a few dubious intro sequences - for the Dolby sound and perhaps the production company - that made me nervous, but then it went straight to the movie. There was no menu screen to start.I did go to the main menu to verify that it was what I would expect, and it also has Chinese characters along with the English menu selections. Nothing special. Nothing disruptive.The only thing that kept me from giving a 5-star rating is that a hard-core acoustics person (aka: husbands) will probably find the sound to be slightly tin-y. Perhaps, if we had a better stero system the sound would be fuller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Kid Movie","review":"Growing up this was a movie I looked forward to seeing again and again.

We were 7 years old and it was the greatest thing we'd ever seen. A film where all the sets were kid size. Where every detail was thought about. A film for us, with great acting and great music and real costumes. It's a shame that they don't make real films with real budgets for children anymore. Less music video and more plot would be great, and I say this while writing a review about a musical. This is a great film that the whole family can enjoy and that doesn't talk down to kids. It's a classic. Jodie Foster is her usual great self, and it's the best moment in Scott Baio's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh the Memories","review":"I recently purchased the DVD from eBay. It is from China, but it is universally coded for all DVD players. I used to go to the Saturday afternoon cinema back in the late 70's and Bugsy Malone was one of the enduring favorites. This is probably the best acting performance by Scott Baio, this after having viewed Zapped a few times. I love the songs, and even when I saw the movie for the first time in I don't know how long, I remembered a majority of the words. So it did leave a lasting impression on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Students love this movie!","review":"I first saw this movie when I was very young. My younger brother and I absolutely adored it, and we watched it quite often. Now, I am a music teacher for children between the ages of 12 and 18 -- I started out showing the movie each year for a holiday treat, but because the students were so positively responsive to it, I am now using it as a teaching tool in my general music classes. The humor behind the cars, dough-guns and \\"adult world\\" does a great job of masking the fact that this movie is, in fact, a MUSICAL! Some of my students are in my class for several years, and when it's time for me to get this movie out again, they really do get quite excited. Bugsy Malone is great entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable Movie","review":"Totally cute, all actors around the age of 12, scott baio is at his prime, it's easy to see why jodie foster becomes so big later in life, cute songs, extremly well done for a childrens musical but great entertainment for all-A must see for drama majors"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see!!!!!!","review":"This is a wonderful musical that is well acted and well written.

I say, put \\"Bugsy Malone\\" back in theaters. It's miles better than most of the crappy kids fare out these days.

First, I was captivated by an ALL KID CAST. Gangsters in kid powered cars (God, how I wanted one!!) and the guns threw PIES. PIES! PIES? What in the world? This was brilliant and every time I got to watch it, I did! It is not for really young kids, but when your just on the edges of puberty and you're too old for Disney fair and too young for PG-13, a movie with kids acting like adults, but still doing kid-like stuff?? What is not to love?? This is a GREAT movie and I recommend it to any kid at about the age of 9 - 12 or an adult who remembers it from the past...like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Classic","review":"This is one the whole family will love!

The songs were as catchy and melodic as ever. In fact I remembered most of them and was able to sing along. My husband had never seen it and didn't enjoy it as much as I did but he did like the music numbers. The acting is not the best child acting you will ever see but Jodie Foster is wonderful and so are the male leads. I guess what I liked most about this movie is that it is an all kid cast, and the innovations that the movie uses to make this pre-teen world realistic are very clever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Jodie, here comes Florrie Dugger the REAL star!!","review":"hi everyone, i am a 13yr old girl, and i love bugsy malone - its my fave musical. i have acted in it several times with my performing arts academy in England, and i was the role of Blousey. To be honest,in this brilliant video, i feel really strongly that florrie Dugger was way betta than jodie foster! jodie is a so called star and the best in the show - well i totally disagree and i think florrie shows much more of a personality and better acting skills. She is very undercredited, and i think more people should open their eyes to her amazing drama skills. She was the best in the video - by a long shot! I may be biased cos i am her number one fan, but truthfully, i think jodie is nothing compared to the superb stage presence of miss dugger. this video is amazing, and florrie rules the whole thing with her great acting. this video is a must have for a gd night in of messy fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon sent me a foreign DVD - NOT what I ordered!","review":"I ordered this DVD after carefully reading everything.

The characters are a large cast of furry monsters in search of a way to Sesame Steet. The book focuses on describing the monsters (fat and thin, red and blue, old and young) and how they travel to Sesame Street (walking, flying). No deep messages here, but our 16 month old loves it and, perhaps as important, it is a book we enjoy reading to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album lives up to the first one Fantastic vol.2","review":"I realy like this album.

Slum Village realized this and collaborated with a man who seems to be on everything right now, Kayne West. With their first single \\"Selfish\\", they seem to have found the perfect formula for success. I swear I can sing the hook of that song for hours. Now hearing their first single I expected to be treated to some of the same...however, I came to like only a few other songs. If you have a Cd Burner and a good downloading program, just get the selfish song and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second best effort by Slum Vil","review":"I've been waiting for this album for a bit now after being slightly disappointed with Trinity. I guess I was hoping for another Fantastic Volume 2 when I heard Trinity. That being said I wasn't expecting anything great this album, good but not great. I was surprised though these new producers BR Gunna sometimes remind me of Jay Dee. This album has highs and lows but it is definitely better than Trinity. The lyrics keep on improving and the beats are solid. I'm disappointed Baatin is not with the group anymore but hopefully there will be a \\"reunion\\" of the fab four. The Jay Dee produced \\"Do You\\", \\"Dirty\\" with Dirt McGirt, \\"Selfish\\" with Kanye, \\"Things We Do\\", \\"Count the Ways\\" with Dwele, and \\"Reunion\\" with Jay Dee are the high points in the album. Overall pretty good effort by the duo."},{"rating":"1","title":"about a 2-to a 2.5","review":"Slum Village always has a track or two that I can get with&then I'm stuck with so-so to forgetable cuts there after.this Album has good Production but the writing ain't happening&that is my biggest knock here.\\"Selfish\\" is one of those Cuts when they drop a Greatest Hits set that I will Rock this time of the year for it's laid back feel&vibe.much like with \\"Tainted\\".\\"The Hours\\" is a cool rack.but to me they have a singles Act written all over them&nothing wrong with that at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This box is composed of 4 base sheets of designed cards, 4 frames and 4 sheets of plenty of stickers.

There was no preaching, just pure tasteless comedy at its finest. Also, whoever is responsible for casting the actors to play the Bundy family is a genius. I cannot picture anyone else playing those characters. The only down side was the way the Fox Network cancelled the show after all those years. The actors weren't even given the courtesy of a proper sendoff. Ed O'Neil found out the show was cancelled by a couple of honeymooning fans in a hotel parking lot. To his credit, he was decent enough to bring them into the hotel bar and buy them a drink. He's a class guy who did a wonderful job playing the role of a no class guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"The set was complete. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The only thing that I don't like is the way that the discs are housed. They are split between two spindles. This makes it kinda hard to get the discs out. I was expecting them to be separated.

It comes with all the DVDs and no other information to help guide the viewer though. That's one criticism where I felt that if I didn't have it on my other collection, I would be lost looking for a specific episode.If you do plan to purchase this DVD series, you will get it an affordable price but the packaging needs to include information regarding episodes and specials. Still it's a fabulous gift for the Married with Children fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy Nostalgia at its best.","review":"This is one of the best Comedy Series of the past. The price was perfect for the whole Series. Picture quality was a little grainy but it does not take away from the comedy effect of each episode. I just used an empty CD/CVD spiral case to put each DVD in upside down after I watched it. The first night I got the Married with Children Package I was up until 3AM in the morning watching the first two seasons.

But he was just getting warmed up, tossing aside the \\"book\\" that he helped write, creating this incredibly innovative and beautiful masterpiece. At the time this came out, you couldn't have paid me to listen to Burt Bacharach (sorry, Dionne) or Jimmy Webb (Glenn Campbell! ). But Mr. Hayes' unique mix of laid-back tempo, lush string arrangements, funky rhythm section, and smokey vocals, turned those tunes into something unforgetable. This is one of those rare albums that showed a new path of ever-expanding possibilities. And, as mentioned by some of the other reviewers, it is a damn fine make-out jam."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recommend this cd for any Isaac Hayes fan or fan of early funk","review":"I first heard this song as a little girl on my Dad's stereo system and instantly fell in love with the funky groove of the music.

It randomly reports its 'findings', even when using the same sample being tested. The fault may be with the included pH electrode (and sealed solution), which you have no way of knowing the condition or age of, because it's not packaged separately or appropriately for sensitive electronics.

When we sold our house, we had to tell the realtors who told us many of the people looking at our house also thought we had stained glass windows until they got up close to them. In our new house, we used the film we just got on our shower door. WOW!! It instantly classes up the shower door to give it that arts & crafts FLW look.

Ha ha. When I chose the book the teacher read a quote by Mark Twain criticising it ALOUD in class.

It is very seldom that I won't finish a book, even one I don't like, but I just can't get through this one.For the first 200 pages, the characters are shallow and uninteresting. The women are gentle and reserved and know their places, and the men are violent and love to shoot things.

But what surprised me is how poor the novel by James Fenimore Cooper is. Two-dimensional characterisation (eg Duncan Heyward - gallant hero?) worsens a tale which seems to lack any proper structure apart from shoving in as many scenes of fighting and dramatic escape as possible. There are positive elements, such as the cunning but subtle personage of Magua and the basic premise of battles in the forested wilderness of North America. Perhaps that is why the recent film version is so much better - it takes all the good parts of the book, adds some new ideas and mixes them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"An almost complete waste of paper","review":"This book not only made me groan every time I picked it up, but discouraged me from reading other books by the same author. For anybody reading this and saying that I am wrong, I disagree. The Last of the Mohicans was not a book I would recommend, especially because of all the confusing characters , sights, and places.

You can't figure out what it is saying unless you cross your eyes. If you like to read books at night to make you go to sleep this one is ideal.

The actions of the English characters are sometimes incomprehensible and the females are of course particularly helpless. Somehow when I read other period literature I can relate a woman's actions to the society of her time, but I couldn't do that here.

I was very excited to read it at first, because i loved watching those old cowboy movies as a little kid. After about the first 100 pages I realized the challenge that faced me, getting through the long gaps between the good parts. I do hope some day to even finish the darn thing (it's nearly 400 pages long, I'm on page 102). I did give it two stars because the action scenes are so well written. If your thinking about reading this for fun don't bother, the movie is much better, or so I hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"the last of the mohicans","review":"The Last of the Mohicans by J.Fenimore cooper. This book is a novel about a Native American tribe called the mohicans and their dying population. I didnt like this book at all. It wasn't that exciting, there wasn't that much fighting, and it never really grabed my attention. The plot never really appeared in the book untill a 1/3 of the way in. this book is like me because the Mohicans fought for what they belived in. i'd relate this book to the Cherokee Indians becaus they were forced out of their homes in the east coast and ended the trail in Oklahoma. In the Last of the Mohicans the Mohicans fought for their land and to survive. I would recommed this book to people who like history and peace between humans. I would also like to recommend this book to people who like Native American stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third grader characterization","review":"This was the most awful book that I have ever read. The characterization in the book is lousy. I saw the movie and thought it was great. So, after seeing the movie, i decided to pick up the book. The movie has very little to do with the book. You never get a chance to really\\"feel\\" the characters. Hawkeye, a main character in the movie, is seen in the book as only a small part. There is no vivd description to translate the action taking place. This book was awful, and I urge anyone thinking of reading it to avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its boring and confusing, don't read it","review":"This is one of the worst books I ever read (excluding The Call of the Wild and The Bridge of San Luis Rey) but I have to read it for summer reading since I'm going into honors english next year. I think it is boring. I once heard from someone that if your mind starts to wander after the first few pages, you should stop reading it. Trust me, your mind will start to wander after the first sentence .ALthough, I must admit there were a few intresting parts that did keep my attention-but not for very long.

It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another review","review":"For those who didn't like the novel, you should look for a very old and humorous review of Cooper's work by none other than Mark Twain. I found it surprisingly in the preface pages of another paperback I own by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"There aren\`t many differences between Cooper\`s tales","review":"Cooper\`s tales are similar. Two women, Indians and bad or good white men. In every story one of the important characters die. (Chingachgok, Unkas) There is always action, but at the end it gets boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last of the Mohicans","review":"This was a very intertaining book. I love reading it. Just good all around product. I have read it several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Should Read","review":"Everyone should read the classis, such as this famous work, and fit in other books as they may have time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant","review":"Cooper's language in this novel is elegant, a product of the era in which it was written. His description of the Native American characters is also a sign of his time. He describes them at times as beautiful creatures amazingly in touch with nature, while at other times making them appear as savages. However, overall I felt the contrast was well done for he also does not always paint a perfect picture of the white settlers. The story has action but it's purpose is not necessarily to exite the reader in that way. It is more character driven and well defines the interaction between characters who come from completely different cultural backgrounds. It does have it's moments of good excitment though. A good book for those who can handle the diction and writing style of the 18th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"While this book deserves some place in history for being an early work of American fiction and it's rich descriptions of early American geography, it is intensely hard to enjoy. The basic plotline is interesting, but the execution and character development is just plain awful. At many points in the book, Cooper just glosses over action leaving a confused reader wondering just what the hell happened and how. The real killer though is the character development. The unidimensional and shallow characters are stereotypes at best, and the women in the novel are written so thin they practically disappear. One might think that Cooper had never actually met a woman before given his portrayal. The book does have points to recommend it from a historical or geographical basis, but if anyone is actually looking for a good book to read, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Hard to Read, but in the end, Worth the Effort","review":"I had a sort of love/hate relationship with this book. Cooper's writing style is so difficult to read and there were many times that I would read and reread sections and still have no idea what Cooper was trying to say. However, I was basically able to follow the plot, and even though the book is way too long, the story is really good.I saw the movie with Daniel Day-Lewis and was completely disgusted. Cooper's book deserved so much better than it got in that movie. I can understand the movie-makers wanting to have Hawkeye be a hunky young man instead of a middle-aged man who has a tendency to talk all the time, but come on, couldn't they have stayed more true to the basic plot of the book than they did? All that crap about the Colonial Militia and Hawkeye being imprisoned for helping some of the colonists escape the fort was just irritating and stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I officially hate this book!","review":"I, also, must second Mark Twain.

The descriptions were ALWAYS needlessly long, the conversations ALWAYS needlessly long, the... blah, blah, blah, blah. That's what the whole thing was. Blah. The whole plot could have been totally condensed to a hecka short 200 pg novel and it would have been a million times better! Maybe even good! And I like long books!This book is terrible.

Works for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You know our form?\\"","review":"One of the things I liked about the movie _Alien_ that its sequels didn't have was a sense of claustrophobia -- the hero couldn't just run away. It was stand up and defend yourself or be eaten. This episode of _Doctor Who,_ a perennial favorite of me and all my friends, is able to boast superiority even to that classic movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Baker as \\"DOCTOR WHO\\" in a classic chiller/thriller!","review":"THE HORROR OF FANG ROCK is one of the most under-rated episodes of the DOCTOR WHO series and may be considered one of the most violent stories from the Tom Baker era, but remains, in my opinion, a classic thriller straight out of Agatha Christie's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE as Tom Baker's \\"The Doctor\\" and Louise Jamison's \\"Leela\\" arrive at a lonely lighthouse off the coast of England in the early 1900's and get caught up in a chilling hunt for a mysterious killer where there may be no escape for anyone! The emphasis in this four-part story is on the characters, the claustrophic setting inside the lighthouse and the taut pacing of the story, and perhaps this story should not have been used to start off the 15th season of DOCTOR WHO, but is one of the best of the \\"history\\"-setting stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Dr. Who episode","review":"This was another episode that only Tom Baker could have done when compared to the previous and future doctor. The story line is dark and meant to be scary like many other Doctor Who episodes, but it really wasn't. The acting was good and the story was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH! The Bore Of Fang Rock!","review":"I have every available episode of Doctor Who on DVD. It should have been called the BORE of Fang Rock. This episode is like torture to watch. If I was to show someone that has never seen Doctor Who, this would be one i would HIDE! Just my opinion, It was SOOO SLLOOWW!! not much action. Some people really enjoyed it, but I guess I like a bit more action."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Doctor Who shows ever!","review":"As a beginning Dr. Who fan back in the late 1980's I was already hooked but this was the show that reeled me in. The Horror of Fang Rock is easily one of the best shows not only of Dr. Who but also in science fiction history. The Doctor arrives with his companion Leela near a lighthouse. Unknown to the inhabitants there is an unearthly creature lurking about determined to destroy all life on Earth. It is up to the Doctor to save the day!Clearly special effects were never Dr. Who's strong point and they certainly are not here in this episode as well but who needs them when a story is so well-written and as wonderfully acted as this episode is? I certainly plan on buying this dvd even though I already own the VHS copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jr. High","review":"This is the worse rap album I've heard in a long time.

There are plenty of books written by former CIA operatives that explains their work in depth, and they are more interesting.For politics junkies and fellow Washingtonians who charge through nevertheless, I'd recommend skipping the last few chapters altogether and reading Steve Coll's Ghost Wars instead. It's more intelligent and better researched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias","review":"This is not a history book. This work drips with political taint; by that I mean that the author has a view in mind and sets out to persuade you the reader of that view, ignoring or minimizing events and information that might lead you to a different conclusion. As an intelligence professional, I couldn't stomach it past the first hundred pages.If you read only this book about the CIA, you will believe it to be a corrupt and ineffective apparatus of clumsy power. While a popular view, it's not correct. But if you already believe that the CIA is a bastion of evil stupidity, prepare to have your belief system validated.It gets two stars because it does actually include correct facts; it's missing three because they are only select facts, separated by manipulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed review","review":"This is strange.

However, according to the labels on the pillows, they are precisely the same model. I guess this is consistent with other reviews: some people describe it as very soft and others as very hard.

Yup -- he dies because he failed to secure those peanut-butter sandwiches.

She was halfway through the book when I realized what it was about. I am upset with myself that I have not been more diligent to look at what she is reading. While well-written, honest, and thought-provoking this book has graphic scenes of rape and murder that even many adults would find troubling. There are also several references that the US Gov't had trained, armed, and basically knew but did nothing about these genocides and of American citizens one quote is \\"Most Americans don't know what their government does. Most don't want to know.\\" I do believe that as citizens of a free & priviledged country we have a responsibility to find out about and try to right wrongs - however not all Americans are this callous.

Not giving up, I buy Injoy, which was a little too close to the 80s era of electronic, cheese ball funk. Realizing I'd over shot, I jumped back to an older album, Do You See What I See? which was good, but more rock than funk. Pretty much giving up I throw this album on my wish list and get it for Christmas. I didn't even decide to listen to it till just a couple weeks ago. However, it's been in constant rotation since. This is super stanky, can't-stop-movin-ur-shoulders pure funk at it's best. With the exception of one track, it's a near perfect funk album. If you're looking for The Bar-Kays at their funky finest, this is where to start.

I have an extensive collection of Faulkner's novels in hardcover. (The Library of America series volumes, for example, are elegantly made, carefully edited, and affordable.) Curiously, a well-made,hardbound copy of Faulkner's collected short stories is hard to come by, so I hopefully ordered this edition. It's a total disappointment. While it is, technically speaking, \\"hardcover,\\" it is flimsy and cheaply done. The pages are poorly reproduced and the paper is only a baby step above newsprint, while the binding is so feeble, it barely survived the unpacking.

I say for better or worse, because some people can be greatly turned off by his novels, and the difficulty in reading them. While I've been greatly critical of him in the past, I'm still trying to learn and understand his modus operandi.

I would recommend Turner, Turner, Turner: The King of Network Marketing, Con Man or Saint or The Unstoppable Glenn Turner for more accurate information on the subject of this book.

According to author Rudy Maxa, the founder and CEO Glenn W. Turner cheated thousands out of $44 million+ with an apparent illegal pyramid scheme called DARE TO BE GREAT.Judging by the reviews here, Turner apparently had a lot of fans and supporters.

A PI single handedly breaks a case while smoking, drinking and making wise cracks. Frank himself is always a joy. However, what makes this a five star film is Deanna Lund. It was one of her biggest roles as a beautiful young starlet and was actually to be her last hurrah before returning to Florida as a businesswoman. However, Irwin Allen saw the rushes and knew that Deanna was the perfect Valerie for Land of the Giants and the rest is history. Her one scene steals the film and Frank was definitely impressed, but that's another story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended.","review":"When my original Nvidea video card (the one that came in the computer)went bad, I replaced it with a ATI video card.

The stock Ford parts are underbuilt and breakage-prone weak points. The Moog parts are, by contrast, very heavily overbuilt, have grease fittings and a strong metal-on-metal design that can't (by design) fail in the way Fords do. The ability to be greased (if used, of course) keeps the wear, and subsequent noise, factor to a minimum. Also, the Moog end links have wrench flats at the stud base to simplify torqueing the nuts properly. The flats do need a thin-jawed wrench (a regular open end or combination wrench, not a Crescent wrench), but are an otherwise fine feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better","review":"Got these for my 2005 Focus, to replace the worn originals.

It's a two handed process, which we all know is wonderful when you're cooking, with flour all over you. I NEVER use it.So, basically, I have an $11.00 digital clock right next to my oven's digital clock. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Just A Terrible Timer","review":"To start, the on-off button is on a hair-trigger. I tend to carry the timer around with me because the alarm is not very loud. But no matter how carefully I try to handle it, I cannot count the times I have accidentally turned it off. Equally numerous are the times I have accidentally turned it on, discovering later it has needlessly wasted its battery by counting as high as it can go.Further, the fact that it starts counting up when it has finished counting down may be useful to some. However this makes it very easy to confuse counting-down with counting-up: you think there's some time left when actually it has expired.Worst, by far, is a design flaw that puts the on-off button so low on the housing that pushing it dislodges the magnetic attachment and knocks the thing to the floor. Where it breaks. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can hardly hear the alarm.","review":"The alarm is not loud at all, can hardly hear it.The alarm is not loud at all, can hardly hear it.The alarm is not loud at all, can hardly hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Timer!","review":"This is a great timer and does one thing well - time things. It counts down from a min:sec you set with M/S buttons. Start/Stop with one button, reset by hitting M/S buttons together. After finished timing, reverts to last set time. Nice loud beeping. And counts backwards to show how long it's been since the alarm went off (t-minus time) til you hit the stop button.Sturdy fold-out stand, clever fold-out loop (for hook on wall), but a weak magnet.Get this if you want a reliable kitchen timer with no extra buttons or hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 1 day....","review":"I used this three times, and then it stopped working.

In fact, in only a few weeks the magnet has started falling off the unit regularly.The next issue is that the timer does not easily reset (by holding minute and second simultaneously) to the set time. For example, if you set the timer to 25 minutes, and you want to reset the timer to 25 minutes while it is counting, you must reset the timer to 00 first and then hold the minute button as it increments. This is annoying when you always want the timer to countdown from a set interval. This can be an issue if you are wanting to this timer for establishing studying habits, such as with the Pomodoro technique.The final issue is that the timer doesn't ever turn off. However, it's been several months and I've not had to touch the battery, so perhaps that isn't really an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numbers disappear due to humidity","review":"Pros: I find the numbers easy to read; the alarm is sufficiently loud to hear about 30 ft away; easy to set.Con: Numbers disappear apparently due to humidity.I received this timer about a month ago. Numbers were visible for the first few days. Then part of the numbers disappeared and it became impossible to set the time. After a week or so, the numbers came back when the %humidity dropped into the 40's. Once humidity moved up into the 50's, the numbers partially disappeared again.My recommendation is to buy a timer other than this CDN which is a piece of junk. I found a Taylor timer which is difficult to set but that also works as a clock and is quite reliable regardless of the humidity. Later I found a Lux Minute Minder which is excellent. All the nice features of the CDN AND the numbers are readable regardless of the humidity (lately we've had 80% humidity for several days.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Homework!","review":"I bought this for my son to time his reading homework (read 30 min per day).

It suddenly started malfunctioning and then stopped working altogether. I took it apart, and found a wire that had come unmoored from the circuit board. I've seen some cheap circuit boards, but this one took the cake: it was wafer-thin and flimsy-looking. I re-soldered the wire the gauge of which was about as thick as a human hair, barely an exaggeration! The unit functioned for a year or so after the repair before it began to go off spontaneously and all digits would intermittently display \\"8888\\", so I popped the battery and trashed it.

Normally, I put self-improvement books down halfway through, as they don't hold my interest. I read Jeanne's book from cover to cover.

It was completed one year before the author's death in 1964, but was not published until 1970. Framed as a novel, and written with great tenderness, \\"Forever Flowing\\" is primarily a history of the horrors of the Soviet state before, during, and after its Stalinist phase. Grossman's chapters recounting the huge famine of 1932, which was a government-enforced starvation of millions, particularly in the Ukraine, are matchlessly brilliant and profoundly moving. The entire novel is a tribute to human freedom. It also reflects the great courage of its author. In my opinion, \\"Forever Flowing\\" will become more widely read as time passes, and will become increasingly recognized as one of the greatest books of the 20th century. It is a true classic. The lucid translation by Thomas P. Whitney is excellent. Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic reminder of the Soviet system","review":"As in his more famous \\"Life and Fate,\\" Grossman does a brilliant job getting into the minds of a variety of Soviet characters who are forced to deal with Stalin's brutal system and its aftermath. It is enlightening for those of us in the West to realize that, unlike the Germans after the fall of Hitler, the Russian people never had \\"closure\\" with their even bloodier past. Grossman shows us the thinking, not only of the released prisoners of the gulag, but the soul-searching of the men and women who denounced them or who merely stood by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"This book does not teach how to make the letters.

The author touches upon many useless topics to the new dog owner and seemingly knows little about the dog's ancestry.Furthermore, the author advocates for positive-reinforcement training only while advising extreme caution against any type of negative reinforcement. This failure to recognize an important training technique for say, barking problems, illustrates this particular author's failure to address the basic dog owner's needs.I found this book to be condescending at best and in most instances a poor reference.

Here, a man arrives to Helsinki by train from the interior of Finland, and is soon beaten senselessly by some thugs in a public park. He wakes up at the hospital, with bandages round his head (a homage to James Whale's version of The Invisible Man, as some critics suggested?) and with a case of complete amnesia. He is soon called M (another homage to a 30s movie?). He goes on to live in a ramshackle house on the outskirts of Helsinki (I didn't know there was such poverty in rich Finland), working at odd jobs, meeting quirky people and trying to slowly remember his past. Among the friends he makes is a woman working for the Salvation Army (Kaurismaki's regular Kati Outinen, showing here a bit of age). The movie has a lot of the mannerisms of Kaurismaki's movies, but also its humanism. It is quirky, but compelling.

This is a joyless production with none of the zip, humor and heart foundin many other Sesame Street videos and DVD's. The songs are just not good - Charles Durning mumbles a boring little number and Harvey Fierstein's \\"musical\\" number seems as if it was written five minutes before taping. Their is just no quality to any of this. The rest of the characters on Sesame Street becomes depressed because every day is Christmas and they cannot get on with the lives. I'm afraid their feelings are contagious. Buy Elmo in Grouchland - lots of story, good songs, humor and very cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"dismal","review":"This strangely dispiriting holiday special is among the worst of the elmo videos available.

Our daughter has had no problem sitting through this video and she enjoyed every minute of it. Granted, she is a big Elmo fan, but the story and the songs are so nicely blended that we all have enjoyed the movie--at least for the first 100 times we've watched it now. So but what I really like about it is that it's a new story for Christmas. It seems like the same Xmas stories are rehashed over and over again. But this story is new. And it helped our daughter to understand that Christmas is a special time of the year. And that message is reinforced with a couple of sweet new holiday songs. So I say, if you're looking for something new and different give this one a try. And, don't worry, we haven't lost a snow-globe yet. Sheesh. And yes, Durning is a Great Santa.

Aside from being British and mellow, emotional music, there really isn't much in common musically aside from Gravity that takes off the signature Coldplay guitar crunch (and coincidently was co-written by Chris Martin). With the multiple layered music and danceable tracks, The Stone Roses might be a better comparison.On their latest album, Out of Nothing, Embrace shine whenever they go for the layered vocals/choral approach to songs such as Ashes and Someday. The added layers give a sense of grandeur that seem to be missing from today's pop landscape. The slower songs, such as the title track, do bring down the album a little bit as they don't pull these types of songs off like Coldplay. Luckily, most of these songs do change tempos to make the songs better.Best Song - Ashes"},{"rating":"2","title":"more great brit rock...","review":"Recently I've been getting into UK artists such as Coldplay, Keane, and Aqualung.

I was rappeling not too long ago using the prusik to make me safe like they do on the cover of the book. The prusik tightened onto the rope just at the end of my reach, and I was hanging from the one loop around my leg. It was really uncomfortable and it took me a long time to get free.

A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is","review":"Well, I don't agree at all with the previous review. There are some good tracks on this CD, and there are some bad ones. But as far as songs like \\"Starry Eyed Surprise\\" & \\"Ready Steady Go\\" they do leave something of a lasting impression on the listener.I'm a local DJ in MN, and I have seen the crowd response to Starry, and watched people sing/mouth along to it in the bars.It is (as far as I know and have read) his first attempt at creating his own songs, as opposed to spinning and remixing everybody elses songs.

It is worth having in your collection, and it will catch your mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I have listened to all of Oakenfols live and released music.this is by far in the top 3 of his works.I like the more mainstream feel , some songs have similar beats to swordfish though.I also recognized the reuqiem for a dream bit in Zoo York.Actually in fact he is using mozarts lux aterna bit, which Clint Mansell used as well.The director of Requiem for a dream does some of the visuals for Oakenfolds concerts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"I have been a Oakenfold fan for many years now and was quite disappointed with the Bunka album. Like many others I was drawn in by Stary Eyed Suprise, and Ready Steady Go, yet the rest of the album is total .... Oakenfold is arguably a musical genius, producing bands like U2, and discovering numerous electronic music artists with his Perfecto label. Bunka is essentially Oakenfolds sell out album, going directly for mass pop appeal by sacrificing artisic integrity, and possilby his former fan base. My advise is this: don't buy the album, download tracks 1, 2, and 8, and buy his Tranceport album (probably his best)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definatly not oakenfold","review":"I guess if you've heard his stuff on the radio from this cd and you like it, it'll probably be the only one that you do like that the man has put out.

I've always respected Paul's career from his roots in hip-hop to his expierments in ambient and his funky drum&bass excursions. His work in trance maybe where he gained his most noterity, but it's by no means his home.I won't buy this album because it's just not good music. I've heard almost every track and with the exception of the single, none of it's interesting. You'll find that every major reviewer in every important music magazine will agree.Its not really a dissapointment. Nobody expected a great artits album from this guy. He may have the pedigree. But an artits album, especially in electronica (and all its sub-genres), is a difficult monster to pull off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oakenfold has lost his unique touch!","review":"I feel that Oakenfold's, \\"Bunkka\\" does not even compare to his old albums. His new \\"style\\" that he exhibits in this album will leave old fans of Oakey disappointed... Although this album has big names, such as: Nelly Fertado and Ice Cube, this album does not measure up to his old masterpieces. Trance fans will most likely be unimpressed with this album because it has a techno-pop routine that repeats itself throughout the whole album. I suggest buying tranceport if you want to hear the real Oakenfold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good one...","review":"I would not recommend those who like PA to purchase this CD.

But for a true UK trance DJ....pop??? Oakenfold breaks loose of the traditional trance euphoria previously released in such titles as 'tranceport' or the 007 global underground series, and takes on a new twist. Mixing wack beats with funky lyrics, he manages to spit out a new sound, but I didnt go for it. I would reccomend anyone to pass on this item. If youre looking to hear some of oakenfolds best stuff, I'd reccomend 'Planet Perfect presents another world.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Debunk this load of bunkka.","review":"This album is bunk! The great Oakie has fallen down the slippery slope that consumed Moby et. al. I give it 2 stars because of the great opening track, then the album goes down and down into the abyss of sell-out from there.I saw his bunk tour in Detroit, it was cool until he put his decks away and some guy came out on stage with an electric guitar and tried to play live techno on it. Needless to say there was no vibe at the event.There's still hope for Oakie. Everyone is entitled to a mistake every now and then, but if he repeats this error with another sellout album, we'll have to pass the heavyweight champion title to a new DJ."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, terrible, terrible...","review":"The biggest load of cr**p I've heard in years.

I've had the pleasure of experiencing his magic at the clubs. His remixes are without a doubt the BEST in the trance/house music world. But this album has totally abandoned all of what has made Oakenfold a club scene icon.This album is AWEFUL. Period. My jaw dropped as I listened to each track. Instead of an exciting journey of house trance, I was dragged through a mix of pop rap that was totally laughable.Please Mr. Oakenfold, go back to your original style of music!! There is nothing on this album that even warrants a single beat on the dance floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-awful album","review":"This is a really, really poor album. I consider myself an Oakenfold fan in general, and was pretty excited about his first original-composition work. I was not shocked to find the album was designed to have pop-appeal-- what shocked me was how cheaply this was done. Only one or two tracks rank at \\"listenable\\" status in my opinion, and this is not enough to merit buying the album. There is just no artistic talent here. The \\"all-star cast\\" only adds insult to injury, because it is obvious that the album is just a big commercial promotion of the kind you expect from an \\"artist\\" who just wants to \\"cash in.\\" For fun pop-electronic done well, try BT's \\"Movement in Still Life\\" and steer clear of this stinker. I wouldn't take it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Out","review":"Usually I do not review audio CD's but with this extremely disappointing I feel compelled to put in my two words \\"Sell Out\\". That is how I view this new album Paul has deviated from his techno-trance mixes to attempt a fusion with rock, hip-hop and pop music. In all this new mix breed of music was just too awful and painful to the ear. You have lost my vote Paul; I will be very cautious in blindly picking up your next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut","review":"I friend bought this CD for me because he knew that I enjoyed the handful of Oakenfold songs I had heard over the years. I did not listen to thid CD with much of any expectations based off of Oakenfold's previous work, so I can't say that I feel cheated compared to his past works. There are only a few CDs that I own where I can say I like every song, and this has been added to that small collection. Each song is different, yet has the Oakenfold imprint. I highly recommend this CD for those who are not looking to hear the usual trance from Oakenfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely sold out","review":"Oakenfold sold out more and more year after year. This album is even worst than I could have Imagined. He has totally moved away from trance and into the pop world. This album has absolutely nothing to do with modern electronic dance music and should not be confused as such. I think this proves that Oakenfold is all about the dollar and not about the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best !","review":"Not as good as expected.1) If you're a pop/mainstream music lover, you may like this one (doubt it).2) If you're an Oakenfold fan, a techno/trance/electronic music lover, then this one will definitely dissapoint you. NOT FOR YOU !This is an attempt (a mediocre one) of a fantastic DJ to go manistream, and it really fails to do so.Here is my final word. If you like radio music and enjoy some techno, get something else, there is not enough melody here for you. If you are a techno/trance music fan, I am sorry to say that this is not for you either. You're better off getting Oakenfold's TRANCEPORT... There are only two or three decent (OK) tracks here. The rest is garbage...

I didn't have to think twice about buying this cd. When I heard all of the cameos on this cd, I was very mad, (I edited that). I listened to the first track, it was not what I was expecting, when the track switched to the next song, I was confused, I thought where is the mixing? Then I heard the rest of the cd and realized that I had been scammed by Paul Oakenfold. Over time he had impressed me by making flawless cds in the past, then I heard this disgusting waste of plastic and I doubted his mental state. As an avid Oakenfold fan, and a fan of good music I suggest not listening or buying this cd.

So, buyer be aware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bunkkalicious","review":"Of the albums produced by Oakey, this one has definite separation towards producing stand alone tracks aimed at radio play. The previous albums I have in my collection are almost a continuous song throughout that sends a \\"trance message\\" to the listener. This one is more pop oriented, but entertaining none-the-less.Definitely worth picking up, at least 50% of the songs have real creative appeal. The other 50% are a little \\"poppy\\", and it will depend on your tolerance for that style of music. Personally, I can take only moderate doses of it. The trippy, consonant, yet flowing tune Zoo York takes a person into a dreamy, reflective groove, while Get 'Em Up rips you back into a heavy Ice Cube Southern California rap.Overall, the level of creativity and diversity in sound exploration makes this a worthwhile purchase. Keep them coming Paul!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"I was totally surprised at this CD! Oakenfold has been the driving ambition for alot of aspiring techno artist and DJ's.The music has no form to it, and with all these different collaborations of this music makes it even worse. Its like he made this overnight! He's better off with just stickin with producing music, not making it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Held together with glue","review":"Patchy, derivative, unoriginal. How exactly is this an album of original music -- it's sample mania, from sounds to vocals to grooves. He lifts entire pieces from Kronos Quartet, ferchrissake. If cheesy Eurodiva vocals are your thing (I guess he couldn't get Bjork but didn't mind finding someone who imitates her), you'll be in heaven here. In terms of originality and composition it isn't all that much better than stuff being produced by a slew of bedroom musicians across the world using Cubase or ProTools on their PCs. You can hear stuff as good or better on mp3.com any time. On the plus side, it's well produced and he gets decent synth sounds. Oakenfold is enormously popular and not about to go away -- like most bubblegum, when it catches, it's hard to get rid of."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd buy a this CD if","review":"it was re-released with vocals lifted with exception of Southern Sun. I realize Oakey was diverse musical background and perhaps my musical tastes are narrow but this CD was a let down. Another World was not pure trance but I loved it (I love Dead Can Dance and the whole 4AD sound). The vocals on Bunkka just gets in the way of enjoying the music. On electronic music, I generally prefer just ethereal female voices (e.g. any Jan Johnston or McLachlan on Delerium's Silence). Nearly half the Bunkka tracks have rap/hip-hop in it. Puke."},{"rating":"1","title":"destroying his image...","review":"This is a very experimental CD from Oakie in a way similar to Swordfish. I think its a shame because it really seems like he has left his old style behind and now seems to persue a more'pop'y style to his music including famous American artists in his tracks. The Reviews on this CD resume itself to either1 or 5stars (like him or hate him). Like others say DO NOT buy this CD if you are expecting some of Oakie's \\"good\\" work (Perfecto Presents, tranceport)but if you like pop, then do buy it, Oakie still has GREAT talent...this could be called electropop I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stimulating source of information and ideas.","review":"Pattern is here considered not only as a formalised repeating motifin embroidery, but also as embrancing structure, design, composition and elaboration. The book is divided into three main sections. The first is concerned with the nature of fabric, the effect of patterned fabrics and their suitability when used in the techniques of applique, patchwork, raised surfaces, hand and machine embroidery. The second section on threads is divided into two parts. The first deals with drawn fabrics and thread, net darning, needleweaving, blackwork, and canvas stitches; the second with embroidery stitches and the combination of embroidery with print. The third section examines the effect that different grounds have on the print and so on the type and style of the embroidery. Illustrated with over a hundred photographs drawn both from historic and modern sources, the book will be valued as a stimulating source of ideas as well as for its technical information."},{"rating":"2","title":"TIME LOOPS PLUS","review":"This is one of the neatest time loop stories ever.

The lighting and set-ups are pure low budget and I had trouble getting past that and into the concept.Make sure to watch this in Spanish; as bad as the subtitles are, they are masterful next to some of the worst English dubbing I've ever heard.All in all, we were very bored very quickly; this movie has some scenes that are just sheer nothingness posing as suspense, and once you've figured out the main idea, it's all pretty obvious. I've seen dozens of time travel movies and this is easily one of the worst-made.No matter how good your premise is, if the filmmaking is weak the film itself is going to be subpar. Timecrimes is the perfect example of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic attempt at a \\"Movie\\"","review":"Wow. I've seen better 10 minute videos on You Tube. The dialogue via subtitles are from a high school play. It's almost a parody of some very bad sci-fi movies. Below-amateur writing, production, directing and editing. I watched it twice with theatre and then movie production people. We all had a wonderful time- CHORTLE! SNEER! GUFFAW! SNICKER! Even Ernie Fosselius' \\"Hardware Wars\\" was superior to this tripe. Serious students of film will barf at 19.25 minutes.On my list of \\"The 100 Worst Films I've Ever Seen.\\" This is one of those DVD's that you can use as a signaling mirror if you're lost on a deserted island."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Version Has It All","review":"There are different versions out there, this one has it all and is the one you can count on for all the options you should have at your disposal.

(According to me and my family and friends who have seen it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"*Warning* Re Video On Demand","review":"A huge heads up, for those who are considering purchasing the video via on demand.

If that's what you're looking for, then this is the movie for you. I watched it hoping it was along the lines of Denzel Washington's \\"Deja Vu\\". Other than the fact that they are both about time travel, there's nothing else they have in common. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Criminal Waste of My Time","review":"I'm going to heroically be the rehasher of the coldest hash of jokes on this when I say that this film was itself a time crime. I guess that's what makes this some sort of cerebral or intellectual film, that paradox. If you get through this movie, there's a good chance you'll arrive on the other side of it thinking \\"well that was pretty dumb.\\" But then you recall the feature's title, and Whammo! The brilliance of the paradox crushes your brain; you realize that the entire experience was a time crime perpetrated on you. I'm a big fan of epiphanic experience, but I probably wouldn't willingly watch this bad of a movie again even if it promised another epiphany. It was real bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad acting and directing that I couldn't finish viewing it!","review":"I am a time travel movies' fan and have a pretty complete collection (almost 40 movies), but this one isn't going to be in it, unless somebody remakes it. I began seeing it and couldn't stand the bad acting and directing. I seldom don't finish a movie, no matter how bad it is, but this one went beyond bad. From the reviews I have read here, it seems as if it has an interesting plot, but the acting was so bad that I couldn't stand to watch more than 20 minutes of it. That's the longest I could hold the impulse to puke! Spanish is my first language, so I didn't have a language issue. Fortunately I didn't buy it. I wish they remake it so I can enjoy the interesting plot and twists others say it has, because as much as I love the time travel theme, I don't think I can stomach trying to watch this awful version again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure about the movie but quality was really bad.","review":"I wanted to try this service for the first time and this movie was hard to come by anywhere else so I was happy to find it on Amazon. But the quality was pretty poor, not sure if this is how the service is in general.Also it was dubbed to English from Spanish as oppose to being subtitled and that I can't really sit through. It would have been nice if that was communicated before I rented this cause I would have never spent the money on such junk.I still want to see the movie. Hopefully I'll find it somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Time - Pointless plodding plot","review":"The real crime with regard to this film, is the 92 minutes you'll have given up watching it. There is just no movie here. A string of, perhaps sometimes interesting looking but ultimately pointless scenes, leading to a lame, open and arbitrary ending. \\"Held together\\" by some of the worst dialog filmed and even worse pacing.Somewhere along the line there may have been an interesting idea for a movie but in the end.... it's just not there.Characters say and do things for no sound or logical reason other than the script calls for it and their actions are needed to set up the next scene.

I was looking for a flavor add-in after I got hooked on Duncan Donuts Strawberry Shortcake coffee, which is really pricey, if you can find it. This is the wrong product for that application. If I had any intention of making snow cones, it might warrant space on my shelf, but unless it turns out to play nicely in baked goods (I'm not sure I want to risk having to throw out batter just to find out), I can't see much reason for keeping it. A more complete description of what the product is intended to do and what it should not be used for would have prevented me from wasting money on it. It's probably too much to hope that the seller will edit the description to make this product reach the right buyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different...but GREAT!","review":"This was a different story line for Roberts, but the great mix of characters make it all worth while. The flash backs and the suspense were excellent. The bond that Tory shared with Hope is undeniable. Never have I read a book that completely shocked me at the end. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing spectacular","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this book - I had the murderer picked in the first 50 pages and found the overall story to be extremely predictable. I thought the characters were too simple; the good were very good and the bad very bad. There was very little depth or complexity to the characters or plot. This was the first Nora Roberts book I've read and it will be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Nora Roberts trend - nasty sexual violence","review":"I have read and enjoyed a few of Nora Roberts books, specifically Inner Harbor. Unfortunately, Carolina Moon is not one of Robert's better efforts. Unfortunately she seems to be moving into a phase where she feels compelled to create plots with explicit sexual violence and murder scenes, and although all the other reviews I have read have been OK with it, haven't even mentioned it in fact, I am not. Nasty rape scenes are definitely not something I want to read fictionalized accounts of for entertainment, and sorry, I don't believe such explicitness is required for plot development. If you are not the type to be bothered by it though, this book is formulaic yet readable and will hold your attention on a airplane."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY WELL-WRITTEN BOOK!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read just about everything Nora Roberts has written and would count this one as one of her best. I loved the relationship between Cade and Tory and the secondary relationship between Faith and Dr. Wade. Nora Roberts knows how to write a mystery and weave in a great love story or two. The characters in this book were likeable and a little quirky. I loved the \\"small town\\" gossip. I would definitely recommend this book. Some of the subject matter in this book is disturbing (child abuse, rape), but central to the character development and plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"How can you tell any of Nora Roberts' single title hardcovers apart? They all have the same stock characters and plots, she only changes the setting: The trampy girl with a heart of gold, the artistic heroine with a disturbing murder in her past, the quirky townsfolk, the bitter martiarch, etc. The story is predictable, as are the romances. Just once I'd like to see Roberts make the hero the killer---but then she wouldn't sell nearly as many books. Disappointing and uninvolving, it's simply a retread of any of her earlier books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the Reef!","review":"This was one of Nora Robert's better recent efforts. Her one fault is that once the abused heroine meets up with Mr. Right and they get together, she never again has any fallout from abuse - and that just would not happen in real life! For what it's worth, I thought the heroine reached out the hero out of a need for affirmation that she was still alive, not out of callousness or insensitivity, although I can understand why that could be interpreted in that way. I really enjoyed the character of Faith in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling.","review":"Excuse me, but wasnt anyone who has read this book as appalled as I was by the fact that the empath-heroine walks herself through the scene of a brutal rape/murder, basically experiencing everything the victim did, and then immediately goes home and has sex with her perfect love interest? Yuck! Until I reached that point, I was genuinely compelled by the book, the choppy writing and the inconsistencies notwithstanding. But that scene was utterly arrogant on Roberts' part. I'm willing to suspend disbelief and lose myself in a romantic fantasy, but it should at least ring A LITTLE BIT true. Am I as a reader supposed to immediately dismiss this perfectly nice girl (who could just as well have been the heroine of another romance) who's been brutally murdered and instead identify with a heroine so callous? Don't insult me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I always buy Nora Roberts books--this one however was a disappointment to me. It seemed choppy and not believable.....and the ending just didn't seem to ring true. It just seemed like she rushed through writing it....I couldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big let down and boring","review":"I really enjoy Nora Roberts books and especially the once she writes under the name of J.D.Robb. Her style is very entertaining and keeps you involved in the story from the beginning till the end. Most of the time you are sorry to see the story come to a end. But this book is a big let down. From the first page on it is very hard to become involved into the story and to remain interested. It is not worth the money. I am sorry to say so. But it is true. It is a bit unrealistic,has some mistakes in it and even though that is not bad, the whole story is absolutely boring.Been there, done that, have read this multiple times before, is the type of feeling you get right away. The end unrealistic and the whole book feels so depressive and totally is not worth your time and not getting any better. I hope her next books are more like herself and her style again. I like changes but this is boring and almost makes you feel as if she didn't spend much time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carolina Moon","review":"One of my favorite novels by Nora Roberts.

And a happy ending too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book for All","review":"This was the first book by Nora Roberts that I have read. Of course, now that I have read it, I plan on reading more of her books.The Story starts off with Tory (Victoria) coming back to her home town Progress to open up a little shop. It is really hard for her because that was the place where her father beat her, and her best friend Hope was murdered. When she arrives, the town starts buzzing with gossip.Once she arrives, Hopes older brother, the dashing Cade Lavelle, falls madly in love with her. But, after a short while, strange things start happening in Progress. There are murders, and other bad misfortunes, that are all somehow connected to Tory.This was a great read. I could not put this book down. It will keep you riveted all the wat up to the very end, with a surprise twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable....","review":"I had never been a big Nora Roberts fan, but after Dance Upon Air & now, Carolina Moon, I consider myself a new member of the club.

Tory needed to grow a spine. Her ability to read people's minds was never really explained. The romantic parts were really quite nauseating.I skipped to the end and found out who the killer was but it just didn't make sense to me.I like Nora Roberts, but this one was quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, Poor, Poor","review":"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan.

Up until the last five pages..my thoughts were she should have left it out or used another character.One of my biggest disappointments of this book was Roberts poor taste in using God's & Jesus' name in vain continuously :( . She could have chosen a numerous amount of words that would emphasize the emotions of her characters.Other than that it was difficult to put the book down! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I thought everything went fine. I had no problems ordering from this person. would do it again definately"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I typically like Nora Roberts books, they are fun, quick, and a little twist at the end. This one just didn't do much for me. I realized I had read over half of the book before anything happened! There were just too many words and not enough story. I never really cared for the characters, none of them were convincing to me. I liked the end and had it figured out long before I got to it, but the book ended so abruptly. It felt like the author had to get a certain number of pages, got there, wrapped it up and got it published."},{"rating":"2","title":"I won't bore you with another synopsis","review":"This is the second book I ever read by the author, and I have to admit it got me hooked on her books and romace novels in general. I thoroughly enjoyed the interactions between the main protaginists, but found the secondary romantic relationships just as compelling. The twists and turns of the suspense will have you turning the pages. Tory may have come back for herself, but in order for her to heal, she soon discovers that she has to solve the mystery of Hope's death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carolina Bore","review":"I hated this book. I guessed \\"whodunit\\" about half-way through. I did not like any of the characters - Tory's repeated proclamations about her independence became tiresome very quickly. I thought Cade was whimpy and Faith's character inconsistent. The remainder of the characters were poorly drawn. I was so bored with the plot that I skimmed the last 20 or so pages just to finish what I started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Story","review":"This was not the book that I thought I could read over a few days. I was so sure I knew who the killer was this time I had to keep reading to see if I was right, but she got me again! Anyone who is the least bit interested in the psychic world, loves a good who dunnit, a love story and all the rest will enjoy this book. Tory is a lot of people in this world who have to learn how to trust again, and Cade was just the guy to help her out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid!","review":"This is the book that got me hooked on Nora's suspense-romances! Before this one, I'd only read her Irish novels, but this one blew the door open on a whole new genre for me to enjoy. Lush descriptions, well developed characters, thoroughly engrossing story! Suspense mixed with a touching romance, a bit of the supernatural (a delightful touch, by the way) adds up to a winner for Nora Roberts! One of my favorites and a definite Keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"child molestation","review":"I didn't finish this book, the depictions of child molestation and murder were too disturbing. If you like the murder mysteries you might like this book, a romance reader probably won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt, Suspenseful, Wonderfully Told Story!","review":"I just finished this book last night, after taking me only over the weekend to read. Throughout the book you can feel the emotions and struggles of the main character, Tory, as she tries to heal after the trials from her childhood. Faced with memories of an awful summer night when she was eight years old, a budding romance with a childhood acquaintance, and the knowledge that events from all those years ago are still ever-present and dangerous, she finds the courage to fight back and hold on to the love of people around her. Filled with moments of sentiment, love, surprise, hate and shock, this book had me mesmerized from page one on. Buy, borrow, or steal this book in order to read it...you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was hoping to finish this book, and respond with 'of course, I should have figured that out!'. But instead, I said 'give me a break'! A good mystery must be mysterious and not easily solved; but it also must all come together in the end. I am sorry, but this one doesn't. She could have chosen anyone of the 20 or so characters and had the same result. Come on Nora, you can do better. I have read previous Nora Roberts books and quite enjoyed them, even if I did figure out the mystery before it was revealed. But this one, I just don't buy! Don't waste your time on it. There are too many really good books out there. Choose wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful story ruined by the narrator!","review":"Nora Roberts is a wonderful author. I cannot believe she allowed this narrator to read her best story yet. She reads in a hurried raspy monotone with no change in voice between characters. I have to keep rewinding to figure out who is talking. Couldn't stand it...bought the book--great book, terrible audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I have to say I was pretty intrigued throughout most of the book, but the ending was horrible. I had so many questions that weren't answered and there was absolutely no logic to the reason Hope died, the other killings and especially why if the killer was bent on \\"killing Hope over and over again\\" that Faith -- who was Hope's identical twin! -- was never in any danger! I was very disappointed in the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I looked forward eagerly after reading 5 star reviews of this book. I was supremely disappointed.The writing does not flow smoothly; it does not capture and hold my interest. The characters are not all that likeable.Nora does write well often, but not in this book. I was plain bored. I would like to see more books such as \\"Divine Evil\\", or \\"Homeport\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the book. Hate the \\"reader\\" in Audio version","review":"Carolina Moon is one of my favourite Nora Roberts books and one I have re-read many times. However, I recently purchased the Unabridged, Audio CD version and it is by far the WORST audio book I have ever listened to. The reader is practically monotone and makes NO effort to provide different voices for the various characters. I could barely make it through the first few chapters before I quit.My recommendation: Read the book, it's fabulous. But DON'T waste your money on the audio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing is great, subject too disturbing","review":"I usually enjoy NR's books, but I found this plot to be too weird and off-the-wall to enjoy. The writing, as always, is top-notch, and it certainly kept my attention, but I don't expect it to be a book I reread often, if ever. There are serial killer plots I've found interesting before, but since what I found interesting about them was the police work behind the search, this didn't provoke the same interest. I was just too disturbed by the plot to be able to appreciate the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Done It Again!","review":"Every time I read a Nora Roberts book I think -- this is the best yet. I've never written a review of a book before but Carolina Moon stayed in my thoughts until the last page was turned. All of the characters came alive and I could feel Tory's emotions. Just when I thought I had figured out \\"who done it\\" someone else came into the picture who could be the one. Mystery and love - what more could you want. I congratulate Nora on another job well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down!","review":"I was expecting this book to be very good because I know that Nora Roberts is a popular romance writer. \\"Carolina Moon\\" was the first book by her that I've read and my expectations were not at all met. It was extremely overdramatic and most of the time I would feel like rolling my eyes. The conversations were much too lengthy and didn't always reveal very much and the characters were too horny. They made it sound more like lust than love. The ending was pretty abrupt and also very unrealistic. DUMB. I'm not reading another Nora Roberts, especially after having read that most of her books are the same plot and characters over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The story starts off promising as Nora Roberts sets the stage for her mystery. However, about halfway through the book the story gets bogged down and becomes predictable. The characters become cookie-cutter, and the story sort of veers off on a couple of tangents.The character of Dwight pops up at seemingly inopportune times in the story, and because Nora draws attention to him by doing that, it kind of gave the story away, in my opinion.I stopped reading the book for a few weeks because I was bored with it, and when I picked it up a few weeks later, the story unfolded just as I suspected.I love Nora's books, but I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Very Boring!","review":"I have read several books by Nora Roberts and have enjoyed them all. I could not even finish this one. I hope her next novel is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Try GHOST MOON if you liked this!","review":"I just finished Karen Robard's GHOST MOON. I didn't even realize their names until I finished the book. What I liked about this one was Roberts goes into detail for every character, unlike Robard who only mentions the killer every once and a while. I loved both of them and if you liked this one try GHOST MOON. They both made me make sure my doors are locked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mystery","review":"Nora Roberts is as talented in suspense as she is in romance. This was a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carolina Moon audio CD","review":"I have both read this book and now listened to the audio CD. The story is compelling and keeps your interest throughout. I found the narrator's voice perfect for a book that takes place in the south and kept picturing Ashley Judd as I listened. The combination of humor, tradgedy and the psychic gifts of the main character keep you interested throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ending is Unbelievable!","review":"The Southern setting of this book was beautiful as was the heroine Tory. I loved the friendship between her and Hope, and I was heart broken by her mother's resentment at the end. It was written so well that I just got lost in it emotionally. I also would've never guessed the murderer. All I can say is \\"Wow...amazing!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"Nora Roberts' blended talents branch into writing romance, mystery, action scenes, etc. and they are all present in this great read. I also loved the feisty 'twin' character who shows how opposite sisters can be as far as personality. There's also a strong portrayal of women as survivors and not just victims. The tension is high, and though I had some ideas, I did not figure out who the killer was until the very end.Chrissy K.

Reading about a killer/child rapist is just not an enjoyable read for me. The main characters Tory, an emotional ill woman and Cade, a spineless mama's boy just became a bland mix.

When trimming your pet's fur, cordless is the only way to go and they will run away.Cons: after long storage you have to charge the battery before use.

I searched the net to find the Eddie Cain CD like crazy for a long time and no luck. So then I kind of forgot about it and came across it unknown months later, i was like DAMN! So i purchased it and WAS NOT disapointed. Lyrics like \\"Drip drop drip drop all up in the parking lot, foggin up the windows seat full of wet spots\\" it's just a must have.

And how many of the suits can be blown to pieces before a war ravaged county runs out?These books grew progressively worse and tiresome, but early on there was a spark; a small spark, but a spark.

You can only control a TV,VCR and Cable. You cannot control Satellite or any other electronics. I ended up buying a \\"6 all in one\\" remote which works well with all my systems. The side switch in he remote to select TV/VCR/Cable is another annoying thing. Otherwise the remote is ok (If you have only a TV|VCR|Cable). This TV has Component Video Input however the S video signal looks much clearer to me than the Component Video Input with my DVD. The tube is a large curvy one comparing to Sony Trinitron.

Bernedette Peters is a much better performer and is a better Witch than Vanesssa Williams, but the supporting characters (Jack, Little Red, Wolf) aren't on the original CD. Jack is basically the same on both CDs. Little Red is less annoying in the revival (YESSS!) and the Wolf is funnier in the revival.The worst performer is Jack's mom. She sounds like Julie Andrews after her vocal tragedy. I think the orginal is funnier, has gusto and does justice to the role. The new mom is discracefull.I didn't care for the narator. I thought he sounded too soft and not old and baggy in \\"No More.\\"I did enjoy Laura Bennenti more than the orginal. But no one can be better than Joanna Gleason as the Baker's Wife.

However, after seeing the revival production twice, I knew this was going to be one step down from the original cast recording, but I had high hopes.Alas, even in the studio, this cast cannot come near to competing with its successor. The only cast members who hold their own are Laura Benanti and Kerry O'Malley, and even then, it's difficult sitting through the other performances.

So I can't really compare the two.Still, I got this soundtrack for my birthday, and I have to say that I'm fairly impressed. I love it so much, but certain things do get on my nerves. It also annoys me, though, when people complain about the different people doing the characters- whenever a play reopens, there are going to be new interpretations of characters. Also, complaining about the people's voices is rather rude, in my opinion, unless you think you could do a better job.Recently some idiot scratched my CD, blanking out the last three songs.

I was also fortunate enough after the show to get Vanessa Williams, Gregg Edelman, Melissa Dye(Rapuzel), Stephen DeRosa, and the two stepsisters autographs.

It is not quite as simple as the fact that he espoused evloution, as a previous review would imply. The Church does not have a problem with evolution. It does, however, have a problem with one of its priests claiming that inanimate matter possesses consciousness.There is no doubting de Chardin's intellect and genius, as well as his mystical tendencies, and it shines through rather well in this book.

I must admit his Jesuit Christianity is hard to reconcile with his worldview of post human futurism, but his collective works are truly worthy of studying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plowing through Teilhard","review":"Teilhard is difficult to read but worth the effort--IF you're interested enough to make the effort (I am) and IF you can attune yourself to the now-arcane style of writing. IF you are so inclined, the rewards are worth it. You get a glimpse into what has evolved from ancient Buddhism, and probably begin showing up in a Western iteration first with Alfred North Whitehead and eventually into General Systems Theory. Fascinating and relevant if you are a student of spirituality--and who isn't if we're honest?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Man's evolutionary future","review":"This is a difficult book to get trough, but de Chardin's view of our ultimate evolutionary fate is a fascinating read and well worth the effort.

Well, do it he did.Raptor's Prey is one of those few books that you don't want to put down when you start reading it. As they say, it's partly truth and partly fiction, but it blends so well it keeps you guessing. The characters development make you feel as if you once knew a fellow veteran that acted like they do.

For my generation, (I'm 23) it serves as an inside look on a war we didn't study much in school. Vietnam has always been a mystery to me - reading Raptor's Prey has informed me and inspired me to learn more about the war and why our country intervened. I think the book will serve an important purpose for the author's generation too. So many of his peers scorned the war and our government, and concern and respect for the men who fought in it fell by the wayside. Anyone who reads this book will walk away with a much better appreciation for people who serve our military, particularly those who served on the front lines, as you did.

But Henry Chadwick's modern translation available through Oxford University Press is a more vibrant and exacting translation. Pusey's translation is too Victorian, which casts too much of the Patristic writer in a Victorian mode of being. Augustine was a preeminent rhetorician, which comes out more brilliantly in Chadwick's translation. Moreover, the philosophical arguments advanced by Augustine are more clearly stated in the Chadwick translation.

Rucker was stuck in a small women's college teaching mathematics during the composition of this book, and his feelings of being out-of-place are mixed with the illogical mathematics he was studying, resulting in a book with a disturbingly chaotic flow.Dreamlike, surreal, psychedelic or just plain haphazard (depending on your frame of mind), this book lurches from storytelling to math to philosophy to self-analysis to physics to gutter humor to Kerouac to.... talking cockroaches, infinite hotels and a marriage on the rocks.Not a pleasant read -- one is never allowed to \\"suspend disbelief\\" -- and the plot twists in the book just happen, like quantum events, with no logic or internal rhythm or storytelling momentum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Share minority view.","review":"Well, someone gave me this book for Christmas and I wish they hadn't.

He fell from the right tree. From Dad and Son we have had the very best of old and new school R&B. I loved Levert from jump and from way back. I have more of his earlier music than recent, but planning to correct that. I used to club in the Bay Area in the early 90's and sometimes had to park my car in questionable areas and I used to tell my friend, if my car gets stolen, I won't be as mad as if they take my Levert cassette -- they better leave my music behind. I also used to say -- Im putting my music on and lettin' Levert tuck me in tonight. How could you not love him. He sang from his natural soul.

There is not one song on this CD that I don't like; I love every one of them! My particular faves are:2. I Don't Get Down Like That5. Fall Back6. Deep As It Goes (my all time favorite!)12.

I practically own all of the cd's he released and as sad as I was to hear he died back in November, I was really happy to know we'd get to hear a little more beautiful music from him.Ironicaly, I think this is one of his best. There is something for every mood you might be going through. Mello, romantic, upbeat, whatever. I love the faster DJ Don't, the stunning slower Sweeter and the cool To My Head. There is no bad track on this cd (these happen to stand out to me more than the rest), but after the first listen, I was already hooked on it. It's sad to know that this is the last fresh music to be heard from such an amazingly talented guy, but at least we got 12 more songs that are absolutely brilliant. I love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Songs","review":"The late Gerald Levert was an underrated R&B singer. His albums sold well, but he never garnered the high praise of many of his contemporaries. This posthumous release is a satisfying final testament to his smooth croon. His previous album found him reflecting on social issues, but In My Songs is a return to his wheelhouse. The songs focus on his trademark love and romance themes, but there is a underlying theme of ache. The title track finds him wishing he could find the love that he often sings about and \\"Deep As It Goes\\" (while being a bit of a double entendre) is about look for a truly deep love. \\"DJ Don't\\" lightens things up with a fun vibe and \\"M'Lady\\" harkens back to his father's, Eddie Levert, Philly Soul days as the songs was co-written with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. The album closes with the poignant \\"Is There A Way To Heaven?\\" that has obvious extra meaning and gravitas given the circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gerald Levert","review":"I love all songs and music by this Man!

The best aspect of this novel was that she didn't let anything get to obvious. Through the entire book there was a sense that things might not be as they seem, or that the \\"good guys\\" might fail. The supspense made it hard to put down. The only real downside was that some of the characters were not gone into as much as I would have liked.

She actually advocates censorship of the Internet, (when it doesn't conform to her views or the views of the think-tanks with which she's affiliated), something that made me so angry I contacted her. The book, quite frankly, made me sorry for my family's positive sense of \\"civil rights.\\" To have given this woman \\"a voice,\\" only to have her use it to condemn and silence populations unlike herself, and to censor the Internet. That was so amazing. And with such little sensitivity to how many poor whites, in the country so many more generations, are locked out of things like college, just so she can go on the tax dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After Time Splitters 2, I was ready for an awesome new version of the game - or at least a heck of an upgrade. Didn't happen. This version is actually much less fun to play than Time Splitters 2. There is far less of the puzzle-solving element and far more of the run-and-gun FPS element. What I liked about TS2 was the creative way they combined these. What I dislike about TSFP is the way they basically abandon the puzzle piece. Very little thinking involved. Hence, very little challenge left. Plus, worst of all, the game is much SHORTER than its predecessor. It's as if they sort of gave up in the middle and just pushed something out the door. It's that old Woody Allen line about life (paraphrasing): It's full of pain, suffering, and disappointment; and it's all over much too soon.If you haven't bought it, don't bother.

Yes, there is definitely more singing and less screaming, but KsE has in no way changed their sound or style.This album is filled with speedy riffs, heavy rhythms, and uber melodic metal/hardcore mixed with pop rock choruses.

At first listen I perhaps wasn't a huge fan, took the second listen to fully get into it but it was worth the effort! This is an incredible record, super fast riffing, drumming from Justin Foley is superb and Howards voice is even more insane than last album! I'd have to say Adam D's voice could have been left out of some songs, almost sounded a little emo at times (God forbid) but he does produce so what are you gonna do? Overall tho, this band have brought something fresh and exciting to metal and I am pretty stoked about it!

One thing I like is that this album is easier to get into (as opposed to 'The End of Heartche' which took me a few listens) & yet also has some of the most melodic music the band has EVER done yet still keeps it heavy! In fact, the best example is the track \\"Desperate Times\\" which will easily become a Killswitch classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with bronxlord 100%","review":"This album is a huge letdown. Some people call this album maturation of the band. I call it appeasing to the mainstream and regressing musically. Long gone is the intensity of Alive or Just Breathing (which was actually a metal album), which was only sporadically present on The End of Heartache. Even though the melody aspect of the band is beat to death on this album, some of it isn't half bad and that's why I give the album two stars but it's way too formulaic and repetitive and offers no variation. AOJB offered something different with every song and even with Jesse's piercing vocals and the crunching riffs, the guys still knew when and how to incorporate melody which made that album special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd!!","review":"Excellent cd.

Awesome riffs here and there but the lack of solos was beyond disappointing as were the singers vox.This album falls into a lot of the same pit falls the last one had, decent guitar work, decent screaming, energy abundant, but without solos I find this record to be a failure. Nothing new here, unless your a die hard fan then you have some new songs. But if you weren't a fan before, this won't change your mind nor should it. Should you need to give a KsE album a try, may I recommend \\"Alive or Just Breathing\\" over this.

The descriptions are like being able to listen, through your mind's eye, to Rawlings' recollection of this wild and fantastic land in which these simple people clawed out their existence. We have not yet finished the book, and my son is not enjoying it as much as I am. It takes a little more maturity and insight to really \\"get\\" this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was very BORING!!!!","review":"This book was so boring that it took me a long time to finishit because I disliked it so much. I thought the story's topicwas pretty boring ,too. This book had a REALLY slow beginning,but there were a couple of parts that were exciting, like whenJody and Penny went hunting for animals and Slewfoot and whenJody ran away from his family because they killed Flag. Thesewere the only positive compliments I had for this book.

This book is incredibly overrated. Anyone who wants to read this book, don't. Read Where the Red Fern Grows instead. It has the same theme/moral/whatever, is much more exciting, and dosen't drag you kicking and screaming through page after page of describing pansies and trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is too long, too drawn out, and is a waste of time","review":"I am one of the unlucky ones who HAD to read this book for school. This book can not be considered a \\"timeless classic\\". The REAL story only starts a few pages before half-way through the book (check for yourself). It also describes nature too deep in detail.

After you get to the climax, it's like falling off of a 100 foot cliff and hitting the ground. The main character Jody seems a little too feminine for a boy in his time. I do not suggest to anyone to read this book.(If anyone takes offense to this, I apologize.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic","review":"This book portrays the betrayal and killing of a living creature, the deer, as some sad yet noble obligation on the part of the young boy. He kills his friend, the deer, in order to perform a bizarre, voodoo-like healing of his father who has been bitten by a rattlesnake. This not only teaches incomprehensible medical practices to young children, but teaches them to double-cross those who love and trust them as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH!! BLAH!! BLAH!!

It drags on forever with unnecessary descriptions of the trees and grass; there is no discernable plot, just a lot of nonsense vignettes; and--most importantly--it is boring. I hope that by writing this Mrs. Rawlings is spinning in her grave, because that would be more interesting than this book.

But even though the relationship between a young boy and his pet deer plays a primary role this book does not strike me as being a \\"children's\\" book. It is lengthy and contains adult themes more suitable for a book meant for more mature readers. Death, extreme hardship, starvation, attempted murder...this a kiddy story? I dismissed reading this book years ago because I thought, oh well, the story of a boy and his deer, ho hum, not interested. Well, this book has MUCH more depth than that. The review by younger readers who proclaim this book \\"boring\\" are not old enough to appreciate it.

We had a problem with the keyboard and called for warranty service and they said that the warranty is invalid if there is any water damage. We explained that there was no water damage, it just stopped working. They asked us to check a \\"dot\\" sensor on the phone. If the dot is red, the warranty is invalid. We asked how the dot could be red when the phone (2 months old) never got wet, and their rep told us that rain, sweat or being exposed to humidity or condensation! An unscientific survy of razr uses at a soccer game found 4 of 5 with the dot turned red-and hense no warranty.So bottom line is, it is a good phone, as long as you don't sweat or live in a location where it rains or gets humid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good phone","review":"I think the Motorola v3xx is a nice phone.

The new neutral dragons are terribly (too?) expensive, even though they are awfully strong. I wonder, if they ever will be of that much use. Anyway, if you liked Heroes III, this is an excellent way of trying new scenarios and campaigns. I miss some new spells, artifacts (there are two new relic artifacts, though) and some modified secondary skills (too many of them stinks!), though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I suppose it's fine if you're a 16 year-old boy","review":"We were very disappointed by Armegeddon's blade.

Believe me, if you thought the original campaigns were tough, you are in for a big suprise. The new units are OK, and not really anything special, although they do provide a few interesting twists. The random map generator, like all random map generators, creates a totally random map. If you want an all-out battle challange, start yourself at a high difficulty and have the computer ally with its self. Used correctly, the random maps can provide hours of gameplay, AND make creating scenarios and campaigns a whole lot easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plays like HOMM 3, but with new twists.","review":"Armageddon's Blade plays almost identical to HOMM 3. However, there are some new twists. For instance, there is a new castle called the Conflux. This castle is ingenious, and very creative. Furthermore, there are new heroes that were not found in HOMM 3. There are also some interesting new armies, such as the sharpshooter. Overall, the new creatures and heroes make for an improvement than HOMM 3. BUT, the campaigns are very difficult at some spots. Some of the campaigns have time restraints on them that are very challenging to meet. Or, on some campaigns you may not lose any of your heroes. Of all the campaigns, \\"Dragon's Blood\\" and \\"Armageddon's Blade\\" were the most enjoyable and entertaining. There are a few minor problems with the game, but for the most part there are patches that exist to eliminate those problems.

It may be for some new users but for experienced users, it isn't. This version takes away some critical nuts & bolts customization features and many tasks now take longer to perform. This is not due to the learning curve, it is the inherent nature of the way the ribbon works. Once you are familiar with the program, nothing is faster than the old menu structure. If Microsoft added an option to allow users to choose between menus and ribbons, it would be the best of both worlds, satisfying the needs of both new and experienced users. The new version does not run macros as fast however.

Not to mention a complete misunderstanding of how Object Oriented Programming is to be used. According to Mr. Lobao, EVERYTHING derives from a game engine - a sprite, a tile, a font, etc...I can't believe a book like this ever made it to press. I also find it laughable that the foreward is written by a Microsoft MVP whose focus is in ADO.NET, and the technical reviewer specializes in data warehousing and internet solutions.

I would recommend the book, \\"PREFAB\\" by Allison Arieff for bigger pictures, broader concepts and more in depth explanations. I suppose they were making a point by making the size of the book compact, but the few times I was impressed with a structure I would scour the three or so pages devoted to it and then it was over, leaving me wanting much more.

This movie could have used more of his patented bug-eyed nuttiness. As it stands, Woods plays the role of unconventional cop in pretty conventional fashion, which, coupled with a murky, uninvolving script and slack direction, amounts to subpar and generally uninteresting slasher fare. There are moments of genuine quirkiness, as when he seemingly ad-libs a cynical remark suggesting that sex rather than sensitivity is what motivates his interest in Lesley Ann Warren. But those moments are few and far between, and I suspect this film went from production directly to video release without a commercial run. Woods should give up the lover-boy fling and stick to his specialty--being the edgiest guy in Hollywood.

This is one of the label's more adventurous releases, alongside Vincent Gallo's \\"When\\" , and the recent Russell Haswell/Merzbow collaboration. Jamie Lidell shines not only vocally, but in his production skills as well, taking the hear and soul of jazz and screwing it up digitally. \\"The Cop-It Suite\\" is the album's opus, a soundtrack to a rainy day in any ol town, with beautiful violins roliin in, and Lidell's voice rounding it out. This album and it's heavy Jazz theme is taken to the fullest extent. Keeping with the very sporadic, free-flowing nature of Jazz, this album does the same thing, only with the modern IDM edge. It's smart, sexy, and funny at the same time.

This stuff dries up SO fast it's ridiculous how parents with a 1 year old will have enough time to get their kid to stretch out their hand perfectly for a print.

Program is very slow to respond; 5-10 second delays after every click (Pentium 4 3 gig, 250 meg harddrive, gforce4 ti4600 ). Program also crashes quit frequently. But, the most annoying thing is the advertisements for scanners, digital cameras, books, etc that take up the left third of the screen. In addition, there is no way to turn them off. Called Microsoft tech support and was informed that the advertisements are hard-coded into the program.

The central problem with Argento's giallos (and most giallos in general) is this: I've seen it all before. Basically, Argento hit upon a certain style (both in terms of plot and technique) a long time ago, and he's spent three decades repeating himself. If you want to experience Argento, you should START with \\"Deep Red\\" -- and you should STOP with \\"Deep Red.\\" \\"Opera\\" is tedious because it's just like all of Argento's other giallos. If I want to see the same movie over and over again, I'll watch \\"Deep Red\\" again; watching \\"Opera\\" is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Dario Argento Film Viewed.","review":"This was the very first movie directed by Dario Argento that I viewed.

I don't know if it was due to the dubbing or not but the character of the \\"police officer\\" was badly acted in my opinion. Otherwise it was well done.When I last saw this movie it was around a week or two ago so writing this review is a bit tough.

The sets and lighting are garish hyperbole, and the characters suffer amusingly unimaginable deaths. Where else can you see a guy get stabbed in the throat, before being treated with a shot of the guy's open mouth, the blade protruding through his tongue? And Dario Argento makes it all work in the name of ART! Argento's camera work in Terror at the Opera makes DePalma look like Kevin Smith. This may be blasphemous, but I say that this film is one of Argento's best, and easily the most digestable for mainstream audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadistic but Masterful","review":"One of Argento's most upsetting and violent movies, Opera delivers as a showpiece for the director's profound exploration of voyeurism. The set pieces - reminiscent of Deep Red - are willfully elaborate, and the fact that the film revolves around a staging of Macbeth adds to the typically self-conscious theatricality of Argento's vision.Those with a strong stomach will revel in this film: it's as much a European arthouse movie as anything you are likely to think of, but sadly only the tougher viewer will get to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par Argento","review":"Thus far the worst Dario Argento film I've seen, Terror at the Opera concerns a female opera singer who falls prey to a mysterious stalker. (It's not as much like The Phantom of the Opera as it sounds.)

The plot especially is a BIG let-down and the climax falls flat. That even A.C should resort to such predictable wool-over-the-eye is amazing. The structure is very little different from Five Little Pigs - if Elephants Can Remember then Pigs can recall much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing people can forget","review":"I am fan of Christie's work but this one is a huge disappointment. The story could have been told in 4 pages. There is no continuity to the plot, no idea why a dozen \\"elephants\\" had to be interviewed, and no clue how Poirot uncovered the \\"mystery\\". This is one mystery novel where I would recommend you read the last 5 pages and be spared the boredom of repetitive conversations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harper book","review":"Will not buy any more harrper books because of thier partnership with Chic fil a.

I do not recommend this book. Christie could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her last and worst book","review":"I feel really bad saying this, because the poor woman was 81 and had Alzheimer's when she wrote it, but this book is horrible. No plot development, no mystery, tedious and predictable. I didn't read any of the reviews before I bought it because I was afraid of spoilers, and because as a die hard fan I had trust in Christie's work. But I had no idea this was her final book, or that her mind was so far gone by the time she wrote it. I feel bad for her. She is truly a classic, and one of my favorite writers of all time. But I really wish I had skipped this one, and I recommend you do too."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite Poirot Novel ***SPOILER ALERT***","review":"I am a die hard fan of Agatha Christie, especially Poirot. Even to me this novel was boring and dragging. There is very little story. The plot doesn't have the juice enough to sustain a novel. It could have done well as a short story.With the dog biting the mistress, I was able to guess the ending. I have never correctly guessed ever before when it came to Christie novels.At some point, the book felt more like a psychology book, only the contents may not be correct psychologically. I wish I hadn't started this book in the first place. There are a lot of repetitive events in the books which is really tiresome. Anyway, I wish a better experience to anyone who wants to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This novel is very slow moving, repetitve and it is totally lacking in charm or suspense.

It answered so many questions and was very thorough and easy to understand. There were sections on choosing what type of Conure--if any--is best for you, feeding, houseing, understanding, health, personality, training, behavior modification, nutrition, and even answers about all of those \\"little things\\" your conure does! Also, many wonderful pictures. The best book I have read on Conures yet. The information was also provided for the single companion bird environment--where most others are geared to breeding and aviary set up and care! This should be your first choice if you must only get one book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT book for a new Conure owner!","review":"I LOVE this book because most other books on Conures put WAY to much focus on breeding, which is good if you are an avid breeder, but can be a pain if you keep, or want to keep, a Conure as a pet. When I was thinking of getting a Conure, I bought one book, it told me SO little, then I bought another, same stuff said, in a different form, THEN I found this book, and that made me deicide on a Sun Conure, I would recommend it to people who are considering getting a bird the most, it tells you what might happen if you get a Conure, it doesn't try to mask the fact that Conures are VERY high need birds, if there is anything wrong with it is that the author doesn't seem to call a bird a he or a she, its weird, but WHO(???) cares, sometimes when I write I make it them problems, and it is understood, so that didn't bother me, but I had to find at least 1 thing wrong with it, and that was all I could think of!Hope this helps!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every New Conure Owner's Manual","review":"This book is an A to Z guide to the happy life of all sorts of Conures.

The only negative critique I propose is that its contributing scholars are predominantly liberal in orientation (which is not necessarily inaccurate in and of itself)--but the contributions of such leading American experts, the likes of Brian Jenkins and Bruce Hoffman, are missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buechner, arguably, at his best","review":"If you love Fredrick Buechner's writing, and you love literature in more than just an analytical (though he is wonderful at that too) way... then this book is for you.It changed my life, my perspective on literature and story and writing (and I'm a literature and theology major).

This game has too many problems (ie: download times, no saving options, frustrating problems, and bad characters). Don't buy it, rent it first and then decide. I am not buying any more games produced by Capcom until they realease Resident Evil 4 for the Playstation2 as well as the Gamecube.

You got it, another 15 second wait. Youve just wasted 30 seconds of what could have been playing time.The HDD cuts the loading time in half but come on Sony, you expect me to shell out another $100 to make up for your INFERIOR systems failings? IS REO worth paying $150 to play? I dont think so. If your a RE fan, youd be better of buying a GameCube and playing RE remake or RE zero.

First off on a good note it is a beautiful game with realistic cut scenes and great effects, But the downsides pull the whole game down. There are no storylines no explainations nor much backgrounds on the character at all. Then they kill re2's adventure into the umbrella corps labs. When you start each senario they give you no reason why your there, or why you are with your AI (Which they hardly do anything at all!). The senario's are boring and dull as you run around trying to find way to excape from whereever you are.

I hated two of the games Capcom made in the series, one of them was Resident Evil Survivor, the other is Dead Aim. This game is better than them but its just weird and time consuming and not scary, just frustrating. I am glad i rented it and didnt buy it. If you like Dead Aim it might be good for you and online gaming is fun but i am looking forward to Resident Evil 4 on gamecube.

This is by far the worst RE game to date. The other characters that you interact with are extremely annoying. They constantly repeat the same few words over and over again.

You can take a nap in the amount of time from when you open the door to a room and actually step in it. Maybe it's just me, but the controls seem to have become worse too. The kick and tackle commands are next to useless, and most of the camera angles just plain suck. I am very disappointed with this game. Horrible job on this one Capcom.

It just doesn't have that tense feeling of serious Resident Evil's past. Even if you're a fan and just think anything with Zombies is cool, you will change you're mind. RE has always been about cool. This games characters and their constantly cheesy out of place lines get very annoying. Imagine a person climbing a latter and then in the midde of the act just screaming out \\" I don't know what to do!\\" even as they keep climbing.

It's got 8 different playable characters, all ordinary, everyday citizens of Raccoon City, and 5 different scenarios to explore. It's fun to just explore the different possibilities and to master the different characters. There's also 4 different difficulty levels for those looking for a challenge. It can be quite challenging figuring out what to do in each scenario, but if you read the files then you should be able to figure it out. This is most likely my favorite Resident Evil game, because you're not completely screwed if you run out of ammo. If you find yourself stuck in a room with a zombie and no ammo, you can either tackle or dodge your way out, which definitely helps you get out of sticky situations, and it is of great help when saving your ammo for the last boss.Also, this game has one of the most beautiful and memorable intros of any RE game to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Graphics, Great Cutscene, HORRIBLE GAMEPLAY!!!","review":"I played this game for maybe 40 minutes before asking myself, \\"what's the point?\\" The game is non responsive, un logical, and completely boring.

The series is probably my second favorite with the Legend of Zelda series first. I just adore the series, but this game feels thrown together. I don't care for the way the gameplay runs. The plots are odd and don't fit together. The concept was really good and I had a lot of fun playing scenario 1 the first few times. The problem was to get all the items I had to play it about a million times and then it was boring. The other scenarios just aren't very good. The puzzles are odd and don't always make sense. And the characters aren't that memorable even if they have hilarious phrases occasionally. It's definitely worth playing all the way through once, but after that, you might want to sell it off or put it in a drawer for a year and come back later.

Sounds great! However, slow load times, and a lack of keyboard or voice support really bring it down. While this had the chance to be a stellar game, it's basically just something for the more hardcore Resident Evil fans rather than just someone with a passing interest in the series. Granted, the load times can be improved if you have the game installed on your PS2 HDD, but not many people have them seeing as only three games out of all the PS2 games ever released in America use them and the new redesigned PS2 doesn't even have a slot for the HDD to fit in. So, if you're a Resident Evil fan, and have the network adaptor for your PS2, you should check the game out. (and if that's you, you probably already have the game anyway) If not, you could probably pass this one up. NnyCW for CapCity."},{"rating":"1","title":"irritating!","review":"this game has very good graphics and ok controls, but overall a very tedious game. you can carry only very limited amount of items. the saving system is very weird (nutjobs must have thought of this saving system). you also need to complete the level (or scenario) within the time limit. if you die, you have to start from the very beginning. not fun at all! by the way, this is NOT a scary game, just annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UPSET","review":"I bought this game after reading the comments of the other versions of Resident Evil, the first level in the bar and in the buildings it's easy, but when you arrive to the \\"Below Zero\\" level, it's difficult to find out what to do. The movement of the characters is slow, clumsy, the A.I. it's a joke, bad comments and the loading process from room to room takes a lot of time. Good graphics for a bad game. Why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive","review":"Ok, so all these people are giving \\"Resident evil: Outbreak\\" fighting words because there is no voice chat? I think they took a chance with doing this to the story line, so they had to see what type of water they were treading in. I am a big fan of the series, and I feel this one, although Jill Valentine, my favorite character, wasn't in it, is probably the best. It adds the realism of \\"what if\\" when you actually have to rely on the next man to give you ammo and to heal you. It's was risky for Capcom to try this, but I feel the finished package is nothing short of masterfull. It will definetly make you jump, and it is fun to interact with other people. Can't we all just get along and kill things?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an EP, but crucial BOC","review":"I got this cd upon reading reviews here on Amazon and being a fan of much of what BOC has done in the past. It seemed like just a small risk but boy did it pay off. I agree with what most of the posters have said of this album an its certainly a crucial offering if you're a fan or even a beginner wanting to try them out but not a take a full leap into a whole album. The first 3 songs are magnificent, each one being incredibly relaxed and repetetive but never boring. Its amazing how tracks that seem so simple can draw you in and hold on so tightly throughout the songs. The only negative is the 4th track which is why I can't give it the full 5 stars. I just found that one uninspired. BUT, the other tracks are some of the best they've ever released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Another quality release from Boards of Canada. I don't think it is possible to give a 4 track album 5 stars unless each track is simply breath taking. This album comes close, I subtracted one star because Zoetrope (track 4) sounds like such a throw away, and it does tarnish an otherwise flawless EP. As far as I am concerned this album ends after In A Beautiful Place Out In The Country (track 3). Still it is a great chill album, much more low key than Music has the Right to Children.If you are a BoC fan and for some odd reason haven't picked this up buy it now, it sounds different yet still evokes the same emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantastik","review":"I also got Music has the Right to Children, which is probably overall a better album. I think so at least. If I could only have one of the two I would have Music has the Right to Children. But I play In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country more often.For me it's easier to get in, it's smaller so I can digest it better. Parts of this record make me feel so strange and wonderful.My favourite two songs off this record, the songs I listen for, are \\"Kid for Today\\" and \\"In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country\\"... the latter track totally threw me for a loop the fourth time I played it and I think somehow it's changed my life, like a few other tracks off Music has the Right to Children have. It's weird when you find music that really changes you. It's inspiring.Get this album, it's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"blehhhh","review":"What happened?

It's like a beautiful and sunny afternoon in spring or summer... in a beautiful place out in the country. Or to say it in another way, the first three tracks are tranquil, minimalist electronica, and that the last piece - Zoetrope - evokes the music of Steve Reich and Philip Glass. But still - the title is the best description of in a beautiful place in the country..."},{"rating":"1","title":"mactop of lapintosh","review":"this is a funny sounding thing, with all the noisy crackling and unquantized parts. probably it'll remind you of, say, flying lotus, or any of the new breed of laptopper... hehe...,... laptoppers, can I trade mark this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"life is short","review":"I bought this item because of the cast, and it is admittedly a pleasure to watch them in performance. But there are too many excellent heist movies and TV series out there (the two ITALIAN JOBs, THE STING, $ with Warren Beatty, even a near-noir morality tale from the pre-Code Thirties called THE WRONG ROAD, and such box sets as MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and HUSTLE) that this one can't compete.

Listen specially to \\"One at a Time\\", a greatly wide-range song which Jones has done simply perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor advice on recovery!","review":"This book provided statistics and stories of rape. It does not provide positive steps for recovery. It states that you should visualize the rape in a way so that you are in control. This is not helpful at all.The book also states that you should not forgive. Horrible Advice.Forgiveness is about giving the judgement & condemnation of the rapist to God. Forgiveness is letting go of your hatred even though the rapist did something terribly wrong to you. Forgiveness frees you from the person who raped you. If you hold on to your anger you are a prisoner of your anger and remain linked to your rapist.I do not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I found this book to be very helpful, both for me as a person recovering, and as I work with people who are recovering."},{"rating":"2","title":"POLYESTER/DESPERATE LIVING","review":"\\"Polyester\\" is definitely a lot tamer than John Waters' previous films, but still stands true to his name. \\"Polyester\\" is still as funny as when I watched for the first time a few years ago. An added bonus is that the OdorRama card is included with the DVD. I have never had the chance to view the film with the card in hand, so this was a nice suprise. It definitely adds to film, I couldn't believe how disgusting some of the smells were! I loved it! \\"Polyester\\" remains one of my favorite John Waters films, probably because it was one of the first films I saw of his and adored.\\"Desperate Living\\" is my favorite John Waters' movie. I love the characters in the film and how the story comes accross as a morbid type fairy-tale. Edith Massey as Queen Carlotta is absolutely hilarious. The lines that she blurts out are so fantastic! I laugh everytime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Shoe-Stomper!","review":"There is absolutely nothing John Waters won't tackle! Divine is campy, compelling, and hilarious!

But that's not enough to redeem this seedy, pseudo-subversive film. I do understand that the obvious charges against it -- sad, sorry, sexist, stupid, stereotyped, shoddy, etc. -- are beside the point; the response from defenders can only be \\"DUH!\\" Of course that's the point. Outrage! (with a capital O!!)But really is that enough of a point? No, I don't think so. This bizarre and tired film will deservedly sink to oblivion with (not very much more) time -- and good luck to it! I wouldn't wish watching it on my worst enemy. Life is too short to spend ANY of it on such low-budget dreck.I definitely recommend against wasting your money here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Desperate Living is Waters' best.","review":"Polyester found Waters heading toward mainstream film-making, and it's his most successful attempt, as he retained his vision without selling out to studio censorship. It's also Divine's most realized performance. She is Waters'' Liz Taylor (the Virginia Woolf Liz, not the crappy Cleopatra Liz), and she works hard in this role. You'll reallly feel her torment through the laughs.Divine was touring with her club act when DL was filmed, so she's absent. But this is Waters' most outrageous narrative. It is one of thhe funniest American films ever made, period.Credit a great cast (the brillliant Mink Stole at her best) and a script that never quits in the laughs department. All this for under 25 bucks? Now that's what I call a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acceptable but boring B Movie","review":"I bought this movie mainly because of the cast for this film--Thersa Russell, Steve Bauer, and Michael Pare--top actors of B movies. Boy, was I disappointed. Boring plot that jumps over the place and hard to follow. Not an interesting film at all --avoid this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A B- movie at best","review":"Looks like a low budget, direct to dvd movie, this one. The 'stars' are not too well known and the script, well, let's just say it leaves a bit to be desired. At least the voice-over narration by the main character keeps us apprised of what's going on, sort of, but the constant screen shot time signatures are a bit pretentious. At least the whole thing isn't too long, but there's a bit too much gratuitous violence. And some of the acting is amateurish at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange and Confusing","review":"This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Though this band went through several changes before becoming The Ebony Rhythm Band they didn't stay around long. After producing only one single the group became obsolete and so did all their unreleased material. This cd contains their only single \\"Soul Heart Transplant\\"/\\"Drugs Ain't Cool\\" plus tracks from the group's other reincarnations. It also has ALL of The Ebony Rhythm Band's unreleased material on it as well. There are a couple of instrumental remakes on this CD, including a dynamite cover of \\"Light My Fire\\".

These short pieces have an impressive breadth--the copious footnotes reference everything from a WWII era letter from the author's grandfather, to the guitarist Brian May's Phd thesis.

Not what I expected, but very cool indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must!","review":"I believe that any music obsessive can always identify another. Just by casually glancing at this book I immediately recognized the author as a genuine fanatic. But the book isn't merely the ramblings of a Queen junkie (that would hardly be enough). It is a carefully crafted trip down the author's own memory lane with Queen as the singular, all-consuming soundtrack. The result is so infectious that I could hardly believe that I was anxious to read it again (rare for a book of poetry). It also made me anxious to revisit the Queen canon. A perfectly fitting tribute to a great (and sometimes underrated) band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenage Live Journal","review":"I was disappointed. I bought this book because it was interesting for me to read what a New-York poet can tell me about Queen poetry, Queen meaning for the world.

It was darker and grittier and dealt with more personal issues. I enjoyed the technical details and did not find it any gorier than any of her others. I do not think that it would be a good place for newbie fans of Cornwell to start their association with Dr Scarpetta - start at the beginning and follow the character development and see what you think. I am looking forward to the next book as I am dying to know (no pun intended :-) how they take up the story after all the traumatic events in Point of Origin but I am hoping that things are going to be a bit more upbeat and positive for Kay. I would hate to walk around as depressed as herself and Lucy seem to be all the time! All in all, a good read with as satisfying an ending as could be expected in the circumstances. PS. Delighted with the Irish reference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, tired characters who've become UNINTERESTING.","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I'm really disappointed with this latest from PC. Her early books were worthy of a best-seller list, but certainly not her latest few, this one included. I'm really sick of the Benton angle...why can't we have people who work together without the romantic angle? In the early books, he was happily married...suddenly we find him and Kay with grand passion for each other which takes away from the suspense angle. I liked her early books for the suspense. If I want romance, I'll read romance novels. I'm also sick of the Lucy angle. Kay is really neurotic about Lucy. She's grown and has her own life; PC, give it a break. I think PC needs to develop new characters. Marino is the only one I still like. Fortunately, I checked this one out from the library and didn't waste my money. It's not worth it. Post Mortem was a great book. What happened to you, PC? Fame catch up with you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lose Lucy.","review":"The book was a real page turner, in the sense that I couldn't turn pages fast enough in a scan for a break in the tedium. Where was the story? Exquisite villianess Carrie could have saved this book, and yet I don't think she was given a full paragraph.What once was fascinating narrative has become interminable forensic techno-babble. Marino remains the only halfway interesting character, and now, horrifyingly, his inner child seems poised to emerge. And PC, if you need to get rid of somebody, next time how about the insufferable, ever sullen, tortured Lucy."},{"rating":"1","title":"can we please have something new?","review":"Pat, Pat, Pat! I know life hasn't been a barrel of laughs lately but does Kay Scarpetta have to suffer as well? Not to mention your readers! We are constantly having Kay and Lucy's insight/ brilliance praised to the skies, don't they have any personal resources? Or doctors?I'm almost too bored by all this emotional self-gratification to ask - How did those fires get so hot? Maybe Scarpetta's personal black cloud obscured my view when I read that bit!As for you-know-who's demise --- better dead than stuck with that self-involved woman.Sorry Pat, cheer up! I'm willing to give you another try. I've enjoyed your books in the past. Could Kay and Lucy please have some fun? Could we also have some new crimes committed by people we haven't already met? If the obvious sequel to Point comes into being, could you please explain the fires- I lie awake for minutes each night.....just wondering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome Bore!!!","review":"When some authors become popular their writing lacks. This is the case with Patricia Cornwell. With the publication of each of her novels they seem to be getting worse. The characters are 2 demensional. The plot is contrived. The writing is juvenile. Dr. Scarpetta is no longer growing. I think Ms. Cornwell needs to lose Kay and find a new career. This book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's left to kill?","review":"Cornwell has become the new Anne Rice, as far as I'm concerned. You can't help wanting to read her because she grabbed you in the past, but what she's offering us is such a diluted form of what she used to write that it doesn't make sense to continue the habit. I didn't read Hornet's Nest because others told me it wasn't worth the paper it was printed on -- but I didn't want to believe that another Kay Scarpetta novel would follow suit. Patricia, it's time to rethink your plots and characters!!! Habit only lasts so long before it becomes a form of compulsion. Since I'm not a compulsive person, Cornwell, I fear, has lost me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak and repeative plot line - wouldn't recommend it","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed in Cornwell's latest effort. The plot is a recycled one as are the characters. Cornwell didn't even tie up the loose ends in the technical explanations of the fires' fuel sources. The ending reminded me of a bad soap opera,where without a body to identify one knows that the character will return..... Enough already...I thoroughly enjoyed her first books. However the last three seemed to have been \\"phoned in\\". \\"Point of Origin\\" reminded me of a screenplay for a \\"Summer Blockbuster\\" gone bad complete with one dimensional characters and lots of fire and explosions! Given the high quality of Cornwell's early works, this effort deserves less than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's getting hard to take","review":"(1) I am not interested in Patricia Cornwell's political views, which seem to erupt from every character's mouth, esp. Scarpetta's. Is it possible she's changed editors? That would explain this phenomenon, as well as the (strange) new books w/o Scarpetta as a hero, all of which are in desperate need of editing. It's fairly typical for a bestselling author to suffer under bad editing b/c people feel they can't say anything to her.(2). Why kill Benton Wesley? He was the only thing that made Scarpetta seem even vaguely human.(3). What is the purpose of the Lucy character? She seems to be getting weirder and weirder. If the point is to show that political conservatives (Scarpetta) can accept and lesbians, even though lesbians are inherently screwy and constitute a serious security risk, well, I am still not convinced."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written book about a forensic pathologist","review":"This is the second book I have read that is written by Cornwell and it will be the last. The poorly written story involves a forensic pathologist who has all the modern conviences at her fingertips except an author with decent writing skills. One example,(although not the worst)\\"I rested my head, and the stubble on his chin roughed my hair and was white like the beach I knew I would not see this week.\\" Do editors even bother to read this pap? Don't waste your $$ on this trash. However, if you are really desperate to read Cornwell - check the book out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarpetta is a complainer","review":"I gave up on Cornwell several books ago, but picked this one up at the library for one more shot. My initial annoyance with the heroine was that she is such a belly-acher: ain't it awful what I have to do, dealing with dead bodies and all. I disliked the token love story with Wesley, who had a perfectly nice wife and family, as being introduced for people who are more interested in sex than in mysteries. Her preoccupation with her niece is obsessive. So I find that this book is worse in all the above. If Kay Scarpetta finds her job so disagreeable, why doesn't she just quit and do something else? I'd like to see a positive attitude here. I am not dazzled by all the techno-garbage. Let's have a heroine I can care about. Scarpetta, resign and get a job in a factory and let Lucy live her own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Boring","review":"This is my second Patricia Cornwell book, also my last. Kay is a totally unlikeable character. She is self-involved, arrogant, humourless, and totally one dimensional. I could never understand why Benton (hate that name) would be interested in her.I agree with everyone else's reviews on the gigantic plot holes.Also I find it very hard to believe that a ME would get so involved in every case in the state. I have never heard of a criminal blaming the ME and then going after her.I kept reading just to finish it and was so disappointed I said never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It&#65533;s my first Cornwell&#65533;s book, and it&#65533;s my last.","review":"A bitter middle aged self righteous medical examiner Kay, a bitter pathetic crying baby Lucy who can an access database and fly helicopter, a bitter foul mouthed cop with profanity in every single sentence, together were looking for a bitter psychopath Carrie who liked to kill with knife and fire.I wish Carrie killed them all half way into the book.Other reviewers have said enough..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy research","review":"I know it had nothing to do with the overall story of the book, but when PC was describing the process of shoeing a horse - and had the farrier sitting on a stool while doing it - I had to put the book down - for days. I have owned horses for years, used several different farriers, in different states and they all use the same basic technique and NONE of them have used a stool - I can't even fathom how they could correctly shoe a horse while seated. It wouldn't have taken but a few minutes to phone a local farrier in her area, maybe even visit a stable while the farrier was working. It seems in all her other books she has taken such pains to give accurate details, so the reader really feels like they are there (or Kay is really there), but she missed the mark this time. I also felt she placed too much emphasis on Lucy's lesbianism in this book. Fine, she's gay, let's just get on with the story already! This was not one of her best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Can Put Down\\"","review":"Usually a Cornwell fan who finishes within a couple of days or a week, but took me nearly 3 months to wade through this one. I am not sure why I even plugged along! The murder/arsonist storyline seemed intriguing and filled with hope. The book got too caught up in tedious details of the personal lives of Kay, Lucy, et al. Interesting characters deserve much more interesting dialogue, actions, and lives! A potentially suspenseful plot with a few new twists got dumped for scenes such as visiting Lucy's apartment? Maybe Cornwell has written one too many books! I want the suspense and mystery back, but only if she can come up with new motives, new perpetrators, and a whole new outlook on life for Kay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after waiting for this one.","review":"I almost gave up on the book about one third of the way through, but because of loyalty to the author, I kept plugging along. Although it does get a bit more like a Cornwell story, the Lucy plot line is basically not interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK!!!","review":"Some of the other reviewers have grown tired of Lucy. I have grown tired of Gault and the aftermath of killing him. We may need for Lucy to grow up, but what we need much much more is for PC to find a new villan. I think this was a poor execution of what could have been a good story. PC can write a good book. This is not one, and she hasn't managed it in her last couple or three. I am going to quit reading PC for the same reason I quit reading Ludlum. PC is hung up on Gault as Ludlum got hung up on Bourne. NOW if you want to read a GOOD author READ NEVADA BARR!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much angst mars Scarpetta series","review":"Having read all the Patricia Cornwell's previous Kay Scarpetta books, I was nonetheless ambivalent about starting her new one, Point of Origin. Although they are dark of necessity, the series had become depressing because nothing good ever happens to anyone! All of Kay's relationships -- whether with coworkers, her sister and mother, significant other Wesley Benton, investigative sidekick Marino, or beloved niece Lucy -- are fraught with tension and mistrust. Everyone seems depressed and unhappy, including Kay herself. And for good reason -- life is always dealing Kay, her friends and family, a low blow. Before I started this book, I told my husband that if something good doesn't happen to somebody in this one, I wouldn't be reading another one. I closed the cover today -- Kay Scarpetta, adios!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to retire Kay until you can write her well again....","review":"I'm almost finished with this book and don't even know if I want to continue reading it. This has been thoroughly disappointing. As an addition to an extremely strong series it's weak at best. As a stand alone book if you've never read any of the other books in the series, it's almost unpublishable. The entire plotline took an excruciating amount of pages to develop and when it finally did it was anti-climactic. Not a page turner by any means.By the way, the introduction of the Teun character is about as see-through as it gets. Okay, Patricia, we all get it. Kay is going to make it all the way to midlife and then discover she's bi-sexual. Before reading this book I would have given the author more credit than to borrow so heavily from her own life instead of relying on creativity and imagination. Sad. I will not be racing out to buy anymore Kay Scarpetta books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very disappointed here.","review":"Kay Scarpetta has been a favorite of mine (Lucy also). Until this book! Unfortunately feel that Cornwell is going the way of \\"Dianelle Steel\\" & others: simply writing to publish. Such a shame! This book spends Way too much time on medical details; little or no plot; have about fifteen/twenty pages to go right now and frankly, do NOT care how she finishes. Writer appears to be so negative and hostile throughout this book, I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seek therapy Dr. Scarpetta!!!","review":"Is this mystery or soap opera? Or Grand Opera? I have read all the other Kay Scarpetta novels and they are becoming ever more angst-filled. I'm surprised Dr. S has not given up her job, given how miserable it seems to make her. Now another lover lost? Does it never end??!! I, on the other hand, am severing my ties with this depressed and depressing old friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"yech.","review":"This is my third Patricia Cornwell novel and she's 3 for 3. You can't say I haven't tried. Stupid story, meandering plot and a testament to the mediocre tastes that make a book a best seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nerve-wracking","review":"I agree with some of the comments that Kay Scarpetta needs to lighten up. She's been a little more depressed and gloomy with each new Cornwell novel, so much so that I'm beginning to blame Lucy who needs to start growing up. I was teary-eyed at the end. I have read all of Pat's novels and they're all good but my favorite and I think the scariest was From Potter's Field. Temple Gault was something else but when Carrie teamed up with him it was even scarier."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happening?","review":"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell since her first book, but lately her plots are weak. She turned Kay into an unlikable character. She does not act like the public offical that she is supposed to be. Her plot lines are also getting similar; Kay loves a character then he dies. The book does provide some good medical information, but the characters are getting too strange. If you want to read some good medical trillers, read the previous books. They have better plots and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin was the first Kay Scarpetta novel to make mecry. I don't think I can forgive Patricia Cornwell for 'killing' one of the main characters, but that doesn't mean that I didn't think this was yet another brilliant story. It's amazing how Patricia Cornwell manages to grab my attention from the first few sentences of every book she writes. Everytime she publishes a new Scarpetta novel, it's like meeting up with old friends, Kay, Lucy and Marino. Point of Origin is a sort of cry for more humanity in the world, and this message is wrapped up and spoken out by Kay, who is heartbroken throughout most of the book. The scene in which she discovers the body in the burnt-down house made me cry so much, especially as, as every reader knows, this man meant so much to Kay. I am now reading 'Black Notice' and the letter at the beginning of the book made this feeling come back and I cried again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have read most of Ms. Cornwell's novels and was sadly disappointed in this one. While I usually enjoy the scientific detail in her books, I found this one tedious and hard to follow. I didn't even shed a tear over you-know-who! At any rate, hopefully the next one will be better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Detail and Fantastic Plot Planning!","review":"This was my first Patricia Cornwell and I assure you, it will not be the last. This amazing and very knowledgeable author is not only a pleasure but a priviledge to read. Her plot is very well developed (having accidently listened to the last tape first I was able to get a sense of how she built her plot) I like best her excruciating attention to detail, right down to the physical landmarks of the settings for scenes in the book. She must research these details exhaustively and in addition to her medical knowledge makes for a very enlightening read. I felt as if I were at every place, peering over the investigators hands as she performed autopsy's and sifted through physical and logical evidence. I was riveted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"Although the book may have been well written, better than a lot of the drivel out there, I was disappointed in PC. Do relatives of gays/lesbians really dwell that much on the subject? Who cares? I think I liked Lucy better when she was an unbelievable child prodigy.This book would have been better if she could have just come up with an original villian. The forensics and investigation of the fire scenes were great.I have read Cornwell for years, but if this doesn't pick up..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kay should open a Pediatrics practice.","review":"This entry in the series was the least enjoyable in recent memory. So much death and blood it is no wonder everybody seems on the verge of suicide. Kay clearly hates her work but continues to be attracted to death like a moth to a flame. She really needs to do something different. Maybe a good family practice for the next book will set her straight. Ms Cornwell is still among the best of this genre and I will await the next book to see if Kate plunges further into depression but I do long for some of the fresh originality of the earlier efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost even worse than the last one","review":"I really enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's first few books. I found Scarpetta engaging, even though she seems somewhat right wing to me, supporting guns, capital punishment and worshiping various law enforcement agencies as though they can do no wrong.However as the books have continued I have found them less and less enjoyable. This business of carrying baddies over several books is tedious and predictable. The love interest with Benson is, for me, a complete turn off. The best thing as far as I am concerned is towards the end of the book - I think some reviewers have unfairly blown the gaff on this one but I will remain vague.Lucy is a pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"More disappointing than the last","review":"I'm not sure if it's because Cornwell has written (and I've read) everything there is to know about Kay Scarpetta, or if Cornwell has fallen a victim to her own success, but she's lost me as a reader.I miss the tight writing and real tension of the past. This book is overwritten, full of stupid phrases, and Kay Scarpetta has become a laughable caricature of her former self. And in typical \\"I'm out of good ideas\\" behavior, Cornwell resorts to bringing back a tired villan to try and spice things up. It doesn't work. Yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good summer read","review":"This is probably not the best Cornwell, but she has constructed a story packed with interesting, intimate technical information and insights of a coroner's office and on pyrography. The story builds well and, for the most part, is engrossing -- only occasionally enmired in minutia (and even that can be overlooked). Crusty old Detective Marino, Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta and her brilliant niece Lucy are back and up to their good deeds. Point of Origin is both entertaining and intelligent, although the ending is too fast and more contrived than should be acceptable in a story such as this. Otherwise, certainly worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters seemed tired, old and angry.","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I've loved the Kay Scarpetta series, but this one felt old, angry, and tired. Lucy should be beyond the rebellious years, and her constant struggles with Kay are a bit too much clash for my liking. It feels as if the series is in decline. Although the storyline was intriguing and the plot intense, I am not looking forward to the next (if there is one) Kay Scarpetta novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A warning: both disturbing and disappointing","review":"Fair warning to Cornwell fans: I have enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta series for years, but this one was so excessively gory that I won't buy another Cornwell book. If you're new to reading Patricia Cornwell, I would recommend starting at the beginning of the series and skipping this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Lucy!","review":"I have found the relationship between Lucy and Aunt Kay very intriguing and tight from the start, thus I'm glad that Cornwell has put more weight on the emotional configurations of the characters in this book. Glad that Marino is still hanging around, as I have found him to be a superb comic relief compared to the charged characterization of the wonderful female characters. However, Benton's gruesome death seems tear jerking, and would have been much better if he were to be missing etc. rather than being charred and grilled. All in all, it kept me awake through the night and was a good read. Looking forward to more Lucy and Kay."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I did not like this book, Dr. Scarpetta's character is very negative of everything and everyone, including her friends and family. I have been a fan for a long time and I was really suprised and disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best but pretty good","review":"My tastes run more to mainstream fiction like \\"Stones From the River\\" or \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\", but Cornwell's skill with this genre she pretty much invented herself establishes her books as must reads for anyone who loves great novels no matter what their focus. I found \\"Point of Origin\\" a little uneven, and the ending was off a bit, but all in all I was very entertained by it. It is not as good as her earlier novels but still a four star effort in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell has gone down the tubes","review":"Scarpetta's emotional roller coaster totally obscures the plot. It seems that she can't move forward on any evidence, or have any conversation without dragging out her concerns for Lucy or herself or Benton and on and on and on. She bores me. I skipped and skimmed through at least half of this book. 300 pages of dragging emotional baggage (through bad writing), and then WHAM! the last 100 pages has Scarpetta single-handedly solving EVERYTHING! Come on! The worst of the series (and considering the last few entries, that makes this one pretty bad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre Effort","review":"Not the best of her books, but definitely the most emotional of the books. Cornwell has become one of my favorite writers, but this novel fell short. The plot was good, but not well developed. The relationships between her characters seem strained. Dr. Scarpetta seems unusually overprotective and overbearing toward her niece, Lucy, and the exit of Benton was a poor choice especially since their relationship was just starting to take off. Hopefully the next book will pull her out of the rut of her last few bad efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating,unexpectedly sad, \\"a lot of food for thought\\"","review":"Definitely a page turner, one becomes totally involved; psychological processes and beautiful insights into real live people makes one want to re-define life's deep meaning. Kate is like a next door neighbor but, how can she take so much? Her strength, intelligence and character tend to make her a \\"role model\\" of sorts. This story has to have a continuation..., soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Because I can't give it zero","review":"Postmortem, which won the Edgar award, was a great, intriguing mystery, with a somewhat disappointing ending. Sadly, each of Cornwell's subsequent books has been progressively worse, with Hornet's Nest nearing rock bottom. Point of Origin is at best a marginal improvement. After her miserable attempt at creating new characters in Hornet's Nest, Cornwell apparently decides to retread all too familiar ground. In her latest installment, she simply falls back on (ad nauseum) relationships and plots (even killers and their crimes) that she has already mangled. Perhaps she thought the additional gore would mask the fetid stench of her decaying storyline. -- Hey, if she can mix her melodramatic metaphors, so can I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Thrilling Ride","review":"Patricia Cornwell has another winner with Point of Origin. The plot twists and turns, and as always takes her readers along for the thrilling, sometimes heartstopping ride. My only regret is that I could not put this book down, and it was over in a matter of hours! I am anxiously waiting to see what's next for Kay Scarpetta. I might just have to re-read some of my Scarpetta novels just so I don't have withdrawl while I wait! Kay come back soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was better than she has done in awhile.","review":"Patrica Cornwell is the best mystery writer working today. A bad Scarpetta novel is still more entertaining than 9 out of 10 other novels. I was disapponited in the last three Scarpetta novels but I believe she is getting back on track. Point of Origin moved quickly and I could not put it down. I still prefer the first four novels, they seemed to have more emphasis on the crime and less on Kay's personal life. I would like for her to go back to more original storeylines. Hopefully this is really the end of Gualt and Carrie. Now if the tiresome Lucy would just be sent elsewhere once in awhile, we might be getting somewhere again. Marino is the best thing that ever happened to Kay do you think she will ever notice?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I can not recall the last time when I actually stopped readinga book I had bought because it was so bad. This series has gotten progressively worse over the past few years until it has reached a point where it is practically unreadable. Kay Scarpetta has become totally unlikeable, the dialogue stilted and unbelievable. Do yourself a favor and give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"the reader from pittsburgh needs help quick","review":"this was a bog standard novel with a poor story which was not even properly explained in the end and it left loads of plot holes and red herrings just hanging in the air. It was full of poor spelling and even poorer grammar. It was also full of brand name dropping and bad characters. A friend recommended this book but I won't be passing on that dubious priviledge. We never even got to see the baddie in this book, after 400 pages! Though it is obvious this story is ripe for a sequel. Cornwell is also a sicko, killing off benton and those horses, and what about that horse that lived. The five star reviews must be from the official fan club, the one star reviews are from people who have read more widely than their local airport stockist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ms. Cornwells best.","review":"I really did not like this book for many reasons. I especially hated the ending. Lucy continues to get on my nerves. I will definitely read her earlier books again since I liked them better than these newer ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"what about explanations","review":"I thought that this book lack what every other book did. Cornwell did not fully explain the point of origins of the fires. I also did not like the fact that Kay had finally found someone she truly loved and loved her and was cut from the series. there was no point. Is she going to pine away as a lonely divorcee? Lucy is becoming a more interesting character though. As the series has progressed, Lucy has slowly become a real character, not just the smart niece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in contrast to Cornwell's earlier works","review":"Point of Origin got off to a good start, but at some point Patricia Cornwell seemed to get lost in her own plot. The conclusion has an almost \\"deus ex machina\\" effect as Cornwell finds her culprit in a character who is mentioned but never actually introduced. To link this culprit to murders introduced in an earlier work without any evident association is stretching the reader's credulity to the breaking point. And to simply \\"kill off\\" a major recurring character -- unforgiveable! I have long been a fan of Ms Cornwell's books -- have read all of them -- but Point of Origin was indeed a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even pass flying time","review":"I really, really wanted to enjoy this book -- I bought it to read on a 23-hour flight! The fact that I have picked it up again, two months after getting home, and find a boarding pass marking page 33 (when I gave up on it) tells the story. This book is so over-written and completely lacking in humanity and humor that it could not even while a plane journey away. I thought at the time that I was perhaps not being fair, being jetlagged already, so have picked it up several times since getting back home. But so far I have not got much farther than the boarding pass. This book does not even read as if it was written by Patricia Cornwell. I loved her first few books, and physician friends agree that she never put a foot wrong in her description of autopsies, but boy, this one is really bad. Give it a miss, if you are a new Cornwell reader; read the earlier ones instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!!","review":"I have enjoyed the previous books with Dr. Scarpetta but thethrill is wearing off. The character is really starting to work on mynerves. Cornwell has created a saintly snob. The good doctor can do no wrong while the people around her have many flaws. The story gets off track with constant attention being given to Lucy and her lesbian lover. I felt like Cornwell was preaching instead of entertaining. The constant references to money were annoying. Expensive house, car, watch, etc. I wanted more suspense and interesting crime solving techniques. This book became a \\"poor Lucy\\" story with Kay whinning about Benton. To love or not to love! ... Carrie's accomplice was hard to believe. I hope the next book will stick more to the crime. Better luck next time Cornwell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already.","review":"This is my last Patricia Cornwell book, or at least the last \\"Kay Scarpetta, M.E.\\" book. Patricia Cornwell makes this character so pretentious it's hard to concentrate on the plot. I really tired of reading long descriptive passages about her perfectly appointed house, her car, the vintage wines she drinks, Benton's watch, and on and on. The story lines are usually interesting and exciting, but not worth suffering through endless accounts of Dr. Kay's wealth and privileged lifestyle ad nauseum. Not only is everything she has the best, most expensive, rare, etc., but things are described in minute detail. This is not Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Goodbye, doc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Charaters","review":"The knowledge that Patricia Cornwell has in forensic science and inside knowledge of the FBI and ATF is incredible. Reading this book, (along with the others) you are opening yourself up to an incredible education in the science of a forensic pathologist. I often have to remind myself that these characters are fictional, although i guess that is what a good author should make you do. I should hope that someday these books would be made into a TV miniseries or even a huge movie series. It would be a huge blockbuster and reach out to other audiences that perhaps do not read so much.You're doing an increible job, Patricia Cornwell, I hope there is only more to come.Leah"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I was really excited when I bought this book, I was told that Scarpetta was a brilliant charicter and the books were really good. I bought it, I took it home and I tried so hard to get into the book, even half way through I wasn't engrossed. The charicters lacked emotion and the whole book dragged on and on going into to much detail about nothing at all.Some of the pathology was interesting to read about but on the whole this book was very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEFT HANGING","review":"It is unfortunate that Benton had to die. I didn't see it coming. Marino and Lucy were their usual selves. What got me was the ending. I felt that there wasn't a clear ending to the book. Ok, Lucy shoots down the other chopper. But the reader isn't given a CLEAR impression that Newton and Carrie were in the chopper. That all seems to be presumed by the writer. How can you end a book like that? It's like there is no closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not only bad...terrible","review":"Being a first time reader of Patricia Cornwell, I didn't know what to expect from the author. I was sorely disappointed in Point of Origin. The writing was something from a first-year college English class with a plot that left a lot to be desired. The characters had zero depth and the ending was uneventful. To me the book would only appeal to either a feminist and/or a lesbian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"Patricia Cornwell is not a good writer. She has succeeded in the past because she's developed a couple of interesting characters and has been able to parlay her knowledge of forensics into some fascinating plot situations. But, she's done all she can do and this book is stale and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is next for Kay?","review":"I keep waiting for Kay to decide the lifestyle Lucy leads is the one for her....and it seems the plot is heading that way. This was her worst book and I am not glad to say I read it...just that it is my last to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Much Introspection & Not Enough Substance","review":"An average, yet thin storyline gets lost in characters, particulary KS and Lucy, spending far too much time feeling sorry for themselves and their inabilities to cope with life as a whole. With emotional instability such as Lucy's, it's not surprising she got the punt from the Fed's. A helicopter shootout as a climax - get real. Cornwell, put some serious effort into the next book and stop conning us."},{"rating":"1","title":"When is Kay going to come out of the closet?","review":"Seems like the author is setting up a \\"coming out\\" book. She promotes homosexuality more than the plot of the story. This book was definitely not her best and the ending was a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please get back to the basics","review":"I was disappointed in this book, but not as much as the last one. (KS was so arrogant-she completely turned me off!) This is really dark and depressing. I've read every book in the KS series and my favorites remain Postmortem and Body of Evidence. PC seems to have lost that ability to make us do double-takes over seemingly everyday, innocuous people and events. Get back to your old style of writing, PC. I miss those suspenseful, sleepless nights."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one of her goriest books ever!","review":"I have read and loved Cornwell's books from the first one she wrote, but with each one she seems to be losing her touch. This latest one was the times because of the unnecessary blood and gore she seemed to find necessary to throw in just any old time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Yawner...","review":"After reading ALL of PC's prior Scarpetta books starting with Postmortem, this is the very first one where I found myself reading ANOTHER book in the process! Pretty much a complete waste of time and effort. It's a good thing PC doesn't make alot of California book signing appearance, because after reading Point of Origin, I wouldn't bother getting it signed...I think I'll start reading more M. Connelly, RN Patterson, James Patterson, Caleb Carr, Ridley Pearson, and P. Margolian etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lacking in knowledge of arson and fire investigation","review":"Ms. Cornwell should have stayed with the field she knew best...the FBI and forensic pathology. In this book, she has moved her characters over to the ATF National Response Team. No reason is given, and we are supposed to believe that Kay, Marino et al were allowed to this elite team since Lucy joined ATF. In addition, she makes it look like the ATF National Response Team runs to nearly every fatal fire around. This, I can assure you, is not the case. Other faults include having ATF agents baffled by how a fire started, even when a piece of magnesium is found at the scene. Come on...Give the ATF some credit for having some brains.She also showed her lack of knowledge of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in almost every area where PA was involved.In total, the book was a fair read, but was so off the mark with factual items, it made it hard to believe anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skarpetta is aging, but getting more interesting","review":"If one can overlook some loose ends and a very poignant plot twist, this is actually one of Cornwells better novels of late. It certainly is better than Cause of Death or Hornet's Nest. A novel with Kay Scarpetta may be a bit predictable, but it's like sitting down with an old friend. I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"We found 'Point Of Origin' another one of Cornwell's excellentreading of and about Scarpetta's intriguing case load. Again once we got started we couldn't stop. We went from Hornest's Nest to Point of Origin so we know we are missing inbetween as some of the story didn't make sense and we had a feeling we had missed something. (Benton's & Scarpetta's affair and Benton's marriage breakup.) Hopefully this author will continue this story (no bodies found!) and now the 3 main characters will continue on with the struggle of trying to make a difference in their world. We won't give away the ending, but we all felt Kay's pain like we were right there at Hilton Head Island. Great reading 4 Christmas or 4 a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Origin of getting no work done","review":"In her usual style, Patricia Cornwell, brings forensicpathology to life. In this book, Kay Scarpetta battles evil yet again, with her forensic expertize. This time she's up against Carrie Grethren, ex lover of Kay's niece Lucy, and full time psychopath. The characters are all expecting a murder trial, in which Carrie will plead insanity, but Carrie has other plans... This book has a very good plot line that is easy to follow and flows naturally from one step of the puzzle to the next. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes murder mysteries or suspense thrillers because this book has both. 430 pages of pure suspense and tragic loss of life. It was so good that I read it instead of reviewing for my finals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Point of Origin","review":"I too feel that her books have gotten progressively lessintriguing and a LOT more disgustingly descriptive.

This was a stupid plot too."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck!","review":"My first Cornwell novel and my last. This book was absolutely ludicrous. What a waste of trees. It was not the heinous nature of the crimes involved that bothered me. It was the lack of a cohesive plot and distinctive narrative. By the time I finished, I did not care who lived or died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this book is cruel & unusual punishment","review":"I have been increasingly disappointed in Cornwell's more recent books (loved the earlier ones); Kay Scarpetta comes off as cold and humorless (What did Benton see in her anyway?), but this time Cornwell went way too far. Killing Benton off, and doing it in the gruesome way she did, was sadistic, cruel and unnecessary. Ditto, burning the stables and all those horses. The interesting thing about Scarpetta's work has been the investigation process itself. But why do the crimes themselves have to be so horrific? This is my last Cornwell book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faithful Reader, yet still not pleased..","review":"I'm a faithful reader of all of Cornwell's novels, and as muchas I love her characters Marino, Scarpetta, Lucy and others, I thinkthe cast and storyline has been beaten a few too many times. It'd be refreshing to read some new characters with a new plot, though I don't mind the medical part of it at all :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a big disappointment!!!!","review":"Having enjoyed some of the prior books by Ms. Cornwell, I found this one to be a great letdown. The characters were shallow, the dialog weak and the settings tired and worn. Ms. Cornwell seems to have fallen into a general state of lethargy and is perhaps at the stage with her writing that she expects the fans to buy just anything she presents. Not! This is the end of the line for me and this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so, so!","review":"Patricia Cornwell is one of the best thriller writers and Kay Scarpetta is very fascinating, anyway, this last book is not as good as the fisrt ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her newest and most depressing book","review":"As a Patricia Cornwell fan, I have anxiously awaited the arrival of each publication. When \\"Point of Origin\\" was released I could not wait to get my hands on it. After reading it I could not help but wonder what is going on in Conwell's life that would motivate her to write such a depressing, dark, disturbing novel. Kay Scarpetta is at odds with every character in the book. She seems at odds even with herself! The plot is grisly and graphic, not lightened with any humor or levity - a downward ghastly sprial. The book held my interest but left a bad taste in my mouth. I personally don't know why Kay was in fear of Carrie. If my life was that depressing, I would have welcomed the relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC as usual!!!","review":"This book was great. The plot keeps going on, and leaves you wondering if your first theory was right or wrong. Point of Origin kept me captivated as the story put me in the moods of each charactor. To be scarred, laughing, and crying in one book is amazing.Way to go Ms. Cornwell!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Scarpetta-novel I'll read.","review":"Point of Origin was the last drop for me. I am now so sick and tired of the 'heroine' that I can hardly stomach another try. The touchy-feely writing and the hugely dissapointing ending of this book is too much. I have read all of Cornwell's books, and have enjoyed some of them, but this is it. And I say that WITH FEELING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy writing, moderately interesting plot","review":"Ms Cornwall is getting very lazy... her style is now reduced to laying on the mood with a trowel, foreshadowing events so clearly that you wonder why you continue reading. She's clearly getting rid of some personal enmity toward the FBI in this book, which rather spoils the mystery itself. Following the poor quality of \\"Unnatural Causes,\\" she's going to have to pull her socks up pretty quickly if she hopes to retain her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't she kill off Lucy?","review":"Scarpetta needs to unload that weird niece of hers, who refuses to be happy, and get rid of that pathetic Marino, who will never quit smoking no matter how many autopsies he his forced to witness. And Kay - well she needs a new job that does not force her to arm her home like a fortress. Cornwell's cast of characters lack hope and optimism - an unpardonable offense to the reader. Former fans would be better served if Scarpetta were to forsake her scalpels and invest in a good set of carving knives so she good more fully attend to her prowess as a kitchen maven. Perhaps she could play on her noteriety as a Medical Examiner to build a following for a cooking school.By the way - just out of curiosity - how many of you know the name of the medical examiner in your hometown??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Scarpetta's funk dampens this novel","review":"Perhaps the author is depressed about something. It seems so because Dr. Scarpetta is so down in the dumps about life and everything around her that she drags this novel down with her. The woman is having no fun. She ought to change jobs and get a life so readers won't go away from this one so unhappy. The pace is slow. The climax unbelievable. Ms. Cornwell's new love of flying helicopters obviously flew parts of this book into places it should never have gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying and in the end, just depressing.","review":"I still think Scarpetta is a great character and that Cornwell is an above average writer but I get so fustrated that these books are so hit or miss. I've really loved most of them even though I feel all her endings are lacking. They come too abrubtly and are unsatisfying. This book however was just not as absorbing or exciting as most of her previous ones. I had to force myself to finish it because I figured out who was doing the bad stuff early on and yes, it was depressing. It left me in a bad mood. If Cornwell writes another one, yes I will read it. I do have hope that there is another great Scarpetta book in her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of Origin burns right to the soul","review":"Point of Origin by Patricia Cornwell is a vivid description ofthe origins of blazes and the horror we all feel at the way a life canbe destroyed in a matter of minutes or even seconds. A gripping tale of mystery from the fires at Warrenton to Lehigh County, PA to Dr. Kay Scarpetta and the cast of characers losing one of their own. Point of Origin leaves you on the edge of your seat and wanting yourself to catch Carrie Grethen. In the end you stil don't know if Carrie is still alive and will show up in the next Scarpetta series, but you can't wait until the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornwell hits gold again","review":"Well the ending upset me somewhat I greatly enjoyed this book. Scarpetta is at her best again along with her merry band of follwers her neice Lucy, Marino, Benton and more. Great writing and a thriller until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the jacket cover then skip to chapter 16.","review":"PC novels have been a favorite read over the last few years. But with each release of a new KS novel, the tension is less and less and it comes further and further into the story. This one is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the real Patrica Cornwell?","review":"Patrica Cornwell has come and gone and unfortunately we are left with yet another book that fails to deliver the goods. Lacking in the fundamental teeth nashing, nail biting suspense of a good thriller, Point of Origin might well have been Point of No Return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable (and annoying)","review":"Boring. Predictable. Unfinished. In the end, too many unresolved issues that at one time in the book were critical and all-consuming. This was a book I simply struggled to pick back up. It took about six actual reading hours spent over about a 3 week period. I only finished it out of my own stubborn persistence. It was like dieting or working out, I just forced it.What about the darn loose horse?What about the fire starter and the silicon? (This actually was shaping up to be interesting, but then was completely forgotten.)The relationship between the niece, McGovern and Scarpetta is totally silly, not important to the story and completely unbelievable, yet received about 100+ pages of dialogue. Annoying.This book broke too many fundamentals of good story writing to have even been published. Unreadable. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but this is my last Cornwell book","review":"The charcaters in a series should bring some consistency from one installment to another. The protagonist in this series, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, has degenerated into a paranoid BORING one dimensional irrational person. Her behaviors are simply not believable. A person who thinks and acts this way could not hold a job as a mortician, let alone a state's Chief Medical Examiner. This book was a struggle to work through. Its plot contrivances seemed to be thought up on the fly and slapped into the manuscript. At times, I was wondering if the author simply grabbed an old character (The evil Carrie) and tried to re-work her for the sake of meeting some kind of publishing requirement. I could never really get \\"into\\" the story...whenever I was slipping into the fictional world created by the author, the sloppiness or preposterousness of that world jarred me back into my own. A true disappointment and the last Cornwell book I'll ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pissed me off. (Can I say that?)","review":"This is where Cornwell should have stopped the series. She's now stretching it out for every dollar. Give me a break. It's done. Stop reading here if you don't want me to ruin a surprise in the book.......Still here? Killed off a very important character and then brings that character back to life in the next one. Reminds me of the season of the show \\"Dallas\\" where the writers changed their minds about killing off J.R. and made the whole season a dream. PLEASE. Lets see more of the characters in Southern Cross, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I can not recall the last time when I actually stopped reading a book I had bought because it was so bad. This series has gotten progressively worse over the past few years until it has reached a point where it is practically unreadable. Kay Scarpetta has become totally unlikeable, the dialogue stilted and unbelievable. Do yourself a favor and give this one a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Point of Origin needs a destination!","review":"My first ( and probably last ) Cornwell novel. I mean, come on. First a big fire, affecting Kenneth Sparkes, who is quickly made a minor character. A bunch of horses die, but one survives, why? Never explained. The bad guy appears almost as an afterthought. And the scary \\"Carrie\\" doesn't even get any facetime with Scarpetta! After all that worrying. And her niece, Lucy, belongs in a superhero comic book; FBI/ATF agent, Computer genius, Helicopter pilot, foxy woman. Yeah, right. I think Cornwell wrote this book as she was taking flying lesson, since the helicopter seems to be the main ( and most believable ) character. Great dialog, weak plot, boring details, messy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Point of Departure","review":"I read this thing trapped in a Days Inn in NC whilst a hurricane went over; frankly I should have tossed it up into the eye. PC's own personal events have so transparently marched into this book: she dumps her FBI squeeze and squeezes up with his wife, so KS's FBI lurver has to get the elbow (or in this case a scalpel and a box of matches). What a dumb plot: a six yr old could have followed leads better than the idiots in this. The only redeeming features were that a few annoying people met their unsavoury ends. Second hand copy, as new, first edition, available here. Free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked It","review":"Point of Origin was a good thriller as most of Patricia Cornwells books are. I really liked the storyline of the burning horse farm and that Kay Scarpetta and boyfriend Wesley are back to solve things. I read the reviews and agree with most of them, but who is the nerd not saying anything about the book and just putting someone down? We don't need people like that in our community on Amazon. Think I will write to them. Buy this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - shame about the ending","review":"This was an excellent book! I couldn't put it down. The only thing I would have to say was the end went too quickly - it just seemed too easy. Now I'm going to start reading all the other Kay Scarpetta books that I've missed out on."},{"rating":"2","title":"PC'S BEST SO FAR","review":"AS A BIG FAN OF THE SCARPETTA SERIES I FOUND THIS THE BEST SO FAR. IT WAS A DEFINITE PAGE TURNER AND I JUST COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I WAS SADDENED BY THE LOSS OF BENTON AND I WAS GLAD TO SEE CARRIE GOT WHAT SHE DESERVED. CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE NEXT PATRICIA CORNWELL BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"A potboiler of no distinction","review":"This was my first Scarpetta novel; it will be my last. Aflimsy plot: as another reviewer has already said, not \\"intellectually challenging.\\" The characters are not credible: the women are overachieving amazons, the men are all cardboard cut-out cliches; even when the heroine's live-in is murdered, there's little genuine sense of loss.... The arsonist's methods take far too long to figure out -- a pointless \\"mystery\\" (I'm a Fire Marshal). The motivation of the serial killer is clinically wrong, an unabashed lift from \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" where the motivation was also wrong.... (See John Douglas, ANATOMY OF MOTIVE.) The final confrontation, fought with handguns between helicopters, is not credible, either -- in fact, downright Hollywood \\"silly\\" (I'm a pilot, too). The novel is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarpetta, Snap Out of It!","review":"I can't believe this is the same person who wrote Post-Mortem. If there has ever been a more pathetically depressed character than Kay Scarpetta, I sure haven't read it. She used to be so interesting, and now she just cries and drags her tired self around, worrying about her neice to the point where I want to scream. I was truly hoping Lucy would turn the gun on her aunt and end the series. Everybody she writes about is tired, sick, depressed, paranoid, and a constant target. And what's with the helicopter chase? Why must Cornwell turn Scarpetta into an action hero? Can't we just have a good forensic mystery without terrorists, plagues, NY Times Front Page Headlines, and ridiculous action sequences to end the books? Read Post-Mortem again, if you've forgotten how good she used to be. Please Ms. Cornwell, give me a book that doesn't make me want to kill myself after I've read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadness & disappointment via Patricia Cornwell","review":"I am a very devoted Cornwell, or maybe Kay Scarpetta fan -- I'm not sure as her deviation from the KS format two books ago was so awful. There was no need to kill off Benton -- if Ms. Cornwell is so devoted to KS living a miserable and lifeless existence, please stick to writing the church bulletin. You can do all your preaching there. I don't know if I can bring myself to read another of Ms. Cornwell's books, she took my love for her writing and flushed it down the toilet, with a \\"good riddance\\" in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of what she has written so far","review":"I thought this book was the best of all her books, although I thought the hate toward the FBI a little forced and phony. She needs to seperate out her personal life from her writing.It kept me riveted and I did not want to stop until it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great author","review":"I found PC's latest not as dark and foreboding as the others in the series, but I certainly enjoyed it as much as any of the other Scarpetta books. Perhaps Carrie could have entered into the plot more than she did. I eagerly await the next Scarpetta book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would hate to work for Kay Scarpetta","review":"Each book seems to make Dr. Scarpetta a more egotistical, self-centered, difficult person---I would hate to work for the coroner. I found this book rather dull----the crimes lacked pizzazz, characters were left dangling, and it did not hold my interest in the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornwell's winning style comes through again!","review":"I always hate it when the book ends! Scarpetta finds herself in an unusual situation once again, and manages to keep your attention right up to the last pages. Keep up the good work and keep those novels coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, my, Kay, hates her job...again....","review":"And, argues with Benton and regrets it, again...and whatever Lucy says to her wounds her, again....and Marino is still fat, smoking and drinking and she is worried about him dying, again. This is what happens in this new novel. More of the same old same old. This was not a page turner. I only wanted to finish it because I wanted to see what character Cornwell was going to kill off. But, I actually cheated and read the last chapter. That was it for me. The part about Benton being kidnapped was so sketchy and incomplete. Truthfully, the whole book was sketchy and incomplete. I guess you can tell I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. Cornwell has said she is going to give Kay a rest and work on other projects. Good. Give us a rest. Maybe Kay willl come back as a human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book is just as good as her previous ones. Unfortunately, when a friend introduced me to this author she loaned me her books out of order of publication. I highly recommend that anyone who wants to read these awesome novels, read them in order of when they were published as one book builds on the previous. While each one can stand alone, I feel I would have enjoyed them more had I read them in order!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old, Same Old...","review":"Patricia Cornwall's same depressing formula is getting very boring.

Patricia Cornwell makes this character so pretentious it's hard to concentrate on the plot. I really tired of reading long descriptive passages about her perfectly appointed house, her car, the vintage wines she drinks, Benton's watch, and on and on. The story lines are usually interesting and exciting, but not worth suffering through endless accounts of Dr. Kay's wealth and privileged lifestyle ad nauseum. Not only is everything she has the best, most expensive, rare, etc., but things are described in minute detail. This is not Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Goodbye, doc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Boring","review":"This is my second Patricia Cornwell book, also my last. Kay isa totally unlikeable character. She is self-involved, arrogant, humourless, and totally one dimensional. I could never understand why Benton (hate that name) would be interested in her.I agree with everyone else's reviews on the gigantic plot holes.Also I find it very hard to believe that a ME would get so involved in every case in the state. I have never heard of a criminal blaming the ME and then going after her.I kept reading just to finish it and was so disappointed I said never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell goes downhill after this Book","review":"I'm not sure what really made me not like the most. Either the ending or Lucy.The ending reminded me of a soap opera. Someone dies, however he will be resurrected... I just can't get past the ridiculous soap operatic ending. If only Lucy could have been killed too (although, then she would have to be resurrected too).I'm sooooo very weary of Lucy (a.k.a Supergirl) the obnoxious genius has gone from computer wiz kid to a FBI agent, helicopter pilot, undercover drug agent, fire expert & the list keeps growing in future novels. Then having to constantly read about Lucy's lifestyle choice & complications. I don't care if Lucy is a lesbian.I'm also disappoint that the escaped colt that received such big buildup was forgotten. I mean, a bunch of horses die in this fire, but one survives, why?????? Who knows it's never explained.Cornwell's books drastically go downhill after \\"Point of Origin\\" & if you must continue to read the series, go to the Library."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I get a refund","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. Slow, boring, no contact between the main characters until the unlikely ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whodunnit---------who cares","review":"Even a one star rating for this book is not worth it,there is absolutely no plot with the characters from the previous novel coming here and if this is supposed to be a thriller,sorry.This is the first book i have read by this author and definitely the last.Skip this book even if you get it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm crossing this author off my list!","review":"If you make the mistake of starting this book, don't kid yourself into thinking that if you keep reading it's got to get better. It just gets worse. The writing is so bad I wonder if she's really the one who wrote it. It's extremely violent (worse that her other books)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gory, Gripping, Ungrammatical, but I loved it!","review":"I empathised with Kay's growing older and like me, her language gets worse with age. I became increasingly bored with selfish and spoilt Lucy. I was itching to give her a slap! I was fascinated with Marino's Christmas Lights fetish, it's widespread in the UK, we've got some of those in Dudley. Benton is (was) a cardboard cutout character - what a great and gruesome way to finish him off! Even Kay's poor mother has had disfiguring surgery. Now come on Patricia, you can do even better with Lucy in the next novel, no-one knows how to suffer like our Kay! Overall, I thought this book was the most interesting so far, full of snippets about fire and forensics and helicopters. In short I thought it was a highly entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"I've read all of the Kay Scarpetta books and maybe I've just gotten tired of them.

But the story line suffers immensely. And worst of all, the final confrontation doesn't really exist between Dr. S and her nemesis. One can almost see the word \\"Sequel\\" flashing on the last few pages. Very disappointing, tedious and time consuming. A reader of such books wants in addition to learning processes and procedures (which PC has downpat) an exiting suspense driven story. This really fails to deliver.Having read the review from readers vs publishing concerns, it is interesting to see how places like Booklist praise the book to high heaven while the consumer out there yawns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, I Hate Lucy!!","review":"This is a pretty good book, interesting info about fires. I am tired of Lucy and Kay's obsession with her. I loved Hornet's Nest(why, No Lucy)Any- way it was still a good read. I suppose we will see Carrie again(See what started Dr. Hannibel Lecter started, the villain never seems to go away, and it seems that Kay will have a new boy- friend? Enjoyed the description of UNC-Wilmington and all the details Cornwell does so well. Boy, does she hate the FBI? One question, though, what happened to Pumpkin the cat? Seeing what happened to the horses, we can assume what happened to Pumpkin, but I always have to know what happened to animals and this is left hanging. Anyway,look ing forward to the next Scarpetta novel\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Low point in Scarpetta series...","review":"I found this book very disappointing from several standpoints.First, our main characters (Kay, Marino, Lucy and poor Benton) wanderthrough the book in a depressive haze. Hey people! Ever hear of Prozac? I'm not sure how these characters could be so interesting in previous works and now can barely hold my attention for two chapters in a row. Secondly, the story takes the first 2/3 of the book to develop and then you get socked in the stomach with the twist. Frankly, there are a couple of other main characters who I would like to have seen end up like him after their incessant whining in the first part of the book. Third, is there anyone out there who can't see Kay's burgeoning mid-life sexual identity crisis coming in the next book?After Patricia Cornwell's first few (excellent) Scarpetta books I would have never thought I'd stop reading this character or even want to stop. This is my last Scarpetta book. It was fun while it lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Having read all of Ms. Cornwell's books, I found this one very disappointing.

I have read all of her previous books and really enjoyed most of them. This book had nothing new in it, a lot of rehashing of her earlier plots. The ending was very ho-hum. This is the third boyfriend she has killed off in her books, no wonder she is depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING and predictable","review":"I don't plan to bother with any more books in this series. At least in this one, the reader was not subjected to as many detailed descriptions of Dr. Scarpetta's culinary prowess, but there was still a lot of self indulgence. Having killed off Benton, no doubt Lucy and Marino will go down the tubes before too long. Cornwell and Scarpetta have exhausted this theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and disappointing","review":"The pace is slow and when the mystery is solved, the result not very original.

But yet again, I got disappointed. What really makes PC's book interesting is how she made use of her professional knowledge in pathology in dramatic plot. It seems that now she has turned her attention to politics and romance, which she is definitely not good at. If she doesn't go back to basic ASAP, her name will vanish in the best seller list very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I got it at the library for free...","review":"Well, at least I wasn't TOO disappointed. Since the last few Scarpetta novels left much to be desired, I was not expecting much out of this one. But - I loved her first three so much, I kept thinking maybe she's pulled it back together. No such luck.I cannot imagine that a reader could understand this book without having read the others before it. I am so sick of Lucy and her chronic problems, and the rest of them, too. I didn't care if she killed a major character off. The book was empty. Give me a break.I enjoyed the ealier books because they were exciting, and scary, and you never knew what would happen next.

END"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring disappointment","review":"Having been a devoted fan of all of Patricia Cornwell's novels, I was excited by the prospect of a new addition to the collection. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Dr. Kay Scarpetta appeared incredibly one-dimensional and was insufferable in her \\"holier-than-thou manner. I kept expecting Marino to keel over from a heart attack (probably in the next one) as she harped on his bad habits. The relationships among the characters were worn and tired. All in all, a waste of money in the hardcover edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relentlessly morbid","review":"I have copies of every book in the Kay Scarpetta series. After Point of Origin, I may donate them all to the local library. What a terrible disappointment!Kay has turned into a grasping, greedy, materialistic bitch. I am unable to enjoy a book whose main character is totally without redeeming qualities. Ms. Cornwell is showing signs of succumbing to the trend towards political correctness--lesbianism, worship of celebrities (Pricess Di, Gianni Versace) who are famous for being famous, etc. Is that why Benton was killed? He was a WASP after all. I guess the graphic horror of his death was the last straw for me. Benton and Pete Marino are the only two \\"normal\\", admirable characters in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The plot that will keep you wondering.","review":"Patricia Cornwell wrote yet another masterpiece. Like all of her other books, Patricia kept me on the edge of my set througout the whole book. If you want to read a book that has an undescribable theme and plot, then Point of Origin is the book for you. Dr. Kay Scrapetta is once again a magnificent character, and is the true heart to this story. Patricia Cornwell's use of details and imagination is the heart and soul to this everlasting story. Thanks Patricia, can't wait for your next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I don't know why I keep reading Patricia Cornwell's books!...Probably because I started reading from the first Kay Scarpetta book, & you can get hooked. The first Scarpetta books were excellent, the kind of books you read in one sitting. But \\"Point of Origin\\", in my opinion, was nothing like the other books. The ending depressed me- not that the author had to chose a happy ending. But one of the most interesting characters in the series is now dead...Apart from that, I found it boring that Cornwell uses the same villain over & over again. Even after being disappointed with this book though, I think I'll still read the next one! Old habits are hard to break."},{"rating":"1","title":"if scarpetta loves them, cornwell kills them off!","review":"I've been an avid fan of Cornwell since her first novel but find she has made her leading character unapproachable and progressively more unlikable. The main shortcoming is the inability of Scarpetta to maintain any meaningful relation be it family or love interest. With little or no fan-fare she eliminates characters by killing them off. I worry about the fate of both Lucy and Marino."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing Cromwell book-what gives?","review":"I found myself profoundly bored with the amount of time spent agonizing over niece Lucy and her lifestyle choice complications, with Scarpetta's exhaustion and depressions and with a recycled villain.

It has been a downhill course since then."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"Started off interesting but then bogged down for several hundred pages.

She used to be able to craft a strong suspense plot and keep you guessing for awhile. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst books I have ever read. The story is rushed, the writing is abysmal (get her to a creative writing class-stat!), and the ending is so absurd that you become angry she takes her readers for such idiots.

However, the last couple in the series have been real disappointment. I'm glad I waited for the paperback to come out and didn't spend the money up front for a hard cover. The story was predictable. We can't expect the long-suffering Kay to actually be settled or content with life can we? There is just so much personal angst in all of her relationships - with Lucy, Pete, and of course Benton. I never got caught up in the mystery and suspense like I did in the first novels. All of the background writing focuses on Kay and her troubles, not character development of other key players. I'll wait for the paperback of the next in the series if I decide to read it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Patricia Cornwell In General","review":"I don't know what is worse, being so predictable with a mystery that the reader figures it all out halfway through, or being like Patricia Cornwell and randomly pulling a suspect out of thin air at the very end. Cornwell has great strength with her forensic detail, which I find fascinating, but she's weak at building a novel with suspense and closure. I can ponder on the killer all I want, but in the end I know it will be someone random, perhaps not even previously introduced into the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmm. climactic? anti-climactic? you be the judge...","review":"this is a GREAT read. Kay and Lucy's arch-nemesis, Carrie Grethen, returns! BUT, as in all Cornwell novels, the book ends before you realize what happened. if you're waiting for an actual confrontation between Kay and Carrie, stop waiting. it doesn't happen. and if I've spoiled the ending (which I actually haven't), then you will be missing a great book, classic Cornwell, just seems like the ending is only two paragraphs long..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, though not her best work","review":"I've read just about everything of Cornwell's and while this was not her best work, it certainly was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as exciting and well written as I had hoped","review":"This is my first PC book and Ihad heard positive review of her writings from friends. I was not impressed. Although it kept my interest, the ending was a little unbelievable, and came out of left field. It was like \\"I have to end this now, so I'll make some wild thing happen to bring it to closure\\" I am going to try to read another of her books. This one \\"Unnatural Exposure\\". If it does not get any better it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing story, too much focus on Kay Scarpetta","review":"Another story where the main character becomes the focus of a killer. What has Patrica done to Kay?. She has changed from a professional to whining and insecure person absorbed in her own feelings. Her attitude to her niece Lucy is hard to understand seeing Lucy is a professional in her own right. Kay thinks of her as a child. It would be so refreshing to read a Kay Scarpetta book in the old style where she solved the crime rather than being the target of it.Time for Kay to take the reins back and get out of the personal. You can do better, Patricia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating. . . frustrating. . . barely tolerable","review":"Indeed the weakest of the Kay Scarpetta novels -- when did Kay become such a whiner? Predictable story line -- I've figured out the plot by chapter two of each of the last four books; where's the plot twist? the red herring? the surprise? the thrill? I threw the book across the room when I read \\"she was stealing their beauty\\" in aggrevation. Cornwell's writing used to be edgy and gritty. Now it seems she is more concerned with churning out a book a year rather than being a writer with a good story to tell. Her editor also fails to rise to ocassion -- it's \\"ensure\\" not \\"insure.\\" As usual, the ending is rushed. The best writing is the goodbye to Benton scene. I want the \\"Postmortem\\" and \\"All That Remains\\" caliber back. . . PLEASE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It left me wanting a little more....","review":"As a great lover of all of Cornwell's other novels this one left me a little short. It seemed as if all the characters were missing what made them so good before, especially Kay Scarpetta. It was a good end to the Gault/Grethen saga but did not satisfy my brain. This is a good read for all those who have followed the series and need that ending. If you haven't followed the saga, I still recommend this book if you like a brain bender. I hope this isn't the end to Kay Scarpetta and Marino!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff!","review":"Disappointed - while still a \\"good\\" Scarpetta novel,this one seems not as well crafted as its' predecessors. Still wortha look, but I had hoped for better.

The plot is good, although I was a littledisappointed in the ending -somehow it seemed a little anti-climactic and possibly unresolved. But overall, I would highly recommend this - it was good, entertaining reading and I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornwell is a superb writer.","review":"This is more in the nature of a \\"customer comment\\" than a review(there are plenty of reviews already). I finished this book at 1 a.m. today and had nightmares the rest of the night. I thought it was extremely well written and one of PC's best efforts. I just read all the customer comments and now, upon reflection, it is obvious that she left some things out. How the fires started is never explained and admittedly, that is a big hole; but the quality of the writing is far superior to most books of this genre. It is hard to believe PC actually wrote Hornet's Nest which I found unreadable. Writing a series is obviously difficult, and she keeps up the quality better than most other authors do. i will recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a sophisticated, intellectually challenging read and doesn't mind the dark and sinister atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work.","review":"After following this author since the debut of Kay Scarpetta, MD, I have come to the conclusion that her most original work is well in her past. Kay has de-evolved into a navelgazing whiner. Kay use to be a clearsighted seeker of truth, now she is a thin skinnned complainer.If you think that the first paragraph simply says the same things 3 different ways -- and you like that style then you will love this book. If, you, after the second sentance, are saying to yourself, \\"get on with it!!\\" then don't plunk your money down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak in comparison to prior Scarpetta novels","review":"I admit to reading POO in one sitting, I've read all prior Scarpetta novels and POO is by far the weakest and most frustrating. The one plot twist I COULD'NT accept was the horse farm fire. All those horses with no staff to tend them except the multi-millionaire , I wasn't able to see him cleaning out the stalls and tossing hay and then we are supposed to believe he left the country without anyone to care for his beloved horses. Along with Scarpetta's designer, brand name pretenses and her general negativity I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone other than a Cornwell fan (which I am). I will continue to buy her books with anticipation of new characters, improved plot lines and perhaps even a contented Scarpetta, perhaps Prozac is needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed in the long awaited Kay Scarpetta sequel","review":"I have been a major fan of Patricia Cornwell and her Kay Scarpetta series and immediately ordered the book. However, I thought it was too dark and disturbing. Also I didn't thing the story line hung together, the pieces weren't woven in their normal fashion, the personal tragedy was too much and the story went down hill fast from that point. I don't anticipate reading another book in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing character development","review":"Apparently, I am not alone in the conclusion that some of the details of the fires were not wrapped up very well. But then, I had a hard time sticking with the plot of the story following the \\"horrible personal tragedy\\" experienced by Kay and the others. I was incredibly disappointed with that twist and would be very interested to know what Cornwell was thinking when she did this. I believe our friends in the Scarpetta series deserve better than they've gotten in this book.To her credit, Cornwell did answer an unsolved question from a previous plot, and further resolved the issue of a villian who was sure to seek revenge somehow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"I am extremely disappointed in this book. Plot points are not resolved. Villans are recycled. Cornwell kills off one of the her most attractive, appealing characters. She seems to be setting Marino up to die, and Lucy for a breakdown. The conclusion is so open-ended, I'm sure we'll see the same villanous characters again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touch for Health","review":"I do not know much about the book because the seller did not deliver it to me. There was a mess up at the post office and some reason the book was returned to the seller. They did not try to contact me and they charged me a restocking fee.

Who knows? maybe I'm old now, to me the humor was dried out. The graphics sucked, even with my PS2 component cable. The music was weird and giant foot steps near the end of the game were iritating, as well as some alarms. Everybody whom played this game know those two computers are stupid hard to link up unessesarily. \\"I know I can't spell, but I'm leaven it like that\\". One thing I liked alot though, was you can customize the controller, but the engineers make you change weapons too much, AND even take your weapons after the missions.

This game is cartoonish and has a distinct arcade-game feel to it. Every 20 seconds someone is telling you which way to go.

It was a level where you had to decode 3 different computers and after trying to get this sequence 15-20 times, I had enough. I just smashed the freakin Cd, and it felt mighty good to do it. Whoever made the game knew that this particular level was a pain in the but and i think that they took great pride in making the gamer's life so difficult.

What really will get you to like this game is the weapons. The coolest ones are: The Injector(will cause enimes to inflate until they explode)and the Monkey Gun (which you have to unlock, but, It's worth it because, it fires like, 65 shots with the push of a button.

The rest is solid REO, with the addition of some well done horn arrangements. It seems that in terms of creating great REO Speedwagon music, it is the combination of Gary, Kevin, Neal, Bruce and Alan. And this marks the end of that lineup with Gary and Alan departing.

If she was unavailable, they should have just let it go."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit disappointed","review":"Having read the book many times growing up & seen the CBS series, I was a bit disappointed with the movies. While great for loyal Christy fans who're familiar with the characters & the incredible story, I agree with some other reviewers that 'newbie' fans shouldn't start with the movies. The original CBS series was great!!! Although Lauren Lee Smith, Diane Ladd & Sam W. are commendable, I think Kellie Martin's Christy, Tyne Daly's Miss Alice & Randall Batinkoff's David were MUCH MORE believable. At times, the acting came off a bit overly done or not enough & unfortunately, Lauren's Christy struck me as a bit...bland. The saving grace: 3 cheers though for Stewart Finlay-McClennan's returning performance as Dr. MacNeil!

First of all, the main characters are completely different actors(except for the doctor) and they don't do a good job of their parts. The setting is all wrong too, it's so obviously not the real mission house and school. The story is wrong as well. The series left it open as to who Christy marries(we know that the original \\"Christy\\", Catherine Marshall's mother, married a preacher). This movie, though, has her marry the doctor. That spoiled everything! Plus, the acting is cheap. The beautiful scenery and music, the quality acting, the genuineness of all the people of Cutter Gap is missing.

Two different endings were shot, so that not even the actors knew who Christy would choose. Unfortunately, this decision to keep the viewer guessing until the final scene makes Christy looks like a flake. By the time this soap opera ended, I didn't care about Christy's fate; I was feeling too sorry for both the men in her life. Catherine Marshall's characters deserve better.

I like Diane Ladd as an actress, but her portrayal of Alice Henderson is bland.Thumbs up to the men -- Stewart Finaly-McLennan and James Waterson. Also, Dale Dickey did a great job with the role of Opal McHone and I thought Emily Perkins and Olivia Kelly were outstanding as Zady Spencer and Ruby Mae (respectively.The script could have provided a much better transitions in several place. Most notably, we see the good-by to one beau. It would have been more emotionally satisfying to see her say \\"YES!\\" to the other.While some performances were excellent, the movie must stand on the overall performance of the cast, director and screenwriters. With Christy and Alice being so central to the story, it simply doesn't make it.We all knew who she would end up with, anyway, didn't we??? Much better to go back and watch the CBS series or better yet, read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 3","review":"Of the three new Christy movies, this is definitely the best, and not just because Christy and (emitted) get married. Haha, gotcha. I can't say much for Lauren Lee Smith, other than she's really weak compared to Stewart Finlay-McLennan (Dr. MacNeill). He's great, just like in the TV series, but Christy, David, Alice, and all of the children aren't believable at all.

I know they probably bought the rights to the movie, but still shouldn't they have been truthful?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy read into the origins of the political economy","review":"The ideas put forward by Ricardo in this book challenges some of the ideas presented by Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations, particularly in the principles of economic rent. Ricardo also revealed interesting insights on the subject of value in chapter 1.To understand the text fully,it would be advisable to have read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, another book in the Great Minds Series, which I had also painfully digested.Like other books in the Great Mind's series, have a good cup of coffee ready. It is a very challenging and difficult read. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile read for those serious in understanding the foundations of the present economic systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Divers Typos","review":"The publisher should be convinced that the automatic spell checker should not be so heavily relied upon. The cover art is an expression of how an armchair graphic artist can be innovative with Photoshop. If a book of such high esteem be put out for public enrichment its presentation should not be so insincere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute!!!!","review":"My daughter got a set of these dolls when she was 3 1/2 and lost them at a friend's. She was so devastated that we had to buy them again for her 4th birthday. The dolls are darling and an easy size to play with. They do have a few small accessories if you're child eats toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"broke in 10 minutes","review":"My 5 year old daughter loves Barbies, fairies, etc, so this seemed right for her. Within 10 minutes tho', one of the fairies' legs had broken right off, and isn't really fixable. She was not being rough with it, so I believe it is a manufacturing glitch. She still likes it and plays with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it. Great thermometer for fridge/freezer. High quality","review":"I bought 4 different thermometers - one for each compartment of our 2 fridges. This is the best one in terms of quality of build and temperature reading. It seems very professional in its style and build. It is easy to read. The only problem with all of them really - any model, any brand - is that there's no great place to place them 'out of the way' in the fridge or freezer. So, I just place them loose on a shelf facing the door and that seems to work fine. I guess I could velcro it to the fridge or something like that but I wont. This is a high quality thermometer. Again, of the 4 I bought, this is the best but honestly the others are fine too. This is definitely easier to read than the thermometers with the red liquid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tips for the REAL WORLD","review":"This book is packed full of exercises you can sneak in here and there. The card trick is amazing! Also, a section dedicated to helping a certain body part is super helpful. The wire binding is a necessity for a workout book--you can place it flat on the floor or counter when going through exercises. VERY happy with this purchase--have had it for quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow and fun-keeps it real!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read many and tried different programs, but this book keeps things on a real level with easy to follow and practical solutions to changing and adding to your lifestyle to fit your needs. I liked the extra stories of her work in Holleywood; added flair! I try to carry this book with me when I travel and am away from the gym. When I get pregnant (way in the future!) I'm looking forward to reading the pregnancy fitness book too! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!","review":"Kathy's approach to real world fitness is both practical and fun. I've lost 5 pounds doing her simple exercises in my dorm room at school. The exercises are practical and easy to fit into any schedule. Bravo Kathy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Love MAD This is for You","review":"You have to be a MAD follower, as I am to download these magazines. Lots of fun, with the usual gang of idiots. Glad I was able to get this on my Kindle. Some of the panels are a little hard to read until I figured out how to enlarge. I will purchase more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad about Mad","review":"Mad About the Oscars: 38 Best Picture Winners (and Losers!) is a great book and a must have for any Mad magazine fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"stoked to see graphic novels introduced to the Fire - which is an incredible machine. honestly it just doesn't work esp. in B&W. would prefer to return if i could. checked out watchmen to see a comparison for fairness - something less text intensive, modern. just not for the kindle. sorry, my only let down to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Soul","review":"I love this album, because this is what true soul is about!! \\"The Sweeter He Is,\\" \\"I'll Be the Other Woman,\\" and \\"I'll Understand\\" are a few examples of the funk and soul that came from this group. Unlike Glass House, the Soul Children had an extremely funky, soulful, gospel-like sound that could only be produced by Stax. Their harmonies were raw, loud, and kicking!! If you love Isaac Hayes, The Staple Singers, or Albert King, you'll love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely essential set for Carlin fans","review":"My family first got cable, and HBO, in 1982 when I was still in school. New Years Eve of '82/'83, I watched George Carlin as part of an HBO stand-up comedy marathon. It was the funniest show I had ever seen in my life. I actually had my little audio tape recorder next to the TV, taping the audio!When HBO did a George Carlin tribute week a couple of years back, I was overjoyed that I would finally get to videotape the show I had seen in '82. Sure enough, it was NOT part of the week-long marathon. And it seems to be the only one of his shows they never re-ran again.Now, finally, disc 2 of this box set contains \\"George Carlin Again!\\". It is still just as funny to me as it was nearly 20 years ago.And this is not to slight the other shows on this box, they are all essential viewing to George's faithful.I just read an interview with George where he said he owns all the rights to these shows. So, to George, THANK YOU for finally releasing \\"Again\\" on dvd ."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Carlin Collection","review":"A very good show that always hit home for some, as it is racy in parts, good adult entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED!","review":"REPETITIVE FOOTAGE. VERY DRY. I AM A HUGE FAN OF CARLIN, BUT THIS COLLECTION IS NOT WORTH OWNING! SAVE YOUR MONEY......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing for a fan","review":"Ever since seeing his 90's work I've been a fan, so it was with great hopes that I unpacked this collection. After viewing the first DVD I was thinking that he has really improved since that and hoped for the next discs to be better.Unfortunately, it turns out that they all contain pretty much the same jokes and even the George Carlin favourites is mostly a rehash of the previous three discs. I have a feeling that this will never leave my bookshelf again. My advice? Stay with the more recent material..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the funniest man alive!","review":"George Carlin is a realist. He finds the facts of life that may offend people but his reasoning all makes sense in a witty way.
