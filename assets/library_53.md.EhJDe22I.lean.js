Now, I know that some peoople will complain about me giving this movie one star, but it is literally one of the worst movies ever made! If it is any indication, this movie is worse than Ang Lee's Hulk movie (and that movie was a giant steamy pile!)! I don't understand how Marvel can have such a good series going and then cock it up on this one. Not only that, but Venom is the coolest Spider-Man villain of all and they made him look like a giant pansy here! Anyway, give The Amazing Spider-Man movie a try.

Tobie M. is about as milktoast as you can get, and just painfully feminine. This movie is worse than the Silver Surfer. Why did I watch these two awful comic book movies? Am I losing my mind?

Every cast memeber did a great job with their role, maybe with the exception of Topher Grace as Eddie Brock. IF this film had any weaknesses, Topher Grace was it.But if that's the worst problem of the film, then I'd say it's still the best film of the year.Instead of complaining about why the film didn't satisfy their pathetic lives, all those comic book geeks should have stayed home (in their parent's basement) and acted out their version of an acceptable Spiderman flick with their mint-condition action figures!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZzzzzz.....","review":"That should about sum it up.

Venom was the best part of the entire movie. Peter Parker's little dance scene in the bar was rediculous- half the people in the theater got up and went to the bathroom and the other half were thowing pop corn at the screen. It was not good.

This one was just full of whiney crying sookiness from the main characters. And the singing and dancing?! Oh please, this isnt a broadway musical! When I watch Spidey movies, I want to see SPIDERMAN webslinging and taking out the villians...with his mask ON! He seemed to have it off more then on in this one. Why would i want to see Peter Parkers nerdy wimpy face in a Spiderman costume instead of his mask? And what was James Francos character? A villian, The Hobgoblin or The Green Goblin mach 2? Does anyone really know? And again, no mask! Boring. The two villians were the best thing about this movie, particularly Venom, for the all too short amount of screen time he actually got. Overall this was dissapointing, I really enjoyed the first two but Sam dropped the ball with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comic fan friendly","review":"Very disappointed with venom, ruined the whole movie for me. He was a very water down version compared to the comics. It seems like they spent all their money casting the movie hoping it would bring a bigger audience.

Here we have a super hero who in prior movies was strong enough to stop a speeding train and now is flummoxed by some dude on a flying skateboard. Come on! This movie is totally inconsistent with prior movies when it comes to SM's super powers. He has somehow come down several notches in power for this movie.The other villains are equally dumb and uninteresting. I found myself cheering for the \\"dark\\" Spider Man because at least that character had some character. As to basic plot and story, there isn't any. Just a series of scenes fighting different villains and a hopelessly convoluted sub-plot regarding the girl friend.Only a Spider Man fanatic would consider giving this movie more than two stars and/or consider watching it more than one time. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reboot!","review":"Spider-Man 3 was a soap opera badly disguised as a superhero movie. As other reviewers have said, there were too many villians--each with enough background for their own installment in the franchise. This movie should have been about The Sandman (with a less stupid origin) and Harry Osborne. Venom should have only been a set-up to Spider-Man 4.Anyone who thinks any of the Spider-Man movies were good just doesn't know Spider-Man. I would suggest that if you really want a true Spidey experience, buy any of the Ultimate Spider-Man trade paperback volumes and see exactly what I'm talking about.I'm pretty sure that if another Spider-Man movie gets made, people will watch it. But if we've learned anything from Batman Begins, it's that there is always room for a second chance. And that is exactly what this franchise needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment after the excellent \\"Spider-Man 2\\"","review":"\\"Spider-Man 3\\" is a big disappointment after the heights reached by \\"Spider-Man 2\\".The villains are uninspired, the plot is just a random collection of ideas that doesn't add up to much, the relationship issues between Mary Jane and Peter Parker have become tiresome.The film looks like it has undergone some major post-production cutting (witness Mary Jane's unexplained breakup with Peter Parker) but it is all to no avail.The creators seem to have run out of compelling ideas. Maybe it's time to put spidey to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Horrible","review":"This film just slaughters the characters from both comic book franchises (Ultimate and Classic Universe) and the previous two films. This film made me want to cry to tears of sadness because it is so bad and walk out the theater. Characters, especially Topher Grace as Venom is totally miscast and Sam Rami wasted too much time on Sandman who is a D listed villain at best, even in the comics. Sam Rami also did nothing to portray Venom properly. He should of just took his time to develop Venom properly and while focusing on the drama between Harry and Peter while also ditching Sandman completely. Don't even get me started on the emo Spiderman/Peter Parker arch because its not dark just very lame. So lame in fact I almost walked out. Also not enough action sequences and the one that are there, have the characters without their mask way too often. If you must watch this, RENT IT because it isn't worth your money to add it to your collection of films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we just forget this ever happened","review":"Spider-Man 3 is absolutely awful!

They completely butchered Venom (one of the villains, for those who may not be familiar with the Spider-Man comics these movies are based on), and making Peter/Spidey \\"emo\\" was just stupid.

Even the driver for my corded 3-button mouse will not recognize the scroll wheel button on the Ci75. So I cannot perform a double-click with the middle button, which is a major pain, and I will probably toss this mouse in the garbage.Kensington tech support claims this is a 2 button mouse, even though the web site says its a 3 button. It actually has a side click button on the wheel, making it a 4 button mouse. But Kensington does not offer a driver for this model, so those extra buttons are non functional.The receiver sensitivity is good, 5 feet or more.

The upper side of the case comes off too easily.2. The lower and upper parts of the mouse are held together by 3 little magnets glued to the plastic case with some superglue. Anyone with a bit of brain can realize that you cannot stick metal to plastic with superglue. The magnets *will* come out of the plastic case shortly after purchase, sticking to each-other and preventing the plastic case from closing properly.3. Once this happens, the 3 primary buttons (left, middle, right) become very difficult to use, requiring about twice the pressure to \\"click\\".4. The tracking is terrible.

Phillips' book is a wonderful study of leadership through the first-hand experiences of one of history's most masterful leaders--Abraham Lincoln. Phillips introduces a host of specific principles known by many to be effective in leading people and organizations, but takes them to the next level by clearly illustrating Lincoln's use of them through many specific incidents. These incidents bring his example of effective leadership alive, bringing credibility not only to the principles, but to Lincoln. Each chapter's end quite conveniently summarizes the main points allowing the reader to ponder its usefulness to our own leadership roles.

I am studying many books on leadership and find this to be among the best. While it doesn't break leadership down into a step by step set of instructions, I find that this cannot be done for as complex a subject as leadership.

This book will be enjoyable both for Lincoln fans and those looking for basic concepts of leadership.The book is broken down into four areas: People, Character, Endeavor, and Communication with sub-chapters that further support each area. Each sub-chapter is synopsized with summary bullets called \\"Lincoln Principles\\" that highlight the cogent thoughts of that section.\\"Lincoln on Leadership\\" is a good primer to provide a basic overview of leadership principles, and will not be useful for teaching about advanced leadership topics. However, Phillips' use of relevant examples from Lincoln's life made the book applicable to a number of leadership scenarios and made this book very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lincoln as an business leader","review":"Donald Phillips is not what you would call an exciting writer, but in this book, he has accomplished the key point the was trying to make--to demonstrate how our 16th President used his considerable leadership abilities to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds to win the Civil War. The advice that follows in often counter intuitive to most executives who are stuck in their ivory towers and try to rule benevolently from there. The book sites examples from Lincon's life to demonstrate these rules. While a good read, some of the rules seemed to be a bit straigned, and I was left wondering if these would apply in every situation. That said, it was great to learn more about Lincoln's approach to leadership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessively Basic","review":"I was highly disappointed with this book after reading the other reviews on Amazon. I found this author to cite the same works over and over again illustrating a lack of extensive research. In fact, he frequently just quoted other authors rather than synthesize any lessons of his own. I found this book to lack nuance or complexity that should go hand in hand with a work on Lincoln."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it! You won't be sorry!","review":"The book is so engaging that it reads like a novel. I recommend it to anybody who is even thinking about entering a leadership role."},{"rating":"2","title":"To the point","review":"This book was not really about Lincoln, it was about his leadership qualities. A must read for the insecure bosses in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lincoln is still a leader.","review":"I selected \\"Lincoln on Leadership\\" as a biography to use in a graduate educational administration course and I couldn't have chosen a better book. The organization of the book highlighted leadership qualities that Lincoln exemplified and each chapter had a succinct summary of those leadership skills. Lincoln's leadership is applicable to all types of leadership including education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Performances","review":"Recorded between 1946 and 1955, the sound quality on these recordings leaves something to be desired, and, but for that, this would be a five-star CD. However, the performances are excellent, and the historical significance of these recordings by violinist Louis Kaufman makes this CD worth exploring."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for Christian picture book!","review":"\\"I'd Be Your Hero\\" is beautifully illustrated.

The story-line is interesting, and the pictures detailed and vibrant. The author-Kathryn O'Brien has a real talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the content; beware of format.","review":"We ordered this book because I had seen the \\"I'd Be Your Princess\\" version and wanted the companion for my sons. The book I ordered was described as \\"hardcover,\\" but it was actually a board book. Be aware that there are two \\"hardcover\\" versions listed in Amazon and the one that costs less is actually a board book. My \\"big boy\\" 4-year-old shuns those as being for \\"babies,\\" so I definitely wanted the other version. Luckily Amazon took it back with return shipping paid, but they have yet to correct the description. Enjoy the book - great biblical morals/lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy!","review":"It has no educational value but is a fun toy just to play with. The noise the polar bear makes is not too load and its cute. My daughter loves chewing on the penguin. Overall great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"BREAD CRUMBS CRUMBLES","review":"Once in a while, a decent backwoods psycho movie comes along. BREAD CRUMBS is NOT that movie.Filled with stock unlikeable characters performed by bad actors, horrible writing, editing and direction (not by THE Mike Nichols), this movie plods along without any coherence or rationality.The \\"kids\\" look like they're in their twenties and the porn stars look like they could never be porn stars, even though one babe has melonous boobs. There's never any explanation as to the history of these killer brats or their fascination with Hansel and Gretel.The make-up effects and gore are quite bad. BREAD CRUMBS is really stale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Oils Album","review":"There has to be a weakest Oils album in their long and great career and this one is easily the least memorable. I used to own a cassette of this album but it was eaten by my Sony Walkman. I think it was trying to tell me something. Before other people flame me for this, just know Midnight Oil was and still is my favorite band of all time. I've seen them in Concert in BEFORE they were well known with their Diesel and Dust release. I know every song in the Oil's catalog and I can tell you definitively this is unfortunately the worst. It doesn't even hold a candle to their other EP, Species Deceases. I can't think of another album they put out that is this bland. Can any of the reviewers here honestly name one album they consider worse than this one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising","review":"the 2 best known tracks on this are \\"no time for games\\", about kids from the wrong side of the track and \\"Weddingcake Island\\" a great instrumental piece which sounds very much like a \\"The Shadows\\" instrumental.Worth getting for these 2 tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tohave and Katie","review":"Katie was forced to marry her father's best friend, Ezra Russell, because Ezra (a childless widower) needed a woman to go west with him.For as long as Katie knew she has been abused, first by her father, then by her drunk older husband. While riding out to the prairies of Nebraska, Indians ride down on their wagon. They should be on the reservation, but their leader, Tohave, likes to play tricks and tease the newcoming settlers.Finding Katie in the back of the wagon, Tohave can't believe such a beautiful woman can be married to the ugly old man driving the wagon.Ezra, thinks women are only for doing chores and making babies, not believing that a woman would actually want him on his own merits, he thinks he needs to abuse women to get what he wants.Tohave is Katie's only hope, and only true love. They'll be together no mattter what hardship befalls them.DON'T PASS THIS UP... Bittner gets better with every book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"camp chef keg roaster","review":"works ok, but the chicken dripping caught fire on the bottom and I had a big grease fire. The smoke affected the chicken and caused the taste to be so so. I am not real thrilled about this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the Samples First!","review":"This CD is for a very select audience. Buy this CD only if you: 1) know and like all the songs as performed by the original artists, and 2) love lounge music.I am fond of lounge music, but only knew a couple of songs, so I was rather disappointed with the result.Ideally, Mr. Cheese's treatment of these songs should be both humorous because of the genre transference, and most importantly should be entertaining by themselves. Since I was not familiar with most of the songs, the humor usually failed for me. And, frankly, most of the renditions cannot stand on their own merit. \\"Creep\\" and \\"Fight for Your Right\\" were good. As for most of the rest, count yourself lucky if you can forget them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bore-----ring","review":"Bill Murray is king of the lounge singer parodies. His work on Saturday Night live was the best in this genre. Everything else must be held to his standard. That having been said, I found this CD \\"unlistenable.\\" If this effort is \\"Cheese\\", the flavor is Limburger."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I heard some of the songs off this cd at a store and I have to say it is a disgrace to every single band whos songs are on the cd. It is not funny, entertaining, or original in any way, and if Kurt Cobain were to hear the Cheese guy sing Rape me, he would be rolling in his grave. So take the 12 bucks for this cd and go out and buy the cds with the actual songs on them. I would have given it 0 stars, but the lowest it went was 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy his other CDs, not this one!","review":"Richard Cheese does *NOT* own the rights or royalties to this album. The record company that produced it (Oglio Records) ripped him off. This CD IS great... but if you believe in supporting artists buy his other albums instead, since if you buy this he won't see a dime. His 'best of' album, Sunny Side of the Moon, has several songs from this album. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome vocals, CRUD instruments.","review":"I love Richard Cheese's voice and love his covers. However on this album the \\"band\\" appears to be nothing but a Casio. On \\"Smack My Bitc-H Up\\" he calls for the band members to solo and it sounds like a pathetic stumble over the keys to try to emulate actual musicians. His other albums have actual instrumentalists behind the instruments and the difference is clear. They really sound like a nightclub lounge style instead of just a dude in his basement. I mean, maybe the studio he's allegedly suing (I don't know the details) just took his acapellas and put them over the aforementioned midi tracks in order to save money... but you can tell it sounds amateur. Like the other reviewer said, pick up Sunny Side of the Moon instead. Most of the same songs, however, real instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROFL","review":"OMG this is so cheesy it is good. Much LOL, and the best Radiohead cover ever.A lover of different genres of music, would appreciate this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Cheese is the voice of a generation! BRAVO!!!","review":"Lounge Against The Machine is an instant classic! That should come as no surprise given the vocal stylings of Mr. Richard Cheese! He is truly the voice of a generation. To take the selected songs and perform them in the lounge-style is fantastic! This is a must have for any CD collection!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"It rocks and rolls!As an alternative music fan who also loves cocktail parties, this is a perfect CD to entertain most and offend some. But, isn't that the goal of all great parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book","review":"THIS WAS THE BEST BOOK EVER. and I don't really read a lot of books.

The end really surprised me, I would recommened this book to every one."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak material","review":"I have purchased other Bulova watch's which were of good quality; although this one does not match up. Other Bulova watch's I have are heavy, solid, and have the luster of quality to it.

Its a nice watch just not as nice as i thought it would be. another problem is the date doesn't go backwards so u have to spin it forever to get it to the right spot. NO ONE wants to spin a dial through a whole month of 24 hour days to get back to the right spot. I also think the battery should last more then a year and when you spin the dial the second hand doesn't spin with it so u have to stop it right at the top or it is hard to get the exact time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice enough, but defective.","review":"This seems like a nice watch.

Great price!","review":"I really have been enjoying this watch. I usally like over-sized watches. This is not an over-sized watch. It makes up for it, by sitting high off the wrist, giving it just enough of that beefy look. Some say the band is to short. I find it to be perfect. I do wish, the date box was somewhat bigger.

Well, he favors conservative and traditional values, but so do a lot of democrats and even liberals. I also promise you that the vast majority of democrats are going to label this stuff as the garbage that it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, turns out that liberals ARE just bitter, humorless people","review":"While I admittedly fall slight right in the idealogical world, I also have a sense of humor and enjoy poking fun at people who take themselves too seriously. Thus I read this book. I've never been a fan of Bill O's style, but do respect his ability to bring issues of the day into living room's across America, in a way that at least tries to be moderate and balanced.1. Humorless. But then again, never a big strong point of the left. They TRY to be funny to mask their biterness and hatred of average american joes, but it never works.2. Factless. As factless as the authors claim Bill O. to be.My advice: instead of wasting money and time on this book, try visually analyzing TP after it's concluded its course through your nether region. There you will find much more humor and factual substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"the title says it all","review":"Those of you who hate O'Reilly will find this book funny. However, Bill has done more good than any news commentator in the USA. You can make fun of him all you want but he is the one getting results. From getting rid of liberal judges to protecting our kids with Jessica's law and holding our elected officials to the fire and fixing the Red Cross post 9/11 and putting the spot light on the ACLU. I can name many others but that will not convince some of you. The fact that he is the target of the liberal left says more about who they are than who O'Reilly is. At the end of the day, the truth will win out all the time. To put \\"Jesus\\" and \\"hate\\" in the same title is just another \\"satire\\" that can be excused by the coolaid drinkers but to the fair minded public, it is insensitive abd childish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief...","review":"These authors couldn't be more paranoid.

I liked this book a lot for what it is. Don't simply listen to the one star reviews, as it is clear they did not read the book; but think to yourself, a book with so many good reviews, and a title that is so irreverent, that it inspires conservatives to \\"review it\\" without even reading it...

Reminiscent of a kindergarten student bonbarding a classmate with juvenile insults throughout recess in the sandbox.

Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts on short supply","review":"The truth is; if you looked hard enough I'm sure you could find some facts to bash O'Reilly.

Some flaws with the book; 1. She bases her book on information from people at the NTSB and not Boeing, despite the fact Boeing are far more experienced at aircraft engineering. 2. She fails to check whether the NTSB provide correct information. 3. She sources other accidents that are not related to TWA 800. The other accidents involved terrorism, lightning and fuels more volatile to Jet A. 4.

Disappointedly, her approach to the issues is a little sensationalistic and avoids some obvious facts which detract from the truly emotional issues. In example, the book ignores the changeover to a less volatile fuel by both the military and commercial airlines which weakens many of the fuel tank as the cause theories.

It is from Zondervan which is a very reputatable source, and a great feature is the introduction to every book of the bible which greatly increases understanding. However the font size is very small- it gives me a headache to look at. The overall size of the bible is small and convenient but this advantage is offset by the small print. I also think the thumb index is not a desirable feature- books are indexed in groups of 3, so it doesn't help you in finding a book- you end up flipping through anyway. The cover is leather, but looks like vinyl, and the inside covers are vinyl, glued to the leather. Cambridge makes a non-reference bible without introductions to each book, but in a lovely leather cover and large (but not your grandmother's large) print font that is very readable which makes a big difference in my opinion.

The trouble with it is its almost amateurish look and sound: no attempt, most of the time, to simulate night, not even with a blue filter. And the postproduction dubbing of the sound is (a) not entirely careful of lip movement, and (b) acoustically uniform: indoors sounds like indoors, outdoors sounds like indoors, everything sounds as though spoken in a small, slightly resonant room - this quite torpedoes any sense of immediacy, space, or Nature. The medium constantly hampers the transmission of the message."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst version of Midsummer I have ever viewed.","review":"This video is epitome of a low budget flick. No Stars. Two thumbs plummeting downward. \\"Laugh In\\" costumes. Unattractive and poorly casted actors. Oberon gives me the creeps. Horrific editing. Who was the makeup artist? Somebody with a lot of surplus green shoe polish, I guess. Where is the Royal Shakespeare company production anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This adaptation is outstanding!!","review":"I just had to weigh in when I read the wide range of opinions posted regarding this film -- most seem to have strong feelings about it, either favorable or decidedly not so. OK, so the film quality is not ideal, and the jerky camera shots are intermingled with cheesy special effects... so what, the ACTING is excellent! The feeling and expression behind each and every actor and actress in this production is sincere and intelligent. Unlike certain \\"hot\\" actors on the current scene (Ahem... Mr. Branagh), these young players (many of whom have become the revered masters of today) deliver the goods with moderation, humility, humor, intellect, and yes, passion. They are also all eminently well trained in the classic style (it is the Royal Shakespeare Company, after all) and it shows. Throw all the modern special effects and scenery to the dogs... Fine acting like this is all I'll ever want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cast, terrible sound","review":"A great cast and good direction.

What makes this book a winner, is the many perspectives and in depth research that Bordowitz provides. The songs and performances are analyzed from religious, political, and musical perspectives. Its great that Bordowitz gets quotes from musical luminaries like Bruce Springsteen, Sinead O'Connor, and Billy Coorgan.Some moments are spent looking into the personal sides of each band member and how their personalities caused the band to evolve over time. The Unforgettable Fire certainly differs greatly from Pop as the band has evolved from a radical new wave band to one that seems to have their influence blend into the world today. Big time fans should pick this book up and even minor fans like myself will find that there is much merit in Bordowitz's fine research."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 from beginning to .....","review":"That book is a must, complete with interviews that are no longer available from different mazagines.

It was trippy in a way that would be better suited for someone high on drugs: pure gibberish masquerading as whimsical storytelling.Every other chapter was the same. Meet a pair of characters, then watch them fight. Mix in some random poetry and songs. Add to that some round-about dialogue and logic that will make the reader dizzy. Viola, a classic.It was easy to follow, but hard to understand or relate to. I knew what was going on but I couldn't grasp why, or even how. I believe that this story would probably be better experienced through a visual means, a movie to television special. I only finished it because it was 100 pages.

Really, don't. Moran writes with the attitude of someone dispensing morsels from the inside track, a magician giving a glimpse behind the curtain....but fails to reveal anything that can't be gleaned from magazine articles, the internet, or an earnest chat with someone experienced at getting and keeping gainful employment.

Our local used book store had this guide for sale for $200, so we are pleased for see that Dan Lewis has arranged for its re-printing. I highly recommend using this guide in conjunction with a Wyoming landscape map - we use Wyoming Atlas & Gazetteer by DeLorme. The reason I don't give 8000 Miles of Dirt a 5-star rating is because I found it harder to use when we were driving a backroad in the opposite direction of the author (and his dog). Two routes that we've done that I would gladly repeat are Union Pass over the Continental Divide and Seminoe-Alcova Backcountry Byway. Recommended for pure adventure is the route from Hyattville to Shell. Don't count on your GPS - bring this guide and a gazetteer to help you make the right decisions at backcountry junctions. Celebrate the freedom and elbow room in Wyoming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the print version","review":"I bought the Kindle version of \\"8000 Miles of Dirt\\" hoping to get some ideas for four-wheeling and camping on my frequent trips to Wyoming. While the content looks promising, the Kindle version is crippled by the inability to scale the maps- a huge oversight for a travel guidebook.Each region is introduced by a detailed map of a large swath of the state. These maps are used to look up the routes in the book. I'm sure sure that in the printed version these maps took up an entire page and were easily legible, but on the Kindle the maps render so small as to make them illegible - and there's no way to enlarge them. Finding routes for the region you're interested in is a major pain.Edit: Apparently the graphics in this book are only scalable in the Kindle Fire. If you have an earlier version of the Kindle you can not zoom or pan the graphics.

I was going to buy this, but waited after reading so many negative reviews. My friend purchased it and I watched his. After doing so, I have to agree that the sound and video editing are not professional. It's almost like a group of intermediate level-instead of top level-guys got their hands on this and went crazy. Way too much attention is focused on the crowd, and there are times when they are playing and the focus is on the wrong element (i.e. paying attention to Geddy during a guitar solo).The documentary, however, is well worth watching, but the sound on that is even overmodulated at times.I haven't listened to the CD version. If you want a live RUSH concert on video, I still have to say that A Show of Hands is the one to get. And until I hear the RiR CD, I'd have to say get Different Stages."},{"rating":"2","title":"what's wrong with everyone?","review":"First off - I've followed Rush since 2112 and seen every show since MP.If you have a problem with the audio- get over it! It's a concert, not a studio album (listen to Earthbound by King Crimson for pure live energy with no mixdown). Name the last concert you attended that had 5.1 surround sound.Granted, the video shows way too many crowd scenes, not enough of the overall stage show including the video screens, and way way way too many fast edits. The problem is trying to video a three-ring circus - it's nearly impossible. They should have multiple \\"angles\\", each angle focused on a particular musician and an overall stage angle with far fewer crowd shots.This rates a 5++ for performance, a 4 for audio and a 2 for video.BTW - the Vapor Trails show at the Gorge Amphitheater ROCKED!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Next time hire a sound engineer","review":"I'm sorry. I love Rush, but the sound quality on this DVD is bad. The video is fine, but the audio could have been so much better. Play this on a killer system and you will be very disappointed.

But as always Rush prevails and pulls off another excellent show. But it was good to see a documentarty on Geddy, Alex, and Neil. Makes you see why they are one of the best rock and roll bands, and it allows you to see them as ordinary people like us.

It's sporadically more awful in random places.The directing is actually okay, I think--the visual is pretty good.

The liner notes state that the band was using \\"borrowed\\" equipment, and it definately shows in this performance. Maybe a purchase for even the diehards, but otherwise I'd stay away.

Over 40.000 Rush fans moving and bouncing and screaming and singing like there was no tomorrow, having the time of their lives. It was a lot of fun, I tell you. How do I know? I was there!Squeezed a little more than 3 meters from the stage, moving like a piece of wood adrift in a sea of arms, able to hear and feel the sheer power of every chord and beat, I experienced one of the best shows of my life (and I have seen quite a feel).The DVD is just that. It brings you to the same environment and makes you feel like you were there too (pardon the clich��). If you're not a Rush fan, you have no business buying it. But if you are... prepare yourself for a thrill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Music but average sound mixing","review":"Rush at their best - great performances and a great set list.I'm not sure what the previous reviewer is talking about - the sound mixing is not that great. Simply, the vocal track needs to be louder and clearer, as it is in a live show. When Geddy Lee is speaking in between some songs, his voice is almost inaudible. Rush even admit on the DVD that the Rio setup was hastily done and there was no time for a sound check.By contrast, U2 at Slane Castle is an example of an excellent concert 5.1 sound mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Rush in Rio\\" is PERFECT","review":"The best show of rock.It was filmed with 22 cameras. More 125,000 people in 03 shows.The video quality is fantastic, is perfect, is beatiful.The effects are perfects. Only compare with Rollling Stones, Pink Floyd and U2.The music selection is perfect.The best show. The public with hight energy.\\"Rush in Rio\\"....buy now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Large Victory!!","review":"This is a great DVD!! It captures the feel and pacing of the actual concert (I went to 4 VT 2002 tour). I have been waiting for a mix to capture what Rush sounds like live and this DVD does it! Does it sound like the studio? Heck no! If you want that;buy the studio albums. What you get here is raw, slightly improvised, high energy renditions of amazing songs. Let's not forget that these guys are 50, haven't played in five years and rock more than ever!There have been complaints about the sound and editing-don't listen to it. Buy this DVD and enjoy life;it is that good.What is so awesome is that the concert is presented in full; Rush never does this. So relish in that amd thank God for this product. Did I mention you should buy this?Rush is simply the best band ever (Peter Gabriel era Genesis runs a close second). This is one of the best concert DVDs. Believe the hype! Rush reigns victorious!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise the Canadian trio","review":"I am a very proud owner of this DVD and the CD Set. When I first got both of these items, I listened to them over and over. These guys, after all these years, can play their music live and still sound nearly identically to the studio version. Every song was nearly that way. Rush is just phenominal in this performance. Great selection of songs. This recording just simply sounds excellent in the car or home. 5.1 or not. Rush picked the perfect place to record as did Iron Maiden. Those Brazilian audiences are awesome. These people really support the music and the artists. If you like Rush a little or a lot, the DVD and/or CD needs to be part of your collection. If you don't like RUSH then you must not appreciate real music, real talent, and lyrics that stimulate the brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Audio & Annoying Crowd","review":"This DVD is probably one of the worst in my collection in terms of audio quality. The crowd are so noisy that it becomes really intrusive. This crowd would have been at home in early Roman times at some gladiatorial encounter. Rush are a WORLD CLASS band but this offering does nothing to maintain their status.Apart from the crowd issue the audio mix was also not good.For other reviewers here, who state that the sound is OK, they should listen to Sting 'All This Time', The Eagles 'Hell Freezes Over', Peter Gabriel 'Growing Up' to name but three. I wasted my money on this and do not wish to let others do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help me if I'm not optimizing this ...","review":"I liked the movie on disc 2 better than the concert on disc 1.The concert was good but I think I may have a defective DVD - the sound and the video are not in sync (video lags by a fraction of a second - makes it difficult to truly appreciate Peart's finesse). I popped another concert video DVD in and it's in perfect sync so could I have a defective DVD? storminfz2@juno.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious sound quality!","review":"I'm a huge Rush fan, having seen them live a dozen times. I saw this tour in Salt Lake City. And frankly, I expect the sound quality on an expensive DVD to be much better than the actual concert. The sound is atrocious on this product. Way too much bass, not enough vocals and absolutely no balance or separation in 5.1 Dolby. Total mush..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame the Sound is so poor","review":"The sound engineer should be shot for mixing this otherwise great performance. I have tried listening this in both PCM, DTS and Dolby digital. All sound equally as bad, although PCM is somewhat bearable. My $30K home theater setup did not even help rescue this mix.It is a shame that 30+ year old performances from other DVDs sound way better than this 2003 release. Perhaps Rush will go back and remix this. Save your money and get Rush Replay and R30 DVDs for much better sound mixes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor DVD Quality","review":"I love 70's and 80's Rush. Later stuff isn't that great for me. This DVD was really disappointing. The video quality isn't that great. Scan lines are really noticeable and too much video of crowd. I know it's filmed in Rio, it's in the title, but I don't really want to see a bunch of South Americans with their shirts off. Nasty. But the audio is the real downer here. The vocals are flat. There's too much crowd noise, even for live. I'd rather just put the original in and listen to that, so I shut it off and did."},{"rating":"1","title":"The words MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT come to mind!","review":"Man...what a disappointment this long awaited DVD was! The sound quality SUCKED! At first I thought there was something wrong with the DVD. Pretty bad when you own a great surround sound system and it still sounds terrible. It sounded better just playing it through the TV speaker. I have several of their old VHS tapes and they sound way better than this DVD. They call that a Dolby 5.1 recording. What is up with that??? I am a major RUSH fan and was looking forward to kicking back and jamming with the boys and when I turned it on I couldn't believe it! You can't hear any cymbal crashes or licks from \\"The Professor\\", you don't hear the guitar and Geddy sounds like he is singing in a can! You know, Rush prides itself on quality workmanship and pleasing their fans...the producers of this one should be ashamed! With the strides we have made over the years in technology it should have ROCKED! MAJOR DISAPOINTMENT...MAJOR...HAVE I MADE MY POINT HERE??!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What ???","review":"How can some people criticize the sound quality?Like Alex didn't know what he was doing, do you really think you know more than this guys that are perfectionists and are on the road for almost 30 years.

That IS A CROWD, forget the chairs, did you see anybody sitting down? or not singing?It is perfect, worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut them some slack!","review":"There is a perfectly good reason why Geddy's vocals are down in the mix.He can't sing very well anymore!!!!Why do you think they didn't play older material as the years went on?This DVD was exactlly what I expected out of a band that hit their prime 20 odd years ago..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about the sound!","review":"This disc was a big disapointment. I'm speaking of the lack of technical quality and engineering. Video editing is poor and the 5.1 mix is horrendous. There is no excuse for this lack of quality today and shame on RUSH for allowing this to happen. I own 70 + concert DVD's. Great sound is exemplified by the likes of ELP/ZOOM, ROGER WATERS/LIVE IN THE FLESH, The EAGLES/HELL FREEZES OVER, BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN/LIVE IN NY CITY and dozens of others. It's too bad the sound and video editing quality doesn't match the slickness of the discs' marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"5.1 SOUND MIX PROBLEMS ?","review":"Rush in Rio sound mix. I'll bet that most of you reviewers of this dvd are listening to it the wrong way (Hea?)Yes, I said the wrong way. What I mean is that you have your HT (Home Theater) system set up WRONG just as I did. After reading countless HT magazines, HT internet reviews and how to get the best performance out of any HT system. I've come to a conclusion for all HT users on how to Properly set up your system. First. you must always keep your center and rear surround speakers set to SMALL, yes SMALL. Second if you are using a sub woofer, you MUST sellect SMALL for ALL speakers in your system, even if you have large front speakers. Second, if you have NO sub in your system you will select LARGE for just your front speakers only. This is the way to go and my system sounds much better and so doe's this Rush in Rio dvd.A Rush fan of 23 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Discs!","review":"I tried returning this title several times for defective tracking.The Prologic soundtrack was lackluster and so was the performance.What a let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock para ni?os","review":"Nunca he entendido lo de Rush. Una banda que fuera de los Estados Unidos, no gusta a nadie. La propia portada de este disco es sintom��tica. Rock para ni?os con pretensiones de sinfonismo.

I saw the Vapor Trails Tour in Chicago, and the crowd never sat down. Even thourgh I was high up in the Stands, I could not see the band. I am a 25 year fan of Rush, and look forward to all the perfections and flaws I've been reading about. I am so glad that something like this is available and in the Widescreen format. My 84 inch wide screen TV will serve as the perfect tool to watch this show. Just as soon as I finsh this pre-review, I will buy the DVD. Looking forward to a new studio album here, and I'm sure their are plans in the works. If you have never been to a Rush Concert or have never heard Rush before, it's an aquired taste. I loved this music. Can only hope the crowd doesn't detract from the music as it did in Chicago.........Have a great day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fitting my new cables.","review":"Last week i upgraded my speaker cables.

JTF"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush: Better With Age","review":"Some bands some, some bands go, some remain the same. Rush is a band that defies all that. Like the finest wine, Rush has proven to better themselves with age. At it shows in front of the 40,000+ Brazilians crammed in a soccer arena. How many Rock bands are there where the fans will actually sing to an instrumental? Yes...these fans are singing to YYZ! And it's heard clearly over the music. This is definately a MUST for die hard fans and new fans alike. Rush puts on a flawless performance, and the extras are great as well. Very few have seen Rush \\"behind-the-scenes\\" Well, here's your chance if you're curious. Everything about Rush is captured on this DVD. And to think...this almost wasn't! (Explained on Disc 2)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio must be a mistake.","review":"Ok, I've read all the reviews and decided to finally buy it and check it out for myself. My conclusion is that the audio couldn't be any worse. There is absolutely no excuse for it to be this bad. Especially since this was a fairly recent concert. It's almost like there must have been a mistake. It's a shame that you have to drastically alter your system's settings just so you can listen to it. Who knows, if enough fans complain, maybe they'll remix it. If you want to hear what a great concert DVD should sound like, check out King Crimson deja Vrooom or Eyes Wide Open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, i've been there....","review":"I've been on this show from RUSH in Rio...By that time i already loved the RUSH history...Albuns like Caress of Steel, Hemispheres, A Farewell to Kings and Moving Pictures are Heavy rock classics! The selection of the songs are PERFECT...besides 1 or 2 songs, i'll say they choose the BEST from their extense catalogue! There's so many classics like FREEWILL, THE TREES and VILLA STRANGIATO ...WOW!! I love that show, which i think is a GREAT perspective from RUSH's history and may create many new RUSH fans!!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL IT SHOULD BE","review":"THIS IS A GREAT DVD AND A MUST BUY FOR ALL MUSIC FANS. The interviews and DVD quality is excellent. I have read some of the reviews that put down the sound quality. I found it to be fine. I just cranked it up on my new Sony System and no complaints. I don't know what these elitist snobs are complaining about? The DVD sounds great. Enjoy it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I am not sure where folks are coming from when they deem this a great video concert. I have seen Rush in concert 5 times and this does not measure up. Not only does it not measure up but there are several DVD's released by Rush that are better than this one such as R30 or Exit Stage Left.The audio quality on this DVD is not very good for a concert released in this day and age. On top of that, I find that the set list leaves alot to be desired although admitedley, I am a fan of the earlier rush days pre-dating Grace Under Pressure. Surely, many will disagree with me but for me, I don't find that this was even worth my money. I do recommed R30 or Exit Stage Left though. None of the DVD's released by Rush exceed the performances that I saw from the band in the late 1970's though.Rock On,DJ Craig"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt do the band justice","review":"I love Rush, and I saw them live on the Vapor Trails tour and was blown away. Sadly, this DVD doenst represent that experience at all.The mix is awful. Filming at the end of the tour was a mistake, they all looked tired and Geddy sounded bad. Worst of all, it was filmed and edited like a superbowl half time show. Whoever made this movie wasn't a Rush fan. You never get to see the guys actually playing their intruments, which is the essence of this band. Instead, they attempted to make them look like 20yo rock stars which just didnt work.My gold standard concert DVD is Queen live at Wembley. That is a 18 year old performance which makes this Rush DVD look very weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"The BEST RUSH tour in years but DVD does not capture it","review":"I am long time Rush fan (since 1979). I own almost every album and video. I have seen Rush live many times, and I have to say the Vapor Trails tour was the best Rush tour I have ever seen, but this DVD does not capture that. From the 2nd disk we learn the road crew got to Rio late and that the set up time was \\"rushed\\". There was no sound check or video check and this shows in this DVD.The audio in not in sync with the video. Also the editing is terrible (Alex soloing and video not on him). Rush should of not filmed in a huge outdoor stadium, an indoor arena would have been better. Were they tring to copy Iron Maiden in Rio? This DVD could of been a lot better. Save your money for the \\"Exit Stage Left\\" DVD whenever it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"I played this DVD and went straight to \\"The Pass\\" and was simply in tears during much of the song. This song has always spoken to me, as it reminds me of a dear friend who died a tragic death in college. This DVD was worth it just for that song, for me.So, buy the DVD and find the song that speaks to you the most. Regardless of the mix, you'll enjoy hearing the music and seeing this class act, Rush, perform. Yes, the mix gets rough at times, but this DVD delivers such a great performance from Rush and shows what an awesome fan base Rush has in Brazil!The documentary included on the 2nd disc, by the way, is wonderful; and it's great to see Neil, Alex, and Geddy share their experiences and a joke or two!I think Rush's 2002 Vapor Trails tour and the release of this DVD (and CD) was a job well-done!These guys are my heros!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE SHOW","review":"This DVD is absolutely incredible. I saw Rush three times on this tour, and the DVD is a perfect translation. The double-disc set captures the band in a raw and energetic way. I was amazed by how true the sound was to the actual concert!! I never expected Rush to release something quite this well done. While some say that the sound quality is too rough, the previous release (\\"Different Stages\\" 3-CD set) has a more polished sound. This DVD footage is more similar to the early guitar-driven days of RUSH.Hopefully Rush will take inspiration from this past tour and continue in the same direction...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The saddest thing in life is \\"UNREALIZED POTENTIAL\\"","review":"If this concert were recorded in 1979 I would have thought it the best thing since the invention of the solid body electric guitar. However, the year is 2003, and we've grown to expect more from a DVD. The sound quality is bootlegish (is that a word?), and although the video quality is good, the editing is aweful. Rush is a \\"musicians\\" rock band. Musicians like to see extended shots of their favorite playors perform difficult passages and solos. The cd is better, because the video doesn't distract you from the performance.Overall I would not recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior","review":"Excellent, considering the camara equipment wasn't the best available. The DVD captures the band in their legendary form, and the documentary disc shows the all of the work that goes into a concert, particulary their concerts, while giving the viewer a taste of their personal side.I'm giving it 5 stars because of the material, 4 stars on the quality of the recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Rush but....","review":"I have ripped the audio tracks from the DVD (both the stereo track and the 6-channel mix) and it is UNLISTENABLE. This is the FIRST time this has ever happened for any concert DVD in my huge collection. Unbelievably bad for any concert DVD (even a bootleg), let alone a band like Rush who has generally put out quality recordings. The person in charge of this mix should never be allowed in a studio again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush - 'Rush In Rio' (Rounder) 4 1/2 stars","review":"Review no.524. I've never been what you would call THE biggest Rush fan, but I've seen them in concert like five(5)times since their 'Permanent Waves' tour. Despite the many rather varied-opinionated reviews of this music 2-DVD title, I was very pleased with what the 28-song concert of this release had to offer. Basically, if you're a Rush fan, you should have no problem with it. As for the sound quality, keep in mind that this is a 'live concert' and the sound MAY, probably will(in fact) differ from their studio CD's. Some of the tunes I was semi-thrilled to see them playing were \\"Tom Sawyer\\", \\"The Trees\\", their unforgetable \\"Closer To The Heart\\", \\"Red Sector A\\", \\"2112\\", their gem of a progressive epic \\"By-Tor And The Snow Dog\\" and the final encore \\"Working Man\\". Picture quality and cinematography are superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RUSH STILL RULES","review":"Growing up in Texas in the late seventies, early eighties when Rush first exploded on the scene may make me a little biased, but this DVD kick's ass.

It gives you a feeling of being there which is wonderful. But if you care about actually listening to the music, it is about the worst sounding concert DVD I have ever heard. If you put the sound in 2 channel it is marginally better. The sound is better than a bootleg, but that's about all your can say. It's just a big mush.I got two DVD's this holiday season, the other being the Peter Gabriel Growing Up Tour and that is an example of how a DVD concert should sound. The Rush DVD is the opposite end of the spectrum. I won't be listening to it a second time.I would like to give it zero stars because without sound you have nothing, but the video is well done and its still Rush and it gives you the chance to see a full concert, so I have to give it two stars. I'm really trying to warn anybody who would consider awful sound to be a showstopper. Otherwise, go ahead and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound, to be endured rather than enjoyed","review":"I've never been a Rush fan, but always felt I could be one. Never owned a Rush album, but heard all the radio cuts, and had seen one awesome, high-energy performance piece on VH1. I bought this DVD on impulse figuring I'd be in for a treat.There was excellent musicianship, good energy from the band and crowd, good camera work. But, the sound was BAD. And, that's bad, since we are talking about MUSIC.Ugh. The audio was muddy, and Geddy Lee's vocals were buried so deep I could not have followed them at all if I had not know words to a third of the songs. It did improve slightly as the concert progressed, but not satisfactorily, as at least one other reviewer, here, stated.I'm surprised the DVD got released in this state."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Ruined It","review":"This could have been a fantastic piece of work for Rush fans. Great quality video and good song selection by the band. However, whoever mixed the sound should lose their job or be shot, maybe both. Garbled muddy sound made this unwatchable to this Rush fan. I recommend R30 instead. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"product not as advertised","review":"This DVD is not formatted in anamorphic widescreen as advertised. I'm returning my copy as soon as possible. It's just shocking that a band like Rush, who has such a reputation for fine music, would let this get past them. They won't even allow you to discuss the issue on Rush's official message board -- why is that? This message board is run by the \\"gang\\" at PerfektWerks. So they don't want the truth about the product getting out? PerfektWerks has done more to give Rush a black eye than any other entity. So I guess we see how the honest man really IS the most endangered species.Finally, the editing on the show is way too quick. If you appreciated the fine work of Derivative Inc on the concert animations, you'll find little of it represented here.Unfortunate that Rush fans have waited so long for a DVD and now get this inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Picture, Horrible sound.","review":"I Have almost all RUSH albums, but I sold back this DVD.

There are some shining moments (Natural Science). However, the sound is indeed horrible (the CD is even worse). I had intended to buy the DVD for the live performance by the band. Instead I was presented with 2 hours of listening to the crowd sing. Looking forward to see Show of Hands on DVD someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Crap","review":"I think this may be the most disappointing music DVD purchase I've ever made. As a huge Rush (and Neil Peart) fan for years and a dedicated drummer, I have to say the sound quality of this recording is just plain inexcusable. When I first saw this DVD I couldn't wait to get it home and watch it. Now I think it will likely only get a single viewing (with the possible exception of the Neil Peart drum solo). I as I watched this for the first time I couldn't believe that a band so dedicated to musicianship and quality song writing could release such crap. This mix reminds me of going to a local bar where there's no sound engineer and the guitar player is playing a cranked 100W Marshall-and that (and the crowd noise) is the only thing you hear! And, by the way, someone happened to stick a cheap microphone way out in the crowd and record it. If sound quality is at all important to you, save your money. It's just plain bad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crowd Noise. Where's the vocals?","review":"I was so excited about seeing this dvd because I read a lot of great reviews.

All it gave me was a headache, and I've got concert dvds heavier than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Love Rush, but vocals are almost non-existent. Tremendous disappointment. Don't waste your money on this one. They should rework the audio and then try to sell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Performance","review":"This is an excellent DVD. My suggestion would be to watch Disc 2 first. After watching the documentary and seeing what they went through to put this show together, only then can one truly appreciate the level of talent these guys perform at. This show is edited to where no one shot last more than five or so seconds. Great for people with ADD. The camerawork is excellent with shots seemingly from inside Neil's kit. The sound on the DVD is good to excellent. (Following the song \\"Ghost Rider\\" Neil breaks one of his sticks and you can hear the wood cracking). Conversly, the sound quality on the companion CD set is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"great concert grat group ever!!!!!!","review":"its a grat concert one of the best i've seen in my life the band sound great, i don't understand the people who wrote the sound its badly i dont think so, first take a few minutes and read the book inside the dvd and you find the reason and the quality of the mix the basic idea of the band its have a concert when you can hear the special rection of the people in the concert its amazing hear and see the people how they live each song, singing, jumping this feelin you cant find easy in other concerts great show my opinion if you want to buy this dvd BUY IT ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the money","review":"What can I say...

I wish they added more easter eggs like more rare stuff. I got the '75 vid on cdr already so I am not worried about it.

This has to be the worst dvd I have ever owned. The audio on the dvd is so subpar I would not recommend it to anyone. Maybe they were trying to cover up Geddy's failing voice with all the bass. If you would like two hours of listening to Neil's base drum reverberating in your ears, this is the dvd for you.

It sounds like they just mikes it from the back row. The combo of distortion and lack of mid causes ear fatique. The picture is poor, too. It looks like they used old betacams (Check out Springsteen's DVD to see what can be done with HD!) and the shots are constantly change with no coherance. I'll still cling to my LD of Exit- Stage left. I am surprised to see a recent concert look and sound as bad as this. Even some of the shots are shakey, as if filmed with a camcorder. Some shots aren't even in focus! I am sure that some of these things won't be noticed if you are watching on a small Kmart TV with junk speakers like bose, hooked up to junk electronics.My equipment- Sony 65\\"wv600 (calibrated with AVS), outlaw 750 amp (200w per channel), Outlaw 1050 receiver, Infinity 2112 sub (2 12\\" servo woofs, 200w), 12 modded LX5 speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"An new low in sound quality","review":"These recordings CD and DVD sound terrible. Save your money. The positive reviews must be written by record company relatives because these is simply sub par merchandise. It's too bad I can't get my money back for an opened item. I'd take it back if I could but they would only take it back if it's defective, which it is, but apparently everyone elses is too.I've been a rush fan for over 25 years and I feel cheated by this puchase that I made based on the RUSH's reputation.The music companies wonder why sales are down. They blame piracy and the Internet. Maybe if they put out some decent quality product people would buy more. If you don't believe the negative reviewers here, \\"preview\\" it FIRST so you don't waste any of your hard earned cash on this lousy recording of a truly GREAT band.Maybe if we all team together we can get a class action lawsuit against the music company, and get our money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"All The Rush I Can Get","review":"I am still giving this 5 stars even though some of the audio is a tad on the muddy side, but as an Australian who has never had he pleasure of seeing Rush here, or hearing them on radio at all for that matter, this is a must.This brings back the memories of Canada and the times I saw them in Montreal on the 1990 \\"Presto\\" tour and the 1994 \\"Counterparts\\" tour. They are simply great live, putting on a diverse and nearly 3 hour performance, so you get your monies worth on this DVD.The bonus material on disc 2 is also very interesting, and gives those who do not have access to North American music media, an insight into the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware, this is a poor purchase","review":"First off , I love Rush. Truly one of Canada's best rock bands. I also love a good live DVD, as I have quite a number in my collection.The performance: The guys as the expression goes \\"were at the top of their game\\". Excellent song selection for this live performance. The crowd was right into this concert.The video: The picture quaity on this DVD is OK (average). There is a good collection of various angles and zooms to create a imagery of the stage.The audio: This has by far the worst audio on any live DVD I've ever listened to. The bass is quiet and distorted. The crowd level on the mix is rediculously loud. It takes away from the music, and only by virtue of putting forth a strong effort could I actually sit down and listen to the whole concert. Really folks, the audio on this DVD is that bad.Do yourself a favour, go buy any other live DVD because this one is really aweful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video, Horrible Audio.","review":".I am a graduate of the Institute of Audio Research (audioschool.com) in NYC and I'm a professional studio engineer with a trained ear.Unless you wanna feel like you are watching the band from the lawn seats or noise bleed section I wouldn't waste your money. The audio has WAY too much audience and way too much guitar. I guess Alex mixed this one. This is nothing new, most live Rush releases has the same problem. I am selling my DVD on Ebay after I right this.Simple point: 95% of Rush fans are Neil Fans period!! So, why would you release something that completely buries the drums so they sound completely wimpy, thin and barely audible?Come on Rush - let's get it right. I wanna hear the band not 10 billion people in the audience. Fire your mastering engineers because they truly don't have a clue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio is fine, video is UNWATCHABLE","review":"The music sounds fine. It's live Rush, no surprises at all. Good versions of good tunes. The video portion of this DVD is sickening, and will possibly cause a seizure with all the quick editing. Count how many seconds a given shot stays on the screen.

OH, WELL, I do not care, many fans most likely have unilateral high freq hearing loss anyway, besides, it doesn't matter what the reviewers say, we will still purchase the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to say it, but this DVD just blows","review":"I am a longtime and very serious RUSH fan - this DVD was a huge dissapointment - the technical problems prevented the group from actually recording their music. Instead, we are listening to the audience sing notes of instrumentals. I wanted to hear RUSH with the audience in the backround and instead I was listening to the audience with RUSH in the backround."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush Still Rocks","review":"This was an awesome concert, and these guys show that they still 'have it'. Maybe it's 'cause it was their last show of the tour, but look at the smile on Geddy's face - they really still love performing. Some people complain about the crowd noise in this DVD ... come on - it's a CONCERT for crying out loud! If you want perfect accoustics and studio sound, buy the albums.The tour 'documentary' was neat insight to the band, what it's like to tour, and how intense some fans are! Face it, 30 years later, these guys still rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush in Rio","review":"This is just what us Rush fans have been waiting for...

The audience in Rio is obviously pumped that Rush would finally perform there. Geddy, Alex and Neil pick up on this and produce the best performance of their careers. What's even more remarkable is that there was no sound check done before this video was shot, due to problems with the weather. The gear arrived late, which put the road crew behind schedule. Anyways, there's energy throughout the entire performance. I'm a huge Rush fan and I can unequivically say, go out and get this video.

The camera jumps on almost every beat of the music to various two second shots of the audience, the stage, the lights, the performers, and just about anything, etc. Who in their right mind watches a concert that way??? Its like disco video. The video should just focus on the performers and the stage and dwell on the musicians. When the video is jumping around every two seconds it completely distracts from the performance. I'd rather just listen to the CD. Its too bad, they really ruined what could have been a good overall concert DVD, because the actual music is good. I'm gonna sell my DVD, I'm that disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Band, BAD DVD","review":"The reviewers who noted that the mixing and camera shots on this thing sucked made understatements. It is unlistenable and unwatchable. This is by far the worst of the 50 concert DVD's I have in my collection. What a tragedy! For those who feel this is the pinnacle of entertainment, I recommend that they watch and listen to Roger Waters \\"Live in the Flesh\\", Eric Clapton \\"One More Car One More Rider\\", or even AC/DC \\"Live at Donnington\\" and THEN tell all of the objective guys they don't know what they are talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST SOUNDING DVD OF ALL TIMES","review":"Oh My God!!! They screwed it up. I was at the PORTO ALEGRE concert a few days earlier and was anxiously waiting for this DVD.They screwed up the mix! It sounds awful, you cannot hear the vocals and the bass is muddy. The cameras have a different quality or calibration which makes the video quality uneven.But that is only a small concern. The big problem lies in the audio. The sound quality of their latest two studio releases was terrible because of the too damn loud mastering approach. Now someone screwed up this DVD (and apparently the CD release too).Plus they didn't include an uncompressed LPCM audio track, just lousy MP3-like Dolby Digital, and not even a DTS track!Someone must call them and tell them. They are probably deaf after so many years of endless touring!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Once, twice, three times a lady","review":"Thanks to this book, I recently reconciled my pubic and private self, and I have to say, it was the most fulfilling, emotionally satisfying night of my life.

I initially seasoned mine 4 times (as suggested by the seller), but with lard instead of oil. The patine is now perfectly non-stick and almost bullet-proof.Takes a bit of initial work, but this is now truely my most prized piece of cookware; even better than my stainless/copper italian pots.The flavor that the pan contributes to the food is absolutely unbelievable. Furthermore, although the pan is quite \\"rough\\" looking, it's incredibly durable. My impression is that it's almost impossible to permanently damage this pan...

When moderately full, it balances perfectly on the stove burner. Handle stays cool during cooking too. Very utilitarian, very excellent multi-purpose cooking implement. Took a bit to get it clean (baking soda, vinegar and a lot of elbow grease with steel wool, and then normal dish soap) before I seasoned it, but as soon as I was finished with the seasoning process (a few hours in the oven and on the stove with peanut oil), this is my new primary cooking tool! Absolutely perfect! It heats very evenly and after seasoning is the best nonstick cookware I've ever used. Vegetable fried rice with no scrubbing cleanup - General Tso's chicken with no cleanup! makes perfect omelettes! Looks great hanging on my pot rack! Love it! great price too. I'll be using this wok for the rest of my life. Hope it's a long time. Get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Wok/Poor Seller","review":"The wok was ordered on August 22, and it arrived Sept 24.

What i really was looking for in a wok was a black steel northern style wok without a wood handle. I found that this wok stays on my gas range fairly level especially with food in it, its bottom is slightly flat so Do not bother with a wok ring mine just holds the pan in the closet. I also ordered a metal chuan, but I reverted to my bamboo spatula and spoon for cooking after the metal one started taking off the patina. This wok is so much better than trying to stir fry in a stainless steel omelet pan I have the flavor is better it cooks faster, cleans easier and is lighter.So go ahead spend the 20 bucks and get the pow wok, but watch out for the shipping costs when you order it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got my product, whats up with that!!!!","review":"I am very upset I never received my product!!!

Also, when I received the Taxcut email that the IRS had accepted my return I logged on to Taxcut to check status and get my declaration control number. Taxcut would not recognize that I had efiled and would not check for the dcn. I had to call support for about the 5th time and after some time on the phone they discovered they could access the dcn and gave it to me over the phone.

So, I went ahead and submitted again and I still have the same problem. TaxCut still thinks I haven't submitted. 3 calls to Tech Support and waiting on hold for an hour hasn't resolved squat.

The filter worked fine and removed the reflections I wanted to get rid off. Removing the filter was the problem. The ring with the threads is only about 1 mm wide and thus difficult to get a good grip on. I used a rubber band to get a better grip and struggled for quite some time to get the filter off the lens. I never had this problem with my 20+ year old 52mm Hoya polarizer. The ring with the threads is 3mm wide in the old filter which makes a big difference.

But it is definitely NOT the best album she ever put out or the collection of songs the best she ever had on an album. She probably wanted that to be the case because by then, music by artists of her generation was no longer welcome in Nashville. Its a shame because the more one listens to this the better it becomes.

I also wondered about portraying Yates as a vengeful gay man, whether there was some unconscious homophobia going on.

There is a lot on religion although Musashi said that he did not use religious ideas in his strategy. In every other translation I have read there is a strong epiphysis on practical martial arts practice, but this one seemed elusive and flighty.

The contents however were more aimed at people who might be into contact sports like boxing and other martial arts. Not that I'm saying it had no relevance to our everyday lives, sure there are some principles that could help us. But for the most part it really is catered for those samurai students, it even states it right at the beginning.

Product works just fine, just more upset that they are visually miss representing the product they are actually selling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a deluge","review":"I bought this to replace my Waterpik showerhead which had various settings.The water force is not.. a deluge but simply a nice spray. If you are looking for a lot of force it will not work unless your water pressure is very strong.Overall I like it because you can set the arm and shower head directly over you or tilted slightly towards the middle of the tub. At least you can control it from splattering outside the curtain. However, every time you move the shower arm you might need to tighten the screw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta showerhead","review":"I can't really rate the shower head.. never got it installed. head would not stay in upright posistion with water on... while attempting to tighten the thumb screws (as per instructions) swivel broke rendering it usless..

If purchased .. use extreme caution !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled!","review":"The original LA CAGE is a comic gem, and the first sequel was still somewhat amusing. If you loved them (as I did), you should probably stay away from this dreadful creature. The original leads return, as do their hated in-laws, but the wit and magic are gone. Albin and Renato become silly cartoonish figures, with none of the humanity that make these characters so memorable in the earlier films. So don't be fooled -- any resemblance between this film and LA CAGE AUX FOLLES is strictly in the eye of the producer.

The story made such an impact on me at that time in my life that it quickly became a favorite. I have continued to re-read the book every Christmas, and it has become my own holiday tradition. Now, at the age of 25, my Christmas holiday just doesn't seem complete without my yearly read of this innocent love story. I have read the story over at least 10 times and thoroughly enjoy it each time. It's my guilty pleasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"most memorable book of my childhood","review":"I read this book when I was 12; I still remember the day I bought it.

I'll never part with mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book :)","review":"Like many of the reviewers here, I've read this book when I was younger... maybe about 12 or 13 and 10 years later, I still find myself re-reading it occasionally and still enjoying it from cover to cover. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"an AWESOME book","review":"Just reading through the first couple of chapters of this book, i KNEW I'd love it. I was right. I must have read it at least 50 times already. I can EASILY relate to all of Ellen's problems. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story. I cry EVERY time i read it.

I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, to be 14 again....","review":"I encountered this book in junior-high as a gawky, awkward teen, and found the \\"Bible\\" of sorts that helped me manage. Sure, it might seem sappy and soap-opera-esqe to older readers, but to a skinny little bookworm who peered hopelessly at her crush over the pages, it meant the world. The idea that the good girl always wins, that happy endings did come to those who wait gave me hope, and a ray of conifidence at a time when girls need it most. Books are designed to bring joy and understanding to your world, and this book certainly did so to mine. As for me, well, I might still be a geeky bookworm, but at least I know that I'm writing a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This Book!!!!!","review":"I'm 21, I remember reading this book when I was in 6th or 7th grade. I immediately fell in love with this book and the story. I could easily relate to what Ellen was going through with Michael. It's scary but what she was going through was exactly what I was going through at that time with my secret crush whose now my present boyfriend (whose name was also Michael).

Essentially it just becomes a sturdy metal pole with a handle to stir the compost with.I have a small compost bin, perhaps if I had a larger one the weight of the compost would open it up or there would be a longer upstroke. However, I wouldn't bet on it. Even if I bang it on cement it doesn't open. It is sturdy and well-made but the design flaw seems to be that compost gets in the hinges and makes them stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, suspenseful read","review":"This one is definitely a winner. Not only was it seasoned with romance, but had mystery added it to it. The technique will surely keep the reader captivated and anxious to discover who is the mysterious shadow. It will make you want to know just who are the good guys and make you wonder if the one you want to be okay is not what he seems to be. However, Ms. Byrd has made a perfect combination in \\"Forget Me Not.\\" Jaclyn and Brad were great! They had some tough spots to clear up, but anything worth having is worth fighting for and waiting for.Another great read, Ms. Byrd. It certainly kept me turning the pages. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a very stupid book","review":"It follows the same plot of most romance novels. Independent, stong, but vulnerable women with secret. Independent, sexy man with secret. One or both of their families are rich and important. They are trying to unravel a mystery. They are in danger. They fall in love. Everybody gets along. They live happily ever after. End of story. How boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got a 15-year old to read....","review":"'Got this for my 15-year-old wrestler nephew.

It had lots of great wrestling history written into it as well as achievements of other great sports athletes. It was motivating and provided great insight into what mental toughness is. It shows how it is involved in every successful athletes sport. I read this book to my 8 year old son. He didn't get all of it but he enjoyed some of the stories of the historical matches and things to do with the sport of wrestling.

I love you Garth"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, what a great album","review":"As a new Garth fan, I think this ablum is a great opportunity for me get a feel of what's like in the real live concert. I think the off-key part in \\"it's your song\\" is recorded straight off the live show in Les Vagas. Garth was soo touched and he almost cried."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This album is awsome. What else would you expect from Garth Brooks?

I can't wait for Garth to tour again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent source of Garth's life-history of songs","review":"What can you say but Garth is the all-time favorite in country music and this gives you alot more than a \\"bit\\" of his history in music; especially if you don't already own his music collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Garth alright, but he musta been a bit tipsy","review":"I like Garth, don't get me wrong, but he's not himself in several of the great songs on this one. Oh, and just because it's the \\"Live\\" album don't go wanting to hear Garth sing that mystery third verse of \\"Friends in Low Places\\" cause he doesn't, he makes the audience sing it and although they do a good job, they just aren't Garth. I was very disappointed not to hear the live version of \\"Friends in Low Places\\" that I've heard on the radio and loved. Garth's timing seemed off on many songs and in general I didn't like this album, I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is with Garth Brooks","review":"Now we are talking about a man who advertises on T.V about the Grand Ole Opry and we are also talking about the same man who played Chris Gaines. How could any man who is a member of the Opry try to go into Pop rock music. Now I will only own two of Garths albums and those are his first and second ones,those are the best ones he ever made other than that forget it his music really got rediculous and kind of lame. This is a ... Box set nothing but some of his good hits here and there, I really think Box sets are ... for artists to advertise and sell because who the hell can listen to 30-40 songs by the same artist you really get tired of that artist after a while. All I'm saying is I just have been a little shaky with Garth Brooks since he released Chris Gaines he really wonders me at times if he really is country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to keep one's mouth shut...","review":"It's been said it's better to keep your mouth shut and be thought of a fool than to open it and remove all dobut. If anybody ever doubted Garth's talent, this cd removes all doubt. The man is without vocal talent. The track, \\"It's your song\\" is such a hack of a song I'm surprised it even made the cd. Garth cannot carry a note and pulls off every vocal trick in the book to cover up that fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Was Horrible, Just Horrible","review":"Goodness, can I possibly be the only person out here that doen't think this cd is good. I honestly can think of one good thing to say. So I'll just say nothing at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garth insults real musicians","review":"In a time and place when real musicians gather - they shall systematically scorn the way charletons like Garth Brooks have fooled the musically uneducated into believing he is actually an artist and not just a media-manipulating businessman with no more integrity than Donald Trump. Like the money-hungry Trump, Brooks' talent is at least questionable. This live cd goes a long way in proving that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great sample of a Garth concert.","review":"Of all his albums, this one is probably the one most catered to the \\"Garth-o-holic\\". With the extra verses, the fan sing-a-long, this truely captures the audistic feeling of a G-man concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Has there ever been a more arrogant egomaniac than garth brooks,or chris gaines,or whatever his name is this week? How this guy ever got famous is beyond me. If you want to hear real COUNTRY then go buy a George Strait,Alan Jackson,Merle Haggard,or George Jones cd. They may put brook's albums in the country section of the store but it definately is not COUNTRY! Please retire Garth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously one for the fans","review":"This is one of those cd's that you'll love if you're a fan and hate if you're not. It won't win anyone over. Garth has strayed so far from what I heard on his first couple of albums. He seemed so sincere and real then. Now it's like one big marketing gimmick after another. It's quite sickening to me. But he's the multi-millionaire and I'm not so what do I know? As far as the music on this disc goes, I agree with the person who said the sound quality is poor. And I just hate it when the artist stops singing and lets the audience sing. We don't pay to hear fans sing, we pay to hear the artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a huge country Fan but this blew me away!","review":"By no means am I a country music fan. it's usually just the same \\"twang\\" and \\"whine\\" sound from every artist who takes the mike. However, Double Live opened my eyes. I listened to it from disc 1 through disc 2 and by the end of it, I was truly amazed. The long edit of \\"friends in Low Places\\" was amazing while \\"Thunder Rolls\\" kept me asking for more. And who could hate the amazing Live versions of \\"2 pi?a coladas\\" or \\"American Honky-Tonk Bar Association\\" This is a must have set from a truley gifted performer and singer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Dull","review":"I admit I have not heard the entire set, fortunately our visit to family ended before the second CD was played. In a country where Budweiser is the king of beer, Macdonalds the most popular food outlet and television the national pastime what can one expect? Generic 'country', tepid and tedious. False sentiment, cliche and tuneless vocals infect every track on this dreadful collection. Made for stronger stomachs than mine. Truly the untalented performing for the undiscerning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recording Studios are sometimes better than live","review":"While the music was as described we were disappointed by the background noise of the live audience.

This album manages to capture the electricity, the chemistry and interation with the crowd, the real feeling of regret of not actually being there. A fantastic 'live' album covering all of the hits and more 'Thunder Rolls', 'Pina Colada', 'To Make You feel My Love'..they're all here...Even 10yrs on, the songs still connect and you get reminded all over again of just how good this guy is...Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the best!!","review":"This album has made going to bed feel like I was at his concert.

It is a must for all Garth fans! It really gives you the feelin' like you're at the Garth concert. (that's if you got a good stereo) I bought it the first day it came out, Nov. 18, 1998. I got the first \\"g\\" edition and the Texas Stadium pack. I'm still collecting the rest. If you don't have it yet, BUY IT NOW!!! It's the best CD in 1998 for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Garth album yet!","review":"I was given this album for Christmas and spent the entire break playing it over and over again.

Ths is a pure Garth concert at its best. For those of you who want to knock Garth Brooks, Let's see you do better. And the whole point of a live ablum is for it to be like a concert, and for GB, that is his fans singing back to him!This Cd is the greatest!!!

Even though they misrepresent two different genres altogether, they are soulless cousins. This is a good representation of his work, which, however, does not mean enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Worst Yet!","review":"This recording of live songs shows his uncanny ability to sing off-key. The songs themselves were great hits, but these recordings are not easy to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not Garth live!","review":"Garth Brooks is the greatest live entertainer I've ever seen and no album can hope to come close to the real experience although a few tracks including \\"Unanswered Prayers\\" does come close. I'm a bit bemused by the reviewer who bought this album and then complained about crowd interaction!! I'd sooner hear the studio tracks but I'm such a fan of this guy that I'd buy a CD full of nursery rhymes if was on vocals. If you want to experience Garth at his best then just buy his self-titled debut album or No Fences. Got everything??? Then buy this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Is The Lonliest Number","review":"The only way Garth's goofy, half-witted songs could get any worse is by playing them live. Here he succeeds. Hey Clem - don't spend your unemployment cheque on this cd! I've heard better music blowing into the top of an old jar of whisky. In other words this cd could drive you to drinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some People Should Not Sing Live!","review":"I have heard most of the songs from this CD on my local radio station the past couple of weeks and could not believe my ears. The first time I heard Garth go off key as much as he did, I thought it must be a mistake. However, as I heard more songs from this set, it actually got worse. On numerous songs he is either going sharp or flat. Most singers tend to do one or the other when they are off key. Garth does both equally well. I have never heard something this bad from a record company before. While I knew Garth was not the best singer out there, this release just magnifies the situation greatly. While I like Garth and think he is a great entertainer, I will not buy this CD. My ears cannot handle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality....Don't Buy Into All The Garth Hype!","review":"I listened to a friends CD over the last few days (I did not want to be a part of the buying hype of the first week). Almost all the songs are drowned out by crowd noise to the point of becoming unnerving. Garth may be a great showman but this recording shows what a poor singer and how fragile his voice is. I am amazed that they chose some of these tracks (these were the best ones?). As far as the huge Garth marketing machine for this CD (and all other projects) I hope some of these Garth fans will save their money and buy just one copy of this CD (Not 7!!)...Garth's music is all show and very little substance..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"album\\" deserves no stars","review":"Do not buy this CD! First of all, all these songs are on Garth's previous albums, and they sound better in the studio! Second of all it's just a gimmick, he wants to sell a million copies of this waste in one day! It sounds impossible but since this is a 2 CD set, every album sold counts as 2. This means he only has to sell 500,000 copies to reach a million in sales. This is ridiculous! Why doesn't every artist put their albums on 2 CDS? Then everyone would go platinum. The songs are not bad at all, but the quality of them live is not the same as on the radio. Really this album is a waste of money and it will be a sad day if he does manage to sell a million copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's one of his best in a LONG time!","review":"My entire life I have been a HUGE fan of Garth! Everytime I hear a new song of his, I'm amazed. However, this album took my breathe away. I really didn't know what to say after hearing live versions of his biggest hits like, Two Pina Collada's, Ain't Goin Down 'Til The Sun Comes Up, and Friends In Low Places. After hearing this and then the radio version, I was totally shocked at the difference. I think that this was the perfect thing to put in stores before his break from the music buisness. Thanks a million Garth!One of your MANY friends in low places, CRYSTAL WHITEHEAD =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought it and have not taken it out of the CD player yet! I would recommend this CD to people who are Country music fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Garth at his absolute best!","review":"The Garth Double Live CD is the culmination of the greatest songs ever! Garth Brooks is an exciting and wonderful entertainer and this enthusiasm certainly comes across in these two CD's. The live concert was absolutely fabulous and hearing these CD's brings me back there! This album is a must-buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth Brooks' live versions are a fresh sound for an old hit","review":"I don't think there are any Garth songs that I don't like. If you are a Garth fan then I'm sure you have heard the third verse to Friends in Low Places or the fourth verse to Thunder Rolls. If not, they are both on this cd set. I also have his greatest hits and wasn't sure if I wanted the same songs. It was worth it because like I said, his live versions all have a new sound. The only thing I don't like about this set is that there are only 25 songs. That's why I bought his Boxed Set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth Brooks at his best!","review":"I am a Garth Brooks fan and I think that this is the best collection of songs every released.

THAT WAY IT WOULD BE A BETTER COLLECTERS ITEM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of the Best Garth has done","review":"I was truly dissappointed with this live album. I am a big Garth brooks fan and I didn't like the way this was engineered. I assumed it would be a continuous Live album instead of cutting in and out within every two songs. Plus he sounds better live in concert than on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of his hits, at a great price","review":"I truly enjoy listening to Brooks's music, although I was disapointed every now and then when the audience sang. But it is a really good CD. I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garth has once again proven why he is the ultimate star....","review":"For any Garth fan this album tops it all off.

Keep up the great job Garth!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much crowd noise in backgroung to enjoy lyrics","review":"A few songs very good but don't purchase to hear the \\"famous\\" third verse in Low Places. If you just want to listen to Garth as background music while you are doing your daily chores it OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the true LIVE expierence.","review":"Very Good CD. The only thing I did not care for was the studio dub overs. They are very obvious and takes away from the true Garth Live expierence. But as for the rest of the CD including the new songs, Exellent as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan of Garth but not maniac.Surely not the best from Garth!","review":"I was so excited to get my hands on this double album. But that was all!!! I'd rather sit and listen back to the \\"No fences\\" and \\"Robin' the wind\\". That was the good days of Garth though he made a good come back with \\"Seven\\". But definately not with this Double Live. Good collection though, but makes you wonder how a recording company can go so wrong, by putting out in the market an album with such a bad quality. But this is I guess how the music marketing business goes around. You take a singer, you make him big enough so people can follow him blinded and then you start putting out albums. No one is \\"The Best\\"!!! There are so many great singers with great songs performing here and there but it's just a shame that they go unnotticed. But anyway thankfully I got his old albums to listen to,among with so many other great country singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Live Review","review":"I think this is one of Garth's best Cd's ever made. You get to hear all of his old classics as well as a few new songs and add in lyrics to some of his old classics such as \\"The Thunder Rolls\\" and \\"Friends in Low Places\\" These are both two of his best songs and are on with extended lyrics to the song. This CD is awesome!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hype from the King of Marketing","review":"If ever a song showed that Garth Brooks voice is truly mediocre, it would have to be \\"It's Your Song\\". The beginning of this song sounds like an amateur on karaoke night. True, Garth has had some fun \\"ditties\\" over his career, but for the most part, he is the result of relentless hype both by himself and the recording industry. As pop music goes, Garth's songs are fun, but he should hardly be held in the esteem he is. And this (double) album shows us just why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost and Found!","review":"I had looked for this this product for long time now, and finally I found it!I am very satisfied with the product, the delivery time and also in which way my order was handled and how my product was packaged.Thank U!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the true Garth Fan","review":"Obviously anyone who really dogs this cd is not a true Garth fan and didn't even bother going to his concerts. Only those who did will know what this cd means to them. It brings back the whole concert experience and yes the crowd singing is part of that. Audience participation is what bonds Garth and his fans. So if you \\"didn't pay to hear the crowd sing\\" you didn't get it. Rather you don't get it. I haven't bought this cd yet but be certain it is on my wish list. Play it, listen and relive the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of all time!","review":"I am a chronic Garth fan, and no song moves me more than 'The Dance'.

What I got was a very poorly plotted story full of inconsequential characters that doesn't really start to get anywhere until exactly halfway through when we are finally introduced to the character whose actions are the very reason this story is happening in the first place. Historical personages are thrown in so half assed I almost feel embarrased for them. I haven't read any of Saberhagen's other Dracula books, and I'm sorry to say I'm in no great hurry to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening","review":"At first, I thought this would be a another of Saberhagen's works to be treasured, to be placed on my bookshelf next to his Swords series. However, the believable characters and highly entertaining historical ties were greatly overshadowed by the perverse behavior of many of the book's characters. It would be redundant to call that sort of thing \\"gratuitous\\" innuendo. This would have been a great one, were it not for the numerous disgusting passages found therein. My copy of this book will be a helpful firestarter next time I go camping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two of my favorite subjects","review":"As a fan of most fiction related to the French Revolution and as a seeker of the perfect Dracula, I was pleasantly surprised that a book I was drawn to more by the guillotine than the vampires may wind up leading me to my answer. I may be at somewhat of an advantage, already being familiar with the historical references and other literary characters, but I find this to be a highly skilled connection of different worlds of fact and fiction. I am highly dissapointed that several books in the series seem to be out of print, although I know they will not share the setting that attracted my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't recommend this","review":"This is my first Saberhagen book, and it is also my last--poor writing style, boring, put me to sleep every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longwinded","review":"I loved the \\"Dracula Tapes\\" take on the vampire legend.

It covers almost everything you need to know about Python. The \\"Core Tip\\", \\"Core Note\\" and \\"Core Style\\" sections are especially useful and helpful.

I have a 2004 Powerbook G4 running OS 10.4.8 , not some ancient computer. She had no idea as to why the drive would not mount, not even offering the idea that the usb port might not supply the drive with enough power. She was rather rude about the whole matter to boot!

I contacted customer service (a bad experience in itself) and they agreed to exchange my faulty product for a new one, and to reimburse me for the return shipping costs incurred upon me (which I have yet to see after 7 months).A new hardrive was sent upon my return of the original. It worked fine for several months, but like the first is a faulty product. I can no longer retrieve and play the music/movie files I have stored on it.

So did some shopping online and read all reviews. Decided to get the WD160GB. I got this device at a good deal from Amazon.com and it arrived on time as promised. So the first impression was impressive. This device works without any installation, use it just like any other flash drive. There's some kind of set up which takes less than a minute. So getting started is that easy. The speed of read and writing is, I would say, amazing for a drive of this capacity. Have to wait and see if this gets affected with decreasing storage size (as I load the memory with my files & documents). There's a little vibration during read & write process, but very low level that it can only be felt by touching the drive during read or write. So don't bother about other comments that claims this device vibrates. All machines however small it is will vibrate no matter what. Overall, it worth my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great .... but then it died :(","review":"** Update **If your hard drive crashes or seems like it died ... unfortunately, you're going to have to format it and start over!

Hopefully you keep your receipt and original box.* * * *The best feature about this external hard drive is that it's so skinny and light weight. I have an external hard drive much like this one by SimpleDrive, but it's about twice as thick and noticeably heavier. The Passport drive is much better for me since I usually stick my hard drive in my purse before going to work and it takes up very little space (less space than my wallet!)

I suppose the only tradeoff is that for this size and with USB self power, you can't yet get a 9600 drive this big (160GB) and a space so small, but the WD160 drives are as fast as my internal drives and they look fantastic.

I figure I can live with that over having to carry a bulky power cord around, but neither my PC or my Mac want to read files directly from it, I have to pull them back down onto the internal hard drive before it can read them.

It displays the ability of the recorder to speak, significantly to the 21st century, not in spite of, but because of its unique design. This, of course, can only be accomplished by masters of the instrument(s). For those familiar with early music, you will enjoy the interpretation of La Bataille, a well known piece.

But this album is slowed down. Much more of a reggae/dubwise feel here. REALLY cool stuff, especially the bass, drums and organ work.Gotta love that organ on \\"Dub for Schooling.

Basically you can easily mold it to the shape of your dashboard, and it will keep that shape after you pick it up unless you move it back into a different position. It's also very \\"sticky\\" (but NOT adhesive, just \\"grippy\\"), which should cause it to not move during a drive.This thing is obviously very high quality.

I bought it for my fiance' who drive like she's in the Indy 500 every day. She has an Acura RSX and the unit just won't stay on her dash. Her sister has a Honda Accord and the unit sticks like glue.

The \\"slip-free\\" feet are anything but - which leaves your RoadMate flying into the back seat on your next application of the brakes, and sliding down the dash the rest of the time.

Even the slightest touch from a finger would make it slide down. Those of you who are clean freaks like me, BEWARE. Products like armour all which leave a protective coating on your dash will further reduce the grip of this stand!

It works great and keeps the unit solidly in position on the dash. However, I wish it did not have to be so heavy. It is really going to weigh down my briefcase/suitcase when I take the GPS on trips (On the other hand, I can use it to do arm curls in my hotel room when I am on the road!). I would prefer to bring the suction cup mount on trips, but the dash mount attaches with four screws to back of the GPS holder. You must use a screwdriver to remove the dash mount from the holder in order to transfer to the suction mount. I'm not sure why Magellan simply did not allow for the dash mount to be easily slipped on and off the GPS holder the way the suction cup mount works."},{"rating":"2","title":"GPS Dash Mount Stand","review":"I'm writing this review quite a while after I got the product, but one important thing that I remember is that Magellan sells this on their website for about $40, but I found it for about $20 here on Amazon.Also, this item simply rocks. You will see other review that say it slides over the dashboard and a few otherst that say they don't have that problem. I don't have that probelm, so I'm with the guy who thinks whether it slides or not depends on how your dash is designed and maybe how much Armorall you use on it.I also agree that, for those of you who hare having slip and slide probelm, buying one of those flat gel things that are supposed to hold Cell Phones and PDA's and stuff to go under your stand is very likely to fix the problem.The stand is definitley worth the $20.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not survive in the long term","review":"Bought this watch because of the large dial and slim for size design.

If you like this you may like Harney and Sons Mother's Bouquet which also has rosebuds and citrus peel to the mix. It is a very fine herbal drink, but most afternoons if I'm not drinking spicy black tea I like a light refreshing white or green tea. I very rarely drink herbals unless I'm off to bed.

But what in the world caused the bottom of the pan to bubble like that?!I have had this set for less than a week, so I'm taking it back to the store I bought it from. I'm so grateful that I didn't buy this set online."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!","review":"I bought this cookware set a few months ago and despite diligence in hand washing and drying and careful cooking by monitoring temperatures and utensils (I only used the ones that came with the pots) my pans look absolutely horrible. I don't even want to bother getting another set via the warranty (which is not a lifetime one like advertised but rather 15 years). It's only been a few months and I'm looking for new pots. Good side is that they are pretty but beware. They'll not be pretty for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusted","review":"These pans aren't exactly dish-washer safe - they rusted after one use.

I got the next dance was a huge disco hit in 1979 and Denise's vocals on this track are excellent. She is a VERY VERY under rated UK artist. All I can say is I was there when this was released thought it was amazing then and still do,You will not be disappointed by this album if only for that track.It rocks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of self-knowledge","review":"Largely tragic but at times hugely funny, this book is well worth the price. The author shows us how he perceives himself, and it isn't always positive. I thought his assessment of his own work was spot-on, too--when he focuses on family, his writing is compelling, but when the emphasis shifts to him and his friends, the book wanders (as did my attention). Overall, though, I really enjoyed reading this, and am selfishly grateful that I haven't had to face the challenges he and Toph had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed until it hurt","review":"This is the most entertaining book I have read in a very long time. I found myself continually reading exerpts to my friends around me because I just had the urge to share the humor. It was the kind of book that I pick up to read for only a few minutes, but end up reading it the entire way through. This book revives the senses and reminds us that even in the most dire circumstances, there is something to laugh about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly dissapointing, couldn't read past the first 50 pages","review":"I started the book expecting a lot. Instead it reads like a very unedited diary of a boring, self-indulgent person. I don't see the hype, this book should have gone through a ton of editing and should have lost the \\"notes for a novel,\\" stilted diary prose. I couldn't get past the first fifty pages even though I tried to force myself to keep reading in the hopes it would get better. I skipped around to later parts but the story could not capture my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book discovery of this winter","review":"Eggers' compelling writing describes life's events both profound and routine with a voice which grabs, engages, entertains. I don't read memoirs, from Ireland or elsewhere, and this book was the exception to make the rule. Eggers' book instead of being episodic flows, so you know you are getting a (version) of a life faced with unique challenges. And this book should put to rest forever the idea that people of his generation are slackers, uncaring, disengaged. The author in telling the particulars of his own life writes about what it means to live, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I expected it to be, well, at least entertaining. It wasn't. Halfway through I had the uneasy, sinking feeling that it wasn't going to get any better. But I pushed on, just so I could write this review and nobody could chide me for reviewing a book I hadn't finished. I even read \\"Mistakes We Knew We Were Making\\" which was equally awful. The whole thing is a huge, exhibitionist blathering that disappears up its own ass by page ten and stays there throughout. The author is a conceited, navel-gazing drama queen, peacock proud of his banal, garden-variety \\"suffering\\". It's truly disheartening that so many readers pretend to like this insipid, steaming pile of narcissistic baloney."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Flop","review":"Eggers is trying too hard to be deep in his memoir, and often throws out self-proclaimed \\"brilliant\\" ideas and insights on life without defending why they are brilliant. The writing, quite frankly, is simple and uninteresting, and Eggars fails to connect his ideas, leaving the reader confused as to what they are supposed to get from reading this memoir. I feel as if Eggars has an interesting and relatable premise for his story, but many people have interesting lives and do not become authors. It is having the ability to have the reader be effortlessly pulled into your life that makes and interesting story a brilliant memoir. Eggars does no have that ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious","review":"I read this book on an airplane and became angrier and angrier that I didn't have another reading option with me; by the end of this, I loathed Eggers as much as he obviously reveres himself. I read one critic review that stated something to the effect of \\"no criticism you could bring hasn't already been acknowledged in the book itself\\". Since when can you write a sophmoric, pretentious, self-obsessed book and get RAVE reviews because you acknowledged -- in a hip, sarcastic way -- those exact failures???? I'm sorry, but instead of aknowledging the books failings, maybe Eggers could have, you know, fixed them. Characters come and go with no introduction or ending; plot lines just vanish. Every sentence is written in that embarrassingly overthought, not-quite-wry, conspicuously delivered tone generally associated with 15 year old schoolgirls. Mostly, I think, Eggers enjoys talking about talking about himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"trivial pursuit","review":"You have to like the style of this book to like the book. People say they like what Eggars does with his mothers death--I read it, completely unmoved and realized later I was supposed to be touched and shocked by the generation x-syle brutally honest delivery. Nope. I don't mean to be overly critical but there is nothing particularly artful about this work. If you like the whole \\"look how quirky and dysfunctional I am, isn't it cool?\\" genre, then you'll like this book. Perhaps this says more about me than the author, but I didn't get it that the book was supposed to be shocking or amusing. He seemed to be just telling a story in a very non-literary way of things that happened in his life. I kept waiting for a plot.... The influence on what we call \\"generation x\\" of MTV and 30 minute television news magazines is evident here. Something stands in for artful storytelling, but I don't know what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"life's too short","review":"If I don't like a book, I still try to finish it - to give it a chance to improve or surprise. But, after pushing onward with Dave Eggers' book, skipping over much of his blah blah blah and becoming enfuriated with his self-importance, I decided that quite frankly, life is just too short to force feed myself on the most over-hyped book I've had the displeasure to come across in years. Dave Eggers is an extraordinarily arrogant, conceited, selfish, unlikeable person. How in the world could I have not realized this before I wasted my money on this book - just look at the title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Heartwrenching Display of Staggering Hubris","review":"There are so many other good books out there, why waste your time with this one? The title is lofty and ambitious and creates expectations for the reader that this work fails to realize (Of course, Dave, you did ask for it). No question to me that Eggers has potential to be a decent writer, but his smug (oh, but I try to be self-deprecating, and I almost mean it, too!), cooler-than-thou, \\"Are you in on the joke?\\" style gets in the way of what could have been, if not a work of staggering genius, a well-told coming-of-age story."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Uneven Work of Staggering Ego","review":"I bought this book based on glowing reviews in the national media, and an extensive excerpt in The New Yorker. But having now read it, I unfortunately would be inclined to retitle it \\"An Uneven Work of Staggering Ego.\\" The first 108 pages are wonderful indeed, but the 267 which follow are wildly uneven, with bits of literary brilliance floating atop a Great Lake of self-indulgent rambling. At the end of the latter portion of the book, in spite of his still-obvious talents as a writer-observer, it is Mr. Eggers' towering opinion of himself and the too-often timeworn \\"insights\\" he supposedly has to share with \\"you millions\\" which left this reader \\"exhausted and fe[eeling] hunted.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Maturity at age 21","review":"Finally someone captures the combination of pain and unbridled \\"gee-whiz, I can really do anything I want now\\" experience of having both parents die before you're fully formed. I've been waiting for ten years to read this book. His own exploitation of his circumstances and peoples' exploitation of him ring excruciatingly true. On one hand, his life sucks. Everyone says, \\"I'm sorry\\" to him. On the other hand, he's been freed to reinvent himself anyway he wants, the rest of us be damned. Kudos to Eggers for turning what could have easily become a syrupy Hallmark Presents Movie of the Week into an attack proof read... Or something approximate to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst book I've read all year","review":"This is hands down the worst book I've read all year, and I read at least five a month. Thank goodness someone lent it to me and I didn't have to spend money for it. I kept feeling as if the author were trying to manipulate my emotions and not doing such a good job. Reading your immature teenager's diary would probably generate the same feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too . . . much","review":"Well. I recently finished reading this book, and I'm not sure WHAT to think. The early part of the novel was very interesting to me, as my mother was also very ill as I was growing up, and I could relate to being a young person who suddenly had very adult responsibilities.I think the problem that I had with the book thereafter was that it was just too much. Eggers goes to great lengths to communicate to readers that he's very self-aware, he's very media-savvy, he's always one step ahead of the reader. And while his tangents and stream-of-consciousness writing can be interesting at times, I found it getting stale rather quickly. The book, in some ways, is all about self-analyzation: what Eggers thinks of himself, what he thinks others think about him, what he wants others to think about him. As a reader, I felt like I was under some sort of microscope, with Eggers considering how, with every word I read, I was perceiving HIM. I'm not sure that such conceit makes a worthy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into a much younger mind","review":"I am more than three times the age of Dave Eggers when his book opens and it was fascinating and moving to see his young mind at work. I am acquainted with death and was greatly moved. I imagine those who disliked the book are closer to Dave's age and so less tolerant of a contemporary; just as I would be with the work of another senior citizen describing the world I live in. My point is that I gave him some slack and wasn't a bit bored by the Real World episode.That part, near the end, when he returns to Chicago, visits the funeral home and what followed rang so true. The description of the frisbee game with Toph caught me with its athletic grace.I have recommended this book to all my friends. I wish I could go to New York in May, 2001 when he is speaking at the New Yorker celebration and shake his hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Honest","review":"I loved this book it was hilarious, his self concious ramblings are so much similar to my own that I couldn't NOT love hearing some of my own inner workings and obsessions. And his honesty and intentions..for example when he's talking about going to a parent teacher interview meeting he confesses he was hoping to \\"pick up\\". Its a great book, an interesting read, that can be kind of slow in parts but overall its just fun..defintely a must get."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOund another book to get me over finishing this book!","review":"I love this book, sad when it was over, so I was thrilled to find SARAH by JT LeRoy. Had a similar type of heartbreak without pity, but beautiful! Great adventure! Fun to read one great book and go right on to another! It just got a great review in the NY TImes! Way great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Handle It?","review":"Whether you are interested in simple story telling, entertainment or though provoking critical analysis, this book encompasses both. I would recommend is most highly to college students and young adults looking to read a coming of age story that can be read into as deeply as you find your desire. A Heartbreaking Work of a Staggering Genius is filled with chances to investigate the life of a young man facing the challenges of raising his younger brother. I suggest this book to those who can handle unconventionality, and who are willing to think freely about the bias telling of another's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to be a 20's something guy to like this book","review":"As a 40's something woman, I found the humor wonderful, then repetitive and ultimately annoying. Couldn't even finish the book. Did I miss anything?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Marketing","review":"So Eggers self-consciously tows the institutionalized postmodern line, and then Simon & Schuster's marketing maffia gets the marching orders out regarding what postmodern critics must say in order to sell the book and retain their jobs.Literature hath fallen, and I expect the popularity of this book to wane, as others more deserving make it beyond the temporal, ruthless postmodern maffia who so dominate academia and the publishing world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misnomer of a Title!","review":"This was the largest disappointment I have experienced since I learned as a child that there is a Shamu at every Sea World. I am a HUGE fan of McSweeney's where Egger's hangs his hat now and therefore believed wholeheartedly that his original prose would be just as stunning. Not so.Neither heartbreaking nor staggering and don't get me started on genius. This was, in the end, really just \\"A Work\\".The preface or \\"Part 1\\" was painfully funny and I had all the hope in the world that the treatment of his past would continue down the same path. Again, Not So.Alas, it has a pretty dust jacket and all my friends can borrow it now without dropping their own hard earned cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius","review":"A better title for this book would be \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Boredom.\\" I forced myself to read the whole thing, hoping at some point it would live up to the literary acclaim it had received. It does not. The book is an egotistical, one-sided attempt by the author to justify his own bad behavior and judgement with regard to the treatment of his young brother after the death of their parents. Stay away from this book! Devote your reading time to something more interesting and edifying - even the dictionary would be a better choice than \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful - doesn't care what readers think","review":"The positive contributions Dave Eggers has made promoting literacy, as a web and book publisher and revitalizing interest in writing and young writers is commendable. I like his writing in small doses, such as in/on McSweeney's; it's funny and his vocabulary is charming. But his full length books are painful.This book is self indulgent and inconsiderate of the reader. The refutations prepared in response to anticipated criticism that precede the story are an insulting waste of time. If an author is aware of such problems, shouldn't they be corrected before the book is published? The excess of the title is reflective of the entire book and the fact that this excess is self-conscious and possibly intended as humour does not excuse the fact that Eggers could do much better, but chooses not to. He doesn't care enough about readers' time to try harder. Style is no excuse for laziness.Eggers talents are best used for short writing and promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the trouble","review":"I rarely resort to skimming books, but after about 150 pages, I had to. Eggers let us know pretty much everything that happened to him since his parents died, which did not gel into a captivating story. He is hyper-aware that he is writing a book about himself going through life knowing that everything he does will be documented in his book. It's all too much. The book did not offer anything new, interesting, or insightful. The only reason I kept reading the book is that Eggers talks about a friend of mine in the book. Even so, I don't think it was worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched","review":"After finding this on a list of \\"great biographies,\\" I checked it out of my local library. Thank god I didn't have to pay for it. I kept reading, hoping that \\"it gets better,\\" but it doesn't. Really annoying and sophomoric and self-indulgent, as many other readers have observed. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it","review":"I REALLY wanted to like this book. So many people recommended it to me and told me how great it was. I had to force myself to turn the pages. The way it's written, it was really difficult for me to care at all about the characters. They don't have any real endearing qualities, and as much as I wanted to root for the kid raising a kid, I couldn't. In general, I felt it was a waste of my time to read this when I could be reading some genuinely moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the Point!!","review":"Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious. Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book. I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was \\"forced\\" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug. This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't. I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so. Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorites","review":"This book has been touted so heavily that expectations are probably way out of whack for some readers. But I just loved this book. Yes, Dave Eggers is youthful and arrogant and a little too clever, but this is a rare peek into the thinking of a guy in his 20's who is going through some major stuff with his sense of humor in tact. It's entertaining, touching and yeah, I thought it was a bit of genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Boredom!","review":"While this book had a lot of promise, humor and obsure Gen X references, it has somehow its fallen woefully short of its mark. The first 100 or so pages were entertaining. Eggers has a great sense of self-depricating humor. But a lull in the book hit mid-way and it never quite recovered. As one who typically finishes every book until the end, I can't seem to get through this one. I've stopped caring about his plight, the humor is tired, and ultimately I lost all interest in Egger's story. While some might compare this to Naked by David Sedaris, they should not. Naked is funnier, better thought out and less rambling. (In all fairness, Naked was comprised of short stories.) In all, my patience became worn and I could no longer muddle through when so many other good books await me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than loved it","review":"I was spurred to read this book by a rave review from a friend, but I have finally given up and won't be finishing the book. I can't say that I hated it, and wouldn't even tell people not to read it. I just didn't enjoy the main character (the author), I felt a cross between ambivilance and irritation with him. I think that someone that felt more of a connection with his style would really get a kick out of this book, but it wasn't for me. I guess I have always worked really hard in my life, and was put off by his irresponsible parenting and lifestyle choices. But like I said, give it a shot and decide for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughters Nine, where are you?","review":"When the muses return they will be angry. Sedaris and Eggers both are hopefully pissing off a generation of real writers enough to do it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I had heard the hype. I read the flattering review on the front cover from the New York Times, more just like them on the back cover, the first 3 pages of quotes from all the best magazines and newspapers in the country... I thought I'd be in for an amazing read.But the words were just more fuel for Dave Eggers' conceit. These reviewers must be in the pockets of Vintage Press- that seems to be the only explaination as to why they would praise this book.I found it boring, repetitive, and predictable. I didn't notice a voice or writing style.I struggled to finish it, just to make sure my opinions didn't change. They didn't.Where are the Kerouac's, Bukowski's, Burroughs', and Kesey's of our generation? More importantly, will they get good reviews if they aren't paying for them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaking is right","review":"The book should have been titled A Heartbreaking Work of a Staggering Narcissist. It starts out great...a modern day Confederacy of Dunces but becomes a mudslide after the first 20 pages. The book is very simply a memoir of a self-absorbed 21 year old on a Ginsberg/Kerouac rant. By the time the reader reaches \\"page 109\\" it is time to take the book back to the library (because he/she has been savvy enough to borrow it and not buy it).The Table of Contents and Acknowledgements sections are entertaining...don't bother with the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius, maybe? Brave, Definitely!","review":"Being from the Bay Area I admit this book was fun to read for the places he's been. I am heartbroken, and a genius, and I found this book to be the bravest book I've ever read. Dave is every bit as jaded and judgemental as I am having suffered almost as much as I have, but he has an incredible ability to be so brazen and honest. At 29, he is still too young to know the full impact of his thoughts but luckily his little brother Toph, like so many of our children, is watching him and I'm sure will keep him in line. It would be interesting to hear his sister Beth's story and to hear more of Toph's thoughts. I'm sure their stories would be every bit as heartbreaking, but the question is..who else among us is courageous enough to be so exposed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd have liked it better","review":"If Eggers had started with a description of his journey to scatter the ashes of his manuscript, and then added \\"The End\\" much closer to the front of the book.Seedlings were orpaned because of this book, and that is a great tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"where have all the flowers gone?","review":"I was quite disappointed with Eggers' latest gardening how-to book. Whilst his magazine, Mcsweeney's, is generally brimming with helpful tips for the aspiring green thumb, his regular readers will feel quite let down by this book. I didn't learn a thing from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adolescent whining","review":"Boring, pretentious drivel. It's heartbreaking to think people are actually taken in by this. Does this guy actually think he's clever? It's all so familiar to anyone who's been living in the US for the last 20 or so years. The literary gimmicks are obvious. The author seems to know on some level how weak the book is, and tries to finesse it by admitting its weaknesses, thinking that's very witty in a post-modern way. I managed to get through the interview about halfway through and decided to cut my losses. I know I missed out on the big emotional pay-offs in the second half, but I just couldn't take the punishment any more. There is some good material in there, but he just doesn't know what to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too impressed","review":"I wasn't too impressed with this one. It did nothing for me. Eggers sex life and relationships did not interest me. From the looks of some of the positive reviews here, it seems to be a definate women's book, for the fact that it is so neurotic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius","review":"I guess I am just not with it but just reading through the first 65 pages was so painful I stopped. I couldn't get into his writing style, stream of consciousness, whatever it was or is. I just found it a chore. I was not relating to the characters and some of his thoughts were just bizarre ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaking Indeed","review":"Really?I don't usually write reviews, positive or otherwise, but when I scrolled across this book, I had to speak up. This book is on most people's shelves, and every time I see it, I shudder. Why is this book so popular? Why does everyone in this town (San Francisco) love Eggers? I just don't get it. This book was dull at best. It may have been heartbreaking work (more of a heartbreaking waste of good reading time), but genius it is NOT. Never has any book been so misnamed. What a tremendous bore. Skip this read if it's not too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well but ends in a torrent of self-absorbed drivel","review":"A Work of Genius? I had read the newspaper raves and after scanning the first few pages, bought A.H.W.S.G. at a Sea-Tac airport bookstore. Big Mistake. If one skips the irritatingly cutesy prolog and begins with the main story, one quickly becomes engrossed in the sad story of the death of the author's mother. After that heartbreaking beginning the rest of the book is indeed staggering in the sense that it leads nowhere.What is the appeal of this uneven personal narrative? Perhaps the kindness and decency that pervade this work are vanishing traits in our increasingly rude society. Readers will certainly relate to Mr. Egger's touching and caring relationship with his younger brother, Toph.Kindness and novelty ...one sees a lot of that in the paintings of children. Perhaps A.H.W.S.G. is the verbal equivalent of a child's painting. In that case, Grown-ups Beware. You'll find little of interest here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor Has No Clothes!!!!!!","review":"If I could rate this book a negative 5, I would. At a time when hardly anyone knows the work of John Fante, when Gerald Kersh is out of print and unread, when works like It Happened In Boston? and I Capture the Castle, are only now being rediscovered, when Budd Schulberg and Jose Donoso slip into obscurity, along comes a staggering work of mediocrity to take America by storm. This book isn't funny, or ground-breaking, or smartly written; it isn't even good. It is self-conscious, cutesy, and pretentious. Publishers should hang their heads in shame. Soon, they'll be publishing the stories of eight-year-olds who can't write for their fifteen minutes of fame. Whoop-di-do! Lap it up, people. Let your tastes sink to the level of network television. Let other countries bring us writers like Marquez, Octavio Paz, Neruda, Saramago, Fowles, Angela Carter--meanwhile, we here can revel in our smug, self-satisfied mediocrity, and Eggers can laugh all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete drivel! - A waste of my time","review":"I should have heeded the recommendation that the author makes in the \\"rules\\" section of his book - to only read to page 140 or so because the rest of the book is ego-stroking. The first part of the book was painful to read, funny and interesting and the stream of conciousness style put me right in Dave's shoes. However, at page 140 or so- about when Dave interviews for MTV's Real World - the book turns to drivel and is a waste of time to read. All the brillance in the first part of the book completely faded away - I'd put the book down after a few pages wondering why I persisted to read it. I skipped about every other page and was truly hoping that Dave's tone would eventually change... this didn't happen and I couldn't finish the book. This book was a real disappointment and a waste of my time! Our entire bookgroup felt the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have never read such a thoroughly dull book in my entire life.

The writing was quite good, but the plot was so sad that by the middle of the book I couldn't read a page at a time without feeling like crying. I put it down halfway through, waiting for a day where I am unbearably ecstatically happy and need a little misery to bring me down. That day hasn't happened yet, but I am prepared for it nonetheless. Dave Eggers seems so young to write such a heartbreaking story! I hope he cheers up soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"The Real World\\"","review":"I must be about the same age as Eggers. I've always enjoyed learning about how a person gets from point a to point b.

This is so much better than \\"The Real World\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that the literary world is populated by fools.","review":"This book was lousy, is lousy, and will be lousy and forgotten ten years from now. Amazing that book reviewers in major papers and magazines went for this pretentious junk--but no more amazing than the junk they praise the year after and the year after that. The literary establishment no longer has the ability to discern quality or see pretention for what it is. Maybe that is because they are not so different from the author if this book. ...Ever notice that books like this get their best reader reviews early on--when readers are still blinded by the NY Times and New Yorker reviews?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be a great short story","review":"The self-absorption and whining gets to be a bit too much nails on the chalk board. Glimmers of the author's genuine pain can be found throughout the book but nearly 400 pages is TOO much. The middle 200 pages in particular need massive editing/direction. It would be great if edited down to a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Miserable Waste of My Valuable Time","review":"It was painful having to place a star before this review. Perhaps the one star out of five can relate to the one-fifth of the book that was worthwhile. The Real World interview was an insult to the readers whp enjoyed the beginning of the book. There should have been a warning before that chapter that stated: \\"The book you are currently enjoying will disintegrate into a self-absorbed rant. At no point will this prove to be entertaining, informative, or even mildly interesting.\\" I hope that Mr. Eggers will find it in his heart to issue a written apology to the people who read the book all the way to the end. It might not be a bad idea for his publisher to issue refunds to all of us who bought the book assuming it would have some entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"promising but so disappointing","review":"How does stuff like this get published? Parts of it were so funny but most of it was so juvenile. I have a son about Eggers' age, and this would be exactly what would happen if MY son were to care for an 8 year old. Scary! The parts about his parents' deaths and the scattering of ashes at L. Michigan rang so true...I've scattered a parent's ashes, and lots of what he said was so poignant and well-written. But so much of this was so juvenile and so ill-thought out. Did he have an editor?? The majority was so very precious and self-serving...The liberal use of profanity, particularly the F-word, is SO slacker and so unimaginative. I sense a talent here, but one that needs major cultivation and discipline."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title should have been my clue","review":"This was a book club pick and that is the only reason I read it.

Then again, maybe this is how most twenty somethings view the events in the fabric of their lives and I am just way 'over the hill.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotone moaning","review":"It is staggering that this book received any attention at all - apart from the opening chapter, the tone is boring, moaning, whining. There is brilliant writing in the first part, the picture of family life is reminiscent of Frantzen's Corrections and its a pity the rest of the book's writing doesn't match up to this. I got 2/3 through but after the rambling and incredibly pointless interview for the MTV show I gave up. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wearisome Tale of Supreme Self-Indulgence","review":"A painful, poignant, and compelling short story unravels into a laborious (and often unreadable) Gen-X mosh pit of flabby prose, incomplete (and unbelievable) characterization, witless witticisms, and the celebration of celebrity. Unbearably tedious, and ultimately hollow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and Irritating","review":"I'm about a hundred pages into this, and it's very bad. Eggers enjoys providing every gruesome and messy detail of his mother's death, and seems to believe that he can write a good book simply by writing more and more and more. This book really needs an editor, or something. It's easy to read, but the light bulb never really goes on. Not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Boredom","review":"I had read that Dave Eggers is friends with Sarah Vowell and David Sedaris and had hoped that like company meant like creativity. Unfortunately I found Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius to be extremely lacking in the creative department. I will not give up on Eggers just yet, however I'm just confused as to how A Heartbreaking was a Pulitzer finalist. The story lacked continuity and Eggers' attempts to wrap himself in the tragic balcony accident suffered by his friend were tacky at best, pathetic at worst. A Heartbreaking is worth reading, but I caution the reader that it is a definitely underwhelming experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurry and board the ship of fools!","review":"This is perhaps, per time spent (by me -- grudingly reading it all the way through so that I could be absolutely positive how much I hated it) and praise given (by others whom I don't understand whatsoever), the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some really teriffic passages, but a bit overly indulgent","review":"There are several passages in this book that are side-splitting funny. His descriptions of playing frisbee with his little brother Toph are absolutely to die for. His recollection of the moment he notices that the music at his sister Beth's wedding is the KISS song \\"Beth\\" almost had me rolling on the floor.These moments are weighed down, however, by several rather long overly self-indulgent passages. His interview with the MTV Real World producer is a good example of this. He seems to get so caught up in crafting the most emotionally impactful rendition of his traumatic life, that he forgets to make it interesting. For the most part, I skimmed those sections of the book.Still worth spending a few days reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I may have missed the boat on this one...","review":"Throughout the year, I compile a list of books that I look forward to reading. This book recieved so much great publicity that I really looked forward to getting my hands on it. One lesson that repeatedly rears it ugly head is that a book that is critically acclaimed doesn't always read as well as it's reviews.I was immediately put off by having a list of very lengthy rules and sidenotes that were separate from the text of the novel. I've always felt that if you want to add something to the book, include in the story line.While Eggars was able to portray a touching bond with his younger brother in the wake of tragic circumstances, I had a difficult time wanting to finish this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so so what","review":"Dave had a number of bad breaks, but his over wrought, over written navel gazing is mind numbing. He suffers from the need for a good, thorough editing. After reading some of his nonsense, I reached the point where I didn't even care about the tragic events in his life, but wanted to give him a good shake. His little brother needs the services of a good lawyer to get back all the money which should have been used for him, but seems to have been poured into the sink hole of \\"Might\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth the effort","review":"Despite the glowing reviews plastered all over the cover, and despite the fact that it was a Pulitzer Prize finalist, I was disappointed. I laughed really hard only once. The rest of the time it was mostly just a non-stop braindump droning. Don't get me wrong, there were some very insightful passages, it does point in the direction of some of the big questions, and the style is clearly off the beaten path. But it left me with only one really strong impression - this author (and his generation?) watches way too much bad television. The narrative is a combination of personal memoir mixed with wild TV-style fantasy, presented in an action-thriller-drama mode interrupted by brain fart commercials. Definitely self-absorbed. Definitely self-serving. Definitely paranoid. Probably schizophrenic. I'm sure he'd love this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book - you can HAVE mine","review":"This book has the potential of being a great novel,the author is incredible, he has a unique style that is endearing and engaging. The story is incredible, the conflict he feels in being a responsible parent/brother to his younger brother Toph is tender, sincere, and often humerous. He had me enthralled until about the last 100 pages of the book then the story line seems to get lost in the muck and mire. I continued to read because I was sure all the meanderings away from the story would be tied together somehow. I was wrong - the book left me empty and wondering why I wasted my time, not to mention money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only made it to Chapter 4","review":"What a disappointment! I bought this book after hearing lots of great stuff about it (too bad I didn't look at the reviews on Amazon!), and I started reading it - and. Oh. My. God. I couldn't take it. Yeah, it was sad and tragic, and so dang depressing - but it was those long-winded descriptions that did me in. Page after page of solid blocks of text and long conversations consisting of 3 or 4 words where I kept losing track of who was saying what. Geez. I can't believe I spent money on this book. I wish I'd borrowed it from the library instead. Now I'm stuck with it and out of [...] bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I don't say things for the sake of saying them. This is THE WORST book I have EVER read. I have never finished a book and been enfuriated by all the time I wasted on it.Yes, it is sad that both his parents died and he had to take care of his brother, but that's all there is to the story. I didn't really even get the feeling he was that upset about it, he didn't say many good things about his parents. His intentions in writing it seem more for his own benefit'for sympathy. It's presented with such hubris in a \\"look how cool I am\\" fashion which gets increasingly more irritating.I think people tried to give this book credit for reasons of sympathy. You won't learn anything from this book, life is way too short to waste your time with self indulgent books like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't be serious","review":"I can't believe this book received such acclaim. I couldn't even finish it. I am no prude, I hear cursing and cussing on a daily basis in my line of work. But this book offended even me. Every other word was f*&k or some variation. And what an incredibly arrogant young man. Avoid it. It is awful, the editing is awful, and he should learn some other way to express himself than cursing every other word."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Heartbreaking Waste of Paper","review":"The only thing hearbreaking about AHWOSG is that I can never reclaim the hours lost reading it. It's a masterpiece of self-indulgence with no real ending. Dave Eggers prose and style are rather good (hence the critics praise), but sadly, he has little to say. Save your time and money--pass on this one. Try instead A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES--simply brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mindnumbing Work of Unbelievable Self Indulgence","review":"Well written, but incredibly boring. After the first one hundred pages or so absolutely nothing of interest takes place. The book is one overlong narrative that covers a brief portion of a relatively dull life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was David Sedaris put up to writing that one-line review?","review":"How Dave Eggers be put in the same category as David Sedaris is beyond me. The book was okay. The title annoying. He sounded fairly interesting on a Charlie Rose interview, but I really suspect the guy doesn't have another story to write after this one. His prose are nonexistent; his vocabulary is limited (yeah, i know that's how real people speak); and the ending was a bratty ranting of sorts. I admire his dedication to his younger brother, though. I just don't think he hits the core like Sedaris and he's not nearly has humorous. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughing out loud","review":"For the first time in a while I attracted some odd looks on the train as I actually laughed out loud while reading a book. Dave Eggers writes in a way that I think most Gen-X's will relate to. I don't really want to review the book - just recommend it. Reassure yourself that Bret Easton Ellis does not define our generation; that you are not on the verge of a nervous breakdown just because your mind is travelling in a different direction to your mouth. Just don't get any designs on Mr Eggers....he's mine...I saw him first..."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless rant","review":"like many other reviewers who found this book distasteful, i got so sick and tired of eggers' wandering, random pomposity that i put the book down two chapters short of the end. i have never gotten so close to the end of a book without feeling any desire to finish it. i didn't even bother reading the last page, because by the time i finally surrendered, my distaste for the often completely unnecessarily verbose writing far outweighed my mild curiosity to know how the story ends. since there didn't seem to be any point to eggers' tale, i can't imagine that i missed much anyway. i have no doubt that eggers has potential to be a clever writer if he can gain a little humility. however, i would skip over this early work. as a full time non-traditional student supporting myself, i find very little time to read recreationally, and i very much wish that i had not waited so long to put this book down for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"a heartbreaking work of staggering genius","review":"i rarely give up on a book . are we suppose to like this book because of the title? its a bloody bore and it made me weary to read it. i gave up . 2 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible book!","review":"Never have I felt so duped for believing all of the hype and critical acclaim that surrounds this pathetic excuse for a book. In purchasing the book I wondered -- is it an autobiography? a novel? a memoir? In case you were also wondering is none of those things. It \\"reads\\" like a nonsensical rambling on of Dave Eggers mundane and often totally pathetic (e.g. audition for The Real World) thoughts and life events. Accounts of those tragic events that affect and shape Eggers' life, such as the death of his parents (which I think was the impetus for this book), are told without a trace of human feeling and spirit. I could not connect with Eggers and kept asking myself -- who is this ordinary Joe and why am I reading his book? I finally put it down without finishing it and returned to flipping through Marie Claire and Vogue. Much more interesting to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"more hype than substance","review":"Eggers is actively soliciting e-contributions to this column, and that speaks to a certain unsavory neediness that cries out (and frequently whines out) on almost every page of this tiresomely overhyped production. Don't get me wrong, there's some good writing here, but it's good in the way of an angry, self-confident twentysomething rattling the bars of the human cage-- as we all rattled them once upon a time-- and in the end, what really works here is less the story than the projected attitude of the writer. Whether Eggers can tell a story, write a REAL novel, whether he's a real writer or simply someone who had particularly bad-- uniquely bad-- luck as a human being and turned that bad luck into literary grist for profit-- this question will only be answered when he steps up to the plate for his next at-bat."},{"rating":"1","title":"another lose-weight-fast gimmick","review":"Dave Eggers talks a good game, and he writes a funny one, but do we really need another novel-cum-advertisement for non-stick cooking spray? After all, our forefathers got by on hand-pressed oils and churned butter in cooking, and their average lifespans were... well, let's not go there. And, more disappointing, Eggers advocates the use of FIVE TIMES the recommended intake of MSG THREE TIMES A DAY! The book, hailed as an optional buy for my beginning Chinese class to help us remember character stroke order, has caused my pores to swell with artificial lubricants and my saucepans and glass bakeware to all but disintegrate in the dishwater... but I have lost two pounds since I started his diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile at best","review":"In the lengthy and tedious introduction (chock full of thirteen-year-old-type humor), the author urges readers to skip over certain less-well-crafted passages of the book. Take his mock-humble advice and skip the entire thing. This memoir is neither heartbreaking nor staggering and most definitely not a work of genius. You will find a much better exploration of family life in David Sedaris' NAKED and a much more truthful look at how illness affects our lives in THE RED DEVIL: TO HELL WITH CANCER AND BACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"My reivew of AHBOSG","review":"When I bought the book, I was so excited because it had received so many good reviews. I thought it would really be a good book. I read it and I was very disappointed. I expected more from the book since it received such good reviews. Dave Eggers is not a very professional writer and cannot express his ideas. An example is his numerous cursing. This shows he has to use unappropriate words to get his feelings across. This is a sign of an amatuer writer. I was very disappointed in this book and do not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 400+ page rant!","review":"This book was absolutely horrible. While the premise is a touching story, Eggers proceeds to take every bit of emotion out of his situation and replace it with useless details about his life. Unless you care about what a 20-year-old man eats in a day, I can't think of a reason to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"I'm mystified at the poor reviews from some of the readers of this book. This was Pulitzer Prize finalist for a reason. Eggers speaks with a great voice. He manages to make us laugh thoughout his recount of a very tragic situation and his dealings with it. Eggers has great language, a wonderful sense of humor, and a vivid imagination. I always love an author that isn't afraid to stray from the \\"rules.\\" I think this was masterfully crafted. Eggers uses his head and doesn't just write it as he sees it, he thinks about what he's writing. I loved every second of it and everyone should read this book. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"A long and sometimes tough read. So very emotional - so vivid, so real, and, so inspiring. A talented writer and thinker, Eggers 'gets it' in this book and if you are fortunate enough to read it, you will too.It is one of best books of this generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"...A Terrifying Work of Unsubstantiated Ego","review":"I was intrigued enough by the clever ramblings that precede the actual telling of this memoir. These \\"introductions\\" aren't neccessarily compelling, though one arrives at an expectation of an incredible journey by perusing evry last sentence of them. There isn't anything else. He continues to ramble on in such a fashion, that I din't even find him likable. He's so pretentious and full of himself, that I never really felt at all sorry for him. His parents died. It .... That's it. The accounts regarding his brother Toph are the only things even remotely interesting, but they made me despise the book more, because I would've rather been reading his version of life with his big brother, the pretentious jerk. This book does for prestigious book awards what Gladiator did for the Best Picture Oscar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stagger not..","review":"Initially I had felt that he introduced the book in a cheap manner. All things considering, sarcasm and ranting might not be completely original to Dave Eggers, however they do come with suprising talent. I was drawn in by his explanation of the book, it seemed as though he was almost embarrassed by it, yet excited to have some form of a reader. I loved his descriptive style. I loved how he would transform himself in a single moment, whether it be lying on a couch or sitting on the beach, to some awkward memory or dream-like stance. Then, with a jolt, reality would hit both him and myself (the reader) again.I definately recommend this book to anyone that enjoys ranting, raving, and FULL expressions of single thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is our future generation?","review":"I enjoyed the first 1/3 of this book - Eggers has some very real & truthful observations about the deaths of his parents that strike a chord many would be afraid to admit to. He also voiced his sudden paternal feelings for his brother in a way that was both humorous & gut-wrenching. But he loses me half-way through his Real World interview when I realize that I'm now going to have the self-centered, self-involved musings of a 20-something thrust at me...page after (yawn) page. I'm truly amazed that so many reviews have been favorable as I felt like I was standing in a dance club with a drink in my hand listening to a child/adult (20-somethings usually think themselves wise beyond their years)pontificating on nothing. Meaningless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing look at trajedy","review":"This book was written in the way that I might tell a story: disjointed at times, uncertain at times, emotional and yet detached at times, but always interesting and always honest. It was refreshing to read a tale about trajedy and hardship that did not moralize itself or conclude in a melodramatic or enlightened manner. Eggers was forthright in his narrative, and his writing shows a style not overly concerned with abiding rules, but more interested in creating the scenarios as they actually occurred, somewhat haphazardly but always amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah","review":"There are entertaining and clever moments in A Staggering Work of Heartbreaking Egotism. This book contains some some gems that are *right on*. However the reader has to wade through a lot of babbling and ranting. Unfortunatly, starting from the \\"MTV interview\\" The book begins to read like a very stoned person writing his profound thoughts in his personal journal. Boring, and apparently, he doesn't even have the excuse of being stoned. I am a person that reads to the end of a book even if I don't really like what I am reading. Staggering Work of Egotism is one of the first books that while reading, I lost interest, began skimming, skipped to the end, and then put down. I do not understand all the buzz surrounding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book","review":"I would give it no stars if that was an option. How great this book could have been. But instead, a smug 22 year old writes about his life which could have been interesting, but isn't. And how could anyone write a book based on these facts, and be able to draw no sympathy from the reader for his plight? I loathed the writer and his book. I really appreciated the commentary about his 29 year old girlfriend and whether or not she would be wrinkly. Wow, great writing. And the interview process for the Real World, that was just painful to read. This book was staggeringly bad and I wish there was a refund on books purchased that are just over rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Staggering","review":"This book is excellent for young adults ages 13-18, or concievably over that, but not under. I carpool with a younger girl, she only in the third grade, and I picked this to listen to on audio cassette. Bad choice: I loved it but it is full of not only teenage emotions that she could not yet understand but also a small amount of mild swearing. But a teenager would enjoy this book a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time & money","review":"all my opinion.... Time, NYT & SF Chronicle got this totally wrong. There is nothing interesting in this book. Manic ramblings of inconsequential events are peppered with bouts of depression and all done in poor form. For sure, the dude was dealt bad cards, but he can't write his way out of a wet paper bag. The only tiny point of interest is how the young brother makes out. This is the only review on Amazon I've written; I am that compelled to call stink, stink. I wish had those wasted hours........."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't let the title suck you in - really 0 stars","review":"...The writing of this book is in a steam of consciousness type of writing and meanders from place to place. The introduction and prefix seem to be the author��s initial notes, doctored a little to add more pages to send to his publisher. I really cannot tell you anything beyond about page 50 because I closed it up and started to wonder if I could return the book to where I bought it and trade it in for another author that I have read before.If this is a gen-X-ers book it indicates that the attention span of this age group has really diminished and I hope that their mental functions have not followed suit. Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it shows that it takes a lot of types to make up the world, and it is a blessing that all of them do not like the things that I like. It keeps the lines where I go short and sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book -- Regardless Of The Hype","review":"'A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius' was written by Eggers across the span of his twenties, and encapsulates that time perfectly. I can relate exactly to his oppressive paranoia, to his boredom with the suicidal considerations of his friend and his own, life-affirming response, to his utter self-absorption and his painful awareness of his absorption, it seeming out of his control and devouring everything in its path. Is this because I am in my twenties? Is this a physiological state dependent on the death of adolescence and the looming of true and sure adulthood? While I'm glad he wrote this book and appreciate it as a solid entry into the literary pool, I think it's 'bestseller' quality is owed, mostly, to it's perfect cultural timing. But it really is a great book -- regardless of the hype. Also recommended: The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"rating":"2","title":"It really is AHWOSG","review":"As a reader with a low threshold for gratuitous weirdness, I came to this book expecting a sloppy, self-centered meditation on life, death, and innocence lost too soon. Instead, I found an enormously entertaining and moving story about all those things. I've read many reviews that call this book uneven or meandering, but AHWOSG defies and revises conventional ideas about what a narrative is--to call it uneven is to suggest that it should be something else entirely. Take it for what it is, and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Not So Staggering work of Genius","review":"Although the plot to this book has potential, I found that Eggers put me to sleep with his boring characters and story line. I usually force myself to finish a book, no matter how terrible, I'm often overtaken with guilt when I finally decide to close a book without reading it from cover to cover. However, I couldn't even force myself to finish this sleepy, pathetic, and ultimately uninteresting novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title is Right?","review":"Staggering. That's how I tried to get through the book but didn't make it. Genius--a word used popularize works that, otherwise, no one would read."},{"rating":"1","title":"About the only good thing I can say...","review":"...is that the writing is so simplistic and the book so lacking content that it shouldn't take anyone more than 20 minutes to read the whole thing...imagine Jack Kerouac with only about a tenth of the talent taking what could have been a moving story and turning it into an insipid and overly sentimental narrative presumably nonfictional yet totally lacking authenticity...one only hopes that before he writes any more books, he goes out and buys a thesaurus."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is my title for lack of a better title","review":"Not only is Dave Eggers a wonderfully nice guy, his novel... semi-autobiography is exceptional. The title, though, was a joke. To clarify, Dave Eggers did not intend people to take the title seriously so if you happen to think that he used that title because he believes himself to be a heartbreaking genius, perhaps he is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, hardbreaking, simply marvelous!","review":"Dave Eggers is an extraordinary writer...his story is both heartbreaking and charming...it made me understand the world of my sons, truly and absolutely, and I want to thank Dave Eggers for opening my eyes and heart!!!I love that generation of the Xers they are true to their spirit and Dave Eggers reminds me so of the very best and the most creative..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny story about a tragic situation","review":"This was a fun read. As a member of \\"Gen X\\" I could really identify with a lot of this book. It is a fast, laugh-out-loud look at an unconventional family struggling to get though the day to day.Yet I still have so many questions...Why did Dave raise his brother? This was never clearly established and Dave seems like the least likely of choices. I'd like to hear more from the brother and sister's perspectives. Also, how did everyone turn out?I also wonder if David Eggers can/will write another book? He is hillarious, but he has now told his tale. Can he write beyond the memoir and the articles of past to tackle bigger subjects? Time will tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaking Waste of Money, Staggering Waste of Time","review":"At first this book seemed similar in tone to Wally Lamb's \\"I Know This Much Is True\\". But I agree with another reviewer- after the slightly heartbreaking death of the parents, the writing becomes silly. I kept going for a bit, hoping things would change, then peeked way ahead and realized, finally, that they would not. I'm not wasting any more of my time with this book- I already wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it","review":"I'm sorry to say that I bought this book. The first 50 pages or so were good, and he obviously knows how to put word together. However the rest of the book is boring and self-indulgent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just unbelievably wretched.","review":"Truly one of the worst books I have ever read. With each self-congratulatory cutesy phrase, I became more and more ill. This man believes himself to be just terribly smart. You can just imagine him as a child, jumping up and down to get attention... and that's what reading this book was like. Buh-bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good - Tedious and Tiresome","review":"This book was terrible. I couldn't even finish it so I guess I really do not have the right to rate it but I tried to read as much as I could. It started out okay but got pregressively boring and tedious. I am even a \\"gen-X-er\\". No - I'm not into country music or the Promise Keepers. Dave Eggers is a good writer - it's just that reading this became too much of chore - and an unpleasant one at that. I guess I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, outrageous, weird...

It was, butalso nothing he told me about it prepared me for it. It was like being kidnapped by this seriously bizarre character (the author himself, to boot!) and be subjected to a strange/marvelous/horrid tour de force of his life... by turns it is poignant, laughable, annoying, and yes heartbreaking......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most pretentious book of the year award","review":"Shame on the person who edited this book. Never have I read such a smug, pretentious, self-consciously hip pile of pages. The best argument against the silliness of hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"clever whining","review":"By chapter 4 I had enough whining. He was in a tough situation, but not so bad compared to the rest of the world. The wording is very clever and there are some cute gimmicks in the book. My favorite part of the book is the copyright page. I like the way he puts words together and if he can find good subjects, he can probably write very good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful - he doesn't care about readers","review":"The positive contributions Dave Eggers has made promoting literacy, as a web and book publisher and revitalizing interest in writing and young writers is commendable. I like his writing in small doses, such as in/on McSweeney's; it's funny and his vocabulary is charming. But his full length books are painful.This book is self indulgent and inconsiderate of the reader. The refutations prepared in response to anticipated criticism that precede the story are an insulting waste of time. If an author is aware of such problems, shouldn't they be corrected before the book is published? The excess of the title is reflective of the entire book and the fact that this excess is self-conscious and possibly intended as humour does not excuse the fact that Eggers could do much better, but chooses not to. He doesn't care enough about readers' time to try harder. Style is no excuse for laziness.Eggers talents are best used for short writing and promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuel for the fire","review":"I was optimistic in the beginning, but I see that I am not the only one to give up on this windbag book. I actually hurled it into the back of the car I was reading in. I had just finished a disgusting part about 'feces man' when the next chapter started with yet more of the same subject. I then looked it up here to see what other people thought of it. I am not alone. Having said all that, I do think that Eggers is a talented writer; I like the creative additions to the book; I like the relationship he has with Toph. But somewhere along the line he lost me and I no longer cared. Don't waste your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss about","review":"With so much hype, I clearly had higher expectations for this book than warranted. It was a boring account of an insultingly self-centered, immature cast of not-so-original characters. This was a bookclub book selection for me, so I suffered through it -- much to my chagrin, however, none of the other 8 members of the club persevered. I was the only one who made it through cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I wasn't impressed at all and I'd started this book with such high hopes, too. In fact, I found this book annoyingly self-concious and rather shallow emotionally. The protagonist does all sorts of wacky or destructive things and we're supposed to glean what? Does he leave things a mess because he's living life his way, because he's bereft with the loss of his parents, or because he's a slob? Don't bother thinking too hard, he'll tell you in just a second, at length, and it'll be just what you expected. While some of the story is interesting, such as his work on the magazine, too much of this book is as though it was an equation worked out using formulas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and then slow","review":"The book is greatly written and laugh out loud funny. The authorship is unique in his ways to outline and present information. Different writing styles are unique. There are some parts which I had to skip, mainly his style of run-on thought writing. Run-on is interesting, but becomes quickly boring in the same paragraph.However, the book begins great and races to great lengths with the relationship between him and his brother, but as the book starts shifting focus to him and his magazine... the story becomes a little more laborous. However, I strongly recommend this book for anyone looking for a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"the decline of modern literature began here","review":"Dave Eggers' book is pretentious, unamusing tripe. His \\"style\\", if you want to call it that, involves basically ripping off Kurt Vonnegut and using improper grammar. I should have stopped reading after his totally useless introduction. This man has nothing meaningful or new to say about the way we live our lives. Reading this makes you feel dumber, and I will never forgive him for that. Simply incorrigible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"I bought this book because I read all the glowing reviews it got. Dave Eggers is definitely a witty writer but this memoir is just a jumble of different ideas that never lend themselves to a common theme. The sad part is that this book had so much potential to be great. If Eggers had concentrated his writing on the dynamic between himself and his 10-year-old brother (who Eggers became guardian of when he was 22 years old after the death of both parents) the book would have been great. I found that aspect of the story most compelling.Instead you get stream of conscious prose detailing uninteresting events (even for a 20 something).I found it to be a waste of material."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most self-indulgent author I have ever read.","review":"I impose some sort of perverse rule upon myself that once I start a book I do not allow myself to quit reading it. That is the ONLY reason I finished this book. I absolutely cannot believe this book got such good reviews. It is truly one of the worst books I have ever read. At the end - trust me - the most ridiculously bad ending ever - if I had not been on a train at the time the book would have hit the wall. Stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE GENIUS !!!","review":"This book is amazing! I cannot believe it got so many bad reviews. I will admit that I am not a literary genius, but I know good stuff when I see it. Eggars is not only extremely creative, but he is also very real. All of his emotions and thoughts expressed in the book are real and expected. He takes you on a journey of sorrow, self doubt, paranoia, and fun. This book has definatly raised my standards for all other literature. I want more, and I will not be satisfied with less."},{"rating":"1","title":"a talented writer but not a genius","review":"This book had potential, and if only a good editor had toned down some of the overly instrusive self-conscious elements, it may have been accurately titled. But what could have been an interesting narrative technique was, in the end, too self-indulgent and distracting. The story itself is very touching and interesting on a personal and societal level. Or maybe I'm just too old? Anyway, I'm looking forward to his next book. I think I'll give Dave Eggers another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes dashed on the rocks","review":"This is a frustrating book, to say the least. The forward and the first chapter are stunning pieces of writing, and through the course of the book, Eggers plays with different devices that add some sparkle. But, when all is said and done, the echoes of the echoes of the echoes become tiresome, and you find yourself wandering around in a verbal cul de sac, wondering if you'll ever be allowed to leave. While much of this book srikes a nerve on a personal level, Eggers seems to be trying too hard to become the voice of a generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should have tipped me off","review":"I was disappointed by this book, Eggers can write, but his self conscious self referential style gets pretty irritating. Unlike some readers I found it readable enough to make it all the way through. Some parts of this are great, but it's about 200 pages too long. Eggers shows a lot of promise, but he's in dire need of an editor. As for the section on \\"mistakes we knew we were making\\", least said the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This book is now on my list of favorites. First of all, it was just really funny in parts, to the point where I was laughing out loud. I found the story engaging, poignant, and thought-provoking, funny parts aside. Also, even though my life has been nothing like the author's, I could relate to his way of thinking. In a way it was like he was writing those things that I have thought, but wouldn't necessarily admit to. In addition to liking the characters, I really enjoyed the author's style and use of language. He uses very colorful words and puts them together in an interesting way.On one hand, I can't see how someone could not love this book. But then again, for some reason, I think it might be more enjoyable to those who like dark comedies vs. slapstick, for example. Anyway, try it for yourself...."},{"rating":"1","title":"best cure for insomnia","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever tried to wade my way through. I finally put it down after only 63 pages because I kept falling asleep. It certainly was heartbreaking to have laid out the cash for this book only to find it was staggering toward the finish with no clear path or message in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN SOMEONE CAN EXPLAIN WHY EGGERS MAKES PEOPLE SICK?","review":"I can't get past a nagging feeling of disdain for Eggers,and it really gets in the way of reading his book. I can't put my finger on it-- there's something about HIM that just is so creepy. It isn't \\"jealousy\\"...because there are plenty of authors who could fit in this vein that I don't feel such disdain for... it's something more.. and it comes through in the books and in the public persona... but I can't figure it out... If anyone else has a handle on it, can you please post it in your review?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A strong start, interesting style at first, and then.....","review":"While I like a well-put sentence as much as the next guy, by the time I got two-thirds of the way through this book, no, wait, maybe 60%, well, OK, maybe 65% of the way through, Eggers' writng style, where he frequently runs-on in tangential, tumescent flights of lacy, breezy, possibly even windy, bloviation in an attempt to make us think he's really really smart, really really REALLY began to wear me down. (There, see - I can do it too!) I found myself skipping large sections of the text in the frequently unrewarded hope that he would sooner-or-later get to the point. Read this book ONLY if you are interested in seeing a writer do the verbal equivalent of catching a Frisbee while simultaneously doing a cartwheel (it's in the book), ad nauseum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's because I am not Gen X.....","review":"but I found this book to be very tedious, pretentious and self-conscious in a very egotistical sort-of way. The first 109 pages were fairly interesting, the remainder is very difficult to read as the authors self-absobtion ( and his self-absorbed fears about his self-absorbtion ) become a metaphysical game rather than interesting literature. Perhaps age will improve Mr. Eggers writing- he has skill certainly- but could use alittle context outside his own thoughts. I finished the book out of duty only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traffic school","review":"It looks as though the Eggers mystique has diminished markedly since this book first came out.I finished the book after forcing myself to slog through the final 175 pages. There are a few moments that definitely glimmer. He has a paragraph describing his frustration with San Francisco that is one of the best rants about San Francisco I've ever read. But the rest of it is repetitive and almost numbingly self-indulgent.All in all, reading this book was like suffering through a day of traffic school."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I add?","review":"So much has been said about this book that it's hard to say anything new. Will only underscore that this is the Catcher in the Rye for the 90s. Eggers so acurately captures the time, place, language, and the feeling of being young. For all his smart-[rearend] attitude and self-obsessed navel gazing, he succeeds mightily in telling a story and making a point that's much bigger than the pretty normal life (I mean discounting all the death of course) described in these pages.Read it for the heartbreaking story promised by the title, but remember it for the surefire genius behind the storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hard to love work","review":"I stopped reading this book before being halfway through, simply because I found it hard work and wanted to read something more immediately rewarding. I then read The Unconsoled and Ishmael, neither of which I could put down. AHWOSG does have some very entertaining passages but deep down I always felt I would give up because the book is never wholly satisfying. Really, its mostly a rant. A truly great writer would not find it especially difficult or challenging to write in this rambling, unstructured way but I'll give 2 stars to Eggers for at least trying. More than anything else this book makes you appreciate works of literature that actually say something about life and the world rather than just the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and Funny","review":"Yes, thematicly and plot-wise it's a mess, but it's a beautiful mess. I laughed out loud, wiped tears from my eyes on the bus, and found truth on almost every page. The paperback version is worth owning just for the great Whale Story that is added in the new section. Not the greatest book in all of literature, but perfect in it's own imperfect way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Compelling","review":"Even though the author indicates in the preface that the middle section could be skipped, I couldn't do it. Although I was about 30 years older than the author when my parents died within 10 months of each other I found myself drawn to and identifying with his reactions. And recognized the additional complexity of his coming of age at the same time as having become his brother's parent. This book was well worth the time of reading--you don't often see a memoir or autobiography by someone so young who has such insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I found this tough to get through. I don't mean it was dense and complex like Dickens or Joyce. I mean it was unevenly written, with far too much emphasis on style and far too little on actual content and making sense. It used some cheap shots to try and draw some tears, but tears a good book do not make! It evoked emotion in the way a scene in a movie about a dead dog and heartbroken kid, with sad music in the background, might evoke emotion, or in the way a scary masked person jumping out of the shadows might evoke emotion. This was recommended to me by numerous friends, and I was very disappointed. If I hadn't wanted to be able to discuss it with my friends, I wouldn't have finished it...I still think it was a waste. I found it to have very little lasting emotional impact.Source(s): English major"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read to page 120...skip to the last chapter","review":"All I can say is, at least he was honest from the start. He tells you that it gets choppy after the first four chapters. The whole MTV interview section blew it for me, at that point I jumped to the last chapter and have not touched this book since. I would say it was a fun read up until then though, and the end is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Occasionally Witty Work of Breathtaking Self-Indulgence","review":"The copyright information page and prologue were clever and amusing. The book went steadily downhill from there. Even worse, the more I have thought about the book in the several months since completing it and discussing it with my book club, the more I irritated I become by the author's apparent self-absorbtion and show-off style of wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbroken? No. Staggered? Yes.","review":"I was excited when I sat down to read this book, and the elongated preface didn't disappoint. I found it amusing and witty, and it made me look forward to a similar story. Yet, when I reached the actual novel, I found the subject matter to be so serious that I became angry and disappointed with Eggers for such a glib prologue. The writing is good, and often engaging, but there seems to be a hint of mistruth and game-playing behind it all. That just doesn't fly in a memior. Plus, the passges containing monologue-ish stream of consciousness can be unbearably long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking The Dave Eggers Seal","review":"I will always love this book, because it gave me Dave Eggers. I was going through my own heartbreak when I first picked it up, so maybe that has something to do with the immediate emotional attachment I felt to his story, but I suspect his undeniable talent had something to do with it as well. He made me laugh. He made me cry. He made me want to write a novel. I could have done without the gimmicky bookends, but they by no means took away from my enjoyment of this heartbreaking work of staggering genius, and, now that I see what Eggers has gone on to do with his rock star status, I can appreciate those quirky touches, which remain in tact to this day & in full evidence in the way he presents McSweeneys & The Believer, as well as his passion for kids & making words fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"getting past the hype...","review":"there is much to admire in dave egger's touching memoir. his honesty about some really embarassing situations is commendable (even if he admitted after publication that it wasn't 100% accurate-- chalk that up to artistic license). unfortunately, there is also much to forgive. the whole section about MTV's 'The Real World' was so unashamedly self-important and arrogant. he could've removed about 40 pages of this book if at the onset he had just stated \\"let it be understood that i am a cool dude.\\" these moments of hipster self-aggrandizing almost made me stop reading, but ultmately i'm glad i didn't. he claims to not be happy with these sections, which i suppose is some vindication, but i still feel some resentment that i was forced to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"One of the better (not to mention funnier) books I have read in the last year. Eggers draws you into his world, be it happy or sad, and keeps you there throughout. Definitely a page-turner & a great summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The image of the big white spanky-pants...","review":"...was memorable, and I cheered for our hero throughout. The only down-side was the annoying and cloying \\"v. v. v.\\" use and the the constant self-referential weight cataloguing. I can so see Hugh Grant in the lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half as long would have been twice as good","review":"Unfortunately the most compelling section of this book is the fist hundred pages or so. After that, it feels like an endless attempt by the author to assault the reader with his egomania. He is not only telling us about himself--which is after all the whole point of autobiography--but it's obvious that he spends every waking moment thinking about himself and how special and clever he is. In so doing he winds up painting a picture of a very ordinary narcissist. Yawn. There are very entertaining bits and pieces throughout, but the book desperately cries out for some serious editing and all in all the gems are not plentiful enough to make the book worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise Dave Eggars - A Gen. X Masterpiece","review":"I commend Dave Eggars for publishing a thoroughly enjoyable book. Despite the mixed reviews, I have nothing but praise for this book. It clearly illustrates a life adventure of a broken family - plagued by death. In the adversity of Eggar's situation, he is able to laugh and illustrate clearly but most entertainingly the journey he has made since the loss of his parents. Having been through a very similar situation and being the same age as Eggars, I can clearly relate, laugh and cry with him. Bravo. A masterpiece. Way to go Eggars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius","review":"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering GeniusDave EggersThis book is unlike any other I have ever read before. Eggers mixes utter tragedy with humor, something like one would find in a fiction novel. The events that occur in this autobiography seem like they could never happen, however Eggers shows vividly how he has had to cope. These events seem to be straight out of a fiction novel, happening to a fictional character, because one does not wish to think that this could possibly happen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd, but interesting","review":"This is a very unusual book, written in an odd style that is, in the end, rather effective. It's easy to tell that a lot of the conversations in this \\"non-fiction\\" work never happened, for some of the sentences supposedly coming out of the mouth of the author's young brother are absolutely impossible to imagine. Interestingly, the author admits that much of this work is thoroughly overwritten and exaggerated, for whatever reason. This book is a big best seller, which makes me wonder what people see in it to compell them to purchase. I liked reading it, but I think that I probably would not have bought it (probably because of the pretentious title) if it hadn't been as commercially successful as it has. I got it just to see what all the hoopla was about. I'm happy I bought and read it, for under all the artifice and affectation is a real, honest \\"heartbreaking\\" story, even if I don't believe there is any \\"staggering genius\\" accompanying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, I tried","review":"OK, I borrowed this book on the high recommendation of a friend, who considers it a groundbreaking work. So I read it, hoping for the best.I'm glad that I borrowed it, and did not pay for it.Even with the turmoil and imbalance of Eggers' life, I just couldn't make myself care. Dad died. (Hmm?) Mom died. (Yawn.) Starting struggling magazine (Sigh.) Surrogate parent to younger brother (What, did you say something?)So, sorry, but this doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"I picked this up after hearing lots of great things about it, but I wasn't a fan. It was too long and boring - I was basically just waiting for it to end. I didn't find it well-written at all. Definitely not worth a purchase; if anything borrow it from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interesting","review":"This book is full of random and selfish thoughts that sounded like the author had the mentality of a 15 year-old without a firm grip on life's responsibilities. Although the introduction was humerous and straight forward, the first 2/3 of the book was not. I could not get past the MTV interview, so I hope for the sake of other readers, that it got better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cute","review":"This book is about the author being cute. Through thick and thin, the author's dedication to the dear and the really quite precious shines through. Sometimes a kind of goofy charm sneaks in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Blathering Work of Overwhelming Selfabsorption.","review":"There is no \\"staggering genius\\" in this book at least up to the third or fourth chapter where I stopped reading. The only talent Eggers has is cleverly wordsmithing uninteresting events. Hello Pulitzer, did you hear me? UNINTERESTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it.","review":"I gave up, I admit it.

I dont know exactly how to describe this book except it is absolutley fantastic. Pick it up today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic work of staggering egomania","review":"I am 25 and I read a lot. I have read many many novels in my short life. However I can say with absolute certainty that this is the most horrible upsetting book I have ever read in my entire life. I cannot believe how arrogant and self-important this book is. I hate this book so much because it pretends to be sincere then explodes into the most obnoxious and annoying self-championing babble that I have ever read. Perhaps I am not writing this review eloquently because I cannot clear my mind enough to write non-emotionally. ...PLEASE DO NOT READ [THIS BOOK]!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyway You Want It","review":"This heartbreaking work of staggering genius is a book that defines the staggering twenty-something generation--men and women staggering to find a place of genius within a society that still views them as children. Told through the eyes of a young man staggering to find a place within a generation that has no place, this heartbreaking work forces the reader to stagger through his or her own genius in order to find meaning. Like Mark Poirier (author of Goats) Egger's is a master of meta-fiction, and produces a staggering story that does not simply exist, but reflects upon itself. Of course the only thing truly heartbreaking about the work is the inability for some to allow the words to stagger over them. We live in a world too willing to stagger through a book of genius, reaming nothing from the words, and demanding meaning from the author. Sometimes an author is ingenious enough to create a work that staggers over tradition, and defines itself by its inability to define anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belatedly joining the minority","review":"I finally got around to borrowing this book from the library, after it sat on my \\"To Read\\" list for several years. The first chapter, which contains everything of value the author has to say, is strikingly effective and effecting writing. However, the rest of the book is self-indulgent, condescending and, worst of all, relentlessly boring. When I was Egger's age, I thought a book about my friends and I and our lives of \\"staggering genius\\" was just what the literary world was waiting for. Thankfully, I grew up and got over myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a stapler instead","review":"There's a trick with a stapler in this book's illustrations, and it pretty much sums up Eggers's writing strategy. That is: he shows you a drawing of a stapler, then admits it's a shameless grab for attention (look! he can draw a stapler!). If you fall for it, you're impressed by how honest he is about trying to distract you with a drawing of a stapler. If you don't fall for it, you realize that it doesn't matter whether Eggers admits the stapler is a ploy: it's still just a dumb drawing of a stapler. This book is the stapler; I didn't fall for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Heartbreaking Work of Stagging Self Indulgant Crap","review":"After hearing so much priase for this book I eagerly looked forward to reading it. Boy was I wrong. There's a fine line between fresh writing and just poor writing that appears fresh, and I fear that this book falls into the latter category. The author is evidently full of a lot of hurt and is trying to exorcise some of it through his writing. The net effect is the whole book is one long whine of how the world 'owes him' just because he has suffered loss. The introduction and the \\"Mistakes We Knew We were Making\\" are jokey and try to sound \\"aren't we cool?\\" and instead just serve to be boring. There are elements of interesting story here that are just not developed - the story of the Might magazine arc is good, and should have been fleshed out more. I really wished that there was more to this book, but it's all someone trying to be the voice of a generation while having very little to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Staggering work of Headaches","review":"I know people believe that this is the greatest piece of literature since Dickens. However, I venture to disagree with all those who believe that this work shows any promise of anything other than the need for extensive therapy and maybe a vacation. I agree that Dave Eggars has had a hard life but go into Middle America and you can hear hundreds of these stories. Yet, these people have survived without mass media or capitalizing on their parents' death like Dave Eggars has. Part of me wants to actually read a work of fiction by the author just to see if this is would show the promise that many believe he has displayed. Overall, this book reads like a teenagers diary and is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"made it through page 144","review":"The premise of this book makes it so entirely possible that it will be interesting and world-view changing. Unfortunately, it's just boring. Very, very, boring. At page 100 I started skimming ahead to see if anything interesting ever HAPPENS! As far as I can tell, nothing does. Good, interesting, eloquent writing about nothing happening can still be a good read, but this book is just stream of consciousness, unedited, boring, boring crap. Please don't support this loser by buying his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"Only bought because someone recommended it, I didn't like it, I didn't see the attraction, sorry but at least I tried it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"This is by far the worst piece of literary garbage I have ever read, it's like a bad movie you sit through hoping for something to happen and it never does. Everything about it is horrible, and what kind of author literally tells the reader who paid money for his book \\"F*** you for buying his book\\"? Don't believe me? Turn to the last page of the book and read it for yourself. This guy is a joke. DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME WITH THIS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaking- yes, Genius - no","review":"I typically love creative unique storytellers but this book was so poorly written and such a narcissictic piece of work that I couldn't even get through the first 100 pages.

I wanted to like this book, and did enjoy some of the descriptions of the authors interactions with his younger brother, but found much of the book too tedious. I like memoirs and autobiographical books where the author seems to be open and honest, but Eggers book did not ring true for me. Skip this book and read This Boy's Life by Tobias Wolff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book REALLY wants you to know it's a book...","review":"I like self-reference jokes. I enjoy them quite a bit, actually. But this book beats you over the head with it. I wanted to read the whole thing, just so I could feel like I had a more informed opinion than I would otherwise, but I got about halfway through and there was no sign of it ever getting any better. I see a lot of reviews full of praise here, but for me reading this was incredibly tedious. He lost me forever when he was being interviewed to be on The Real World. The only reason I gave this book two stars was because I didn't finish reading it and it could be that the constant self-reference is actually some genius device in which we're shown how arrogant the main character is. But I don't really care, I hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wordless, herdless and out of breath","review":"I was wary of this book due to the praise being poured on it and, for lack of a better term, hype surrounding it. It is an amazing book. It deserves every accolade it receives and then some. I'm afraid to say anything about this book for fear of defacing it. His style is so impressive I actually visualized the events he is describing, although I could personally relate only to the midwest location. Any faults you may find are destroyed by the fact that he has already found them first and let you know. Every emotion you are capable of having is touched yet at the same time it is never forced or pulled from you. I'm afraid I've already said too much of the wrong thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This books starts out well, and that's about the last positive thing I can say about it. The author, even given his situation, is a completely unsympathetic character. Why would we care about someone so incredibly self-absorbed and dull? The book goes downhill quickly from about the halfway point, and the end of the book is a disgrace. What does it all mean? Obviously nothing. I could not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book had a great first act, but then dwindled into postmodern gimmicks. There is only so much masturbation you can read before you want to throw the book into the fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring times three","review":"Writers deserve to be read all the way through, but this was a tough one to finish. Pointless, dull, and self-indulgent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please make him stop talking about himself","review":"The reviews I read about this book made it sound interesting and as with a couple of my fellow one-star raters, I did get sucked into Mr. Eggers story in the beginning. However, by the middle of the book, I hated this guy so much that I could not go on. I didn't want to hear one more thing about his self-absorbed, man. Luckily, I checked the book out from the library and did not end up putting any money into Mr. Eggers pocket. Unfortunately, I have been unable to read an autobiography since, fearing everyone who writes a book about themselves is just as egotistical and boring as this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"At times brilliant, mostly ponderous","review":"This at times brilliant and heartfelt book is sabotaged by an unfortunate lack of editorial discipline. You will be moved to tears during some passages. At other times you will curse the day your eyes met this never-ending discourse."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbearable work of staggering self-absorption","review":"If you are looking for yet another book by someone who thinks their own disappointments in life are worse than yours and that venting one's furious anger and bitterness on paper is not only good therapy for the writer but of interest to the vast book buying public, here is the latest installment in the long stream of books by self-absorbed gen X'ers. I think the author knew that the only way he could get away with feeling sorry for himself and claim it as literature was to mock his own writing of it. The whole thing is annoying - like having to listen to a spoiled, angry street kid in a juvenile detention center for an entire afternoon without giving in to the impulse to slap him in the face for being such a screw up and such a whiny wimp. Do you want to listen to someone else's raging murderous fantasies?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"how frustrating...","review":"This book starts out fine and is interesting to begin with...then you start to realize how contrived it all sounds (not necessarily the story, but the actual writing). It's almost as if Eggers sat back before writing each sentence and thought to himself, \\"how can I write this in a way that makes me seem as smart as possible?\\" As a result, he created a pretentious novel (although it may seem genius to those who go out of their way to be \\"offbeat\\")...I was so annoyed by the 200th some page I could not even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted, overrated","review":"I bought this book after reading about it in several newspapers. Unfortunately, finding the motivation to finish it was a chore. Eggers has a unique (and unorthodox) style of writing, but it didn't add much to the book. He writes how we think which at times is garbled and veers off in many tangents. It's clever, but it tested my patience after some time. Sometimes there would be long descriptions and endless ranting that led nowhere. At 21, I've always viewed most people my age as being shallow, callous, and cynical. Dave destroyed my expectations of proving me wrong. I began to loathe the man very quickly. I think the fact that he wrote this book was very narcissistic of him. If there was any character that I admired, it would have to be Toph. He managed to survive living with a messy, unintelligent, and hedonistic individual. I like to think that there's hope for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"2001 was a bad year for reality, and apparently, for fiction as well. That's the only way I can explain how this pretentious, annoying and over hyped book was finalist for a Pulitzer. Dave Eggers lost his parents within weeks of each other to cancer, and became a kind of surrogate parent to his younger brother, Topher. That's an extraordinary circumstance, that could have made for a moving memoir. But Eggers, who has a huge ego and little talent, gives us an incredibly dull and tedious account of his life with Topher. I worked hard to finish this book and in the end, I just gave up. Life's too short to waste it with this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Waste","review":"The first chapter succeeds in hitting a sincere emotional chord, but the book quickly degenerates into self-indulgent, overly flip blather. Too bad -- since it's apparent Eggers has talent and a pretty good story to tell, just not the maturity to pull it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book of the year","review":"This book qualifies for my favorite books of the year 2001 for me. It's great, personal, and I relate to the characters. I know, it's mostly a true story. And that's great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good potboiler","review":"That's all it is, a good read and nothing accomplished at the end. It may be a true story, but it's also an amalgam of Woody Allen movies, Nick Hornsby, and the hacknyed bonding between brothers theme. All you rustics who like this book might say \\"this is so heartfelt, humerously sentimental\\" blah, blah, blah. Eggers is a conceited SOB. Skip this and read something more original."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty ok","review":"just a short comment: it's pretty hard to take seriously * (one star) reviews from people who can't spell (amy and this fellow below me from pennsylvania to start). the book itself is quite good. there's not much out there like it and berating someone for being a clever monkey when he's admitted to the charge from the beginning is a little stupid. it's no masterpiece, but i'm pretty sure eggers would be the first to agree with that statement. in the age of irony, perhaps the only way to tell a true story is to irony the hell out of it; anything less would be cheezy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I enjoyed this book, having recently been a 20something. What wasn't told to me was that this is a very sad story. It has its funny moments but for the most part is fairly depressing. Still, a good read giving the reader lot's to think about regarding themselves, family, friends, and the mortality associated with all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother to read this book unless ...","review":"... You want to read a stream of consciousness diatribe from an egomaniac. Don't bother unless you feel curious about the life of an uninteresting privileged white guy from the suburbs. Don't bother unless you are compelled to hear every thought that ever entered a person's head - no matter how ridiculous. Don't bother unless you have money to burn on pages of endless ramblings from someone who has never truly struggled in life. Don't bother unless you like and believe the hype of the publishing machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not finish it","review":"The author summed it up in the beginning.I paraphrase -- The first 123 pages are mildly interesting and the rest is unnecessary. Dave is a good writer, although all over the place, but honestly, I felt the book was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eggers dot bomb--publishing industry pyramid scheme.","review":"This book is basically hyped trash.There's no plot, there's no unity of time, place, and action, the characters are cardboard, even though they're real, as opposed to Hamlet, where the characters are deep and profound, even though they're fictional.They set Eggers up as the ultimate literary \\"it\\" boy, even though he's the ultimate company man, out-hyping his publisher's hype.The publishing industry needed someone to hype, and it ended upbeing somebody who wanted it more than anyone else. Eggers lacks all traits of a classic artist, and he relies on his appetite for postmodern fame.This book's an embarrassment, and it's also a sign of the times--there's a good recent article in the Atlantic Monthly about the decline of literature, and the rise of hype. I bought the paperback version, and it's worth less than most dot com stock options."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"After wading through the title and all the \\"rules\\" for reading the book, I read the first 30 pages, a sad tale of his mom dying in her own blood and mucus and puke. How many times did he need to describe the tub of blood and mucus she spit into? Anyways, I knew what was coming and followed his \\"rule\\" by skipping to page 123. Wah wah, woe is me. The book still wallowed while trying to be funny. This cutesy cheesy tongue in cheek type of Sedaris wink at yourself in the mirror while writing kind of humor. PUKE! A little rimshot of drums played in my head after certain lines, and the book fell from my hands as I drifted off to sleep. You might like it if you enjoy amatuer night at the comedy club and old brady bunch reruns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks Your Heart Because It's So Terrible","review":"This book is nothing more than the diary of an arrogant, immature 16 year old. It's not funny, not insightful and not worth your time. Amazingly, despite Eggface's attempts to be hip and edgy, he was able to put me to sleep in about 5 pages. Sadly, the critics have mistaken his cutsey, self-important style for literary talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good. I wouldn't believe the other reviewers....??","review":"I read everyone else's reviews and bought the book. It really is not that great. He was very funny in some areas, but the book just drags on and on. All he does is whine about his problems using sarcasm and a sense of humor. I feel sorry for him, but not enough to recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Title...not much else to offer.","review":"Some may have enjoyed Dave Eggers story of the unfortunate loss of his parents, leaving him the difficult task of bringing up his younger brother, but I found it to be a rant. Some of it was witty and a bit funny, especially his introduction. But all in all, I found the story to be fairly ordinary and somewhat boring. It often drifted back and forth without much story movement at all, and sometimes went virtually nowhere. Although Eggers wacky, dysfunctional thinking process saved the story a little, I couldn't wait to finish the book so I could finally start reading something else. However, good luck to Dave and Toph anyway, as I applaud the human spirit for its traits of perseverance and endurance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Piece of Rambling Garbage...","review":"I like all types of literature...I read about 60 books per year (while working and going to grad school) and so I consider myself pretty well read and will give anything a chance. This book was recommended to me by a friend and I was really excited to read it, but was very disappointed from page 1. I have never read a worse book. It is immature, sloppy, artsy drivel that adds up to a whole lot of nothing. I have no idea how it got such good reviews and even won awards. In fact, I can't figure out how this garbage even got published in the first place. Eggers is not a genius for writing this book, but is one for convincing critics that this book is worth reading. You couldn't force me to read this book again. Even at gun point, I'd refuse to even open the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother - Genius this is not","review":"Vastly overrated. I kept reading this book in the hope that it would improve. It did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staggeringly Amazing","review":"This book is one of the greatest I have ever encountered. Written by David Eggers, it traces the intricacies of the author's childhood; from the tragic experience of his mother and father's passing to his struggles and witty commentary on raising his younger sibling. Embued with Gen X sarcasm, Eggers speaks with a voice that forces the reader to contemplate the complications and experiences of the youth of modern America in a most captivating manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointing work of Staggering Idiocity","review":"I have read this book till about a bit more than half of it expecting something and got nothing. The writer dissapointingly attempts a Bukowski style and tries to add to that some thought and philosophy, but goes no more than what we can call some diary entries. He may be a talented writer and sometimes funny to some extent, but don't expect anything that will enhance your logic, thought process or way of life from this book.Bottom line: this book is a cheap Bukowski style, somehow tragic diary of Dave Eggers. If you read just to kill time and don't expect much from books then you may actually enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Egotistical","review":"Basically, if you want to know what this book is like, just imagine a self-important 'super-casual cool' hipster who spends most of 500 pages trying to be funny and self-depricating, with rare success. There has to be more to good writing than conversationality."},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down","review":"the first 50 pages or so are promising. it seems like it is going to be a quirky, honest depiction of this young man's life after his parents die and he becomes the guardian of his young brother. and as long as he stays with that, the story is compelling. unfortunately, most of the book is full of random stories about his uninteresting life told in such a self-conciously, self centered way. every bad thing that happens to anyone he has ever met manages to be completely about him. he thinks he's infinitely more clever than the rest of the world and more entitled to attention and he acknowledges this. it's as if he thinks that by admitting his faults, the reader no longer has the right to be annoyed by them. but they do and i was. the writing is scattered and lazy and i don't know how it got published."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Genius Doesn't Stagger...","review":"Dave Eggers is an amazing writer, but even better he is amazingly real. This work is witty, so make sure you read everything from the inside cover, to the Rights page, even the back cover photo has his humor attached to it. Definitely read the parts he even suggests you don't. Eggers makes you comfortable that even if you still slide across wood floors in socks, hit on women in purple berets and run throughout the house yielding a knife that you are somewhat normal. He's definitely beyond genius, and his book had me laughing out loud. Definitely looking forward to his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to force myself to finish it...","review":"A writer friend of mine once told me that award winning books usually do one of two things: They make you feel far smarter than the average literary reader, or they make you feel far dumber. While I don't know if I agree with him entirely on that, I would say that his theory perfectly sums up this book. I found it so boring, self-important and monotonous that I could barely finish it. I put it down several times, having to force myself to pick it up again. I finally finished it (with relief) and was left with a feeling of \\"so what?\\". Considering that this book is so widely acclaimed, I was left with the feeling that either I was missing something or the critics were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Genius In Heartbreaking Work...Is \\"Marketing Genius\\"","review":"I so hated this book and I was so disappointed that I hated this book. Although I admire Eggers dedication to his brother, his account of the years following his parents' deaths read like one aggregiously long sophomoric essay on what I did on my summer vacation, year 1, year 2 year 3 etc. Although it started out rather promising, and there were snippets of humorous antecdotes, and insights, they were few and far between. Definately too sparce a crop to keep the book moving for nearly 400 pages. Maybe the male, under 20 crowd might enjoy it. I have donated my copy to my library, hopefully it will save someone some shipping and handling. Overall, bad hardback purchase, but you gotta admire his \\"marketing genius\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made it through....barely","review":"I apparently do not have the sophisticated reading palet that some critics do. It's not that his life story is not interesting and that I didn't want to know what happens to him and his brother BUT....I cannot stand his writing style! Run on paragraphs that last pages long was only one unbearable aspect of his writing style. There was also the random tangents into his daydreams which did add flavor but were entirely too long and often unclear. And his dialogue! There are these long sections of dialogue where it becomes extremely difficult to differentiate between characters. At one point you almost question the dialogue entirely as it seems his younger brother completely falls out of \\"character.\\" But I made it through...barely. And I truly was caught up at the end wanting to know what happens to them but then he started up again with his blurred reality and randomness and it was all I could do to not jump out a window."},{"rating":"1","title":"More self-indulgent tripe","review":"Books like this make me wonder why I bother reading \\"hip\\" authors. This book, like Jonathan Franzen's THE CORRECTIONS, is hopelessly self absorbed. Nothing about the author or any of the other characters is compelling. I kept waiting for some substance, but found none. Sure, there are some clever passages, but these are more than outweighed by dull dull dull sections. Dialog is especially hard to follow, particularly when the younger brother breaks character and speaks like an adult.This work is a fine personal journal, but for the rest of us it's not worth the time, effort and money to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and tiresome with the occasional sparks...","review":"Yes, I did enjoy parts of this book. But for the most part, I found this book to drag go on and on and on... It was touching in some aspects, in some ways it was so very shallow. I wouldn't say 'don't read it', but definitely don't expect this to be a page turner b/c that it is not! I guess I just expected so much more from the title and the 'rules' - it seems like it could be such a great read but unfortunately, it isn't quite that."},{"rating":"1","title":"My love for this book ended with the acknowledgements.","review":"I did not like this book. Parts of it were really interesting but mostly it was boring and pretentious, the author just goes on and on about things that put me to sleep like tossing around a Frisbee with his brother on the beach.Dave Eggers is not beyond his years he just thinks he is and wants others to see him that way. Even though there are a lot of emotional things going on it seems that Dave doesn't really grasp what is happening and sort of always has this living in la la land attitude. Most of the time I felt like he was just spewing big words that he plastered all over sunshine in a the world is beautiful type outlook.I found most of the things he thought were witty pretty insulting/hurtful to people in general. This book exudes false optimism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started strong, ended as a crapheap","review":"This book started strong, really strong, but quickly became really bad. I kept reading it all the way to the end, hoping it would becoming interesting again, but it never did. It's self indulgent, vapid, and worst of all, boring. I started the book knowing nothing about Dave Eggers, and feeling pretty neutral about him, but by the end of the book I actually felt kind of angry at him for wasting my time.The only reason I've given it two stars is because it's a beautifully designed and typeset book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Self Indulgence","review":"Mr. Eggers apparently learned nothing about being or becoming a human being from his experience. I hope his little brother faired better than he. This book was nauseating in it's glibness, chaotic in it's prose and boring in it's length. I don't understand how the Eggers' could be seen as heroic. Frankly, I see them as just plain sad and out to make a buck. A definite...MUST NOT READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3:1 garbage to goodness ratio","review":"this book could have been great with a decent editor. instead it's unrestrained, longwinded and high on itself. yeah, i know that's the whole joke, but just because you can make fun of yourself doesn't make all the bad stuff not true. there are hilarious parts and even moments that are really touching but it's a better read if you skip at least half of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"Would someone please get Dave Eggars a good editor? Full of promise unfulfilled, the book rambles on tediously after an interesting first chapter. There is an original voice in there but this volume quickly becomes a bore -- in spite of the possibilities inherent in is material -- as he is distracted from his story and good writing by his self-conscious style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"The book was in mint condition, the story was interesting but the ending was not what I was expecting and it left me feeling like the story was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"love to read and this is a good read!!!","review":"Enjoyed discovering Dave Eggers and his writing is very unique. especially since i just moved to the Bay Area.I think it is a great book to get you out of your own head and into an interesting character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earns its legend","review":"There's that old quote about The Velvet Underground's debut that not many bought the album originally, but everyone who did started a band. Though this book received a sort of rock star status from the start, I can't help but wonder just how many writers it inspired--likely as many or more than any of its generation. Just gushing with heart on every page, it earns every bit of praise that's heaped upon it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it.","review":"I tried to like this book but couldn't manage. It came across to me like a sob story from an egotist.There were short flashes of brilliance but it wasn't worth the length of the book for me. ...after reading other people's reviews, though, I'm wondering if maybe I should read it again to see if I missed something. Maybe I'll try again in a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entirely enjoyable","review":"What a great discovering--this engaging, engrossing book is both deeply moving and funny. Laugh out loud funny. A truly original voice and I am looking forward to more of Eggers work. I did not give it 5 stars because, it lost some momemtum towards the end and smacked of twnety something self-indulgence. But that aside, it is the best book I have read in a long time. I wonder if I would like Mr. Eggers, if I met him in person. I know I would like his brother Toph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh how clever!","review":"Self-indulgent manipulative unedited clever hatefully diving headfirst into victim culture how funny how not particularly well done. Train wrecks come to mind. So do \\"The Beach\\" and \\"House of Leaves\\". A classic book for people who think the Real World is an entertaining and realistic portrayal of life. Apparently the paperback will be even longer and more self-indulgent than the hardcover. I'd be willing to bet a lot of people are actually going to go buy the paperback just to see what wisdom they missed the first time. Eggers will be laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good book, yes. To buy, or not to buy, though?","review":"Should this book be a purchase or a library pick-up?

Thankfully, it's been rumored that Jeff Goldblum has been optioned to play Toph in the film version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here is my review.","review":"There are nearly 300 reviews for this book and mine won't be the best. But I'm trying to get my numbers up, and I enjoyed this book so here it is.This book moves at the speed of thought and is an incredibly fast read (manic being the apparent word of choice). The story itself is rather plain (death, aging, parents, friends), but each aspect is looked at from many angles and the result is often a bizarre and unexpected humor. The truly funny parts are laugh-out-loud funny. The sad parts are diluted to the point that you really can't tell what is real.A great book for the late-20somethings out there that can remember being lost and floundering."},{"rating":"1","title":"i woulda give \\"no\\" stars, mon","review":"dis book vex me much-much! in da words of de immortal johnnyrotten: \\"ever felt like you been cheated! \\" oh man, dat be me! dis book fly out da window from my hands--dis book de zenith of solipcistic charletanism, mon. dis book stinky-stinky--much-much! mon, dis guy want be david foster wallace (not a good ambition, mon, david foster wallace way pretentious too), but he no dwf! one giant yawn for dis doorstop of book. i see dis author somewhere, i give him \\"what for\\" dat's what i do! don't believe dah hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Genius?

There was no story. Very engaging manic style of writing but what was it all for. A great cathartic purge?I feel like the entire book was windowdressing for his pseudo-Marxist ideas for salvaging society. Great ideas but don't couch them in your personal tragedy.My parents died. I was 23. I was a parent to my younger brother. My two older brothers were far from the competent allies Eggers had. I am a Gen Xer. I wanted to hear how Egger's orphan experience compared to mine. What did he have to say about the loss of parents, the taking to the grave of that point you reach as father/mother-son? Understanding your parents posthumously?I'm glad he spared the sentimentality and ran with the humorous, stream of thought. It made for a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbroken and Staggered","review":"I love this man, this Dave Eggers, who made me cringe and laugh my head off and cry my eyes out over the final pages, damn him."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous","review":"I honestly do not understand criticism of this book.

It was a big disapointment. I have only thrown about three books in the trash, this is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy At Best","review":"Don't believe the hype. I had to force myself to finish this book. I barely laughed and when I did it was out of disbelief that people actually enjoyed this sophomoric effort. A lot of the writing felt forced to me, had no substance and, at times, was down-right annoying. If you want to laugh, do yourself a favor and read anything by David Sedaris. If you still want to read this book, buy the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Style Rules Substance","review":"Dave Eggers is one emotionally guarded guy. Why all the mind-numbing literary acrobatics ? Is he just trying to protect whatever his emotional truth might be ? Does he just want to make sure we all know how truly unique he is -- not at all like the rest of us who might have had a more mundane response to the losses and upheaval he experienced ? I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Mr. Eggers is unable to transcend the emotional shallowness that seems to plague his generation. But it does surprise me that his publisher would choose a writer less able (or maybe just less willing) to communicate honestly. There is no wisdom or revelation in this book -- just one silly manuever after another to obfuscate some very real and painful truths."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened!?","review":"I just finished reading this book and put it down thinking, \\"What the hell just happened?\\" Literally. So this kids parents die, and the entire book is written from an \\"I need to articulate everything\\" perspective, meaning that everything the character thinks you, as the reader, get to read about. Unfortunately it's not all that interesting. I don't believe that this is a great work of talent. It was interesting, yes, but I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe I didn't catch the symbolism, but the characters did not progress enough, nor was there any climax or denoument. And the conclusion lacked. Don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I only finished this book because I infested a couple of bucks for it on-line. Pretty boring and self serving. I was appauled in how insensatively he handled his mother's illness, tongue and cheek? he tried too hard to be funny...I didn't get the humor. And some wierd touchy feely relationship with his younger brother, that bothered me. Don't waste your time and money...read Augusten Burroughs's \\"Running with Scissors\\" instead, far better read IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pace yourself...you'll be sorry when it's over!","review":"I can't express how much I love this book. The acknowledgements alone were enough to win me over. As much as I hate the cliche I'm about to use, Dave Eggers is wise WAY beyond his years. He mixes the most tragic emotional events with a perfect punch of sarcasm and self deprecation. Overall, the book is impossible to do justice to with a measly \\"review\\". So I realize perhaps I'm not being helpful. Sorry. But here are two possibly helpful tidbits: I'm a big fan of David Sedaris, using him every semester in creative nonfiction writing classes, and I think Eggers' book may be the required text next semester; also, I read this book during a three day bout with the new and improved Killer Flu, and though my energy level was that of a banana slug, I could not stop reading. I wish I could induce aphasia and read it fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns you off at the first page","review":"That oh so hip and cool disclaimer at the beginning sets the tone for this underachieving, overhyped, ego-fest of a novel. Just because Eggers is aware of his novel's flaws doesn't make them any less egregious. Eggers, by taking this ironic approach to his own work, shows that he is a coward, too afraid to take real criticism and much too lazy to edit. I guess in Eggers' world, talent is measured in terms of literary verbosity, in which case Eggers is number one. The man couldn't write a true simple sentence if his life depended on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Eggers: Editors Are Your Friends.","review":"OK, I'm a little late to the party. But the book is still being talked about so much that I have to add my two cents. Like many others (including everyone I know who tried), I couldn't get through this book. I wanted to! I was lulled by the positive buzz. I love a well-told tragedy. And I like to finish what I start, especially books. At around page 200, though, my mind glazed over. This book is way too self-indulgent, self-consciously clever, and repetitive. Eggers is extremely promising, but he needs to pare down the verbiage to win over this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, one of the best books I've read all year","review":"Absolutely wonderful. This is without a doubt one of the best books I've read all year. Eggers' self-referential humor and heartbreaking asides weave a tapestry worthy of praise. I highly recommend this book to almost any audience. Audacious and thought provoking. An affirmation of living life and a meditation on mortality. It is probably the best example of what it is like to be a single twenty-something living in the U.S. in the modern era. Definitely worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoresville","review":"I started out enjoying this book immensely, laughing, and rooting for the whole Eggers Family. I loved Eggers descriptions of his relationship with his brother Toph, there could have been alot more about thier interactions. Unfortunatly the book didn't end where it should have, before the Real World interview.I lost interest during the Real World fake interview (how many pages did that go on and on and on?)It was a struggle to continue on from there. I have this annoying habit of always finishing a book no matter how painful, and this book was just that, painful..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed reader","review":"I found the prolougue to be the most entertaining part of this book. The author is a good writer and quite humorous, but after a while, it gets just plain boring. I found myself wanting to skip pages. However, he does look to have a bright future. If you're looking to kill time, like on a long plane trip, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither heartbreaking or genius. . .","review":"but it was staggeringly difficult to finish this rambling memoir devoted to a self-centered man-boy. If a woman had written so poorly about her tough circumstances, the book probably would not have even made it to Oprah's dubious list.A Pulitzer finalist? Puhleeze!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks.","review":"Dave Eggers' style isn't funny, and it pisses me off. He seems to be fully aware that no one could actually enjoy reading what he writes, but the fact that he recognizes this (his \\"self-consciousness\\") is somehow supposed to excuse the fact? Just because he admits that the whole book is a mass of hyper-self-conscious gimmickry, does not change or make up for that fact, or make it funny. I feel horrible for him and his situation, and I understand that this book was his way of dealing with it...I certainly don't know how I would handle such an intensely tragic series of events. He is an immensely talented writer, but I would suggest that, instead of foisting his misery upon his readers, he make a serious attempt to deal with reality, and THEN write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a bad thing - too many pages and nothing to say","review":"Consider this: if you want to read a book about a true story of losing one's parents, David Eggers will give you that and much more. The problem is the much more - lots of thoughts that just sit in there with no connection to the rest of the book whatsoever.The author undoubtedly went trough a great tragedy, losing hisparents in such short time. But this fact by itself does not make a great story. And, by the way, nothing else in this book does.Is a writer allowed to write whatever crosses his mind? Sure. But does it make good literature? I doubt. I got thefeeling that the reviewer was so sorry for the author that (s)he felt the author's \\"healing\\" through the publication of the book would be worth the extra pages. Not worth for the reader, though.By the way: nothing against well written prose and loose ends - try instead Kazuo Ishiguro \\"The Unconsoled\\". Lots and lots of loose ends, superbly written and no agression against the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious book by a megalomaniac","review":"Many books are infected with a common malady -- I'll call it the \\"look-how-funny-I-am\\" virus. Seen in both fiction and nonfiction, the chief symptom of this disease is that the writer exaggerates events or anecdotes to the point of incredulity. The reader invariably finds himself saying, \\"I don't believe you!\\" Now, writers often employ exaggeration to heighten comic effect. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with this. Used sparingly, exaggeration can be very entertaining. But when this exaggeration is employed in every other passage, as in this memoir by Dave Eggers, or as in the fiction of Tom Robbins, the effect is not comic. The effect is inauthentic and tedious.The reading public's apparent infatuation with this mediocrity is a sad measure of contemporary taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow-Someone too shallow for even The Real World","review":"Hard to believe but we read in Eggers \\"AHWOSG\\" that he was deemed not worthy of even The Real World-the benchmark of acceptance in his crass generation. The remainder of his book goes on to prove how smart the producers of the show really were. Nowhere do we get a true thought or feeling from this hackneyed author. Instead we get a series of tricks designed to cover his serious literary flaws. He can't properly recreate a scene so he stops trying halfway through to tell you that he has no idea what he's doing-long after the reader has already concluded as much for himself; he has no sense of subtlety so he comes right out and screams his point at the reader, hoping that you'll admire the volume. It's sad when this is the best we can do.Question: If you went to a restaurant and the chef came out and announced that everything after the appetizer was going to be disapointing, would that make the food taste any better? Apparently Eggers thinks so."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to get my money back","review":"I suggested this book to my book club without having read it first. Big mistake! All of us hated this book so much, that we wrote a letter to the publisher asking for our money back. Perhaps we don't understand Gen-Xers, but it seemed to all of us to be a book about NOTHING. At least Seinfeld made us laugh!We now have a rule that no book is to be recommended to the club without having first read it yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Staggering Work, Indeed","review":"Dave Eggers makes the calculated risk of beginning his career with an autobiography, and it's as beautiful as it is tragic. When both of his parents die over a series of months, Dave is left responsible for the well being of his sister. This is Party of Five without the cute drama, without the budget, and certainly without November sweeps. A contemporary masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This book was recommended to me by my mom, whose brother (my uncle) introduced it to her. I think the best thing about the book is that he deals with an obviously tragic part of his life with such great humor. This book is a memoir that takes place over 5 years. Dave Eggers is about 22 years old when his parents die within a couple of months of each other, both of cancer. His sister is in law school and his brother is working in politics, so Dave is left to take care of their 9-year-old brother. What ensues is what you would expect to happen when you have a slacker-ish 20-something raise a child. They move around a lot, but Toph (the boy) adjusts quite well wherever they are. Dave is always paranoid that something will happen to him and orphan Toph, but everything is fine. This book is one for anyone who wants to read a tragic story, but confronted with great humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slack-Tastic","review":"I think readers will either love or hate Eggers semi-autobiographical story of living in San Francisco during the dot-com boom. Dave holds almost nothing back about his adventures as a clueless single raising his eight year old brother; how he and his friends half-heartedly tried to revolutionize the world in between beer-drinking sessions.I am the same age as Eggers, and can easily see people hating him for being such a vapid and spoiled product of suburban living. But I found his dry wit and snarky tone hilarious (even though I was worrying about mortgage payments while he was worrying about getting laid). I could not put the book down and kept wondering if he would ever grow up and see his brother as a real person and stop treating him like a pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated ....","review":"Well ... for all of the hoopla surrounding the greatness of this book, I thought I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, I found the author and his story a little too stream of consciousness for me. At times, I even thought it was self-serving to talk about his problems in the way he chose to write it. I admire him for the path he traveled but I don't think his book does it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Sedaris wannabe?","review":"Oh my, Dave Eggers rambles on and on without a point. What is interesting about David Sedaris is that he rambles but ties everything in at the end. Eggers doesn't do this. Tried very hard to like it, but just couldn't. What I did enjoy was the relationship of the lead character with his brother. Very sweet and endearing. But this was not sufficient to make me like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, how did this junk ever get published?","review":"I read all the raving reviews and ran out to buy the book. I think I might have mistakenly picked up a book in an alternate reality.The book was long and boring and I've never heard such pointless rambling in my life.If you want to read about death and mourning, try the obituaries in your local paper; They're more enlightening and far more engrossing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wasn't for me","review":"There were so many times throughout this book that I wanted to just stop reading and put it on the shelf to collect dust. I literally had to force myself to finish this book. This story about his life after his parents death was simply not interesting and there was nothing that made me want to keep turning the pages. The jokes, the random transcribed thoughts, were just numbing. I regret buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Like it Anywhere","review":"This is a very original and interesting book. It could have been a simple memoir of a young man coping with the deaths of his parents and caring for his younger brother; but Eggers does more, by describing the process of writing the memoir and ridiculing it even as he's doing it. You have to read it to appreciate how clever this gets, especially when Eggers shows that he realizes it's clever, and ridicules that as well. By turning the traditional standard memoir into a thing of odd and hilarious beauty, Eggers has shown he is the leading creative voice of his generation -- he really should be writing fiction. The equivalent of AHWOSG in novel form might be Asher Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, less experimental but equally funny and equally \\"now\\". Tremendous stuff!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...I want to meet Dave Eggers (and his brother)","review":"First of all, the title grabbed me. I thought, \\"how conceited can he be? Is he being sarcastic?\\" And then I thought, \\"of course he's being sarcastic, and I'm going to love this book if this is his sense of humor.\\" Ironically, it doesn't begin with the humor I had expected. But this story grows on you! I feel as if I've known both Dave and his brother, Toph, all my life. What a remarkable talent...to write so clearly to the reader...to provide such a connection. I didn't want to the book to end. I can only hope that Dave writes another."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it, but...","review":"Incredibly overrated. This is the \\"type\\" of book I normally love. It kept coming up in my recommendations, so I finally broke down and bought it. Eggars is trying way too hard, and he desperately needed a better editor. There are some beautifully-turned phrases alongside some incredibly trite, freshman English class ones.The best part about the paperback is the acknowledgements. It's all slowly downhill from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm 21 and can't identify with him","review":"As the introduction states, some people should read up to chapter four and stop. This is excellent advice. The first four chapters are fresh, funny and very manic. After this point in the book Toph drops out and around page 150 you realize: HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT HIMSELF FOR THE REST OF THE BOOK. Unfortunately the narrative becomes overwhelmingly self-centered and juvenile. Was very turned off by his attitude. If the first four chapters could be released in a (much cheaper) novella format, I would have felt like I'd gotten my money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing","review":"Dave Eggers has proved to me that he has the talent to be a great writer....He already is! Eggers' writing kept me turning the pages of this autobiographical jaunt through young adulthood, and left me wanting more. Although the story itself gets slow at times, the writing is what will keep you reading. Eggers' certainly has a knack for stringing together beautiful and entertaining thoughts. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys the art of writing, particularly those of us in our early- to mid-20s. The book will make you realize that most of us are lucky to lead as simple lives as we do at this age, without the burdens of suddenly having to raise an 8-year-old while also trying to finish school and start a career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost","review":"A friend of mine turned me on to this book, and I am not ungrateful. It's almost like a blog in some ways, stream of consciousness ramblings that for most people would be boring, but with Dave Eggers' topsy turvy life and frequent intersection with even more unstable persons this book reads well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I didn't know much about this book before reading it, but was pleasantly surprised. The author is very funny, and I found myself laughing out loud at several passages.That said, as other reviewers have pointed out, this book covers two widely divergent topics--Eggers' family situation and a biting commentary on Gen-X careers, etc. Although I enjoyed the Gen-X portions of the book much more than the, uh, heartbreaking sections on his family situation, the author had a story and tells it very well.Parts of the book tend to drag, but overall very well done. I would look forward to reading more from the author, ideally something a bit more focussed.tmr"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I could write like this...","review":"... and my life was less mediocre, for that matter...Dave Eggars writes what many of us twentysomethings feel and sometimes think (or at least the manic-depressive, the paranoid and the neurotic - which probabbly means everyone), the anger and the caring. Only, he does it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was TOLD this book would be good","review":"I chose this book to read for my summer reading book because my teacher praised it and said it was one of the best books he has ever read. I picked up this book thinking \\"Okay...this HAS to be good because he said so.\\" Sadly, he was wrong. I found parts of this book enterating (the first chapter) and other parts sleep-boring. The worse part was the Real World chapter and how it dragged on and it seemed to never end. There can only be one word to describe Mr. Eggers' life, and that would be messed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A young man and his hormones.","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be about the author and his brother... Their relationship in light of their parent's death. I suppose it might be called a coming of age book, but I have to say that I quickly tired of reading about Mr. Eggers' running around. If I wanted running around, I would do it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I wasted my [money] on this awful book. I see no literary talent whatsoever in his writing and don't understand how he was a pulitzer prize finalist. This is absurd! I'm sure there are much better books out there that deserved all the awards Eggers got.AHWOSG was nothing more than schpeels of a self-absorbed, self-pitying person. It was unnecessarily long and definitely needs some serious editing. VERY DISAPPOINTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with McSweeney's, pal...","review":"Eggers' autobiographical monolith is an obscenely overrated exercise in literary masturbation. Numerous witty turns of phrase are smothered under a landslide of fake self-mockery as very real (and intolerably boring) self-aggrandizement. A good month in the hospital spoiled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh boy, a man who does what women have for years...","review":"Annie Lamott's \\"Operating Instructions\\" is much more compelling - if you're talking books about single-parenting. Eggers is self-serving and pompous. The book lost me early on."},{"rating":"2","title":"single parent insight from a brother doing the job","review":"This is a very good book. The energy the author has mentally and physically shows just how young he really is to be a \\"single parent\\" to his younger brother after the death of both his parents. My favorite parts are when he tries to go out for an evening or other times he gets worried about his little brother and can not enjoy himself and tortures himself with an inner dialouge from Hell. I am the Mother of a teen son and I can relate! Buy this book, you'll want to read it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Think He Meant Stuttering Genius","review":"The brilliant title notwithstanding, novelized autobiographies require something more interesting than the death of parents (barely etched at that) to make it interesting. At 22, the author pretends to know more and feel more than other less sexy mortals. The narcissism of this exercise becomes tiresome rather quickly. If Eggers were truly funny, he could have salvaged something. But Eggers is earnest, unflaggingly earnest, ironically earnest. While irony is a useful self-deflation device, Egger's overuse of it is instructive. If you need to mock your own work to defang critics, your issue is approval, not world-weary hipness. Readers might be better steered in the direction of Frederick Exley, whose similar novel/memoir A Fan's Notes is immensely and mordantly entertaining. But then Exley was writing outside the shadow of youth, and the tragedy of his failed expectations rings heroically true. Eggers needs to live a life before he starts writing about one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterns are difficult","review":"This is not like the \\"Knit Stitch\\" or \\"Purl Stitch\\" books of Melville's, which I love. I found no patterns that I cared to knit, and few that I felt I would even want to attempt. It's promoted as having patterns that get rid of your stash, but most patterns do this by weaving in small amounts of various colors. You will still need to have large quantities of a basic color for many of these patterns. I will be getting rid of my book, unfortunately. Check this out a library first to see if these patterns are what you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"sally melville styles","review":"I am so totally impressed with the work that Sally Melville has done to present knitted patterns in a well structured manner that is easy to follow and at the same time very detailed. Her styles are elegant and the patterns are very well written. Just my style!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dated","review":"I bought this book quite a while ago- possibly a year ago and have not used it at all. I would not purchase it again. None of the patterns were anything I would want to wear, but Sally certainly knows her stuff and if you follow her techniques, you will become a more polished knitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work","review":"This unit could have been so helpful to my Mom who has low vision.

But this model 56420/E does not include a pump. The 56421/E does. So keep a look out for that while browsing. The pool not having a pump included is the only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Don't buy it!","review":"I was looking for an inexpensive pool for the kids and myself to use. I saw other reviews and decided to take a chance with it. My husband and I set it up in about 10 minutes. Took about 2 hours for it to fill. I should have never bought it. After a day, the top ring kept deflating. We pumped it back up and after about an hour it was deflated again. We never found the leak. I believe it is on the seam of the top ring, which you could never fix. It wouldn't be worth the effort to return it because of the shipping charges due to the weight of the pool.

The shampoo is thick and lathers poorly by comparison to the Suave Professionals Almond + Shea Butter shampoo I've chosen to use instead. It rinses, but not well, and left my hair feeling drier and not the least bit 'sleek'.If you have color treated, processed or dry hair, and/or use a flat iron for styling, avoid this shampoo. It's just not moisturizing enough and will leave you with fly-away, dry hair which defeats the 'sleek' look you were hoping for in the first place. It would work OK for kids' hair or perhaps those with normal to oily hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the first one was better.","review":"This game is *much* shorter than the original, with many more bugs. I was very disappointed because I really loved the original and have played it several times. Even though I'm using an \\"approved\\" video card, I had several crashes that would knock me completely out of the game, which is very annoying when you're about to finish a level. In the last mission, I found that I couldn't even use the satellite (overhead) view since it would cause a crash. I've actually given up on completing the last level until Ubisoft releases another patch.That said, the action is very good. The missions are similar to the original and in the same setting. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll like this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant suprise for under $20","review":"I had passed on the first GRAW so when my buddy and I were looking for a new multiplayer game we figured we would try GRAW2 as it had better reviews and was a cheap buy.Let me say this game did not disappoint although it is rather short.The single player experience can be hard or easy depending on how you play. You can save in the single player game almost at any time which is great. If you play allot of COD4 or other FPS games I do not think this will be very difficult, however it does require more stealth and patience than normal FPS's require.The multiplayer experience so far has been a real challenge, as there are more bots and they change places so they are not in the same spot all the time (In Campaign Mode). It is a very cool idea and adds to the game in a positive way.We have not forayed into the editor or the mods yet but we are headed there soon and hope it will add to the game, if so then this will have been a real gem of a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game","review":"This is a great shooter. A very good game, folks. There a few minor bugs (video glitches), but they don't hurt gameplay or in-game graphics. The missions are engaging and fun.

I found the game very unchallenging and too slow paced for me. Except of course the occasional expert sharp shooter from 1000 yards away could pick me out from behind a building...Plus, you have to control three or more support NPCs and that got annoying for me. Couldn't figure out how to turn them off so I just left them behind and had to listen to them calling me waiting orders for most of the game.Also had a problem with setting up the graphics, i.e. the default is set to a resolution which will not play on my monitor.

This really explains why building muscle is so difficult for most people, particularly trainees that have already put on muscle and are looking to go to the final level (which, depending upon their genetics, may not ever be as great as they hope). John Little has done a masterful job of laying the obstacles out on the table and then applying science to overcoming them. The Omega Set is incredibly intense. I used Max Contraction with great success (gaining 14 pounds of muscle) in the past and am just starting to experiment with the Omega Set. It is definitely \\"the last word\\" (Omega) in high intensity training. The Nautilus North Study is must read material for all personal trainers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for advanced bodybuilders","review":"As a bodybuilder becomes more advanced, progressively increasing resistance is not enough. Further progress towards one's genetic limits requires the use of even more demanding repetition methods. The Omega Set is about as demanding as they come.Advanced Max Contraction Training explains the science behind muscle growth and the development of the Omega Set, how to overcome physiological and psychological barriers to progress, the results of the Nautilus North study and several case studies, how to combine Omega Sets with Heavy Duty training, and more. It is a must-read for advanced bodybuilders serious about maximizing their muscular potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks.","review":"The routines require TWO training partners. I have none and won't be getting any. So the book was useless to me. I may have liked the \\"Max Contraction\\" book but the \\"Advanced Max Contraction\\" book was a waste of time for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but be careful!","review":"advanced max contraction training works. I've been doing high intensity bodybuilding for over four years and this protocol for isolation single joint movements is a great stimulas. However I hurt by back doing calf heel raises on a machine with too much weight on my shoulders. Also it doesn't work well with compound movements like squats, after three weeks I went back to full range squats and was sore as hell the next four days from getting the full range stretch in all my lower body muscles. Alternate this protocol with Mr. Little's other book, Body by Sceince, full range compound and you have the perfect bodybuilding schedule. I also advise people to take creatine monohydrate, the only supplement that works. And no, I have no financial interest in these products. Also, use Nautilus equipment if available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nautical No-No's","review":"This book, with its seventy-nine fun filled illustrated chapters of nautical humor, provides an addition to the technical treatises on learning to sail. It is a \\"what not to do and what to do when you have done it\\" approach to the education of a sailor. The pen and ink drawings serve to illustrate the subject matter and enhance the humor. The pratfalls that are bound to affect anyone who is new to sailing are described in amusing detail and provide a learning experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and Badly Out-of-Date","review":"I agree with the first reviewer. The book Wetland Landscape Characterization lacks detail sufficient to make it useful.It is very similar to another book by the author about Watershed characterization and uses much the same material. They are practically the same book in many ways.Many important wetlands are completely ignored and the ones that are featured are not significant.Lastely, the information is badly dated in this rapidly changing technology.

We take the books off the shelf every couple months and read through them for bedtime.

I agree with the comment that it leans a little too much on the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but I expect the movies assisted in a great resurge of interest in pirates, so I think it is acceptable to give credit where credit is due.The interactive pull-outs of letters, cards, etc is very enjoyable. I particularly liked the Wanted Poster of Blackbeard. I like how this book doesn't talk down, and while a young kid may not read in too much detail, they can grow into the book and take in all its details over time.Great, fun book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirates","review":"I purchased this book for my 5 year old grandson.

Enright really knows how kids think and what they want!Written in the 1940s and 1950s, they are a glimpse of childhood as it was. Kids go on adventures, ride the bus, attend the circus and concerts - all by themselves. As long as they get home by dinner and remember the family's rules of \\"don't talk to strangers and if you get lost, you can always ask a policeman\\" - all is well.The Four-story Mistake furthers their stories when their family moves to the countryside. These plucky city kids have to learn all about country life - even simple things like riding a bike are new to them.I bought the audiobook version for listening to on long car trips and my eight year old son loves listening to them at bedtime as well. The audio book reader is a real treat as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My reading list at retirement","review":"While at a garage sale this summer with my granddaughter, we came across some of the early Trixie Belden books, and I bought them for my g/d, after she promised to lend them to me when she was finished.

I ordered it, got it in 3 days, and read it that night. Gosh, the memories that brings back. Very fun story.

When I read it 30 years ago, it made me desperate to live in a ramshackle victorian house(great escapism for urban kids)!

Our experience was that the tiny cars are temperamental. Fluff gets in the cogs. We were able to extract a hair from one axle but the second car failed completely (on day 2). Our options now are either to send the entire complicated package back or hope that a retailer decides to sell cars by themselves, so we can buy a replacement vehicle.The giant 'parking structure' is well designed and assembles nicely. The cars whip through it easily enough except at junctions, where we found it very hard to steer one way or the other. Steering is quite a skill, beyond younger kids for sure. We ended up redesigning the track to not use the junctions.Bottom line: relative to its exciting appearance, X-Trek was disappointing.

The magentic base really holds on to the point it is hard to remove, has a rubber ring base but it doesn't completely cover the whole base just the outside edge. Works well you get a better constant signal than using the units supplied antenna but you have to figure out what to do with all the extra wire that you don't use. I gave it a 4 stars due to the pricing. Check out aftermarket antenna's before buying one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magellan 760 External Antenna","review":"Excellent accessory for the Magellan 760 GPS unit.

This not only implies that it is somehow the patients fault for getting ill but also that they can control it. Unfortunately, the disease does not work like that.

From a poor boy in Sri Lanka who did not have enough to eat to a monk having his own monastery here in US, traveling all over the world and preaching Dharmma.But the reason why I found this book interesting is because it dispels a myth for me. I always thought that Buddhist monks are above any other priests in any other religion. What you see in this book is the total opposite. The characters in this book suffer from the same human defects as anybody else and what they preach has nothing to do with what they do.

The vignettes of customers are wickedly funny -- Naughton has an eye for skewering the pretentions of New Yorkers, both native and Anglo.

First of all, this book has got to be one of the \\"worst\\" Accounting books I have ever read. Sure, all the authors are esteemed academics, but they present the material in a complicated and rather technical manner. Rather than focusing on the basics, there are numerous pages wasted on explaining the minute differences between international and US accounting. I read many of the chapters several times over, and still had trouble understanding exactly what the authors were trying to communicate. Overall, the book might be okay as a decoration piece on a professor's book shelf, but as a basic, hands-on tool for the beginning or even intermediate student it fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"More useful if it were complete","review":"This book is not bad, but it's not the best, either.First, a lot of the problems in the book are incomplete (e.g.: they tell you to depreciate an item but don't give you the salvage value). And they also don't give many formulas, but they ask you to come up with them on your own, (e.g. Free Cash Flow). Some of the cases and problems are pretty vague, leaving you to fill in a lot of blanks that are integral to the problem.This book is also becoming increasingly obsolete. (e.g. it was written before SOX.)That being said, the book still gives you a good idea of some the ways you can use the information presented in a company's financials to get a good idea of what's really going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Young Under Review - a complete waste of money","review":"Misleading advertising.

The only thing I really liked on the album was the Theme and the Eric Cartman song. The Chef stuff was somewhat funny but it was burned out after a few songs. The music that was supposedly influenced by South Park is all recycled garbage thats been heard a thousand times before. They also put some of the worst bands and rap artists on this.

It was bad enough that SBS in Australia showed 'South Park' originally at 8.00 pm -- yes, 8.00 pm (can you believe it!) -- but to promote promiscuity through the CD is beyond the pale. Why can't record companies promote wholesome themes -- like the thoughts of much of the excellent Christian music that can be obtained today -- rather than disturbing songs about disturbed children?

It only takes less than a couple of minutes for the game to start with the selected codes which is compared to the hours it takes to complete a single game. The memory card has a mega storage capacity for saving whatever you accomplish in any game. The only drawback is even though it has a ton of codes for many of the games that have been released, I would like to see them add codes for the games that are being released this year.

A lot of money, considering. It usually takes about a half an hour (sometimes it takes so long I just give up) before the game stops spitting back a \\"disk read error\\" message at me and loads the disk. That's half an hour of standing around by the PS2 pressing the eject button again and again and again. It's really quite infuriating. And then, once it finally works, there's a long enough load time for you to take a potty break, or two, or three, or maybe go out for coffee.In addition, there aren't very many codes for this device, and a lot of them don't work anyway. ...On the plus side, the memory card's nice. *cough*My advice?

As others have said, this book is MUCH better than the film. If the moviemakers had only used it as their script, Forever could've been the best of the original Bat films.Peter David is a truly gifted writer, and the novel does a good job of tying the story back to what happened in the previous film, Batman Returns. He also develops the prior relationship of Batman and Harvey Dent/Two-Face and delves deeper into Bruce Wayne's personal anguish over Dent's fall from grace, as well as his feelings of guilt over his parents' deaths. The novel sheds much of the silliness in the characterizations of Riddler and Two-Face that proved distracting in the film.Frankly, I wasn't expecting much when I picked this up, but I was very impressed.

The Listz rapsody: amazing! fan of Horowitz, Cziffra: listen this version, we may only regret that Murray did not record yet the Complete Rapsodies....The Consolation in D major is a regal when you have a pianist of a delicate touch.

This book routinely skips past steps. You'll find signs flipped, things factored, and numbers changed with no explanation.You sometimes end up with an answer that is technically the same as what the book's example has, but signs will be flipped in the book. Sometimes the answer is completely off, and it's because you followed the book's incomplete instructions. It's like they never handed this book to someone who doesn't already know everything in it before putting it up for sale.Skip this if your course gives the option.edit:This is based on the 4th edition, but given the nature of the textbook publishing industry, the 5th edition is probably the same book with a new cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"prealgebra","review":"Great price, with one day delivery I still saved over $80, included student manual, nicely wrapped.

Also for those interested in the mini-genre known as 'steampunk'. This is a story about terrorism, technology, and anarchy written over a hundred years ago. On the surface it seems very similar to much of Verne's work, (Hartmann the Anarchist is a madman who builds a huge airship which he uses to bomb major cities all over europe) but the book goes much deeper into the political motivations of the character, and contains an intersting dialogue between the underground socialist and anarchist movements in the 1890's. I'm sure it was a radical novel at the time, but went largely unnoticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not produced well","review":"The cd had a nice cover, but the contents of it were poorly made. One can hear how \\"sampled\\" the wind and evening crickets were when they cut in and out sharply beginning and ending throughout the recording. The majority of the recording was music, which at times didn't complement the bits and pieces of wolf howls. Annoying sounds of chimes and a bit of the harp really clashed with the howling. And the calling of the wolves was electronically altered to echoe, and resound. It was often too much echoing. But the few times on the cd in which one hears the wolves isn't enough to even relate the contents of the cd with \\"sounds of the wolves\\". I wouldn't reccomend it for anyone who is looking to hear wolves rather than music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing!!","review":"There's not much to say, but everything is positive! When I go on a long drive, and I need some peace, the wolves take me to their home of harmony, and \\"sing\\" out loud of what they feel inside.

The evening crickets and songbirds are lovely, as are the howling packs of wolves and the wind rustling through the trees. But the background muzak destroys the sounds of nature, as does the microphone echo. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in time","review":"The book is excellently written, the prose is magnificent. In the 30's 40's and 50's people had fewer distractions like TV tarnsport etc. which gave them time to savour reading well written books.

Alex and Clinton are believable, fallible young men who are at times sympathetic and at other times difficult or even detestable. They both love their sisters, their mothers, their fathers. These commonalities make their conflict all the more uneasy. Along with the HIV information, themes of alcoholism, abandonment, and what makes life livable weave in and out of the story. This strikes me as the sort of book that might appeal equally to male and female audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Alex is a teenage who is HIV positive.

Hence, many of them have come to see me. This book helped me a lot while working with those who have been in and out of prison for years.Shadd Maruna actually studied the narratives of those who have desisted from crime with those who haven't and found significant differences in the way they think. To determine how likely it was for a client to return back to prison, I would compare their narratives with those in the book.While recidivism rates continue to be high, this book does give one hope as everyone does eventually desist from crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic and Warm","review":"This is an endearing early chapter book about Robert, who always hands in messy homework, has trouble with his math, and is a slow reader.

But then Robert and his friend Paul enter a school contest, hoping to win the most points by being Super Helpers. En route, they encounter some problems, including a mystery, which they grapple with and solve. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Soul ?","review":"This book is not about Father Joe. It is about a bad boy and later a not so very nice man who writes a book in an attempt to profit economically from his relationship with a wonderful individual. Unfortunately, not a lot is said about Father Joe. So don't look for any spiritual guidance.How many people do you know who would describe an individual they care about as having floppy ears, rubber lips, etc.? He also takes his licks at President Ronald Reagan and PM Margaret Thatcher. This guy is sick, but has found a way to make a living at being sick.I question whether Mr. Hendra's soul has really been saved. In my opinion, he has a long way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book anticipating spiritual inspiration. To the contary I felt that this was naive, tedious & shallow. The hype for this book on the \\"Imus in the Morning\\" radio program was thoroughly deceptive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penultimate Example of Playing One's Self","review":"I read this recently, in a public library so as not to help Hendra's sales. I read it after being exposed to his daughter Jessica's book which makes a convincing case that he molested her.The narcissism was always self-evident in this book. But for Hendra to draw this picture the way he did where Father Joe's last advice to him is that he was put on this Earth to be a good parent and husband, that that was his destiny ... amazing. Hendra's fictitious bologna will stand throughout the ages as the penultimate example of \\"playing thyself\\" in print.To the extent that Father Joe actually told him anything like that, it reflects both Father Joe's disconnect with reality, borne of his insular life within \\"the Church\\", and the natural acceptance of pedophiliac tendancies that such a life seems to correlate to.\\"A Life Wasted Badly\\" would be a better title."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Catholic","review":"This book is embarassingly awful to me, as a Catholic. Not only does Tony Hendra display atheism, but if he was ever Christian, he is now a heretic because he believes Father Joe, not Jesus, is God made man. The fact that, late in his life, he thought he could become a Catholic monk shows a pathetic ignorance. He needs prayers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father Joe","review":"The book was in excellent condition but I had specified that it be shipped to another person and it was shipped to me. So, specify and underline it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Jesus can save souls","review":"I remember reading Son of God comics in college. I thought if there is a God, then this guy is going to have a lot to answer for. Here is a guy with a spiritual bent who has great talents and luck and throws it all back in the face of his Creator. His story and subsequent Church attendence is like throwing a bone to God, just in case it may be true, as time starts to run out for his selfish life. If his conversion were true you would expect to find more humility than the jabs he throws at his fellow pilgrims. I think he has to be a lot more broken before he can find peace with God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoda: The Jedi Who Saved My Soul by Darth Vader","review":"Having just finished listening to the audio version of this book as the new Star Wars movie opens, it seemed to beg for a satiric version with this title. For the work of a card-carrying satirist, this book takes itself very seriously. By turns it aims at uplift and revenge, high drama and low blows. It features more heavy-handed foreshadowing than most soap operas and seems to have been edited with a chainsaw. Not surprising for a writer who has busied himself in Hollywood this tome is an over-hyped under-achiever."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has a sad backstory the author never addresses!","review":"With all the glowing reviews for Tony Hendra's book, many people will be shocked, as I was, to hear that the author has been hit with strong allegations of incest and child abuse.A New York Times article headlined \\"Daughter Says Father's Confessional Book Didn't Confess His Molestation Of Her,\\" reports that Hendra's daughter, Jessica Hendra, now 39, has come forward to demand her father finally admit to repeatedly molesting her as a child dating back to when she was 12-years-old.This book needs a sequel. Or a prequel. At least, a mea culpa! And Random House owes its readers an apology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This is a sad book about a very selfish person that wasted his life while inflicting much pain on others. I would have found the read more palatable if Hendra actually experienced a metanoia, but it remains clear he continues to view himself as the center of the universe. The lessons and love unconditionally offered by Fr. Joseph were ignored at best and at worst persecuted.A couple of other points: (a) I find it impossible to believe the \\"recollections\\" are accurate as this author is prone to extreme fabrication, and (b) I found the \\"name dropping\\" to be tedious and off the mark. Silly me, I thought the book might actually be about the title - \\"The Man Who Saved My Soul\\". This one goes in the trash bin. I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend money on this book.....","review":"What a disappointment! Tony Hendra left me with a feeling that he was and probably still is, pretty shallow.Did he ever attempt to \\"clean up the messes he left behind\\"?This is definitely not the kind of guy you'd want your daughter to end up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"A pack of nauseating junk from a narcissistic, self-serving child molester. I read this book first, and then \\"How to Cook Your Daughter,\\" by Jessica Hendra. I found \\"Father Joe\\" to be unbelievable and self-indulgent from the outset. After reading the absolutely believable words of his daughter, wife, and ex-friends...this book is unworthy of being read, let alone praised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected So Much and Got So Little","review":"Over the years I've purchased several books which were recommended by Don Imus. All of his previous selections have been outstanding. I'm not sure if he really read this book cover to cover. There are funnier books you can read and there are more religious books you can read. I just did not \\"get it\\" from this book. Father Joe by all accounts was a wonderful man, maybe a book solely on his life would have been more worth while. If there wasn't all the hype surrounding this book maybe I would not have been disappointed. I expected so much and got so little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly Reassuring","review":"Although I wanted to read and savor the book, I couldn't put it down. Now I am rereading parts and underlining certain thoughts I want to remember forever. I have just ordered several copies as my selection for our book club which will meet in June. This book is brilliantly written and although it seems, at first glance, a Catholic only book, it is for anyone. Father Joe was a living Saint. Thank you Tony for sharing such a personal journey. I feel you were left in the secular world because you could reach so many people through your past connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I miss?","review":"A major disappointment... I must have missed something. The book was no more than OK. I expected to be inspired, instead I was bored and tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"I found this book difficult to finish because the protagonist, Tony Hendra (not Father Joe), is not a likeable character. Tony Hendra's \\"tribute\\" to Father Joe is actually a memoir of his own rather selfish life, which unfortunately included using Father Joe's name to sell his book. If you looking for sage advice from Father Joe, you will find little of it in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book was terrible ... he isn't funny enough to compensate for his ego. At the end when he realizes he wasn't the center of Father Joe's life he is surprised ... that just about sums it up. Imagine, this wonderful man had other people in his life ... how could he be surprised?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Book, Don't Concentrate on the \\"Scandal\\"","review":"The unfortunate victim in this Hendra V Hendra business has become this book. While I admit I somewhat know Tony Hendra, and have also read his daughter's book, I can say without prejudice that Father Joe is a great book and it should not unfairly bear the brunt of the obvious dislike for Hendra that has rendered this page vile and unreadable. Let's not judge Hendra (either one) in the court of public opinion nor let us damn a perfectly innocent book for the perceived sins of its author. Read Father Joe and see what I mean. To quote: We sin, God forgives (and judges)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"By the end of this book you will feel that you know, and love, Father Joe. Utterly moving; a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sad I found this book","review":"I found something missing in this book. I am Irish Catholic. I know what severe abuse does to the soul. Tony Hendra was severely abused physically, emotionally and sexually. He also had a pretty serious drug and alcohol problem. He never mentioned a word about recovery in his memoir. I kept waiting for something more. After I read his book, I googled him and found the allegations of sexual abuse by his daughter, Jessica. Given what I know about the generational nature of abuse, I would say, Father Joe did not save Tony's soul! Tony, you may have a little more work to do - it concerns HONESTY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, excellent narration","review":"I enjoyed the book, but having the author read is aloud adds another dimension. The author is an excellent narrator. When he reads it, it never lags. I wish there was a narrated version with just the dialogue between Father Joe and Tony. (By the way, I don't want to hear in the book just how bad a father he was. I am glad the book spared me this.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Father Joe","review":"\\"Father Joe\\" is a good book to take along on a relaxing vacation when there's time to ponder...life.Well-written, it holds interest from beginning to end. Although not a biography, the paragraphs about Quarr Abbey and the saintly monk leave me longing to be there...to experience his presence and receive his counsel. There are, among the pages, some powerful life lessons that make me yearn for more opportunity to glean from Fr. Joe's wisdom, and for the privilege to have known him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"I very much enjoyed Tony Hendra's book about his 40-year relationship with Father Joe. There are a number of useful lessons that readers might take away from this book, but I will let other reviewers enumerate them. For me, the best thing about this read is the reflective, honest and humorous manner in which Hendra looks back on the role (or lack thereof) of faith in his life, his many accomplishments and failures, and his relationship with his family."},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite part...","review":"...is when Tony meets Fr. Joe after rubbing the lamp. Fr. Joe comes out and agrees to give Tony three wishes for setting him free. First Tony wishes he had written all of Spinal Tap, but that's a wasted wish because Fr. Joe tells him he can't go back in time. Fr. Joe tells him that he can still claim he created Spinal Tap anyway. Then Tony wishes he could spend Tuesdays with Morrie Schwartz, but Fr. Joe tells him that sadly Morrie has died. Another wasted wish. Finally Tony wishes he could write the first novel to appear on the non-fiction bestseller lists. It's a moving scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the whole story","review":"Tony Hendra fails to address possibly one of the worst sins he allegedly committed - namely sexually abusing his daughter Jessica. This book should not be given another review until Jessica's book hits the shelves at the end of this year with the untold story of Mr Hendra."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Father Joe's luminous spirituality and sound sense shine through, but far too much of the book deals with with Hendra's not especially interesting life. The author's life is only interesting to readers when he brings his issues to Father Joe.The rave reviews this book received attests to the hunger for genuine spirituality in an age of charlatans posing as men of God peddling the gospel of mammon on TV and with a dangerous evangelical in the White House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little of the spirit here","review":"This book contains little about Father Joe and even less about spirituality. It never explains how Hendra's soul was saved -- if, indeed, it ever was. Hendra himself seems still very much a \\"scoffer and worldling\\" (in C.S. Lewis' Screwtape's words) at the end of the story. Thus Hendra unintentionally offers a warning about his own incurable worldliness. For spiritual sustenance, do look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Faith","review":"Very funny and touching. I wish I could have known Father Joe.

One has to live it to really understand it. Simply ask any Vietnam Vet and they will tell you...Only those who've \\"been there\\" can understand. I find it extrememly difficult to believe that Mr. Roberts lead a recon team, served as a sniper, advised a CAC team of ARVN Rangers, and was shot down and rescued... all in one tour, and as only a PFC.

I'm not too sure of durability yet as I have only had them for a month or so, but so far so good. The only thing I did not like was the fact that the large pot was red while everything else in this kit was black. I must have missed that in the description.

The name may not mean much, but it is the famous whistle-tune from THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, and parodied in THE PARENT TRAP.My complaints are minor and few.

It took me at least an hour to get most of it off, but when I wipe it with a paper towel, it's still coming off reddish brown from all of the rust. The sheet metal looks like it has dirt, oil, and grime all over it. I'm really surprised that they get away with shipping something like this to cook in.

The truly hand-hammered (The Wok Shop) wok has a characteristic series of hammer marks (giving it a scalloped surface), a heavier gauge metal and wielded handles (much sturdier).

The theology of the book stems not even from Quakerism but of Universalism which teaches that God will save all men, even the devil himself at the end of time. Madeline L'Engel and authors like this have fashioned for themselves a happy, grandfather-in-the-sky who only wants all men to have a good time and feel good about themselves while they are doing whatever it is that pleases them.According to this controversial book, Jesus' teaching on hell is essentially 'fire-and-brimstone fundamentalist doctrine' fit for the crap pile. It is sad to think that they are searching for the God who is made in their own image rather than the one revealed in the Bible and the Torah. This book is not original as men have always hated God and His Perfect Mediator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another, better choice.","review":"If you are looking for a solid exegetical and theologically sound text on what Scripture actually says about universalism, read \\"Hell Under Fire,\\" Christopher W.

(see pages 53,54). He relies more on his experiences.On page 130 he states that \\"God made the flood that killed all but 8 persons- this isn't the God who made clothes for Adam & Eve\\". Does he want us to believe in two gods??In his remarks about the Love of God he refers to Jer. 31:31-34, John 12:32, Phil.2:9-11 which do represent God as \\"saving\\" everyone\\" and then goes on to say God in not judgmental. Well, if God is not judgmental then why did He instruct Joshua to kill all the inhaditants of Jericho?

The entire book is one big red herring. Their exegesis is inconsistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on Speculation, Short on Scripture","review":"This book is well-written and engaging, a remarkable thing if you consider that it was written by two men. They speak seamlessly with one voice, though, and do not distinguish which is writing at any particular time.The arguments against the traditional Christian view of heaven and hell and in favor of universalism are rooted not in Scripture, but rather experience. Many passages are quoted, but generally out of context. The writers explain that it really doesn't matter to them what the Bible says on these or other issues anyway, as experience is their ultimate authority.This subjective placing of experience as the ultimate religious authority is what really caused their faith in the Trinity, Incarnation and sacrificial Atonement to unravel, and not Universalism.For a better study of the subject from a biblical perspective, see \\"The Inescapable Love of God\\" by Thomas Talbott."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Grace Is True","review":"This book is brilliantly written and truly expresses the good news of God; all men will be saved. The authors give some good bibical and rational reasons for this belief. I was awestriken at the thinking that went into the writing of this book and how logocal and reasonable their main thesis is. Read the book; the worse that can happen is that you overestimate God's grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"Philosopher Immanuel Kant once wrote a speech on \\"What is Enlightenment.\\" Among many things said in the speech, one point he stresses heavily is the need for one to break free of \\"self-incurred tutelage\\" to become fully enlightened. Basically he's saying that in order to see the truth, you must question what you know like the back of your hand. After all, if all your life you're only looking through the lens of one perspective, you're missing out on a lot.This book is for those who desire enlightenment. It is absolutely necessary to read it with an open mind, or else you will get nothing from it, which would be incredibly unfortunate. When I read this book, I couldn't stop thinking that someone had actually managed to put into writing what I always had in my head.It's a fast read, and it isn't a long book anyway. I definitely suggest that Christians and non-Christians alike read this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary ideas about faith.","review":"This book presents a new view of what Grace really means. It's stunning and threatening to many faiths, but it's definately worth a read. I think the fact that the book has been taken off the shelves of many Christian book stores explains how revolutionary this idea is and how threatening to the traditional faiths. I'm not saying his theory is right, I'm just saying as a woman of faith who is active in a traditional Christian church I found it moving, inspiring and thought provoking. But not threatening! I will continue to follow Jesus as my savior but recognize Mr. Gulley's ideas as inspiring and possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"As a Universalist myself, I was intitially delighted to encounter a widely distributed book that defended universal salvation. However, the problem with this book is that most Christians will likely dismiss it because of the authors' liberal theology. Gulley and Mulholland go beyond what is essential to universalism and espouse beliefs that are unacceptable to the majority of Christians. If they could have just stuck to the basics of Universalism, this book would be much more valuable. You don't have to be as liberal as Gulley and Mulholland to be a Universalist. I respect the authors' opinions, but I think this book will not be accepted by most of the Christian community.A better book on the subject is Thomas Talbott's \\"The Inescapable Love of God.\\" Talbott sticks to the subject much better, and evangelical Christians could read his book without being too offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I always had doubts about hell; it didn't make any sense that God could love unconditionally and still sentence someone to eternal suffering.

As a brave attempt to reproduce the music of Rome, it deserves substantial praise. However, if it is an accurate imitation, I pity the ancient Romans. The music of Synaulia's Disk 1 is rarely melodic and seems more post-modern than ancient. I wonder whether the repetitiveness of the songs is an unavoidable result of the limited tonality of the replicated instruments or of the composer's failure to achieve proficiency with them before starting.

It's noticeable if you listen. One never knows if their review will be implemented. Mine will always deal with the worlds of difference between hearing the work and listening. This reviewer is not concerned with Midori's ability to equal or surpass another's work. I am interested in what her presentation does for me on it's own merit.

His thoughtful interpretations should be well received by many classical music fans, especially those who've followed period instrument practice. I greatly admire not only Zacharias' technical excellence at the keyboard which he demonstrates repeatedly in this recording, but his graceful, almost cantabile-like, playing. In plain English, he strikes a fine balance between excessive emotionalism and technical perfection. The sound quality of this recording in its Hybrid SACD format is absolutely impeccable. So I have no hesitation in recommending this recent recording from Christian Zacharias as both a fine interpretation of these Scarlatti piano sonatas, and a delightful introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong book","review":"I got the wrong book.

An Absoulute MUST READ!!!Nicki Stanley, Pharmacist, Certified HypnoBirthing Educator"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacture failure","review":"I Bought these punches and returned them due to the reduced quality. The punched I received appeared to be machined from bar stock not forged. The handles were hex shank not knurled and the pin shaft was considerably shorter than the punches I thought I was buying.In all fairness the seller gave me a full refund after determining that this was a change by the manufacturer that was not reflected in the description.For those who don't know SK Tools went bankrupt a few years ago and was bought by Ideal Tools. The guarantee is now subject to an excrusiating review that I don't believe any tool that has to be sent in for replacement could pass.I recommend that for those looking for roll pin punches either buy a cheap set or spend the big buck and buy Starrett, Mayhew or Snap-On."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very standard","review":"A typical old style reader. There are a number of problems. The texts are not interesting. Even though the title is Modern Korean there is too much emphasis on things of little interest to me like Korean festivals, folk tales etc. I prefer authentic content about real people, or history or other adult material. I find the examples, drills and exercises useless.I need to read and listen. I want a good word list with the odd explanation and then more content. What I do need is an audio version of every chapter, either on CD or available for download on the Internet. Unfortunately this book is one of only two intermediate readers I have found. Both are about the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust!","review":"I bought a large Phillippe Richard cookware set (4 skillets and 4 pots, 5 lids, baking rack and pan and utensils) and within a year it has developed rust from the \\"non-stick\\" surface wearing off. I only put the lids in the dishwasher, and I've had no problem with them. I don't scour these pots and pans or use very rough cleaning pads, but the Teflon-wannabe coating on the pieces themselves certainly explains the great deal I got on this set at JCPenney Home Store. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a nicer brand. You'll end up buying new ones before too long anyway when this one rusts."},{"rating":"1","title":"rusting issue with stainless pasta pot","review":"I have a stainless Phillippe Richard pasta pot. The insert began rusting right away and the now the inside of the pot is rusting, too. It now needs to be replaced and I've had it less than 6 months. I had no issues with the glass lid, but I can't cook in a lid and I would not recommend Phillippe Richard products."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXPLOSION!!!!!!","review":"I have had this cookware set for 3 or 4 years and they did fine, but in the last couple months two of my four lids have exploded. One exploded while I was using it on the stove and the other exploded while sitting in my dish drainer. It had been sitting there for two days without any change of temperature to cause the explosion. I threw my other glass lids away before they had a chance to do the same. Has anyone else run into this problem?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Barry!","review":"\\"Chapel of Love: Jeff Barry and Friends\\" is the soundtrack of a fantastic television special originally produced in 2000 and broadcast on PBS, and later released as a home video. It is, first and last, a tribute to the fantastic music and talents of Jeff Barry, whose influence on pop music during the 1960's cannot be overstated. All fourteen performances from the program are represented here, from the goosebump-inducing title cut by the Dixie Cups (complete with heavenly new harmonies and chord changes), to Brian Wilson's version of \\"Be My Baby,\\" to his and Ronnie Spector's duet on \\"I Can Hear Music,\\" to Archies lead singer Ron Dante's cool solos on \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" and \\"Hanky Panky.\\" Simply put, if I could give this CD more than five stars, I would!While you're here, grab a copy of the \\"Chapel of Love: Jeff Barry and Friends\\" video, too, because once you have one you'll want the other. EXTREMELY recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Echo Prior","review":"An earlier comment reported, \\"it doesn't address theory of GIS programs in general that well, and I felt like my hand was being held a little too much in some things.\\" I certainly agree. The book is simply a series of examples. The examples are repetitive in part. There is very little explanation. Using up 10 pages to demonstrate drag-and-drop functions is really not necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introductory book","review":"Getting to Know ArcGIS Desktop is a very good introductory book to ESRI's latest software. It is easy to read and the exercises are easy to follow and are a great teaching tool. This book covers basic GIS tasks and will provide a solid foundation for future learning. However, I do not think this book will be useful to persons already experienced with ArcGIS as advanced topics are not covered. Overall, very good tutorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for beginners","review":"I never use ArcGIS before and this is my first experience. This book is used as a textbook in my class and it's very helpful for those who needs step by step guide in using ArcGIS. Still, it is very important to have a teacher to guide you as you will learn more in depth. For those who needs an intro, this is a very good book although you might find some instructions in the book which is different from what you see on your computer but still it's easy to make out the right steps. Good for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"ArcGIS","review":"This book is really good with giving step by step directions.

This is a great way to start learning about ArcGIS. Notice I said START. If you have some ArcView/Map knowledge, you might not get much out of this book; but then YOU didn't read the title.

If you can learn this program hands-on, you're a lot better off."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best guide to learning the basics!","review":"This book is written in an easy to read to manner and is simple to follow along.

More than this, it has ways to bust the legs (as the title claims). Sometimes it can be quicker to tap your opponent with leg / toe / foot locks than to pass his guard. The shin lock looked very effective and a potential quick tap. This has a lot of material. It has ways to bother your opponent and make him want to open his guard. It also has technical aspects which are less brutal. I gives more tools (submission locks) that are not so commonly known. I'm glad I bought it. It gave me things which I can test out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for my classroom","review":"I bought this book for the projects I do in my classroom close to Halloween.

The font size, and the size of the book are the only things that would deem it so.Save your money, and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.C. Sabuda's pop-up books","review":"Ever since Sabuda published his book, America the Beautiful, I have been giving his pop-up books asholiday gifts. The recipients love them and look forward to seeing what comes next. They won't be disapointed by the latest gift they will receive in December, the Christmas Alphabet book. It is everybit as creative and beautiful as his other books. Also, the books were on sale so I purchased them in July for December. Of course, I save a book for myself. My artist friends really appreciate the skill needed to create the books. Thanks Robert Clarke Sabuda for the joy the books have given many of the children and adults in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sabuda's Masterpieces","review":"I discovered Robert Sabuda's books while researching Amazon for children's books.We have 5 grandchildren , all under the age of 2 with the exception of l; she turned two in July!

That's how highly I recommend The Movable Mother Goose. You will be highly pleased with this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love pop ups, this is a MUST have","review":"This detailed, intricate pop up by Robert Sabuda is a must have for any pop up lover. It would make an incredible Christmas gift, too. Sitting out on a table during the holidays, it will attract adults and children. If nothing else, it will slow you down a bit during the season to open every alphabet letter and appreciate all the detail of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"He did a great job on doing the pop ups.","review":"The students at our school like the book very much.

Each different leter of the alphabet, represented by a charming old-style pop-up, will take you back to your childhood. Not just for kids, but also for grandparents to share with kids. Buy 2 or 3, you'll need them for your family and friends - they're perfect gifts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good deal, but poor quality","review":"The book itself is a wonderful book, with amazing pop-up graphics. I purchased 20 of these to give as Christmas gifts because they were at a very good price ($4.59 each). However, I was very disappointed when I received them because they were of poor quality, perhaps explaining the discounted price. Almost all of the books had glue (or possibly mold) spots throughout the white pages. Several also had bent corners and scratched covers. I am in the process of returning them all to Amazon for a refund. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"After reading the glorious reviews by other customers, I was very excited to receive this book.

I have been charmed by all of these and had convinced myself that anything by Robert Sabuda was not to be missed. I was wrong. The little pop-ups on THE CHRISTMAS ALPHABET do not compare in any way with the others, and there is literally no text whatsoever. This book is flat, colorless, and has no \\"wow\\" moments at all, which is what is so delightful about all of the others. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mushy voiced vocals, aren't inspiring.","review":"I received this CD as a gift. It's awful. I love great Southern Gospel music, but this doesn't even come close. I don't know why these people are even categorized as Southern Gospel. They sing contemporary Christian music without even a hint of any characteristics of Southern Gospel. That's fine. A lot of people like and are inspired by this type of music, but it should be labeled and marketed as what it is. The vocals on this CD are mushy. They sing like they have marbles in their mouths.If you're looking for a good Southern Gospel CD from a family group, try the Hoppers or the Lesters."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are not crush proof","review":"I have ordered crush proof balls in the past and was very satisfied. These balls can be crushed between two fingers and do not return to their original shape. I had purchased them for a ball pit, they will not stand up to that kind of play. The seller never contacted me after two attempts via amazon, an A-Z claim had to be filed. Go with the commercial grade balls, dont buy these, cheap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey dude, where's my tide chart?","review":"I've had one of these watches for about two years. While it's fine as far as watches go, be careful where you want to use it. It does not have all the tide charts that are listed in the owners manual.I know for a fact that it does not have the Seattle/Puget Sound area in it, even though the manual says it has several beaches in that area. Which by the way is one of the reasons I bought the watch, as I used to scuba dive there.I contacted Freestyle about this, and they said they were aware of the problem, yet they didn't feel it necessary to do anything about it, or inform potential customers. So sorry.Before you buy one, go to a store and try to find the tide chart you want in the watch itself before you buy one. If it has the charts you want, great. It's a handy feature to have, and otherwise a fine watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good so far","review":"I have had this watch for approx. 2 years now and it has worked fine. The tide function is very accurate for the area i live in which is NC. The only problem I have had with it is the band broke and I had to replace it. Other than that it has worked well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Im actually 18 and i REALLY love Michael Buble.

I LOVE IT! well good luck michael and keep up the good work!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stuff!","review":"This was a cute, light movie. It made me laugh and had a fun plot. If you want to watch a movie that makes you smile and is a little bit silly in the interim, Totally Blonde is the one for you. Don't take it too seriously, though. It's just plain fun. And, HELLO!! Michael Buble has quite the voice and what a face...Frank Sinatra/Harry Connick, Jr./Bing Crosby mix. Beautiful way to introduce himself to the world of music and movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"good\\" bad kind of movie","review":"Yeah, its a silly movie...but its meant to be silly! I really liked it. I liked it so much I want to add it to my collection of dvds. Michael Buble is pretty cute in it and his acting isn't bad either...he's why I watched it in the first place. Also, the songs he sings are really good too. I say WATCH IT...you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Buble Only Redeeming Factor","review":"I watched this movie only to see Michael Buble. Everything in this movie was disappointing except Michael's voice. The songs were not up to his class, however--quite disappointing. The female star in this movie is awful. How did Michael get into this mess of a movie? He is also much better looking than this movie shows him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could rate only one star....","review":"This is easily one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. Let's be honest, folks. I like Michael Buble - his singing even in this movie is amazing, but I think I'd rather be beaten silly than watch it again.I'd say, in fact, that Michael's singing is the movies only redeeming quality. And he actually is the best actor in the whole film... and that's not saying much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Another Blonde Movie","review":"Though the title may suggest this movie is full of blonde stereotypes and jokes, the movie ends up being a romantic comedy that seems to forget the character of Meg Peters \\"went blonde.\\" Aft er the sequence under the opening credits, where Meg has just another one of those bad dates, she decides to dye her hair blonde to find Mr. Right. However, after the initial shriek of excitement from her blonde friend, Liv, at the change, the issue is dropped. Meg goes on a quest for Mr.Right, but her hair seems to have nothing to do with it. Instead she gets wrapped up in other antics. A confusing friendship with V-Club Owner Van and a roll-your-eyes at his stupidity one with pretty-boy Brad ensues. Krista Allen is hilarious as Meg, a quirky but underneath it all good hearted and intelligent woman. Her attempts at physical comedy are cute, not parallel to Lucille Ball, but still add a lot of fun and flavor to the film. And personally, I think all women need a Wall of Blame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Take on Blondes","review":"What a wonderful performance by Krista Allen and Michael Buble. Cleaverly written and directed by Andrew Van Slee. A great way to bring Michael Buble's singing and acting together. This is a feel good romantic comedy. I wonder what Andrew will come up with next? Great job by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, terrible singing","review":"All I have to say is that this movie was great except one thing, Micheal Buble. Krista, Maeve, and Brody were great and I loved them all. The only thing was that I cringed whenever Buble came in. His acting was was dreadful and I don't even want to talk about the singing. I couldn't ever understand if anyone thought he was a decent actor, but Krista, Maeve, and Brody make up for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful - with one saving grace","review":"This film is generally dreadful - with a simplistic plot, an obnoxious herione, and only one good laugh (it involves a Canadian Mountie). Yet, as others have said, the saving grace is Michael Buble. His singing is wonderful and he may have some potential as an actor. Unfortunately, the film doesn't isolate its chapters so one could zoom from one Buble song to the next and skip this badly written film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally B","review":"Totally B movie with only one redeeming factor: Michael Buble's singing.Buble's acting has some potential but it's his singing that's makes this dumb movie watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch this movie only if your a Michael Buble Fan!","review":"That was the only reason that I purchased this movie was so that I can watch Michael Buble....other than that, this movie wasn't very good at all. Krista Allen plays this woman that can't pick the right guy, and when the right guy (Michael Buble) comes along, she's not interested in him. He plays a really nice guy in the movie. I didn't find this movie to be funny although it tried to be funny, it was more corny! So, only get this movie if your a Michael Buble Fan! I paid less than $7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Torture","review":"If this horrid flick were used to soften up terrorists at Gitmo instead of Christina Aguilaras' singing any terrorist would crack within 5 minutes. Michael Buble is a wonderful singer and an actor with promise but his agent should be shot for getting him in this mess of a movie. Krista Allen should be shipped to the Antarctica ASAP before she strikes again. She is the biggest waste of time and space I've ever witnessed. She can't act and she's so stupid that I don't believe that she's capable of anything but screwing something up. Until I saw this travisty I thought that the two worst movies I had ever seen were \\"Ulzana's Raid\\"--only movie I ever walked out on because of blood and violence--and \\"The Good, Bad and Ugly\\"--neverending, truly awful, spaghetti Western. Little did I know that I hadn't even begun to see the worst. Awful storyline, terrible acting, script must have been written by a couple of 6th grade boys. I wish I could give this movie minus 10 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable","review":"This is music for people who are really really drunk. In fact, it sounds as if Coyne was drunk when he wrote and recorded it. The experience evokes nothing so much as the slurred ranting of the unhappy drunk on the stool next to you when you're trying to pick the hot drunk chick on the other side of you. Will appeal to people who spend a lot of time drunk. I never, ever want to hear this album again. F"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book of Ghost Stories","review":"As the \\"Haunted House\\" begins to build with the first book in this series, Ed keeps you spellbound with true stories told by people that it happened to. This is a book that keeps you spellbound and you can't put it down until you have read it from cover to cover. Sometimes you laugh, sometimes you cry, and always you keep looking over your shoulder as you listen to the creaks and thumps in the night, wondering if just maybe you may be adding your story to those who have told theirs before you!Buy this book...and the others in the series...you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone who uses cosmetics, shampoo or soap needs this book","review":"Very eye-opening and somewhat disturbing, Ms. Vance sheds much needed light behind the long-held veil of secrecy surrounding the cosmetics industry. The lack of testing and regulations concerning common household shampoo, soap and even toothpaste is shocking and we see once again the absolute necessity and importance of educating OURSELVES as consumers (and parents)about the products we bring in our homes, use on our bodies and put on (and in) our children. My only criticism of this book is that she does not recommend substitute brand products which ARE safe, though does offer some make-at-home recipes (which few of us realistically will follow). When I attempted to access Ms. Vance's website, www.cosmetichealthreport.com, to see if she offered suggestions there, it was not up. Regardless, this is a valuable book and needs to be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you know? You'd rather do.","review":"I believe that information is the most important thing for anyone in all circunstances. When you are informed you can do better choices.This book brings you informations that normally remain under the clouds of tecnical and chemical names. Do you know what is in your shampoo? You should! Other very useful book is \\"Unreasonable risk\\" from Dr. Samuel Epstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Already Own Va Va Voom ....","review":"Despite being a big Cinerama fan, and loving everything they've done, I was hesitant to purchase \\"This is Cinerama.\\" I already owned the U.S. release of \\"Va Va Voom,\\" and there appeared to be quite a bit of overlap (around 6 songs) between the two CD's.As it turned out, there's plenty of original, superb, material on \\"This is Cinerama,\\" making it absolutely worth the separate purchase. The CD even contains an interesting cover of the Smith's \\"London.\\"By the way, the converse hold's true. If you already own \\"This is Cinerama,\\" and have been hesitant to purchase \\"Va Va Voom,\\" well .... again, plenty of great stuff on \\"Va Va Voom,\\" making it worth the separate purchase.The only thing that I don't love about the CD--yet--is a couple of the re-mixes of Cinerama songs. However, they do seem to be slowly growing on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINETELY not The Wedding Present","review":"After listening (and loving) to The Wedding Present's \\"Sea Monsters\\" and \\"Bizarro\\" I thought I'd check out Gedge's latest material. Big mistake. To be honest I didn't even give the CD a full listen. I ALWAYS give a CD at least two listens before passing judgement. But this was so bad, that I only got to track five or six before I had to turn it off. If you like syrup dipped in honey you might enjoy Cinerama. If you are expecting the frenetic, impassioned, rockin guitar driven pop of TWP then don't touch this album.Maybe Gedge should drop the girlfriend, the keyboard and the drum machine and pick up a guitar again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent melding of classical and tango","review":"Accidently stumbled onto this CD. Very beautiful! Two great composers and excellent musicians. The music evokes something very emotional, like far away places and times, that were not even visited, a melancholy tinge of the future, perhaps. Damm if I can pin it down. Anyway, if you like jazzy, chamber like, sweet but exhilirating music, this is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does what it says, but the sound quality is horrible!","review":"First off, you need to rip apart your dash board to hard-wire install this into your car's power system, which isn't so bad if you know what your doing. Secondly, it constantly has a stream of static that protrudes through the music at all times and especially when at a stoplight intersection that has a magnet under the pavement for detecting traffic and whenever you are using anything else in the car that requires electricity like the ac or the heater (the higher you turn up the fan, the louder the static gets). The only way I have found to circumvent this is to turn the bass way up, and the treble way down. This is ok for me because this is the way I like my music but for anyone else, its probably not a good way to go. All around, it does give me my music, but it doesn't give good sound quality at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not bad at all","review":"I still have yet to use it for its intended purpose, but so far it has served me well. It stands up to its claim, but get ready to get your brain dirty. Maybe its because I like basic reverb effects that aren't full of crazy options. I still have yet to figure out how to efficiently use the routing feature. Its there though, and Im sure it serves a purpose. I was really looking for a less complicated Reverb Processor.I originally intended to use this as a final between the Mixer and PA Amp, but due to the lack of time most of the bands around here put into practice, I haven't had much time to work on all that. It serves me well in the recording process, but that is a sterile environment where I can control everything with the push of a delete button.All and all I would recommend it to anyone that has a basic grasp on using reverb. IF you have never used something this in depth, just get ready to get your brain dirty. It still works well and is loaded with features though."},{"rating":"2","title":"You NEED this wok!","review":"You might not want to do as much research as I did to find a wok, but I was determined to find a high-quality, authentic wok that would provide years of service. And my research paid off! This wok is made of hand hammered carbon steel, so it will stand up to the high heat required to perfectly stir fry your favorite ingredients! Not only that, but your ingredients will stay in place when you need to move them higher up the sides. I am very happy with the results of the seasoning process. The Wok Shop e-mailed me easy-to-follow-instructions for this necessary task. Cooking with this wok is fantastic! I've already used it three times, and I have had excellent results every time. It is large enough to cook enough ingredients for a family of three. But if you have a larger family, I would highly recommend the 16\\" wok. Either way, you will be very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the wok I'd hoped for","review":"Unlike some other reviewers I am not happy with this product. The handles DO get hot ... so much so that I needed a pot holder to hold onto them. And I needed to hold onto them because the wok is easily tipped. The edge of the rim was rough and likely to cut a finger had I used with it much more. It will instead find its way into the garage sale pile and I will find something better to cook with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coatings","review":"Although the steel is a little thin, the two big problems are surfaces and coatings.The inside of the wok is not smooth but shows the indentations of the fabrication. Food tends to stick and burn in these uneven surfaces.The bigger problem is the coating on both the inside and outside. I started to season the wok and immediately smoke and an unpleasant smell started pouring off the wok. There is a thick sticky coating that required at least a half hour of scrubbing with \\"Googone\\" to remove.I would have much preferred a smooth cooking surface and no coating. After all is said and done, it's just okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best no stick pan I every had","review":"Season pan the right way, researched the internet and found what made since to me (help full hint, if it don't take you more than a half hour than your not doing it right.) Now I been cooking with no oil, just steaming with water and when done, put some water in pan and back on heat, take half of a paper towel and wash out pan and rinse out and put back on heat intill all moisture evaporates and starts smoking and turn off heat, than pour a little oil in pan and take the other half of the papper towel and and coat pan with oil and you have a non stick pan for life. PS Never let food harded in your pan, allways clean as soon as you done cooking, food needs to cool a little anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS RELEASE IS TAKEN FROM THE VINYL LP","review":"A great lost classic for sure, but does anyone who bought this, realise that this is transfered & cleaned up (a little) from an LP? Alot of \\"Ticks\\" & some \\"Pops\\", are clearly noticable throughout the CD. The giveaway is the begining of Track 7.

I guess if any R Kelly associated artist or group has shown they need his midas touch, it's changing faces. They have lovely voices, but the production was weak on too many of their tracks. I'm getting tired of buying cds only to find two or three good songs on them. People need to take time on their product rather than rushing out and having their stuff released when it's below the buying public's standards.

Taylor expends a lot of energy attempting to justify the unjustifiable. He lamely attempts to paint the picture of Dresden as a strategic military target while totally overlooking the dire condition not only of German military capabilities but even of the country's elementary infrastructure. The title alone is an indictment of the book. What incredible arrogance on the part of this apologist for Allied war crimes. He would have us believe that on Tuesday, February 13, 1945 Dresden was a serious military threat that required the most barbaric incendiary bombing ever carried out. Quite frankly, anyone who has studied the condition of Germany in 1945 would not be foolish enough to accept the author's premise.

He struggles with the morality of British \\"Area Bombing\\" - sometimes more, sometimes less during the course of the book - but overall enough to be credible. His account is detailed and well researched, and also covers the post-war period and various distorsions of the most probably actual events. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive, well rounded and researched.","review":"This is perhaps the emergent \\"revisionist\\" view of the Dresden bombing. Irving produced the initial, horrifying, description of the mass destruction of the allied attacks - Taylor places them in a more pragmatic wartime context, but also looks at the history of Dresden itself and shows it to be not quite the cultured, non-military city of the earlier histories of the bombings. Dresden was undefended through lack of preparedness, the RAF were by Feb 1945 professional and skilled in area destruction. The need to appease Stalin remains unanswered. Dresden had its centre ripped out - and visually still suffers today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Printing?","review":"The printing of the book is a complete disaster.

The daughters are all declaring their independencein different ways and that is difficult for their all-too-traditional father. The relationship between the girls and their father is well-portrayed as a cross between love for the family and desire to lead their own lives. There are lots of scenes where delicious food is being prepared and they are a delight to the eyes of the viewer. A little spice is thrown into the mix when Racqel Welch appears as the mother of a family friend who has her eye squarely on Hector. Predictably, the daughters are not too pleased about the situation. This is a light-hearted comedy set around a close Mexican family and it makes for a most enjoyable evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight Rip Off","review":"As a Mexican-American woman living in the United States, I am glad to see Latins finally being represented on the big screen in a positive way.

I must have played the Columbia LP over a hundred times until it finally wore out. It was only a memory until I discovered the CDCarmen Without Words. It was a wonderful reunion. Apparently, the master recording was damaged because the original Toreador Song in Act II was replaced by a sublime Bernstein version (the trumpet solo is simply beautiful).

He also doesn't seem to be in touch with his masculine side, his vocie is very, well if ying is male, and yang is female, he sounds very yang. He needs to take some liberties with the songs he sings and then he won't sound so obnoxious, then he needs to take some vocal lessons and try to bring out the ying(masculine side) in his voice.

Maurice Bucaille challenges the reader to look beyond the initial, obvious translations of scriptures, and to try to see the deeper truths contained therein. If you believe in God, then this book reinforces that belief. Unfortunately, the Bible has been tampered with by man, and God's words have been changed - but the Qur'an has remained unchanged since revelation. This book also challenges the accuracy of certain translations of the Qur'an, forcing Muslims to re-evaluate their total, unquestioning belief in these translations without ever considering that it might be fallible. All round a well-balanced, interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and obsolete scholarshp thats no longer significant","review":"Bucaille has committed a grossly wonderful job of mis-representing, selective misinterpretations and scripture-twisting of the Bible. And Dr.William Campbell was doing nothing other than rightly representing the facts again, and correcting all those gross misinterpretations. I would say that it was Bucaille who has tried to lead many closed minds to become more shut. Whereas, Dr.Campbell has opened many of those closed minds with the clear light of truth again. Furthermore I also agree with the previous reviewer that theres a lot errors and mistakes in The Koran scientifically, historically and factually! One has just to study the few passages listed objectively, to get to know the truth! So much for the 'Word' of God!

Any inaccuracies in the book will nullify the other claims.It does not take a rocket scientist to realize that Al Talaq 65:12 is scientifically wrong. \\"IT IS GOD WHO HAS CREATED SEVEN HEAVENS AND EARTH AS MANY ...\\"Followers of any religion should accept their holy scriptures simply as religious guidence NOT as scientific revelations nor as historical treatises otherwise they will end up making fools of themselves.PD"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting analysis of the Quran's scientific accuracy","review":"I first read Dr. Maurice Bucaille's book two years ago, and since then, have recommended to many people that they read it. In fact, I consider it to be one of the most interesting and thoughtful books on comparative religion that I (in fairly extensive reading) have ever read. Dr. Bucaille shows through careful analysis exactly how the Qur'an is far superior to the Bible in its scientific accuracy, and how in fact, science can be used to prove Islam's truthfulness.

Finally, the sound quality of the recording is also excellent: clear, delicate and with a natural sounding reverb field.It seems that this item is not available now at Amazon, so if you can find it used, buy it immediately if you love German baroque music for harpsichord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steven Lance- raw, unbridled precision","review":"Vulgarian Goulash has left one deep, dark imprint on my psyche. I read several of the stories while traveling through airports on my way to Chicago for a holiday, and the images that were retained haunted several of my susequent days of leisure. Pure enternainment at its most crass. The stories work on several different levels at once, creatively engrossing one in the storyline while introducing political, theoretical, ideological, phenomenological and several other lines of thought to characters from all walks of life. With his piercingly clever style of writing and dark, steamy imagination, Lance will chisel pretty deeply into the people who read it.

His vocals are nothing to write home about, but you can't deny that his words of pain and hatred are born from his heart and experiences. He backs up his statements with strong and angry emotions. If you're in a bad mood you'll probably make a connect, but if things are alright in your world, Barry may just bring you down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Candidate for the Nazi Book Burning Fires","review":"This is BY FAR the worst computer related book I have ever touched. I seriously doubt that the Author even knew what he was doing when he decided to write this book. I purchased this book a while ago, and after trying to create working examples from his bug ridden code I became so distraught that I used this utterly worthless book for firewood. I have never seen anything like this before. Even books written by college professors for use with only thier classes have less errors and those books often have several pages missing and thousands of typos. So, if you are even considering buying this book, then do everyone a favor and DO NOT buy this failer of a book. Hopefully the author will lose money by writting books and as a result be forced to give up writing, which will be beneficial for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible book","review":"I bought this book only because I need to try to support the Kodak FlashPix format, and this book happened to have some code related to that format. Unfortunately for me, the code doesn't work. It constantly returns errors and cannot even open the FlashPix pictures that came with the book on the CD. This is the second (and last) worthless computer book I've bought from Wordware. I contacted then to see if maybe there had been an update to fix the bad code on the CD, and they told me they don't support the code contained in their books and that I would have to contact the author.One star is the lowest rating Amazon has, so that's what I entered... but it deserves no stars and a whole mess of lemons because that's what this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book seems totally unedited!","review":"Wordware apparently never applied any editorial skills to what was obviously a poor first draft of what could have been a good book. The text is often disconnected to illustrative code, the code on the CDROM misses some chapters and is not in the correct directories. It is a roll of the dice trying to find the code you are interested in. A large number of the formats covered are of no interest, and for the money it is a puny book. Nobody should buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book!","review":"Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book! This has got to be one of the worst programming books I have ever seen.The code included on the CD doesn't match that in the book, and neither set of code work. The included examples crash, have missing files, and various other problems. The author includes his e-mail address but ignores all questions, so support is non-existant. There is not one redeeming quality of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your hard ( or easy) earned money","review":"I picked up this book in the Bargain book bin for $4.99 and paid five times its value.

He still uses far pointers, an artifact of 16-bit Windows 3.1 that disappeared 12 years ago with Windows 95, which itself is antiquated! Nobody programs like this anymore in 2008 (or even in 1998!).I find the chapter \\"What's not in this book\\", where he rants about redundant discussions that typify other programming books, to be mildly amusing and I read it from time to time just to get a laugh. Other than that the book is a shelf decoration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful and deep indeed","review":"A very good and underappreciated album. Though not quite as consistent as Law of the Fish, the Rads major label debut, the best tracks here are about as good as the Rads ever get. Their combination of greasy blues rock, New Orleans second-line funk, and Memphis soul (can anyone say Stax) never sounded as good as on the best tracks here. Everything Gets in the Way could easily have been a classic 60's soul hit, and You Can't Take It With You is absoultely smoking good time rock that needs to be turned up to eleven, as Nigel Tufnel would say. Molasses is a beautiful acoustic tune, and other stand-outs are Let the Red Wine Flow, Honey from the Bee, Total Evaporation, and Soul Deep... Party 'Till the Money Runs Out is a fun tune that rides a Mardi Gras groove similar to Iko Iko that makes you want to do exactly what the tiltle says. There's a bit of filler here: A Grain of Salt and Good As Gone don't amount to much, but overall its a very strong record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloatware keeps it from working in VISTA!!","review":"Others had a problem with the retracting mechanism...

I have another SanDisk that slides the usb key which works perfectly and is very easy to use. I don't know if I got a bum key but this one STINKS! The problem is every time I go to insert it into the usb port it pushes the darn thing back into its case! I can spend 10 minutes trying to get it just right so it finally inserts. My wife got a great deal on the drive and was so excited so I don't have the heart to tell her its flawed. I should soon though because I see they do have a 4gb in the other model. This design is pointless to me because the other one works just as well and isn't that fancy.Bottom line, SanDisk makes quality stuff but this design is not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Collection by Lightfoot","review":"I have to say that I was expecting a bit of flash and glam with the DVD, simply because that's what we seem to be used to these days with entertainers. This is a great DVD, because it is simply a gifted singer/songwriter sharing his music, supported by an obviously skilled and talented band. I found, as did others, that Lightfoot \\"up close and personal\\" was something to get a bit used to, but the music is magical. As I continued to watch the DVD, I was really entranced--the combination and synergy of the voice, the songs, the back-up music, and the enthuasism of the audience.Particularly given that in late 2002 he suffered major health problems (to say the least), I'm really grateful that we have this opportunity to have this gifted entertainer recorded on DVD for posterity.

His more recent albums have been less than successful, but he does perform all the songs that made him famous and a standard on AM radio in its heyday. His voice no longer is the baritone it once was, but he still gives every once of energy he can. This is a good compilation of his hits and he and his band do them all justice.I've seen him in concert and in this performance he does not engage the audience with talk that he once did. Perhaps this is by design, but it would have been nice to show others what this man can be like in concert. After 40 years performing, Gordon Lightfoot is not burned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gordon Lightfoot-Live In Reno","review":"Let Me Start By Saying I Love Gordon Lightfoot but this Dvd is awful.

Truly exellent. This is the Mona Lisa masterpeice of guitar music.\\" It manages to showcase some of Santana's early work, the latin-pop-rock-blues, as well as including the Santana band's later, more Jazz and spiritually infused music. It also includes the 16 minute masterpeice \\"Incident at Neshabur\\", my favorite song of all time.BUY IT, FEEL IT, DIG IT, BABY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good","review":"I think that the original vinyl release of this amazing concert sounds a little bit better than the CD, but still, this is one good show. Everyone talks about Incident and the other long instrumental jams, and they're certainly worth noting, but how come nobody talks about Leon Thomas? He even throws in a little bit of his trademark jazz yodeling on Black Magic Woman. You don't even mind so much that his mic feeds back for the first couple of verses.It's a pity that they couldn't really reproduce the huge fold-out graphics that came with the original album, but it's still well worth the price.

Parts of it sound like he's practicing, not performing.If you like songs, try Moonflower or one of the early studio albums. Even true devotees would have to admit this set pretty far from melodic, although it has about three spots where it becomes recognizable (such as Black Magic Woman on disc one).And what's up with that long drum solo on disc 2? He's got several great people playing rhythm but instead we get a rather conventional, '60s-style drum solo.I love Moonflower; I just can't connect with Lotus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware - This is Jazz!!","review":"Many folks who love the classic rock Santana just won't find anything here to appreciate. Non-the-less, Lotus is snapshot of Carlos during the middle of a phase that meant a lot to him.The playing is all top notch. The overall sound is good but not great. It's a little to high pitched sounding without a nice warm bass to push this recording over the top.I still give it 5 stars because of the excellent playing thoughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best live Santana recording, hands down","review":"Two hours of nearly all instrumental music, beautifully recorded at Santana's peak as a band.

We LOVE the Cookshelf Thai book and have no complaints about it. My husband and I have enjoyed many of its recipes and have not had a hard time with the directions making sense. What some may view as a dumb-downed version of Thai cooking is actually what we would consider a fun way to enjoy Thai without making it into your part-time job. We love the Pad Thai recipe (which always turns out delicious and is a whole lot more authentic than the box mix most people get from the store). We also love the Green Chicken Curry, the Thai-Spiced Cilantro Chicken, the Mango Coconut Smoothie and the Coconut Rice. We cook from it weekly and many of our friends have enjoyed the recipes as well.

From using Ketchup to make Pad Thai (yes I know that authentic ethnic food can be difficult to make but how many corners can you cut before you still call it ethnic?) to a Crab bruschetta with mayonaise this book shows you what Thai food is not. Your time would be much better spent searching all sorts of Thai food recipe websites than using this book.

Moreover, many of the group's most enduring numbers have been left off the box set: the Gene Clark classics \\"Here Without You\\" and \\"Set You Free This Time\\"; their treatments of \\"Wild Mountain Thyme\\" and \\"Satisfied Mind\\"; \\"Change Is Now,\\" etc. (Some of its inclusions are rather questionable too, specifically the later ones.) I highly recommended the original albums, especially in their expanded versions; they are essential listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gram Parsons Strategy","review":"The best sales strategy for box sets is to offer what the hard-core fans crave, but have never had. The Beach Boys offered tracks from the legendary, unreleased SMILE; the Byrds give us the Gram Parsons lead vocals that Lee Hazelwood succeeded in getting wiped off the original SWEETHEARTS OF THE RODEO. Very hard to resist at the time. (Are these the same tracks included on the later issued single CD?)Besides providing a complete, idealized version of the beloved country-rock classic, this box well programs the the output of the original line-up, though a couple of more tracks from NOTORIOUS would have been appreciated.

They perform amazinly on Dylan's songs and Dylan should have written songs specifically for them. This Byrds box set is a must for any die-hard Byrds fan. It covers their entire career from their LP \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" through \\"Byrdmaniax.\\" There is also a booklet describing the band, it's members, personnel changes and a family tree depicting bands that have evolved from the Byrds.

If you've ever wondered what your toys did when you left the room, or if you like Raggedy Ann and Andy, you may want to check the movie out."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"this movie is incredible, very trippy and very magic. to those who are mourning its disappearance from video rentals, i suggest renting \\"dunderklumpen,\\" another 70s live action/cartoon involving stuffed animals which i have had better luck finding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experimental animation at it's very best!!","review":"At first glance, this movie looks like typical children's fare. Toys come to life, musical numbers every five seconds, and then, you get to Mr. Greedy and things get wonderfully weird!!! I remember renting this video and watching it countless times with my sister as a child. I loved the songs, to be sure, like the Camel's signature lament about how it feels to be a discarded toy. But, the best part was always the wickedly weird animation. For cartoon buffs and animation students, this film is an ultimate must-see. If you can find it cheap at a garage sale or a library book sale, buy immediately and don't look back!! This may not be your \\"normal\\" animated film, but it rocks!! there is a similar film out there called \\"Arabian Nights\\" or something like that that came out in the nineties, so check that one out too, definitely!! SEE THIS FILM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Generation deserves this enchanting musical!","review":"I loved watching this movie as a child and would love for my own children to share my memories of Babette, the Pirate King, the camel and Rageddy Ann and Andy among others. In this Disney dominated era it would be nice for my kids to have something \\"new\\" to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A childhood classic.","review":"I remember watching this movie constantly as a child. To this day it's one of the few I remeber very well. When all the toys come to life it really fulfils everyone's childhood fantasy. It's a remarkable, captivating and magical movie. Hopefully they'll re-release it so that we can shre this timeless treasure with our children."},{"rating":"2","title":"*THE* movie of my childhood","review":"This is the first movie that ever stood out from all the rest so well that I NEVER forgot it. I've been scouring the country for this movie and could relive one of the best memories of my childhood if I could see it again. Fun for ALL ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply The Best","review":"This Video is the only one of it's kind featuring our most loved childhood favorites Raggedy Ann and Andy. The story is wonderful and full of color and excitement. It is nice to see our Beloved Raggedys come to life. I hope that it will be released again and be made available to others. All chldren should be able to see this splendid video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by poor engineering","review":"I checked this CD out from my local library. I'm a big Nigel Kennedy fan, but the engineering on this CD is just awful. The violin sounds very unnatural. The overall sound is quite lackluster. Unfortunate, because it gets in the way of a pretty good performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch...","review":"First of all, it is way too expensive for what it is.Second of all, it isn't anything new or fresh.Third of all, musical quality isn't what I expect from the label.Compositions are dull and (maybe) sounding like some othertunes I know, sounds out of pitch and can't find any good groove.Could have sounded better without violin on it.Maybe next time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shared experiences","review":"I read with a great deal of interest and anticipation A. Cleveland Harrison's book UNSUNG VALOR. I was certainly not dissappointed. It is an anutobiography beginning with his youth in Little Rock, Arkansas and continuing through his military experiences in training and in combat in Europe during World War II. The emphasis is on his military life.My enjoyment of the book was expecially magnified by the similarities I had growing up and as a GI during World War II. I also loved my country but was loath to serve. It, however, made me a stronger person. Mr. Harrison expresses this very well.I recommend it wholeheartedly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsung Valor","review":"As a former member of Co B,301st Regiment, 94th Infantry Division who shared many of the experiences described by Cleveland Harrison,I am impressed by the manner in which he describes the feelings and frustrations of the private soldier. The enlisted men often felt that they were the pawns of generals, manipulated for hidden motives. Only in retrospect do see their own importance. Harrison captures this as he personifies the common man."},{"rating":"2","title":"a clear view to the most compelling period of our life time.","review":"Unsung Valor was recommended to me by a history libraian who knows I am attempting a similar work about my older brother and his friends.My only hope is that I can express those times as clearly and honestly as Dr.Harrison.This should be reqired reading for students of U.S.History.In my expierence I have read no better account of what is was like for the ordinary soldier during WW11.Dr.Harrison told me more than news jouralists and high level accounts have in over 30 years of study and research. Donald W. Colbert Little Rock Arkansas March 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretending to be dead counts, I guess.","review":"Hopefully, irony was intended with the title. Or not. boring & trivial memoir by someone with a remarkably detailed memory. Unfortunately. wasted my time due to 5 star reviews. death in combat may have been preferable to sharing a foxhole with this \\"impersonator\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, clean descriptive tale of an \\"ordinary soldier.\\"","review":"This beautifully written memoir of WWII is the real account of personal events in the life of a drafted eighteen year old boy from Little Rock, Arkansas.While the author describes day-to-day activities in army life, there is considerable humor, warmth, fear and drama in the book. It is extraordinarily accessible and interesting. The person projected here is a most likeable and naive young man who ends up the friendly, compassionate writer of the book.Dr. Harrison's ability to remember so much, in such detail, really immerses the reader in a different time. Even if you aren't that interested in WWII, you will certainly be interested in the story of this young man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull personal catalogue","review":"Memoirs are necessarily self-centered, but the best are connected to incredible personal experiences or probe beneath the surface to explore an emotional life. This book does neither. It is a well-written catalogue of names, places, rooms, food eaten, weather conditions, etc. Harrison must have a photographic memory or something is at work. There is nothing remarkable or interesting about his service in World War II, and the title is more than a little misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"I agree with those who say this is not a traditional Hot Tuna album. That doesn't mean it's not a good album, however. It's a little more mainstream, a heck of a lot of fun and definitely worth adding to your collection. 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing pictures...deceiving","review":"I have ordered for this watch-Kenneth Cole - KC6021 (Size: women). However, I got a different watch delivered to me.If you'll click the details of this watch to see the different angles of the watch, you'll see a picture of another watch!and that watch has been delivered to me.Sounds confusing and I don't know why they've posted TWO DIFFERENT PICTURES OF WATCHES under one item.I tried asking Watchzone,but they've got nothing to do.So frustrating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Art's Images Blow You Away","review":"I hiked with Art in Patagonia when he shot the images in the Edge of the Earth, Corner of the Sky while I was researching my own new book, Classic Hikes of the World. Time and again, Art would rush to a spot and set up his camera. I looked where he was pointing but saw nothing unusual. When we returned to the US and I saw the pictures, I was shocked. Art has a unique ability to capture fleeting moments, or pick out the one element in a landscape that makes a strong composition infused with magical light. Each time I looked at the shots in this book, I'm glad I'm a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelmed!","review":"This book delivered more than I was expecting. I was expecting to see some really great photography of God's beautiful Earth and I did. What I wasn't expecting is to find in the back of the book the details of how Art captured each shot! He describes the look he wanted and how he got it - from the camera used, the lens used, the time of day for proper lighting, the exposure, . . . This book truly met and exceeded my expectations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, cleverly wrought tale","review":"On their way through Virginia, Fancy and her sister are captured by ruffians and saved by Chance and his friend. When they reach their destination, a tangled web of who is planning to marry whom, partly solved by Chance's forcing Fancy to marry him by sneaking into her bed one night, brings on a tale of jilted loves, revenge, and learning who truly stands to inherit a huge estate.This is really a tale of several twisted romances between three men and the two sisters. It is upbeat, funny, and overall well done. I read the book quickly and was held in terrible suspense several times. The subplot of Chance's possibly being the original beau's brother was a great turn of events and really kept me going. This was a not-to-be-put-down book in many ways, so I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is classic Shirlee Busbee...","review":"Although this book was not as exciting as her earlier works, I still enjoyed it because of the historical detail that is synonimous with Ms. Busbee's work. The caracters are fun but I thought that she could have gotten a little deeper into Chance's earlier years so we could get a better handle on the man he was in the story. Fancy was a fine lady but I expected a little more fire from her especially with Change and most definitly when she butted heads with Jonathan. I hope we don't have to wait too long for the next episode from Ms. Busbee's imagination.

YAWN!!!!! I do have to admit, however, that the scenery shots were excellent. I prefer documentaries with commentary so I know what I'm looking at. Yellowstone is such a dynamic place, close to my home, and I wanted a DVD that enhanced my experiences with it. This one just didn't do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful video","review":"This has become a favorite of mine to watch while I walk on the treadmill. I love the wildlife and landscaping, watching Yellowstone go through the seasons. It has a nice classical soundtrack and tons of beautiful and fun to watch scenery. I recommend this to anyone who has gone to Yellowstone or wants to see some of its beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Read","review":"This is an excellent DVD. I love Mr. Rogers. You get the story of his life with many behind the scene videos and videos of award ceremonies and talk show appearances. It is narrated by Michael Keaton who used to work on the set with Mr. R. It's great! The one star rating is to get your attention. The third party sellers here are charging two, three, even more times what this DVD should sell for. If you go to Family Communications (which you will remember is Mr. Roger's company) you will find this DVD/ VHS available for sell.The cost is about twenty dollar. They ship quickly and they are reliable. They also have many other items for sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true inspiration","review":"This DVD was a great tribute to a truly inspirational man. I grew up watching 'Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood' and it still stands out as a genuinely unique program for children, in it's one-on-one sense of communication and the lessons the show taught.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the inexplicably extended interviews with Joan Rivers (of all people!) that followed some truly moving segments that talked about his lifetime achievements for his sincere mission to reach children with gentle compassion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for every Mr. Roger's fan","review":"If you are a Mr. Roger's fan, you have to have this in your DVD collection. Great story and behind the scene look at this show that has captured fans for generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what i needed!","review":"I purchased this grater based on the good reviews it received.

Particularly enlightening is the perspective it throws regarding why Sweden, as an ethnically homogeneous country undergoing a major shift from an agrarian to an urbanized society and with a lively interest, not to say an obsession, with its own cultural roots, never went down the same road that Germany went down after 1870.As such the book is worthwhile for anybody interested in the development of modern Swedish culture, and in fact it is eminently more readable than most other books I've seen on the subject, while still being authoritative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Color Plates","review":"I am a big fan of this genre - and the book is well written --but hey- where are the color images? There are dozens in black and white (?) but only about 8 in color. I understand that this is an art history book that is heavy on analysis..but color images are a MUST. I would not have purchased this book if I had understood how crappy the images are--what a shame. This is such a wonderful genre of art, and the colors are magnificent in the real paintings.I would not buy this book unless you have a great visual imagination.With all the fine minds, and excellent research behind this project..I wonder what they were thinking to publish a book about beautifully colored paintings..in black in white.

I do believe that Donald Lawrence is one of the most talented and anointed producers out there. His ability to write songs that tough the heart of our spirit is nothing short of God given. Although I was looking for something totally new and fresh, the Cd was old D. Lawrence, which is still a very good thing. It has some songs that will get you out of your seat in a holy dance like \\"Testify\\" and \\"Never Seen the Righteous.\\" Then it has other song that will leave you in praise and worship and full of tears like \\"When the saints go to Worship\\", \\"Love the Hurt Away\\", and \\"Superman\\". All in all, this is a very good album, probably one of the best out there next to Hez. Walker's \\"Family Affair\\" and Fred Hammonds new upcoming album. Get this album, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Sickening ode to one of the most horrible episodes of the 20th century, made all the more worse by its artistic sensibilities.

While those people need solid information, its a breath of fresh air to find a book written to the autistic community and by members of the autistic community. For instance, this book has the most succinct and nuanced discussion of the community advocacy issues that I've found. I'm very glad I purchased this book and am sure I will refer back to it from time to time through my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asperger's Self-help","review":"I purchased this book for my twin daughters who have Asperger's Syndrome. They are bullied at their high school by their peers and sadly, by some of the adults there as well.The book was touted as a handbook to \\"help\\" kids advocate for themselves. My daughters reported to me that it was a joke, and very cliche.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent book for autistic people","review":"I would recommend this book to any autistic person, family, or friends of autistic people. who has to navigate any form of the neurologically typical society. This book explains information that autistic people need to know about, school, work, and even social life. More importantly, this book is good for building relationships with those who are allies of the neurodiversity movement. With enough people reading books like this one, maybe autistic people can actually be seen and heard. The author has both the real world experience as well as the credentials to write this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I'm sorry to say, but this book is so bad. It's a waste of money, time, and everything else. I might sell this book, but I would feel bad for anyone who ends up buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this if you want to learn or review immunology","review":"I bought this book as a review for USMLE step 1, and I started reading a friend's copy of levinson's review of medical microbiology and immunology. Not only is Levinson's the best resource for microbiology, but its immunology section is fantastic for both learning and review. I tried reading HY immunology afterwards and was only confused by it. It is poorly written and inconsistent, and not at all high yield--I wish I had not bought it. I guess there are some okay parts to HY immunology, but there are much better alternatives (Levinson's, How the Immune system works)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drew","review":"I am using this book in additiion to the classes I am taking for a second year medical student.

Depending on the nature of your Immunology course it might be oversimplified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea.","review":"As in all the CD's in this series this is well priced and does exactly what it says on the label. But this is undoubtedly my least favourite of those I bought. The cascades sound more like a running bath to me. Rather than making me feel relaxed and lulling me into meditation they make me aware of my bladder and long for a trip to the bathroom.My advice if you want water is go for the ocean surf track, which is the best of the bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV Snow","review":"If you want to save yourself a few bucks and get the same effect, unplug your TV's cable/antenna and turn up the volume. Listen for the lovely snow sound that comes with the snow picture. At least watching TV snow is more interesting because there is a visual to go along with the sound. This CD stinks so bad it should be used to wake up terrorists for sleep deprivement tactics. However it may put your newborn to sleep, go figure? Probably because its the only way he can get rid of the noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is It Bath Time?","review":"This is the most uninteresting CD so far. No gulls. No birdsong. No thunder. Nothing to break the monotony of.... running water.If the sound of running bath water thrills you, then this is the CD for you. It's cheaper than paying the water bill at the end of the month.The weird part is that after a while it sounded more like static than tumbling water - the kind of static you hear when you've misdialed your radio.If you enjoy water sounds there are many other delightful CDs available. This one is just plain boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast fast fast","review":"Great product no matter the vendor. My dogs turn themselves inside out for this treat. I have an agility dog and I find that these are good for at home training. Not so good for trial or class treat because they are so crunchy and take a sec to gobble."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADAPTATIONS BY A PEERLESS GENT","review":"This is a melding of two earlier albums, both recorded around 1960. These adaptations of works by Tchaikovsky and Grieg tend to get ignored by the jazz critics, and are probably deplored by the classical ones. Which is a pity, because the love affair between the two genres goes back a long way, think of Stravinsky and Ravel, for example. This was another attempt to bridge the gap, by orchestrating the Nutcracker and Peer Gynt suites for Ellington's orchestra. But whereas the Duke composed with his instrumentalists in mind, neither Peter Ilich nor Edvard had that advantage.Of the two, I think Peer Gynt has the edge, mainly because the resultant textures are more keeping with the spirit of the music. Duke's attitude to the Nutcracker suite is more tongue-in-cheek, as witness his retitlings, but it's an interesting approach nevertheless. The filler is the Ellington/Strayhorn \\"Suite Thursday\\", which the band attacks with relish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for fans of Ellington, fans of the Nutcracker","review":"I'm not much on jazz, so I can't really comment on how it compares to Ellington's other work or other jazz. But if you know someone who likes to have as wide a variety of Christmas music as possible, get them this. A large part of the collection is a bunch of renditions on the most memorable of the Nutcracker music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"The CD itself is exactly how they said it would be. Good condition and all. The only problem I had was that it took quite a long time for it to actually get here. But I believe this is because of inclement weather so I have no problem recommending this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blast From Our Parents Past","review":"If your are in your 50's as I am you will remember hearing this LP playing on the record player at home.

It is music that is good for your spirit in that it takes you through a few different moods,but in the end it all made me feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...Awesome!","review":"I first purchased this CD about 5 years ago and it's been a favorite ever since.As a classical musician married to a jazz musician I was really curious about what Duke Ellington would do with the Nutcracker Suite.All I can say is that it's absolutely fabulous and wonderful! We need to see the ABT dance to this version someday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hands on","review":"This is a book for those who wish to practice and improve their writing creativity.

His openness to the work of other poets, and his deep feeling for the suffering of the Holocaust combine here to bring a large and varied collection of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not enough energy","review":"I love Eurodisco and Albert One's music in particular, but his \\"Best\\" album shows that it is quite ok to stick to his popular singles released on many Italo Disco compilations, especially long versions, and anyone's collection will not suffer without this release. Even versions of famous numbers like Secrets and For Your Love are not as good as the original mixes that came out in the 80s. Most songs are just too flavourless for one to sit through the whole album. I barely take it out of my CD rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"I have been a big Albert One fan since I found him in the mid 80's. I have several of his 12\\" singles. My favorites are \\"For Your Love\\", \\"Hopes And Dreams\\" and \\"Everybody\\". I bought this CD (new) to have a \\"CD Quality\\" collection of his most famous songs. However, I was very disappointed to hear the sound quality. Over half of the songs sound horrible. Only a few are listenable. I suppose I could try to return it. Since others have mentioned the sound quality, I doubt that getting another will solve this problem. Now I am converting all of my 12\\" singles to mp3 files and then burning them to CD's....so now I do have CD quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic score in a grand tradition","review":"The merits of the 70's TV series \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" have been debated by science fiction fans for over 20 years. But one issue that is beyond debate is the excellence of Stu Phillips' stirring score for the series' movie-length premiere episode. This is music in the great tradition of the space saga and its cinematic precursors.The score has been newly recorded by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Stu Phillips himself. This new recording pulses with energy and emotion. The mysterious prologue, the powerful main theme, the tender love theme for Cassiopea and Starbuck--each track is wonderfully realized.Whatever flaws it had, \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" was a saga with both an epic vision and a tender heart. Stu Phillips' score expertly captures these twin aspects of the saga. This disc is an essential addition to any good collection of science fiction and fantasy film music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"This is the music I've been waiting for! I'm especially thrilled that Stu Phillips was able to come back and conduct his own work -- these pieces are his babies, after all.The only thing lacking on this CD is that little piece of intro music you heard at the beginning of every episode over the opening credits: the one where they run through the cast of supporting characters, writer for the episode, director, etc. But even without that piece, this is still a great CD, a must-have not only for BSG fans, but for fans of orchestral science-fiction themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music almost as good as john willaims","review":"great music i love this soundtrack. i mean the show was short lived but i mean the music is great and the show was great and i dont know why it got canceled oh well thats a subject for another day. anyway the soundtrack is excellent. i for one got a tingle runnin up my back when i heard the main theme. excellent music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bike at War","review":"A very interesting model depicting the top military of it's time. A perfect item to depict the Flower Wars and the rapid pace toward the Eastern Front. Even later in the war a few bikes can be seen on the Western Front strapped to a panzer providing alternative transportation when the need arises.This is a model requiring some assembly and patience when detailing with paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eccentricities and suspense","review":"This is a well-weaved, humorous mystery about the bad things that occur to the quirky Kelling clan, their friends and associates. I was crestfallen about the turn of events half-way through the book, but can't say why for fear of revealing too much of the story. Nonetheless, it was very fun to read, with many suspenseful moments. I especially enjoyed all the eccentricities of the characters in the book, in addition to the Boston setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"I recently got my hands on a copy of this DVD and I am extremely disappointed after acquiring it. I have an extensive music DVD collection and this is by far the worst sounding DVD I have. The sound is too low, particularly the vocals. I have music DVD's where the footage was taken in the 60's, 70's, 80's, or the early 90's and each of these DVD's have a much better sound than this DVD. I feel there is absolutely no excuse for this considering it was made when all this technology was available to them.The band seems to be putting on a good show, but I found it impossible to enjoy it because of the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This DVD is perfect for any Godsmack fan. Nothing beats seeing your favorite band perform live. It's even better when the sound quality is top notch. The video/sound quality is superb and I have no complaints about it. There are no special features and it would've been a great addition to the DVD, but it doesnt ruin it in anyway. So if you, or someone you know likes Godsmack, than this is the DVD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like being there","review":"Rather than repeat what other reviewers have already written, I felt compelled to address the concern others have made regarding the sound and vocal quality. This DVD sounds like the audio was recorded off an open digital microphone rather than straight from the soundboard. It has a bit of an echo to it, and at times the vocals can get a little bit too low in the mix. Overall it is a great DVD, but not the highly produced and polished \\"platinum quality\\" sound that some people have maybe come to expect. I attended a Godsmack show on this tour, and this DVD is what it sounded like to be there. If you like the band you will love this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT !!!!","review":"The sound is terrible! I love the music and I've worn out both of their CDs but the poor sound on this DVD has no power at all. Sully is almost inaudible. Godsmack ought to be embarrassed by this release. I can't even watch the whole thing because the poor sound is such a distraction. For those that say that this is true concert sound, I submit that a concert DVD out to sound like the first row not the last row.

Children would love listening to this disc at bedtime.The only thing I don't like is the choice of background music. It reminds me of an old carnival carousel. Its murky resonance contrasts with the crystal clarity of the dolphins. It quickly got on my nerves. Luckily I can turn down the volume and allow the dolphin cries drown it out.If background music annoys you, you might want to buy a dolphin disc that isn't enhanced with music."},{"rating":"2","title":"good place to start","review":"for those who have had little trianing in linguistics as regards to greek nt it is a good place to start"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solutions to live, learn, and love by in the 21st Century","review":"Dr. Jones' book reinforces the way I treat my wife, children, and business associates in my life.

It chronologically details Michael Jackson's musical achievements in a large, clear format with dates in bold font. There are many great picturs, BUT the majority are in black & white.

There must be something strangely erie about chronicling such an iconic man's life only to find yourself facing too soon the ordeal of writing the final chapter, coming to grips with the most monumental loss in music history.I'm sure there's a detail or two he may have missed, but I know of no other work that is as complete. There are great photos. It's not meant to be a classic coffee table book of stunning photography--it is as the title describes--a visual documentary.I've never met Michael but everything I've read by those who have convinces me that he left an indelible impression on everyone.If you're researching his life, or just curious to know more about his journey, this book is a must-have.My thanks to Adrian and all who contributed to its creation.

John was estatic at being able to record with Yank. Sadly Yank died not too long after it's release.

The flavor is balanced with no one particular one ingredient taking over. It is a farily simple hot sauce flavor profile with vinegar, garlic and onion boosted with citrus to make it interesting.I have to admit, it was not quite as hot as I was expecting after seeing it had both habaneros and pepper extract in the ingredients, and from the many warnings on the label about how dangerously hot it was. Don't be fooled though, this is still a very, very hot sauce. I have had other sauces without extracts that were as hot as this which is the only reason I bring this up. I suppose it could be possible the batch I got was weak for some reason and I did not get a typical sample.This is a good sauce, I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a soundtrack!!!!!","review":"This soundtrack is amazing!

It is even harder to actually find soundtracks which reflects the movie. Some of my favourite soundtracks are the X-Files movie, the Truman Show and the Matrix. It is easy to relate some of the songs in the soundtrack with the actual movie. This makes for a very good soundtrack. One of the reasons i bought this CD is because i like \\"Sway, by Bic Runga\\". The reason is that during the scene where Oz lost his virginity to his girlfriend, one of the first thing i noticed is the song. I really like it and it is very good to listen to when you do work or relaxing. Some of the other songs were rather plain though, but i'm not going to say which.

I think it could've been so much better if it included full length versions of the songs the choir in the movie sing - 'do you believe in magic' and 'to be loved by you'. these songs were some of the funniest non-sexual moments in the film, and definately the best songs. Maybe Universal will release a second soundtrack to be go with the video? I hope so!

Very few soundtracks have every song used. This is a CD I plug in to my CD player in the car and sing and dance to it with my girlfriends while e drive around. We really get into it nd have lots of fun doing it.

Great songs are used throughout the movie. I then decided to buy the soundtrack and was horrified to discover that the CD has practically none of the featured songs in the movie. Instead it's limp collection of sound-a-like songs by dull sound-a-like bands that are barely even used in the movie except in the extreme back ground. A complete let down. This soundtrack CD should be held up as the biggest con ever and shouldn't be represented as the real soundtrack to the movie. It's more like one of those pathetic \\"more music from...\\" CD's that have become popular recently as a way to snag more cash from consumers. Absolute rubbish.

So I can't tell you if this album is amazing in that area...but I do know that the lyrics of this album are something more than powerful. The words resonate with you long after you turn the music off and you find yourself stealing certain phrases over and over again to express how YOU feel. There's just something about OtR that keeps you coming back, again and again. I would encourage everyone to listen to this album. It makes sense in a world that otherwise doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I need is...OTR","review":"Take off your shoes, close your eyes, and step into the Imaginary Apple Orchard. Over The Rhine creates yet another masterpiece. Good Dog Bad Dog reaches new levels in songwriting. With intelligent lyrics, beautiful harmonies, and Karin on lead...Who could want more?

To say that I highly recomend Good Dog Bad Dog is a huge understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good music","review":"I think this albus is really interesting, i can say that here you can find a good band playing music as only Cowboy Junkies did with their Trinity Session. Good music, lyrics and a very good solist voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hats off to Good Dog Bad Dog","review":"I first heard of Over the Rhine while watching an episode of \\"Mysterious Ways\\". There has been a cry from people to know about Over the Rhine. Well this is a great CD to begin with. The first track, \\"Latter Days,\\" is the most beautiful song I've ever heard. Karin Bergquist has the most beautiful voice of any female artist. And then there's the lyrics. I've never really liked poetry, but that's what music really is. Just set to a melody. And somehow, when set to a melody the poetry is transformed. If this album doesn't elicit a visceral emotional response, I just don't know what will. This CD is not something you can just play in the background. It draws you in and once it's got you, you're down for the count, so to speak. Obviously, I'm not good at reviews, but Over the Rhine is great at making music."},{"rating":"1","title":"great watch, awful band","review":"I bought this watch less than a month ago, and I got this one because I knew I wanted a Timex Ironman (I've loved the ones I've had in the past) but I didn't want the resin band, because it irritates my wrist and my last one got discolored. This watch is great, and I use all of its features regularly--I originally bought it to time my runs, but I also use it to count down study time so I take regular breaks, I love having 3 alarms available to set, etc. The problem is, in less than a month the band is completely fraying! I have strings hanging off in multiple places that I need to cut off. I do wear the watch all day, but I take it off to shower. I just can't believe the band is falling apart so quickly. Obviously Timex has a lot of work to do as far as their bands are concerned. I'm not sure what to do because I do love the function of the watch itself. I probably will not buy another Ironman in the future unless they change something significant about their bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Unisex\\" Strap Much Shorter Than \\"Men's\\" - Too Small","review":"I bought this watch for my husband, and the strap is way too short to be comfortable. It fits more like a woman's watch. Would probably work for teen boy, but not for a average sized grown man."},{"rating":"1","title":"too heavy and clunky","review":"Way too much material for a simple watch. What happened to the simple \\"pin\\" design for watchbands? This watch has lots of rubber or latex material at top and bottom of watch itself, then the design forces the watch band to wrap over itself making for a very clunky, heavy sport watch. Timex had a great mid-size Ironman design for years. I find this particular design to be neither attractive nor practical. Went with the Timex Expedition instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Stories!","review":"This is a terrific book I stumbled upon by accident. If you enjoy \\"Twilight Zone,\\" then you'll love these. Each story had an ending I didn't see coming. And each time I finished one, I ended up with a giant grin on my face and a big \\"WOW, cool!!!\\" I must say, I rarely like books of short stories. They're usually very uneven in quality and readability. This is the exception. This is a great book by Jeffery Deaver. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful - this is a rip-off","review":"The name of this book is very deceptive and makes it sound like it contans follow up stories in the vein of those in Deaver's book \\"Twisted\\" (which is also available in audio format). Lo and behold, it's actually just more stories taken from that book. This audio book should have been named something like \\"Nocuturne and other stories from Twisted\\". Based on other reviews I've read, I'm not the only one to have been duped. The stories in \\"Twisted\\" are good, but jeers to the publisher for pulling this fast one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but . . .","review":"This is a fine book. I appreciate the concision and depth, certainly an asset of the authors' experience. This could be the best book on broadcast writing, but the price is too steep. This is a good $30 book, but to ask $50 is too much for students going into the lowest paid position requiring a college degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising","review":"Well I ordered this c.d. with limited expectations. Never having heard of St. John, I poped the disc in my c.d. player and was very happy with what I heard. This album has amazing energy and is excellent for party's. It blends a bunch of club anthems into one beautifully!! That being said, the disc does hit a lull at track 8. Some of the mix downs are a bit rough, and it doesn't end with the same energy it started with. Still yet a worthwhile purchase!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin plot, lots of random facts about Cubans","review":"There's nothing suprising in this book...the plot is predictable and the characters are stereotypes. Instead of reading a romance/mystery as it was advertised you get a dissertation on Miami Cubans...how they like their coffee, thier booze, their cars, their food, how they feel about Elian and Castro (as if we couldn't guess) and on and on. Even when the author stuck to the plot it was passable at best. My advice...pass of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"Not a lot of substance to this book or any of the characters, which would be acceptable if the book was funny or had some kind of redeeming entertainment value, but it doesn't. I absolutely loathed the main character, a manipulative, one-dimensional, shallow, self-absorbed ninny, more obsessed with dining in four star restaurants and her designer clothes than in her family, her friends or her job."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no mystery, Garcia-Aguilera can do romance","review":"Once again Garcia-Aguilera has written a book that I just can't put down. I have read and love all her mysteries- so I picked up this romance with eager anticipation. I was not disappointed. The main character Margarita is easily likeable, which makes the trials she faces that much more intriguing. Sometimes you want to yell at the book and tell Margarita what she should (and shouldn't) do. But the author is measured in the development of the plot and keeps you turning the pages all the way to the end. Mix that in with an interesting take on Cuban exile politics and humorous insights on the world around Margarita and the picture of wild, steamy Miami is complete. Another winner from Garcia-Aguilera."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Genre NOT a Success","review":"As a BIG fan of this author, having read ALL of her earlier works, I was greatly disappointed in this book. The plot was thin to non-existant. It was a struggle to continue reading, but I persisted hoping it would get interesting with the next turn of the page. As I read I had the feeling that the author had struggled as much in writing as I was in reading. In her future books I hope she will go back to the themes she has had so much success with in the past. They all were interesting and fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hottest Book!","review":"I loved this book, from the moment that I started reading it to the end, I couldn't put the book down. The ending made sick, what they did to margarita was just out of this world! GREAT BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This romance novel is right up there with the rest of her amazing mystery novels. Being a guy, I was a little hesitant about reading a romance novel but I just had to give this book a shot because I have been such a huge fan of Garcia-Aguilera's books. And to be honest, I absolutely loved this book. I love the way she presents funky Miami and its crazy Cubans in not just this book but all her books. Garcia-Aguilera did a superb job with this book, and I can't wait till her next book. You gotta read this book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one hot summer is HOT HOT HOT!","review":"As with all of Ms. Garcia-Aguilera's books, I think this is a MUST READ, impossible to put down. Successful deviation from past Lupe Solano series-captures the very essence of the excitement, local color and diverse fabric of MIAMI. Sensual and culturally enlightened!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Conceptual Review","review":"The binding of this book, which struts the CCNA #640-507 label, is slightly misleading. A beginner will not pass the test studying this book alone. That being said, this is a great book to start with. The topics covered, from Spanning Tree Protocol to VLANs and Access Lists, are explained in detail with steps for implementing the technology thrown in. More comprehensive configuration examples and having those examples grouped logically would be a plus, and would have raised my rating to 5 stars. It is important to get a good grasp on the subjects presented in the book for taking the test and for performing the job. If an individual does not have much hands on experience, reading about the same technologies from more than one author (in a variety of books) will help greatly to understand networking concepts from all angles. I would definitely suggest reading the book... But for those in a hurry to get the knowledge and get on with the test, you should check out other options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does cover the course, but I failed the exam.","review":"I failed the CCNA exam wtih this book.

See _Upgrading and Repairing Networks_ by Terry Ogletree for a good general primer."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXACT SAME book as ICND for 640-507","review":"The book didn't change, except for the cover. I compared the 640-507 book with the new one for 640-607 and the info is, page-for-page, exactly the same. You can turn to page XX in one book and the exact same info is on page XX of the other book. See, the ICND material didn't change. The only thing that Cisco changed was the format of the test (640-607 has the material weighted differently; Cisco.com might explain this better) and (I think) the passing score is higher. So, if you want to study for the new test, use the same ICND book, but the NEW Cisco Press study guide for 607 instead of the old 507 guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for what it is","review":"I have tried several CCNA/CCDA books and this one has been one of the best. It's clear and consise. If you are looking for a book to hold your hand, do not go further but if you are will to use the package as it's intended ( Cisco Exam Certification Guide and Interconnecting Cisco Network Devices) it works well. The information while dense is presented as clearly as it could be with the exception of VLSM. VLSM is tough anyways and I have yet to see anyone write it down clearly. The book does expect you to have some background and access to a router or two.I used this to pass the newest CCNA V2 test which has a higher pass score then the V1 test. For the record, my pass was 946 with these books. They work *IF* you put in the effort you need to. These books will NOT spoon feed you the test answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"For CCNA exam or not, good material","review":"While most novices find this book too technical, those who are in networking industry will enjoy this book. If you're taking CCNA exam, it's better to read Todd's CCNA guide first and read this book. That'll make things easier for you. This book covers more details and gives you insight about networking. If you really want to be a networking pro, this level of reading is necessary anyway. I recommend even after you passed CCNA exam, reading this book will be beneficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"This book, although it has its fair share of interesting pictures, is quite unimpressive. Was it actually more than advertised I would say run the other way, save your money for a better book. The editing is some of the worst I've seen, and the book is very poorly organized, with grainy pictures and (very) poor diagrams scattered about in hodgepodge fashion. If you're looking for an authoritative account of Soviet Submarines in the Cold War, you're better off looking elsewhere. Unfortunately, as far as I know, when it comes to pictures and diagrams of these Cold War legends, there are few other comparative books out there...Ultimately, I expected far more of this book, which for the most part proved disappointing. Again, its only saving grace is the fact that some of the pictures found within I doubt have ever been published in the West before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Her Best Effort","review":"Although her wonderful, intriguing novel \\"Mulvaneys\\" was one that was hard to put down, this collection of short stories leaves me wanting; I read it in the wee hours when I can't sleep, and I'm usually asleep within 20 minutes. Knowing she usually writes on the dark side of life's issues, these stories seem to me to be redundant and have excessively similiar themes...rape, illicit sex, fear, murder, alcoholism, etc. With a short story, we expect the unexpected, of course, but many of these shorties just left me asking \\"what was that all about?\\" There are a couple of exceptions: \\"Fire\\" had some depth and was emotive, but, sadly this book is not one I will put in my bookcase - it will go in the \\"give away\\" box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Away from TV and playstation","review":"Kids should play more away from electronic gadgets, this is the ideal starting point.

A couple are good and a couple seem to be written high on drugs. Grant Morrison is one of the most inconsistent writers. I don't know why he's praised so much. One of the highs for me was bringing in the living members of the JSA. It's great to see the old Flash, etc. back in action. And seeing Captain Marvel (Shazzam) and Superman battling each other was also a great moment. Too many of the stories don't coincide well. (Some of the action takes place during the \\"Batman: No Man's Land\\" era.)And some are there just to setup later stories. Overall, although a mixed bag... it was an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"JLA vs. the World","review":"In this trade the JLA goes up against the Shaggy Man and the U.S. Army, a former JLA-member, Triumph and a genie and an elf from the 6th Dimension. This story also brings Johnny Thunder's magical genie into the contemoprary JLA scene...pretty enjoyable. There's also a story that takes place in Gotham during the No Man's Land arc where the JLA is to take on Bruce Wayne in civilian guise. Overall most of these stories were enjoyable and I personally liked them. But take note that none of these are earth-shattering stories like the ones that you would find in the Tower of Babel or the Obsidian Age, they have no long term effect but in traditional JLA-standard they are just out saving the world and having a great adventure in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nicely Done","review":"A well put togeather paperback, continueing the saga of the new and improved JLA.

This trade really disappointed me and on re-reading has disappointed me more.Story lines: I guess they have run out of acceptable opponents--maybe cause they made the heroes so powerful. One story they confront 5th dimensional beings, in another book, 6th dimensional beings. What's next 7th dimension?Art work: Fancy colors but look at the characters: they are all standing around in muscle poses, hands on hips or arms crossed. The action seems cardboard. Those poses are fine for cover art but should't they look like they are doing things?I just think things in comics have gone down hill--I will get my son as many reprints from the 50s and 60s and let him appreciate the genre as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my goodness","review":"Oh yes.

What can one say about the DVD except that it is a great pleasure to watch it. I regret never having met him or seen him play. The DVD is surely a must have for every lover of music.Aalf Molenberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Life!","review":"Stephane Grappelli: A Life in the Jazz CenturyThis 2-disc documentary is what all documentaries should be, interesting and informative. Grappelli was 88 at the time, but whilst his voice was weak, his mind was still very sharp. Full of performance clips, photos and interviews with talking heads. Disc 2 includes more interviews, plus complete versions of performance films, including all existing footage of Django Reinhardt, including the priceless 6 minute film, Jazz Hot.To sum up : A Gem of a Documentary. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, this is cool!","review":"First off, any band, whether it be metal jazz or polka, that does a cover of a Savatage song, is cool. No arguements. Holocaust is an amazing song Chris, once again as in the original version, screams out \\"Are You By The NIGHT?\\" Not scream, but shriek. Nightly good. The other great covers are Blackout, Stepping Stone, and In League With Satan (Venom RULES!) But I could do without Purple Haze. That sounds ridicoulous. Also, Sweet Leaf was great damage to the gods of metal. \\"I LOVVEE YOUU!\\" Ick. Chris is an excellent growler, and the guitarist really knows how to play. Fine stuff. As to quote from Chris:AAAAAAAA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MUSIC IS HEAVY BUT CHRIS'S VOX SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"AFTER NOT LISTENING TO SFU FOR 10 YEAR?i HEARD OF THESE COVER CDS THE MUSIC IS TRUE TO FORMAND TIGHT BUT THE VOCAL KILL THE SONG ENTIRLY.THEY REALY DID DO GREAT COVERS NOTHING MORE BUT CHRIS VOX JUST KILLED THE WHOLE VIBE AND MADE THIS UNTOLERABLE TO LISTEN TOO.WHAT A SHAME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Embarassing","review":"Some bands can release a whole album of cover songs and make it work (see Napalm Deaths' Leaders Not Followers 1&2), but here Six Feet Under fall flat......horribly flat.

Other greats butchered by SFU: AC/DC \\"TNT\\", Dead Kennedys \\"California Uber Alles\\", Deep Purple \\"Smoke On The Water\\"......the list goes on and on.

These guys picked all the wrong songs to cover, and they just completely trash excellent songs. I mean, come on, a death metal version of Jimi Hendrix? What the hell were these guys thinking?! And AC/DC was another horrible song pick, because they are pretty well known for having more high pitched vocals, and these are the total opposite. They should have picked songs that would have fit in more with the style of music they play. This isn't even good for a death metal album. It's just sucks.

Haunted, I thought was great. The rest wasn't as consistent, but had merits. This album, unfortunately, is a steaming pile of feces.

Not that I believe that UFOs or Aliens are imaginary things, in fact I believe there is good evidense for them, but Hopkins \\"may\\" be influencing these people and that is certainly the most logical and scientific explaination for what is going on.

What's essential is here anyway, like \\"Stray Cat Strut\\", \\"Rock This Town\\", \\"Rumble In Brighton\\", and \\"(She's) Sexy + 17\\". Everything here though is just good fun rockabilly.

Ruby is actually the widow of the rabbi of the local, small Jewish community in Eternal, Texas.

The new character, Opal, is absolutely precious. The pictures are outstanding.

We were accustomed to wild adventures and postcards. This one had few words and tiny blurry pictures that did nothing to help the absence of text. My toddler is too young for loose teeth (the book's subject matter) but the text was brief and trite. Other than that it was just a lot of white space on the page.

Not only does it have sissal, but it also has things to keep it in place. No slipping around all over the floor like a little pad that I also bought recently. Furthermore, the wood on the end is helpful. One of my cats likes to drag himself along the floor, using the bottom of the couch and his claws to propel himself. Great fun, but not so great for leather furniture. If you place this right in front of the couch (and there are regular scratching posts on the ends), he can't do it. At all. And it gives him something else to scratch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best scratcher","review":"This is my second scratcher.

After living with this scratcher for 4 months, I can tell you it is as beautiful as I hoped (well, as beautiful as a scratching post can be) and our cat uses it for 95% of her scratching needs (I don't think a lifetime of squirts from a water bottle will ever curb her love affair with our green armchair).

A professor of men's studies once wrote in a book that mostly women take his courses, so this doesn't surprise me.The chapters have many important thoughts. They point to how completed the issue of gender and work is, especially for poor countries with high unemployment and low GDPs. The problem is that this book is a little boring. The cover is dull.

If you want a treat look into the Burnside Exploration, two of \\"Big Daddy's\\" grandsons, their blues power duo of guitar and drum was \\"doing it\\" before anyone ever heard of the White Stripes.

RL continues his history of making music to lift spirits and make you want to dance. Even though the tone of this album is darker than his prevuious albums he brings some relief with his tracks, Miss Maybelle, Too Many Ups, and Nothin' Man. He also proves his ability by , not only remaking \\"Chain of Fools\\" but dramatically improving it. He lets us into his own soul with his heartfelt singing. Hard Time Killing Floor and RL's Story shed light on this artists troubled past and gives more depth to work by letting us see his past that made him a blues man. Some hard core fundamentalist may not like the modern style of this album, but I'm sure RL would remind them that Blues is just supoosed to be dance music.

I have been able to use a few for an extended period before they break.I do not reccommend these ponytial holders if you are looking for strong and thick ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charmed","review":"The only part of this book I liked at all was the one by Jayne Castle.And it was so condensed as to be almost superficial.As for the rest, I certainly wouldn't buy a book by any of the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"Out of the four, only Jayne Castle's and Lori Foster's are worth mentioning at all. The other two are totally forgettable. Castle's is a nice little addition to her futuristics (little being the operative word).Lori Foster's story left me cold. It had the potential to be a great story - I loved the mind reading stuff - but frankly the sex creeped me out. I've always enjoyed a little kink in the sex scenes, it makes a story interesting. But the thought of ALWAYS having bondage sex, which is NEVER reciprocal... BLECH. The guy needs to see a sex therapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Bridal Jitters: An entertaining story, but entirely too short. Of course in a novella collection like this, there isn't enough space alloted to tell a whole story. Castle, however, is ambitious to try to convey the entire world of the Curtain and Ghost Hunters in this brief tale. A lot of questions are left hanging, and one hopes that other books in the series will clear them up. Virginia seems lame, but I'd like to know more about Sam.Man in the Mirror: Terrible. F.Tangled Dreams: Decent. Kinky.Pandora's Bottle: Pretty good, actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This was a disappointment to me, as I had expected a novel by Jayne Castle and the book was actually stories by different authors, with the Castle just one (quite short) of a group."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it 0 Stars, I would!","review":"This is one of the worst collection of short stories I've ever read.

As I started to read the first story I realized that I had already read it.

On top of that,they were marginal reads the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"All four stories good - well worth the price","review":"I purchased the book primarily because of Jayne Castle (Jayne Ann Krentz) - I'll read just about anything she writes - but the other authors were surprisingly entertaining.

I couldn't put this one down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really Tristan","review":"I've read most of Tristan Jone's books, and they all have a distinct writing style. 'Seagulls in my soup', however, has a distinctly different style. We do know from other work that Tristan is a tough nut. He reports the only time that he ever cried was when his eye was knocked out of its socket by a falling gaff and he had to shove the eye back into place. He also, normally, uses as many expletives as non expletives. Yet in this book the writer seems somewhat less than rough around the edges, embarrassed by the usual expletives, over uses adjectives and metaphors that can only be described as cringe material, and in general portrays Tristan as some kind of new aged sensitive type. Having said all this I think the book is fine in its own right, but I don't like the feeling of being conned. I really can't believe that the author is Tristan Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just incredible","review":"I have to tell you that I have been mesmerized by this album since I heard it for the first time a few weeks ago. I as you can tell am brand new to the music of Townes Van Zandt, I discovered him by being a Steve Earle fan and hearing Steve's tribute album to Townes.Our Mother The Mountain is pure magic, all at once it is one of the most beautiful and sad albums that I have ever heard, Kathleen is the perfect example of this, heart wrenching and gorgeous at the same time. And as was stated in another review here the title song sounds like it was written and performed hundreds of years ago, like one of those song catcher tunes , I can listen to it everyday and not tire of it.I could go on and on but what's the point, every song is fantastic and I am so grateful that I found this album , now I will have to explore his entire catalog, this guy was one of the greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"A small thank-you to Norah Jones, and a huge one to Townes","review":"I've got most of Townes' stuff, but had never heard 'Be Here to Love Me' until I heard it on the recent Norah Jones 'Feels Like Home' CD ... which is actually pretty damn good itself.Which has naturally made me track down Townes' original version.I was lucky enough to see Townes twice, a couple of years apart I think, at small concert venues all the way down here in New Zealand, and his effect on the audience in the quieter passages was such that you could have heard a pin drop. Funnily enough, I remember chatting to one of the concert promoters a while after the second show, and asking him if they had plans to get Townes back... he smiled, shook his head and said 'he was just too much hard work'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Townes Sings Like an Angel","review":"Worth it for the glorious St. John the Gambler that has be one of the greatest performances of his career. The rest is also fantastic. A great starter album if you are new to Townes and an essential album in any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life . . .","review":"Yup. I bought a tape version of this album for a couple of bucks somewhere a few years ago, and I dare say it changed my life. I can't promise the same for you, but it's a classic album by one of the great songwriters of the twentieth century. I give it four, rather than five, stars only because I found that the instrumentation took some getting used to. The songs, though, are tremendous, and that, after all, if why one listens to Townes Van Zandt--for the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"You would not think that a book concerning Fetish trends etc would put you to sleep but this book will.

Stand out tracks are the two I mentioned above and \\"Confess\\", \\"Crazy World Like This\\" and \\"I'm Only Fooling Myself\\".

Unfortunately this wasn't the case. If you're looking for the same thing, this isn't for you.It tastes more like a Green Tea Latte from Seattle's Best (which I don't care for). It's also a really disgusting brown color, not bright green. It did not come in the packaging shown here.Basically this is a syrupy brown liquid, both too weak on the green tea flavor and too sweet. It tastes even more artificial than the drinks at Starbucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you get in the starbucks","review":"I'm really disappointed that this tastes so horrible.

If you have grown up romanticizing horses and cowboys and you thought this might transport you further along that path, you might not find this book enjoyable. However, if you actually grew up on a ranch and were horseback from the age of 6, you will love the biting wit Mr. Ulph uses to describe the equine experience. He doesn't forget about the bovines either. He gives them equal amounts of center stage.

I still love her, but I cannot understand the scarcstic approach taken by this author. The book has a nice cover though. As my mother taught me, if you can't say something nice about somebody, don't say anything. The author is apparently a loner who has been made cynical by his rejection by the civilized world.

I have read the first chapter and it is worth every penny I spent on it. However, I don't think it is very good. I suspect the author is more fascinated by his observations than any reader will be - which is why I sort of like the book - because the author seems so absorbed with his own observations he cares little for whether they have any educational or entertainment value for his reader. ... - he is the only one having a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abstract","review":"The writing of Mr. Ulph is too abstract and leaves too much to the imagine. Pity, he takes topics with interest and potential and then slowly loses the reader's interest by infusing his own personality into the word paintings he is trying to draw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Anybody","review":"The prior reviewer's efforts at praise miss the mark. He spends his energies explaining who the book is not for, a rather inclusive group that includes just about everyone, and has nothing to say about the book. The book is self indulgent - it is the voice of the author critiquing a world without painting for the reader a picture of the world he is talking about. Evidently, the author's friends grew tired of listening to worn out tales, and so he tried to reach strangers through this book.It is not well written. Not illuminating. Not entertaining.

The comedy isn't funny, the nudity is anerotic. The plot makes no sense.

I just thought I'd add one more thing.I've had the experience several times of liking one track from a band, buying the album, and finding that the rest of it doesn't sound like the track I like. That is NOT the case here. If you've heard \\"Crystal Clear\\" or one of the other tracks, then rest assured that it represents the sound of the band and the album.I give it 4 stars out of 5 because it's not exactly a life-changing album but it is very fun and listenable all the way through. I have no complaints at all - I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite soundtrack, ever.","review":"I saw the movie at the Music Box Theatre here in Chicago, because I try to absorb as many non-American films as possible.The story is a touching one, but the prize is the lovely music offered. Simply the best blends of Viet traditional with lush classical orchestration, most notibly the strings and subdued vocals.I can NOT find anything that touches me in the way that this sountrack does. It seems rare to kiss raw Viet with tranquil ambience.Maybe I should run out and get a backup copy. Other soundtracks, artists to consider if you like this one: Kundun, Beyond Rangoon, Putumayo's \\"Music from the Tea Lands\\", Pham Duc Thanh's \\"Vietnemese Traditional Music\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great World-music CD...for existing fans!","review":"The Euro-take on classic Vietnamese instruments and arrangements on this soundtrack provide one of the most ambiently-compelling set of tracks I've heard in this vein in a while, and has got to be one of the best, more current representations of Vietnamese music (although, again, realized through a Euro, Horowitz sense of tracking) in a film setting I've heard. If you're into the Om Lounge series, the ambient Art of Noise CD, the \\"Kama Sutra\\" soundtrack or world music at all, you'll dig it a lot.If, however, you were simply looking for something to pop in the player to groove to, this isn't one of those fly-by-night purchases. This music uses instruments/vocal styles that you might not be accustomed to hearing in your music, so for the newcomer to world music, I don't recommend it first. Come back after you've heard a few CDs in the Middle Eastern/Asian vein that you actually liked, and THEN get this one.

Barnes covers Thales down to Diogenes in a less scholarly and more personal style than Kirk & Raven use in their book of the same name. Barnes is less concerned with philological and historical interpretations than with \\"whether the Presocratics spoke truly, (and) whether their sayings rested on sound arguments.\\" He also is an entertaining writer. For instance, in pooh-poohing the currently fashionable tendency to stress the irrational side of Presocratic thinking, Barnes writes: \\"...that even the Greeks had their moments of unreason is not to be denied....

The \\"Argon Oil\\" portion of this brand is heavy with silicone first and so low on argon oil that it makes this a simple silicone product, the oils in it are essentially useless..

All of the dermorganic products are AMAZING on my hair and I will never go back to styling my hair without using Moroccan Argan Oil. After one month of using the product, my hair was super soft, drying time was cut down by HALF and my hairdresser said my hair was incredibly strong and more resilient. Organic Shmanic. Mayonnaise and beer are supposed to be \\"good\\" conditioners for the hair, doesn't mean I want to go around smelling like a backwoods redneck!Dermorganic saved my hair hands down, and my husband RAVED about being able to run his hands through my hair when he kissed me for the first time after being apart due to his military deployment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for My Keratin Treated Hair!","review":"I recently got a Brazilian Keratin treatment and was told by my hair dresser to get all hair products that are sulfate and sodium free. She recommended DermOrganics. Sulfrate-free shampoo is, by nature, pretty flat. It doesn't lather much so you have to use more of it than you would a normal shampoo. This lathered more than the Organix and Jonathan sulfate-free shampoos. It smells really nice and has maintained and extended the life of my keratin treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Line of Products!","review":"I have a citric allergy and was using an almond shampoo I could only order through Caswell-Masey.They stopped making the shampoo and I was on the hunt for another shampoo/conditioner.

Short, precise, workouts focusing on different areas of the glutes, thighs, hamstrings and even waistline. I felt muscles I never knew I had!! I like the husband and wife team and the variations they offer for the routines that they do. I totally recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!","review":"If you have either of the other two Core videos, don't waste your money on this one!

If I hadn't opened the package, I would have sent this one back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan!","review":"I am an active person doing running/swimming/Pilate religiously 6 times a week. I used the first two ten minutes of this DVD twice and every time I did the routines, I had a very very sore knee afterward. The pain is not in any of the thigh muscles as I was hoping for but inside of my knees. The workouts in the ten minutes were very boring with not much variation. I personally don't think any workout that is causing a joint pain not the muscle soreness is healthy to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much waisted time..","review":"It seemed to me that half of the video was composed of the \\"warming up\\" exercise. After the first warm up high knee lifts I was already warmed up. I didn't need to do it before each exercise, and I thought that they could have had a lot more workouts if they had cut out the warm up before each workout. It seemed like an unnecessary time filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOO Boring","review":"I am 39, never really worked out and as a beginner found this video extremely boring.

I do not recommend this to anyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All new material!","review":"One reviewer gave this DVD only one star claiming that it was all repeat material which is just not true. The Exhale Core Fusion practice is one style of workout - so all are similar in that it is the same discipline. Just like all Kundalini yoga practices are similar in style or all Pilates programs are similar in style. However, this DVD in particular focuses on the lower body - thighs and glutes. The other two Core Fusion DVDs focus on the whole body. So, if you liked \\"Body Sculpt\\" or \\"Pilates Plus\\" then you can be sure you'll love \\"Thighs & Glutes.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout DVD","review":"The ten minute sessions are good if you want to work out more or less on different days. The workouts are targeted and effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I wish I could return this DVD. You have these two people Elizabeth & Fred doing and going thru each exercise and explaining how each one is done. Fred is doing a little advanced version. It is being narrated by the both of them. There is no talking between them thru the whole taping of the DVD. They stare at each other thru the whole exercise. The woman (Elizabeth) has this grin on her face the whole time! I just didn't understand why they didn't converse not once. I didn't like this DVD at all! IT WAS BORING! WAKE ME UP! A LITTLE MOTIVATION PLEASE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides five 10-minute workouts each specifically designed to life and tone the body quickly","review":"Acacia is a premier producer of healthy and 'user friendly' exercise DVDs.

They offered variations if you have knee problems, but the standing poses were still really too much for my knees. They were tingling after just the first workout.

This book allowed me to explore and choose a hike that was perfect for the length of my stay. I felt comfortable with the route laid out on paper. I was dissatisfied with THE BUS route and scheduling on Oahu as compared to the simple statement under how to get there. I had to explore a different route and connection but felt that THE BUS system was to blame. Otherwise, I felt that the book did sufficiently lead to the perfect hike for me at the time.

Which is really too bad, because the premise- women with their own language and bond- is very promising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, just awful","review":"Trite, corny, unbelievable characters and storylines. Yuck. This terrible book was recomended to me in a bookstore as I was purchasing historical fiction. The \\"alternate China\\" is just a ruse to hide poor scholarship and writing.

It could have been set anywhere, anytime, the story is universal in its appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted my come-uppance","review":"This could have been a really fabulous book. But the flaws are so striking, it's really hard to forgive them. The biggest one being that one of the characters never gets her due. With all the drama that goes on in this book, the resolution, or lack thereof, is very unbalanced and disappointing.Also, it really freaks me out when I see statements like \\"The best work of fiction yet...\\" That's ridiculous. Especially in the case of this good, but again, deeply flawed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jin-shei","review":"This book is very well-written, and keeps you interested throughout. You essentially do enter the world of Jinh-shei, and feel like you have become one of the sisters. There are many twists in the novel, things that you never actually thought would happen. Throughout it, I was very surprised. I liked the plot details and I admit that Alma Alexander is a good writer. I hope to track down her other novels and read them. The details are amazing. You are fully transported into the world, and the ending certainly surprised me.I name it a Must-Read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a beautiful novel!","review":"If you loved Snow Flower And The Secret Fan, you will love this book. But where Snow Flower focused on two characters and their sister-of-the-heart relationship, this writer deftly weaves together eight distinct characters and voices. We begin with the childhood of one character and are carried through her growth until she wraps up the novel in her old age. Hers is the constant, steadying presence. And while Snow Fan reads like historical fiction, Secrets of Jin-shei has its roots in fantasy. Alma Alexander has hit my 'watch for what she does next\\" author list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"A must for anyone who is intrigued by both myth and China. As I was reading this book, I actually could tell-tale certain points in the characters of what applied to my personality and it certainly can for you. You could actually feel the pain, the joy, the sadness, the laughter, and every other endeavor that they experience over the course of their lives. The friendships that these eight women form are irrevocable and everlasting. Although, this book would more suited to a woman due to the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but there are better","review":"Free Cash for College is an okay resource, but there are definitely better books on the market. I find that \\"How to Go to College Almost For Free\\" by Ben Kaplan to be much more readable even though this book seems to have ripped-off a lot of the ideas from that one--I mean honestly, the \\"Scholarship Myth\\" idea seems to be outright lifted from the Kaplan one! Also, \\"The Scholarship Book 2003\\" is much more up to date than this one. If you're going to buy multiple books, don't get this one since it recycles a lot of ideas from other books that are written better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent text, but beware of a few downsides","review":"Even though the textbook's content is well written and clear, there were several big downsides (for me).The first was that the text sometimes skips steps in the derivations, and simply presents the final solutions. This is fine if you simply want the end result. But, if you are interested in the fundamentals as well, you will be slightly disappointed.The second major drawback for me was the abysmal quality of the illustrations. All the illustrations are in black and white, and they are beyond plain. They appear to have been done in Microsoft Paint by someone with little passion for their work.For someone who is a visual learner, the illustrations might be a deal breaker when it comes to this text.Aside from that, the content is quite competently written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mile Wide and an Inch Deep...","review":"Had to use this textbook for class; so to preface this review, I had a bad teacher which frustrated me along with the book.The book is weird. On some topics it goes way too in depth (enzymes) meanwhile on other things (organisms) it barely touches.

Doesn't serve as a fantastic reference book, nor does it serve as a great high level overview. Not overly thrilled.Go Yellow Jackets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview","review":"Good overview and introduction for bioprocess engineering.

The measurement lines are easily visible...even to my presbyopic old eyes. The cover is an excellent idea. Leftover sauces and gravies can go right into the refrigerator.

It is a hilarious collection of very old blues-type music. You can hear the age in the recordings.

Don't know what it has to do with the actual album. The beats on here aren't funky at all, with most being hum drum synth numbers. Lyrically none of the rappers really stand out on here - even Capital B sounds so-so out of the group element.I'd like to recommend it, but even for the price I do not think it is worth it to cop this.

Some actors seem fine in their roles, and others are jarringly in-apt, if not inept. I want to like this performance, but I keep being distracted by the clunky manners of some these players. Also, the timing and verbal phrasing is often odd, even among the better actors, as if they were speaking lines from Ionesco, or another translated \\"absurdist\\" work. Saroyan is closer to lyric poetry than to absurdism. There are casting problems with the James Cagney version that he stars in, too, but he and his sister nail the poetic qualities of their lines--check out that film version from 1948, available for a pittance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Production of an Award Winning Play!","review":"Very entertaining.

The book is definitely marketed to the \\"get rich\\" and \\"seminar junkie\\" crowds. I like the book for the information on what not to do and what one should do to be successful.

The pillow works great as long as my husband does not curve his neck while using it; he tends to curl up into a ball and the constriction this causes in his neck results in snoring.

After placing the order, it arrived pretty quickly. We had to air out the pillow for a few days, because of the chemical smell. After that, it was fine. My husband tried the pillow for a few nights and I noticed that it only worked if his head was positioned correctly on the pillow. As soon as his head moved out of position, the snoring would start up again. It's very difficult to stay in one position when you're sleeping, so this pillow didn't really help. My husband said it wasn't very comfortable either, so in addition to it not helping, he stopped using it altogether. We ended up having him sleep on 2 stacked pillows to keep him on his side and that seems to be working much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!

This collection of demos would not be the first time Childish peddles product no one in their right mind would touch (his 'poetry' books are a glaring example). Unless such scraps were one's own, they would be meaningless to anyone else: warbled echoes, mushed guitar sounds, 'acapella' song ideas whispered in the can, and mangled song bits of all sorts -- all this presented as the intimate musings of an 'artiste' at work. What drivel. That such garbage does not embarrass Childish is proof of the man's callousness -- the very trait he so much despises in the record industry.One thing is to make lo-fi music, quite another to release lo-fi demos of lo-fi songs. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans of Lost Soul-STAY AWAY","review":"Usually when you see a CD of little known tunes from the classic era of R&B, you're in for some rare treasures.

It covers their awkward \\"getting to know you\\" stage. Reconciling their public and private lives. Amd it also covers each of their origins. This isn't an action filled adventure. Some of it is slow. Much of it is not how we know these heroes now. This is how the heroes were twenty-something years ago. While reading it, I found myself missing Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and the others who are currently featured in the Justice League / JLA. But it gives a good historical background to grow on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great art with a corny story!!","review":"I have always heard really good things about this series but finally getting to read it I wasn't thrilled. First, I should say that Barry Kitson's art was spot on old school art. It fit perfectly and still looked contemporary. Waid and Augustyn's plot and dialogue is where the problems lied. Its one thing to try to evoke nostalgia but here the writers just seemed to copy ancient dialogue. The plot while large seemed so scattered its hard to imagine these heroes acting the way they did. Overall, this series added almost nothing to the legacies of these heroic staples."},{"rating":"1","title":"It starts off okay -","review":"- but quickly loses steam like most 12-issue series.I wish Crisis on Infinite Earths had never happened. This whole practice of \\"retconning\\" is ridiculous. So now I'm supposed to believe that these heroes were a team in 1980? Black Canary making references to Yoda? Jeez... Anyway, there are plenty of cameos by heroes and villains to keep you busy. Just don't expect much in the way of story.The art looks very impressive at the start - the shading is great and adds real depth to the color. But as it goes on, the shading goes away, leaving the art flat and lifeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Mark Waid is a hard writer to like. He gives us Kingdom Come, which is a masterpiece of art and literature, and then he backslides into something like this.The stories are disjointed, and hard to read in one sitting. My suspention of disbelief is stretched to it's limit with the \\"villain of the week\\" story arcs and poorly conceived, half-hearted characterizations.Also disappointing is that Waid likes to recycle his own plots, as many elements from this paperback find their way into the JLA monthly. (A core member of the league secretly builds profiles on his teammates, which are later stolen by an enemy who uses the information to strategically take apart the team. The issue of mistrust is resolved when everyone reveals their secret identity. No joke, he used this exact plot twice.)Barry Kitson has also seen better days, as his art here seems rushed and sloppy. I wonder if good art could've saved this one. (Is that what happened with Kingdom Come?)Avoid this one if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Justice Lame of America","review":"This was a fine attempt to tell a story that could have been good. The problem is that the writers don't tell us one NEW thing that fans of the Justice League need to know. Why not tell us how Black Canary manages to keep that blonde wig on? Instead of making details of the DC Universe more clear, the book actually creates more inconsistencies. Superman and Batman are so distanced from the league that it's hard to imagine them ever becoming involved. A half-hearted attempt to make Green Arrow a more important player is made but this branch of the story is left undeveloped. The most troubling problem has to do with the time period that the story does/does not take place in. Since so many of the revised versions of the league take place in contemporary periods then shouldn't that put this one about twenty or thirty years before other incarnations? If you're a fan you'll probably still buy it, but you'll feel a littled cheated.

This watch looks very expensive but is actually quiet a steal. I would have rated this watch a 5 however, the self-winding mechanism is a little noisy and I don't like that. My Seiko does not make any noise and it too is self-winding. Over all though I would recomend this watch to anyone looking for an expensive looking watch but not wanting to pay the ridiculous price for it. 03/22/2011: After owning this watch for less than three months, the auto wind mechanism is not working correctly ant the watch stops all the time.

Basically it's a greatest hits album, and even though alot of it has different versions and mixes, it's still excellent. I love the songs \\"Everyone I love is Dead\\" and \\"Love You to Death\\". Also they cover Black Sabbath's \\"Black Sabbath\\", Neil Young's \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", and Hendrix's \\"Hey Joe\\", kind of. They all get the goth-metal makeover. Plus one of the last tracks is the epic \\"Unsuccessfully Coping With the Natural Beauty of Infidelity\\". One of the things I like most about \\"Type O Negative\\", is that alot of their songs are really dramatic, and Pete Steele's deep voice of course. I just wish I got into them sooner.

But wait, that's not all. Not only does it include all the popular songs, but rare, unreleased and remixed tracks as well. What a bargain! The three \\"new\\" songs; 12 Black Rainbows, Stay out of my Dreams, and It's Never Enough, are faster and less doomy than most of the songs off World Coming Down--their last album--thus proving some relief from the otherwise morbid songs on this album. Stand out tracks also include the studio version of \\"Hey Pete\\", the remix of \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" and the Trash Metal-Thug Opera-Mini Epic \\"Unsuccessfully Coping With the Natural Beauty of Infidelity\\". In short, this is a welcome addition whether you a casual or die hard Type O Negative fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Starter For New Fans","review":"I wouldn't say so much that this is a greatest hits album. It's more of a complilation of songs put together by the band to showcase themselves and to release some new material. Granted, all their singles are on here, but that's because the reason they released them as singles is because they liked them.It's a good collection, but by no means does it showcase them enough. With Type-O you either hate them or love them. All of their albums are pure black gold, so if you really want to get into the Type, go out and buy them.

All of their CD'S are different but at the same time somewhat the same.This compilation is an awesome representation of all of their styles of music. I was however extremely disappointed that the song \\"Suspended In Dusk\\" wasn't included. It just so happens to be the only song from TON I don't have... and can't seem to find.They also put on an amazing live show. I reccomend buying every CD they have and will put out.

There is enough detail to set the reader into further research but it is light enough to provide information in an enjoyable way. The inventors often have insightful quotes. It should be required reading in schools to encourage more participation in science, math, computers and intellectual curiosity in general.Not just about science, the book also mentions patenting the brassiere, computer technologies and some weird ideas (skeletons shocking criminals into confessions, anyone?).

So while it doesn't touch on the higher notes of, say, truth telling through music it does very well at what it aims in title. Throughout the material, the conductor makes several assessments with respect to Haydn's works and his approach towards them.

Ditto for astrology and astronomy. And like Gail Reid-Gurian noted in her review, I got a similar sense of just how little things have changed over time. Indulging in superstition and gossip are still favorite pastimes today. One noteworthy change for the better is the reduction in infant mortality. I lost track of the number of children and family Kepler lost to illness, there were so many.I especially liked the personal letters of Kepler that were placed at the beginning of each chapter. They lent a perspective that can be gained no other way.On a lighter note, I chuckled out loud over the image of King Friedrich and Queen Elizabeth forgetting the baby back in the castle as they fled an invading army and sent a Baron running back to retrieve the infant.

That's just SOME of her good qualities. Her friends are even worse. The \\"mystery\\" is far-fetched. The blurb on the book's cover is very appealing.

Bought after no availability at a few stores.Bottom line- no better (maybe worse) than standard iPod ear-buds.Very flat, limited range, not dynamic.

Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Right","review":"I bought these headphones after searching website after website and review after review. I have had no major problems with the headphones; they are in good working order and have no major defects. The sound quality is good (much better than my previous earbuds), and they are stylish enough to wear in a design firm (where I work) and their 'foldability' is so much easier to master than what other people have said (i didn't have to read any directions). The price wasn't too extreme which was a selling point as well. I recommend them - just make sure you are careful with them because they aren't as hefty as the $100 headphones, but they have a much better sound quality than the $20 ones. All in all a good middle ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, and beautiful","review":"All I want to say is that this is a good product. Looks beautiful.

To me, Juvenile's Best Work (lyrically and production-wise) is with his 400 Degreez album. That cd so far has been the HOTTEST album out of the Cash Money Clique! Hopefully, this review helps.

This magnifier produces very dim light, it lights a very small area. The magnifier is not of a high quality and combined with the dimness of the light it becomes very hard to use.

Customers who see a rating interpret it as a rating of the show itself.Second, I rate CSI highly because it is so well produced, so creative, and has such good acting. (And also, it doesn't hurt to have gorgeous people like Marg Helgenberger (sp?) on the set!) I can relate to the viewer who said they had grown tired of CSI.

My only disappointment having purchased series one was that the title music, although good, was not that of The Who, which I feel adds to all of the C.S.I. series ie Las Vegas, Miami and New York.

The characters are consistent and the cases are always interesting, always keeps me guessing! The one thing I appreciate the most about this series is that the case/crime is always the main story, keeping the personal affairs/story of each CSI member on the sideline and only touching it briefly. I also like how there are almost always two cases going on at the same time. There are no subtitles unfortunately, otherwise I would've given this dvd set 5-stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"CSI - Season Two","review":"I'm not a TV or movie critic and won't take much time trying to discuss the characters and episodes. My wife and I like CSI - it is one of only a couple of TV shows that we watch regularly. If you like the shows, then buying the complete season DVDs is a great way to see the episodes. We particularly like that we can watch the episodes without interruptions for ads. The only downside to this set is the lack of subtitles. As our hearing has gotten worse with age, we like to put the subtitles on the screen to help us with the dialog. Pretty much all movies allow us to do this, but not the CSI DVD's. Other than that minor quibble, the set is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied!","review":"The DVD's came quite quickly and worked very well!!

I feel sorry for the people who have to wade through it. It's painful. The author attributes a significant amount of thought to various themes/concepts, but I found it way overboard.This is the first book I've read which analyzes films/books in this manner, but the over-analysis of everything sucks the life/joy out of the process of analysis.If you're someone who enjoys thinking about/discussing movie thematics with friends/family, I don't see you enjoying this book.

I have given this as a gift that has been warmly received many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very biased and directed at abused women","review":"I'm very interested in exploring the femine face of God. However, I found this book to be centered on abused women. As a result, it is extremely hostile towards men and male-based religion. The author is very well researched, but she is content to gloss over her research in the text with references to the sources in the bibliography. At times, she seriously misrepresents her facts or draws conclusions that are not universal. There are times when the book points out injustices to women that I think a lot of men go through as well. I thought the book was extremely biased against men and was disappointed in such a hostile exploration of spirituality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Useful","review":"There isn't much of use to most people in this book. Do yourself a favor and save the time and money you would spend on this book. You would do much better to read the more time-tested feminist theology. Books or articles by Rosemary Radford Ruether, Daphne Hampson, Dorothee S?lle, etc., will all teach you to think more productively than this book (not that I agree with their primarily anthropological or sociological approaches to theology and atheology, but we can all learn from them). I suppose that this book might be useful to read if you are doing specialized research about abused women and their relationships or religious convictions.I should explain the reason why I don't find the book to be very useful. I don't feel it is likely to stimulate new patterns of thinking or transmit a whole lot of information. I felt relatively unaffected by it. A book that doesn't change the reader is, in my opinion, a book better left unread or used for (as I said) specialized research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and sexist","review":"What Reilly says in 350 pages could have easily been condensed into a chapter or two. This book dwells on abuses suffered by some women, and is quite biased in implying that female children are the only ones who suffer neglect, abuse, and disappointment at the hands of their parents or other influential adults. I found most of the subject matter depressing (and redundant). I believe feminists should acknowledge what has occured in women's lives in the past, but also must note the present and look toward the future, striving to support the women they supposedly want to inspire, instead of asking them to relive past trauma on a regular basis in the name of feminism!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the title gave me an option!","review":"I really enjoyed this book and even gave it to our community library. The author does a great job of outlining the problems using stories from people in her groups, and then she shows how to put that behind you and find a God who you can really relate to. It was so refreshing to to read a well written book by an educated and knowledgable women on this subject. I went on to read all of her books and heard her speak. Every book continues to develop this theme of embracing a larger view of god and ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembering Religion's Metaphorical Base","review":"After reading Patricia's second book Be Full of Yourself, I was given her first book by my therapist. What a life-saver A God Who Looks Like Me has been! I am a spiritual person yet have no desire to partake of religion as offered in mainstream churches. A God Who Looks Like Me helped me sort through my religious past and design a personal spirituality that works for me. The book put \\"god the father\\" in perspective as a relative newcomer to the heavens.

It really touched my heart as a woman from a traditional religous path with devastating results. This book is very empowering and does a great job of handing the responsibility back to women for thier lives and thier spiritual growth. The author understand the hows and whys of this loss. This book has helped me understand myself more and more. It gets to the root of the issue which is where real change can begin. I will be purchasing this one for the public library hoping that a younger woman will read it. It is a life changing book. After this one read The Dance of The Disident Daughter by Sue Monk Kidd. I stand taller and hold my head up higher than I have ever done in my life.

PJ Harvey was a big influence on music in the 90's and inspired a lot of the styles in artists that are around today like the yeah yeah yeahs.I found that this book did not delve very far into her life story and this is probably not the author's problem but because PJ Harvey is a private individual.

This harrowing story of an abused woman in 1890's New England rivets the attention and moves the heart. The story centers on a hat shop offering gorgeous creations for otherwise restricted and lonley women to wear upon their heads. The ponderous hats, laden with plumes, flowers, bows and laces help to brighten loveless marriages and dreary lives. Eventually, the hats become a symbol, masterfully used by the author, of women's social and sexual emancipation.\\"Gilded\\" is a must read for those who love the Victorian and Edwardian Eras and are concerned with the condition of women at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been robbed!

I always thought that the Beats By The Pound production crew (now known as The Medicine Men) gave Mystikal the perfect instrumentals to express himself in that loud way of his. The Neptunes also give him some nice music. I would have liked to see some Legendary Traxster tracks as well as more collabos. It seems that all of Mystikal's previous albums featured exaggerated cameos from his Boot Camp Clicc and No Limit crews as well as the likes of Snoop Dogg, E-40, Naughty By Nature, Busta Rhymes, etc. If the album had a few more cameos it would have been a perfect 5 stars as listening to too much Mystikal gets tiring at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Solid.","review":"Mystikal developed a totally new style and attitude with this release.

The singles, \\"Shake Ya A*s\\" and \\"Danger\\" are fun, good rap songs, but as a whole the album isn't awesome. He doesn't have as much to say, and he spends most of his time bragging about nothing or yelling at nobody in particular. This was entertaining for a few albums, but without the No Limit squad, Mystikal has proven pretty one dimensional. A lot of the songs are similar, and only a few guest appearances lighten up the album. Da Brat and Petey Pablo lend an OK rhyme on \\"Come and see about me\\" and the best track is obviously \\"Neck Uv Da Woodz\\", where OutKast pretty much does the entire song. Without C-Murder and Master P and the rest of no limit, Mystikal is lonely, even though this was his most commercial success.

Her continuing heads on with Ryan is getting a little old and redundant, but at least at the end, with Ryan's little surprise, maybe the sparring will ease up a little. Also, the inclusion of Anne and her marital problems added little to the story, simply providing Tempe a fall guy in the final scene. And why does Tempe insist on going into dangerous places with dangerous people without any kind of backup? In six novels, it's always gotten her in trouble. Reichs needs to make Tempe behave with a little more common sense.With that aside, MONDAY MOURNING has a compelling tale that slowly reaches a fiery climax. The true culprit is surprising, and Reichs does have a way with dialogue and humanizing her characters as in previous books. If the Anne scenes had been expunged, the book may have been a tighter more convincing read. As it is, it's still a good book by a talented writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, but a bit too autobiographical for me....","review":"Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the characters, plot, and the forensic knowledge in this book. This is my first Tempe Brennan book, but I will probably read more.There's only one thing that's unsettling for me. Kathy Reichs has pretty much the same job in the same locale. Her fiction is a little too close to her day-to-day life for me.Otherwise, very well written and a very good read.

Both of these settings are great, but Montreal is especially appealing and Reichs descriptions of the old streets and neighborhoods of Montreal are very well done. Temperence deals with three skeletons found buried beneath a pizza parlor in Montreal, a friend's personal crisis, and her own romantic difficulties. This book really moves along and captures the reader. This is the best of the series so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monday Mourning","review":"I have read all of Kathy Reich's books at least 4 times. Dearly love them all except for the last one, Monday Mourning.It was flat and somewhat boring. Mainly, Tempe's unrelenting churlishness toward her love, Andrew Ryan, is tiresome and annoying. (Shut up, woman!) If I were Andrew Ryan, I would head for the door - fast.There has also been a very subtle but noticeable trend from book to book lately of how wonderful and important Tempe is. Come on, Kathy, re-read Deja Dead and get a clue. Tempe was incredibly vulnerable but also strong throughout. Now she is just kind of a self-important, boring woman who seems to be going all out to drive a great guy away.After Bare Bones, Monday Mourning was a disappointment.Pat GannonForest City, NC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart Woman Doing Stupid Things.","review":"If you like books about supposedly intelligent women consistently doing stupid things to create tension and excitement, then this is a book for you. Otherwise, give it a miss. While I like the characters in the book very much, it seems the author loses respect for them about halfway through - having them do very stupid, nonsensical things to create tension, excitement. Because I get so annoyed at a woman, supposedly very intelligent, doing something so stupid to put not only herself, but also her friends in danger - the tension becomes artificial, and, quite frankly, a let down. And it happens over and over again. One more thing - I just don't understand how a trained forensic anthropologist who must always work with things that most of us would find upleasant, could have such an impossibly weak stomach. She got nauseous a lot over unpleasant things in this book. Come on. She should be a stronger heroine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"The Kathy Reichs books are made all the better by the TV series Bones. You can visualize the Dr. Brennan perfectly. Gifted writer whose story was so compelling I just couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book, 'tho a bit disappointing","review":"I've read all the Tempe Brennan books and enjoyed each one. Sometimes, I find Tempe a hard character to like: she's written as being a know-all who finds all the clues the police miss. But the mysteries are solid and the forensic techniques brilliantly described so that the reader doesn't fall asleep from information overload. I do get a little distracted by all of Reich's road names and directions. I found the ending disappointing. Why does the protangonist have to behave in an utterly stupid way in order to get into trouble? There are better plot devices that would enable the same result without turning the character into an idiot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"I always enjoy the Temperance Brennan novels, but I tend to favor the ones set outside of Canada. Monday Mourning ended up being the exception. I loved the mystery and the back and forth during the investigation between Tempe and Claudel. Kathy Reichs has a way of \\"dumbing down\\" the science so readers can firmly grasp the concepts presented and that was highly effective in this novel. The owe thing I didn't enjoy was Tempe's reactions to her issues with Ryan. She's strong and straight-forward in all aspects of her life, including romantic relationships, but when she suspects something is wrong with her situation with Ryan she actively avoids confrontation and deals completely immaturely. She seems to be reacting against character emotionally and I found that both distracting and annoying. A killer Temperance Brennan novel as long as you just ignore the romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"bit disappointed","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author and I was drawn to it from the forensics aspect. I was a bit disappointed though - I found the writing to be unpolished. I agree with other reviewers - I don't find Dr. Brennan's private life particularly interesting and the dialogue drags terribly. In fact each time we go back to it it seems to distract from the real interest. And Ryan is just flat out dull and one dimensional. I found this particular subject matter (can't specify without spoiling the plot) very difficult and the references to real cases from the news that we remember very unbalancing. The plus side is that this author is clearly very accomplished in her main profession and that is fascinating. Interestingly she writes very much better as 'herself' when she gives us factual background after the story has ended about how she came to this plot line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monday Mourning Review","review":"I really like this book.

Tempe is once again in Montreal, where she is investigating a case involving 3 skeletons, buried beneath a pizza place. Tempe has to use the newest methods to establish whether these skeletons are new or old, and she has to deal with the local police, who seems to not care at all about the skeletons. She also has to deal with a friend's marriage problems, her own love life and the cold, cold Montreal weather. As Tempe works her way into the case, dark things surface and soon Tempe is way more involved than she wants to be. This was a great and enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Oh dear. I'm a great fan of Kathy Reichs -- she's better than Patricia Cornwell, I think -- but this was just so tedious. Too much repetitive brooding over her lover -- does he, doesn't he? -- together with a particularly grim crime scenario...It was just too much -- very loosely put together.

According to her stats; lots of experience, formal education culminating in a PhD, and on staff in two countries.

I know three medical professionals very well, and none of them are remotely as unbalanced as Temperance Brennan. Granted, the book is considered entertainment.

His hero Mitch Rapp facing a daunting threat but you always believe he,l prevail in the end.A great story well worth a look even if you are not a regular flynn reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flynn's best to date","review":"In my opinion this is Flynn's best book. The ending was weak, but the first 99% was great. I appreciated that he left Rapp's wife out of the book. I think Flynn finally sees that she should not have been brought into the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book. Well written. But too realistic and therefore a downer.","review":"Scary but realistic story but not for me. I'd rather escape if I'm going to read fiction. However if you like hard hitting, current event based action and intelligence genre novels, you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flynn's best to date","review":"This formulaic thriller tells the story of Muslim terrorists sneaking a nuke into the US with intentions to detonate it during Memorial Day ceremonies in DC. Returning hero, Mitch Rapp, the top counterterrorist expert and former field agent/killer, must race against time to foil the plot. While a bit jingoistic in its patriotism (there is no question who the good guys and bad guys are), this is Flynn's best book to date. It is fast paced and action-packed. It helps that Rapp's whinny, insecure wife Anna doesn't appear in this novel. Rapp is still a bit too arrogant, pushy, hot-headed, and condescending; makes it somewhat difficult for the reader to totally like the hero of the book. I don't think this was the intention of the author, just a result of bad writing. However, it was very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a mystery!","review":"It is a mystery to me how some books get published and this one is right up there at the top of the how list. The characters are flat, and remain as flat as the plot throughout the novel. Rapp, the protagonist, is a sadistic automaton who justifies his brutality by sinking into the \\"end justifies the means\\" refuge. The plot is simplistic and without tension ... it is predictable and cannot provide the reader with even the tiniest of surprises. All in all, the book is nothing more than Flynn's ridiculously simplistic defense of the Patriot Act, and a rather mindless rant against liberalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorial Day is great.","review":"Vince Flynn makes you feel as if you are right along for the ride when Mitch Rapp takes on a terrorist. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorial Day","review":"Very enjoyable read. Mitch Rapp keeps you on the edge through out. Flynn always does his home work when writing a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitch is the Man!","review":"Mitch Rapp continues to evolve and become a bigger force. I would recommend this series to anyone that enjoys reading intrigue involving the CIA and our government."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast","review":"Action never stopped. Ending you would not except. A must read but try to read in order. You get lost if you jump all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitch Rapp, protect us!","review":"Like other reviewers here, I hope and pray that we have Mitch Rapp type men out there who are as absorbed and passionate about protecting America as we would like to believe there are! Vince Flynn writes brilliant, well-researched books that will have you losing sleep, both by reading the books, then wondering if we have the people in place to do what his hero Mitch Rapp does,for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitch Rapp is back!","review":"Vince Flynn has brought back Mitch Rapp for another all to real action packed thriller. Let's hope that people like Mitch Rapp are really out there fighting the war on terror. I'm already waiting for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Editing","review":"This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as \\"harken\\" rather than \\"hearken\\"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, too much propaganda","review":"This is the the third Mitch Rapp booK I've read and I never tire of the adventure and intrigue. Memorial Day does have the adrenaline, but bogs down with the psycho-babble of the characters trying to figure out if torture is justified, legal, or moral. The argument isn't solved by Flynn, just his point of view vividly portrayed. At least he does give space to the other side. I'm sure I'll get back to Flynn/Rapp. I'll just wait to see if he resolves the question himself and sticks to what makes him a brilliant espionage writer.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitch Rapp, you are my HERO!! Ha!","review":"I was introduced to Vince Flynn about 10 years ago and loved his work!

I love his political portrayal of US politics, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as his early work","review":"This one just didn't have \\"it\\" the early books did. Disappointing, though palatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-sized paperback","review":"be aware that this paperback edition is a new format that is over sized (about 2 inches taller than normal mass-market paperbacks). In order to justify this format, the type appears to be slightly larger and the spacing between lines is noticeably larger. And, of course, the publisher had to increase the price to reflect the \\"bigger book\\". It is awkward to hold and won't fit on the bookshelf with the rest of your Vince Flynn paperbacks (Mr. Flynn - your publisher is using an experimental book size and it will affect your sales)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Blatant Right-wing Propaganda","review":"This author is a raving, right-wing hack. I couldn't even finish the book. The story line is very simplistic and predictable, and every other chapter involved gagging on the author's simplistic right-wing preaching:Brown People = EvilTorturers = CourageousDemocrats = Weak/ShiftyIt's impossible to enjoy this book unless you're a big fan of right-wing propaganda. If you're a thinking person who is paying attention, you'll despise this author and abandon the book before finishing it. Definitely a book designed to appeal to knuckle-draggers.There should be a warning on the cover. I'll never buy another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Timing","review":"Another far-right-wing, testosterone-drenched potboiler. The hero is hindered from saving the country at every turn by left-wing nincompoops incapable of logical thinking-- primarily career-climbing image-conscious women, of course. The primary message of this book is that if only we could further restrict the Bill of Rights and allow the agents of our government a free hand in torturing prisoners, America would be much better off. Given the recent news, the timing of this message could not be worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"What say I, Bill O'Reilly","review":"Although I never read books of this genre a Bill O'Reilly article inspired me to give this one a try. \\"Memorial Day\\" is a cold slap reminder that we are at war, and if we are ever going to put a stop to this insidious menace the politicians, protesters,lawyers and bureaucrats--along with their career concerns--need to take a backseat to folks with intuition and common sense . Flynn's damn-straight style of writing complements the hero Mitch Rapp very well. Flynn's epilogue is thought provoking and curiously ominous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorial Day","review":"I have read all of Vince Flynn's books and enjoyed each and every one. Each book is well written, fast-paced, fascinating , and a great climax. If you like Robert Ludlum's Bourne Series, Tom Clancy, Stephen Coonts, Dan Brown and Brad Thor you will love Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp character. I rate it a Five Star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent political thriller","review":"The thing that comes to mind when reading this is, \\"Tom Clancy-Lite\\". The style and subject matter bring to mind an early Tom Clancy, but without all the unnecessary political grandstanding. And at 400 pages, it's a much quicker read. This is an excellent, fast-paced, and timely thriller. There are constant twists throughout the novel, and not just one climax at the end, which makes it a more entertaining read. This is the first book by this author that I have read, but I'll be picking up some of his earlier work. This isn't great \\"literature\\", but it's perfect for the beach or on a long plane ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, Fast Paced","review":"I started reading books last year and I got hooked reading Memorial Day. Fast paced and a great plot. Mitch Rapp character goes back about four books and his stories are great. I recommend the whole Vince Flynn series and I hope he continues wiritng with Mitch Rapp in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"See storyline above.Vince Flynn offers up one of his best novels yet in this well rounded thriller. This novel is not only timely, it offers up a character (Mitch Rapp) who knows what it takes to win war on terrorism, like it or not.An exciting story you'll want to read quickly. Looking forward to the next Rapp novel.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend this one","review":"Well, we seem to have a lively disagreement here. Everybody either loves or hates it.... so, I thought I'd add my sixpence too. I picked this one up because I liked some of this authors previous stuff. This one DID dissapoint. It was unoriginal. There are better novels on the topic. Nothing personal against Mr Flynn, but it is a big letdown after his other Mitch Rapp novels. Facts are facts. But maybe the next one will be better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I saw this in grade school back in the early 70's. This and the other Williamsburg video, Gunsmith of Williamsburg, are fascinating documentaries about how things are made. Every child should see things like this to encourage their curiosity and creativity.Adults will love this as they will see how complex things were made of metal long before the Industrial Revolution.In the Silversmith DVD you will see a beautiful wood handled decorative silver coffee pot made step by stop, starting by making ingots of melted silver, then hammering them out to sheet, then forming the parts of the pot from the silver sheet. All by hand! In addition there's less detailed coverage of a silver drinking cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second dud in a row for Scandinavian Lizzy devotee","review":"That's right - have a look at the tracks on his albums and you'll see a number of covers of Thin Lizzy tracks. However this album lacks anything as live and kicking as Phil Lynott. No sense of danger, no sense of anything.Which is a pity as I was expecting another awesome release real soon from this guy. And when the opening guitar barrage came out of my speakers that is what I thought I was going to get. But it all turns around and heads back down the same alley as his previous studio release, Worlds Away. Poor production, meaningless lyrics and no sense of purpose. Like he was just doing this to meet a contract or something.Never mind, his next album, Optimus, was a great return to form."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best?","review":"Ok guys, this is the last John's album and it could be the best! John plays the guitar with terrific new sounds and he sings too.

You have to buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful at all","review":"The information on this page states this book will help other retired folks help stay out of the \\"retirement trap.\\" I found the book useless and didn't get one good idea.

It is thick and rather dry.

This play--and it's exactly that, a play--is full of banter between the characters, humor, and even sexual innuendo, but it also addresses a very serious issue... one man's conflict with the God that he feels has betrayed him. I am a Christian, but I still truly enjoyed reading this and thinking about my personal relationship with this same God. I would encourage anyone to read this - it's a great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the Trial of God","review":"This book is very thought provoking. May not be suitable for children other than HS level because of its sophistication. The more one knows about the Bible, the better one will relate to the arguments used.

Traditional believers may have a problem with the ideas presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review of the trial of god","review":"The trial of god by Elie Wiesel is a stunning play about mans relationship to God and trying to understand him.

Zizek is a master at diagnosing the contemporary game for what it is: synthetic, gnostic, and without meaning (Nietzsche wins?!). Yet, he does so in a way that provides, perhaps theoretically, some sort of intellectual resources for how to go beyond our dual fascination with all things material and, paradoxically, immaterial.

He is one of few writers that I genuinely can return to time and time again (even if it is to discover exactly where I disagree with him)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that easy","review":"This is a review from someone without a background in philosophy - and that may be where part of the problem lies....I have been reading books from the \\"Thinking in Action\\" series, and consequently moved on to this one by Zizek. I found it very difficult to follow the lines of discussion. This was for two reasons: (i) the author assumes a lot of background knowledge on the part of the reader, making a lot of (unexplained) references, (ii) the author has an incredibly rambling style.If you are in the field of philosophy, perhaps this book will have more meaning for you. If you are a beginner, you may want to steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never for any *Feint* of the Heart","review":"I disagree with the reader from Montreal: Belief itself may fail on all accounts, but nevertheless persists and insists. If anything this book enacts -- in Zizek's Helegian fashion -- the very concept under discussion. For that reason Zizek's dialectic is joyous, tumultuous and, yes, RAMBLING. But the subtle reader will notice that the transition from one random topic to the next is always tied together later, when ex nihilo a Master-Signifier emerges to order the text in a consistant fashion.Furthermore I reccomend any of Zizek's rambling, ill defined arguements or pedantry.

His depth of knowledge of details along with his handle on the scope of the larger covenantal picture is awe-inspiring.

I think we would have nothing less than a reformation and a very different - and refreshingly better - state-of-christianity - and hence, the world - if that happened! Yes, this book is pricey, but it's worth every penny of investment. Buy it, read it, pass it on. You won't regret it! Your SOUL will THANK you!

In a sense, this is music made for airplay, which is why it is odd that it did so poorly.There isn't a weak song on this release, but they tend to lack the lustre that would have made this a great selling album. Very good songs include \\"Straight to Your Heart\\", \\"Time Stood Still\\", \\"Rebel Say A Prayer\\", and \\"Life At the Top\\". The best songs are \\"Make Love Last\\", Dancing Off the Edge of the World\\", and \\"Time Alone With You\\". My favorite of the tracks is \\"So This Is Eden\\". Great vocals, guitar work, and songs are what make BACKLASH a disc worth having and the price should say affordable..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to disagree but....","review":"This second, and last album, by Bad English comes across as tame and generic. There aren't any tunes that hit you like a lot of the stuff from the first cd did. The only two songs that stuck in my head were \\"Time alone with you\\" and \\"Straight to your heart.\\" Everything else is really faceless and sounds like b-sides from the first album. The songwriting isn't bad, the lyrics are well done, but the rhythm section lacks punch and the songs are mostly forgettable. I found myself skipping over a lot of tracks. Start with the first album or check out the far superior bands that these gentlemen were involved with: Journey, The Baby's, Hardline, John Waite (solo), Soul Sirkus, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good English","review":"The follow-up to their debut release is really kinda \\"eh.\\" A few songs are okay - Straight At Your Heart and Time Stood Still are decent.

Her love is preserved in part by a special gift, tied up with a bow and placed in her throat by God himself, the voice of a songbird.Lisa Samson never ceases to amaze me with the quiet strength her characters possess as they erase the lines between secular and sacred bringing the reader to a better understanding of humanity as a whole.

When a book can stir these kinds of emotions in me, I always have to check out this author. Since reading Songbird, I have read many more of Lisa Samson's books, and I have not been disappointed. Lisa shows the realities of the Christian walk. While we are saved by grace, we are also human, and have to continually rely on our redeemer to bring us through.

It helps simplify Civil Procedure and gives workable examples and problems to sharpen your Civ Pro skills. It gives a 1L a definite lead in understanding the Civ Pro arena.In most law schools Civ Pro is taught as a terribly abstract concept. Glannon's helps to put it into both context and practice. In my opinion it was one of two or three of the best law school study guides I ever invested in. Gilbert's Dukeminier's Property Law Study Guide is probably the only equal to Glannon's Civ Pro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Civ-Pro review book on the market!","review":"In deciding which Civil Procedure study-guide to purchase, I considered at least 5 other options, none of which are even in the same league as Glannon's \\"Examples and Explanations.\\" Glannon's writing style is thorough, yet concise. He manages to convey an excellent understanding of the basic concepts and theoretical underpinnings of the rules and doctrines relevant to an introductory Civil Procedure course, without getting bogged down in the more trivial details of the Federal Rules of Civil procedure themselves. One word of caution: This book will be most helpful to students whose Civil Procedure professor is predominantly interested in theory and conceptual understanding as opposed to the minute details of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the latter type of class, Arthur Miller's study guide may be more appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professor-recommended study aid","review":"This is an excellent exam aid for the student who has already put in at least some of the work of studying during the semester but wants to sharpen up in preparation for finals.

It provides thoughtful, accessible analysis of the significant areas of civpro and then provides excellent short essay questions and answers.This book is best at helping you practice the analysis necessary for perfoming well on essay exams. It is the only study aid my civpro professor recommends, and it helped me secure A's both semesters."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding secondary source","review":"Glannon's book is an excellent and highly readable companion to Civil Procedure. The examples are well-conceived and very helpful. The course has a steep learning curve, particularly as you wade through the various types of jurisdiction. If there's a class for which you need an outside source, it's probably Civil Procedure, and the source should be Glannon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best study guides; an absolute MUST for 1L's!","review":"For those law students who are having difficulty comprehending the abstract world of Civil Procedure, this book is incredibly helpful. Glannon has a very simple way of explaining concepts in just a few sentences. After reading Glannon's study guide, I was able to follow what the professor was trying to explain in class. Suddenly, it seemed so very easy to understand! There is also one other element which is the reason that I highly recommend this book over any other Civil Procedure Outline: at the end of each section, there are questions FOLLOWED BY EXPLANATIONS!

I've found many of the books helpful in supplementing law school reading that can be at times difficult to synthesize. However, Freer's supplement on civil procedure is unbeatable.Law school is about knowing the rule and applying the facts. E&E; is great at helping you to know the rule. However, it doesn't help you figure out how to apply the facts, especially in a way pertinent to law school exams.

And don't listen to what anyone says, reading these books is not somehow cheating yourself out learning information from the cases. Case-analysis is a vital skill but it's not what law school exams test you on. They test primarially how well you can synthesize information over the course of a semester and then apply that synthesized information to the analysis of a fact pattern in a four hour exam. The E&E; series generally mimics this process very well, but the Glannon Civil Procedure book is heads above the rest.It's such a talisman for first year law students that anyone who advises against it should be regarded with grave suspicion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glannon is the best!","review":"This is a great book for 1Ls suffering through civ pro or any law student or lawyer who needs a refresher course in litigation.

Book V was decent, but somehow not on par with the rest of the series. Mediocre is the best word to describe it. Book VI (The Song of Susannah) is just plain bad. The biggest problem is that it is very short compared to the others (except book I). The decision to write himself into the series has really mucked everything up, but it might have been smoothed over with an additional 400 pages of text. This book feels rushed and disorganized. There are several plot points that seem be going in several different directions and serve only to distract the reader. While the plot content of this book is disappointing, my biggest disappointment is that this book takes place mostly in New York and Maine. That takes alot of the magic out of the story. I enjoy the series mainly because it focuses on other worlds. I haven't lost faith for Book VII yet, but I'm definitely worried at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh what a waste","review":"King works better in Roland's world than in ours. I find his stories in those other worlds so much more interesting than when they cross over into ours. It has lost its appeal and this book feels forced. I think King was driven to finish the series and really did not know where to go. Once he wrote himself into the book I lost all sense of fantasy/unreality that made the other books so interesting. Lets hope his finale has some heart and depth. I've come this far so I will see how it ends, but I think this time I'll check it out from the library rather than purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Ain't God","review":"Ok Stephen King decides to write a story where it is revealed that he is God and the future of the universe depends on him continuing his miserable existence as an egocentric maniac. Sorry for the spoiler but that pretty much sums up the whole book. In short 'Song of Susannah' is awful. Roland and Eddie meet God and shiver before him. Stephen King reveals he has powers and awes the Gunslingers. This book is so stupid I wish I could give it negative stars. I don't know why an author would choose to do something of this nature unless they were just lazy or really into themselves. Sorry Mr King you are not God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't anyone else disturbed by where Black Thirteen is???","review":"First, I'll say this was better than DT 5. SK writing himself into the story was a bit weird, but considering the idea, it was executed ok. SOS, like WOTC, does not measure up to the first 4 Dark Tower books. I am a HUGE fan of the Dark Tower series and of Stephen King in general. I think it is then safe to say I am not offended by much and usually find King's stories quite enjoyable. Having said that, King has made an oblique reference to a huge American tragedy by where he's stashed Black Thirteen in this book. This already is crass but if he continues down this storyline in DT 7 it will be the most tasteless, insensitive, idiotic thing any author has ever done. Don't do it, Stephen.

I won't give anything away, but if we are headed where I think we are, those of you who like tidy, neat little endings are going to be sorely disappointed. I could not put this book down. The cliffhangers are intriguing, and the twist King takes by continuing to write himself into the story is beyond genius. I would recommend reading the entire series, or it just won't make sense.

However, it seems to me, that King has taken the easy way out of what could have been an epic tale. In DT VI, King begins to (without much care or reason) tie up loose ends.

I don't believe I've ever read a worse book. The author admits that he doesn't use an outline, and especially in this book, it shows. The book is an absolute waste of time to read because nothing substantial happens throughout its 411 pages. The anti-plot wanders aimlessly throughout the entire book. The previous Dark Tower books badly meandered through their plots, but not nearly as badly as this one. I rate this book as zero stars. Mr. King, you should have thrown the series back into the corner of the garage, or is that the garbage? There was only ONE redeeming factor: the artwork of Darrel Anderson was fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I don't see how anyone could have given this a zero. The entire thing was very well written, and my only complaint with this book is that it is too short, but even that isn't really a problem because the next one is coming out so soon. So far, it seems like all the peole badmouthing it said they hated that Steven King brought himself into the series. I guess it might have been better if he hadn't, but he did it pretty well, it's not like he just popped up and said\\"Hi I'm Steven King, and I am your God\\" the way some people have made it sound. Instead he slowly tied himself in to explain many of the things from the Dark Tower 5 and 6. Even if you still can't stand that he was in it, he was only in it for about thrity pages(not counting the author's journal at the end) and (warning:spoiler) he killed himself off in the journal anyway so he can't be in the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ruined the series","review":"Remember in the prequel to Star Wars when George Lucas ruined the original three movies by reducing the once-mystical Force to nothing more than a chance bacterial infection?

This book had only a few scant good parts and all the rest were well, not good parts. The parts with Susannah and her litany of personalities just wore me down. I don't want to spend 300 pages in someone's head. The Gunslinger and Eddie had some nice scenes, but that was it. You can't skip this book either, although you could probably skim over it. I will read book 7, I've come this far, but if it reads like this one, it will be tough to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring baby-mama drama","review":"This book is by far the most boring, least interesting, and least active of the first 6 dark tower books. I have yet to read 7 or the prequel so they may be worse. I don't want to give away any plot but suffice to say this story is a major slow down in pace from Wolves of the Calla. I also don't like the way they break the fourth wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumber than part five.","review":"If part five wasn't crappy enough, we get this.

This is the 6th book in the Dark Tower series and it does not disappoint. This book continues the journey of Roland and his posse (ka-tet) trying desperately to reach the Tower, and save the rose when its about to be destroyed. I am amazed that the story is still so intriguing after this many installments, it just gets better and better the deeper you get into Roland's world and King's psyche. The story is compelling and extremely well written. I highly recommend this book. I do not recommend you read this book out of order. To fully appreciate the story you need to read the entire series in order. You do not want to be lost in Roland's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"we cannot really rank this book before DT7","review":"I started reading the DT series almost 1 year ago. I read 40-50 pages of The Gunslinger (The word is nineteen..remember?) and decided to buy the first 4 books and read them in a row. I read them all in 45 days.Then I read the Wolves...and now The song...I think that the story changed a lot. I still really like the series (the best mr king's work in my oppinion, followed by \\"It\\") but maybe we expected more magic and mysticism at the end, instead of this contemporary NYC.The song is a very good book, dynamic and with nice twists in the plot.But...hey! We are all watching very carefully and expecting how all this saga ends. This was just another chapter of a whole and dramatic story.We will see the end......And we can really say that mr king is our new god or our new demon.Or Maybe both."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mad whirlwind","review":"King has you going every-which-way in this book. And as an author who has broken every convention, he commits his biggest sacrilege ever in this book by writing himself into the story.As a fan you can take it though - and if you've read all the books up to this point don't stop now - there's even something magical about it.Most people know how close to death King really was. And in this book I think he is trying to reach out to his readers, and say \\"thankya.\\" But with all of his money, wealth, agents, and fame it is hard to find the sincerity in his plea. The plea to be taken as a true writer and artist. Something the critics will never give him in his lifetime.I'm bias, so of course I want to believe. And I look for the meaning in these books and there are times when I think I've found it, and then, like a dream it fades away . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but should have been better...","review":"The book is typical Dark Tower although it doesn't rank as high as some of the other books in the series. It flowed very well and held my interest. The story did tie up some of the loose ends from the preceding books (although it created some new ones) and you can almost feel how close the Tower is. However, even though it is titled Song of Susannah, I would prefer more of the focus to be on Roland and his quest. Its almost as if he is being pushed to the background in deference to the other characters. Also, the book was much shorter than some of the other ones. It's almost as if King either ran out of storyline or he just split the remaining book up into the 6th and the 7th books. All in all I did enjoy it and will certainly buy the final one to see how the Dark Tower quest plays out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I think all of the negative reviews have summed it up well, so I won't go into much detail. This book is....lacking. It doesn't feel like King, it doesn't feel like the Dark Tower, it doesn't feel like he was even trying. He wrote himself into the book? And the rhyming? What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Tower #6 or Dark Dud?","review":"Two things shaped my formative years. Star Wars and The Dark Tower. Sadly, the latest installment of the epic Dark Tower series leaves me longing for the early days (ie The Gunslinger through The Wastelands). Susannah and Dark Thirteen have slipped into New York City in 1999 with Mia's chap ready to make his grand appearance. Our heros Ronald, Eddie, Jake and Oy along with Father Callahan try to follow her. Will Mia's chap be the beginning of the end? Will you get through the end without wanting to shake Calvin Tower until his teeth rattle? The best part of novel? The part I feared the most, the entrance of S. King, Esquire into the narrative. Shan't reveal too many details but his presence in the last novels may not be the devastation that so many fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I'm a huge Stephen King fan - but not enough to be blinded by the sad fact that Song of Susannah has to be one of King's WORST books. Nothing really happens in it - in fact, you could probably skip it altogether and simply read Book 7 when it comes out later this fall and really not miss anything.I also don't how overindulgent King is becoming about himself in this series. Writing himself into the series is a disaster and the only reason he can get away with it is because he's Stephen King. I would prefer to hear more about Roland and his past - I already know quite a bit about Stephen King's life story from A&E's Biography, thank you very much.One is left wondering what direction the Tower series would have taken had King never had his accident in '99 - certainly a better one than it seems to be heading in now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one more","review":"I'm not going to review this book, because it is not fair, If something should be review it must be the whole story of the Dark Tower.

A bit gimmicky without pushing the plot along","review":"Writing himself in (seeming as an excuse to complain about his fans for thinking they should have affordable access to his work) seemed a little gimmicky. Though you can tell just how much his near death experience (the hit and run in '99) really affected him by reading this book, I couldn't say that Song of Susannah really advanced the plot of the Dark Tower series at all.It was a moderately enjoyable read, but one worth waiting for paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roland is one bad mf'er","review":"This is an excellent follow-up to Wolves of the Calla and surpasses that one as well. People worried about where the series is headed should be rest assured that the direction Wolves took at the end is handled better than you might expect. With all the action and three separate narratives going on this DT entry harkens back to the two best DT books, DTII--Drawing of the Three and DTIII--The Waste Lands (DTIII still retains my title as favorite in the series). Some prior situations get resolved but all in all this book sets things up for the final showdown in DT7 (with yet another cliffhanger to leave the reader off). Here's hoping that the final book can live up to mighty expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"After giving this book a while to grow on me....SPOILERS in review!","review":"SPOILERS BELOWI still don't like this book or the direction king took the series after the 4th book. The 5th book was decent and kept me into it throughout, but with the finding of the king novel \\"Salem's Lot\\" i was afraid of where he was going. This book goes there i'm afraid. I still don't get why King put himself in the books. What complicates matters even worse is the fact that the 5th and 6th books should have been combined...at least in my opinion because they seem so much shorter than the first 4 and the 7th. However, if you've made it this far in the series you should finish it. I personally liked the ending of the 7th book but the 5th and 6th books were pretty terrible. Heck even the 7th could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King should have quit writing!","review":"The first 4 books were great! I was anxiously waiting for the rest of the series. It is obvious he had no more ideas for this story and forced himself to finish it. I struggled through Wolves of the Calla, most of which was Salems Lot revisited, just so I could get to the next book and closer to the end of the story. Song of Sunannah was even worse. Stephen King takes to writing about himself! He clearly does not have the imagination that he had when he younger and began this story. The more I read, the more dissapointed I became with the direction of the story. There is no more fantasy and romance of the worlds last gunslinger that was present in the first 4 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"VI review","review":"A must read, though anyone who's started reading the Dark Tower series already knows that.

This unpleasant rockyness is were DT6 takes off. It's at these point were I relize somethings not right. What happened to Eddie's smart-ass humor, what happened to the sense of forboding mystery, what happened to the story mostly revolving around Roland, YA KNOW THAT GUY FROM THE FIRST BOOK! The original romantic prose of the first few books is also rudley absent, and the ayes, yars and Commalas get old fast. I can appreciate King's merit in banging out the end of the tale fast, but maybe it should of stayed in the word processor a little longer.Stephen, I hope you ended the tale without forgetting the face of your' father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"As I was reading the coda at the end of the book, I read one part where King talked about other authors whose books are ruined by character pregnancies. Too bad he didn't take this wisdom to heart. I was so tired of this book I could barely wait to put it down. Enough already with Mia and the stupid baby. The entire pregnancy sidetracked Roland's interesting quest. I loved the Wastelands where King really drew a clear picture of Roland's world, and the way he painted the history of it in Wizard and Glass.King being in this book seemed so stupid. I felt like I was reading the book version of The Neverending story or something.

I invested too much time in the first 4 books so I felt I had to finish off the series. But it was soooo painful getting through these last 3 book.

The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story. I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top. The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book. I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of \\"The Green Mile: Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail.I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger signs!","review":"Yes, Danger signs.

First, the quality of the writing was not up to the usual high King standards. Second, the plot dragged, and in places, seemed not to make any sense. It seems to me that Mr. King, for whatever reason, just got lazy. Third, the insertion of the author himself into the story was self serving and unnecessary. Still, I am waitingwith much anticipation to see if the Beams hold true and the Tower remains standing.

There's no denying King's ability to hold a reader's interest even when he isn't saying anything worth reading, but still, be fair to the reader. This could have been written in 50 pages.

I thoroughly enjoyed the earlier books from the gunslinger series, but it seems that fame and money have made King lazy and egocentric. Who else do you know that would actually have the ego to write himself into his own book as a god? The dialogue in this book is also particularly simplistic and bland- something worthy of Danielle Steel. It lacks the capacity to conjure up the vivid imagery of earlier books. I can only believe that King is getting paid by the word, and that his publishing company, knowing whatever piece of trash he writes will sell, broke hardly a sweat in the editing process. It is truly, truly unfortunate that a series that originated with so much promise should end up this way. Like the worst movie sequel, this sequel sullies appreciation for the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has S. King become possessed by a hack writer?","review":"His past stories have been so brillant and entertaining, but this book and Wolves of Calla are fine examples of boring tripe by an author that apparentely doesn't believe in trying too hard.

Some would think this as arrogant, but I prefer to think that I get his joke. Now his written himself into DT 6 as possibly the Crimson King but probably not and I'm laughing (hopefully along with Stephen) What he then does with the Stephen King character is about as ballsy as one can get.Number 5 offered a few hints as to how this story has evolved over the years in King's mind. Number 6 offers even more and, I think the location of Black Thirteen is fitting (I don't get as offended as some--in fact, I'm not sure the easily offended should count themselves among King's fans) I find myself wondering what he originally intended and has he taken new directions with it over time.Ultimately, I'm as enthralled with the story as ever and await the conclusion this fall. I enjoyed Song thoroughly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wizard and Glass was the last","review":"True, I do have to read part 7 still, but part 5 & 6 were very poorly done in my opinion. First of all, it's obvious that the reason for the failure in 5 and 6 is that the gunslingers have lost their edge. They have become parodies of themselves. In another review I saw the phrase, \\"overly mannered,\\" which I feel hits home. The redundant vernacular: palaver, deal in lead, come commala this, come commala that, come commala with a wiffle ball bat, so... King is fastidious with his overdone jargon that sounds sickenly hackneyed. Since when did gunslingers become such wimps? Since part 5 & 6. That's when. The repetitive symbolism gets overdone until anything having to do with a 19, dinn, or Ka, is just charred nuggets. The symbolism has lost its zest by being referred to annoyingly countless times. As another reader stated, I can't wait to finish the Tower Series, so I can feel some closure on a story that went sour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"here i'll save you the trouble, remember where book 5 ended? you're about 1 inch from that at the end of this one.

With first 4 books in the Gunslinger series, I finished reading them within 3 days of first picking them up. It took me 2 weeks to get through Wolves of the Calla and 5 weeks to plow through this drivel. I'll read the last book in the series because I really want to see how it turns out and hope it gets better. The series stared out with such promise, but has really gone downhill. Nothing really happens in this book, and King writing himself in the story as a god was just egotistical and ridiculous. I was almost embarrassed to read it. If you a true die hard fan of the Gunslinger series I suppose it is worth it to read this just to get to the last book, which I hope will be better then the last 2"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm devastatingly disappointed","review":"I've read every single one of Stephen King's books, and this by far was the one that I enjoyed the least. Perhaps the only one that I would say that I didn't like. I couldn't wait to get my copy of the book. I couldn't wait to read it. I wanted to like it so much. As I read it, I tried to like the book. Unfortunately, the book is quite bad. I HATE the way that he included himself in the book, but that is only one aspect of what made the book a poor read. The character's actions did not ring true to me. This book would make a nice first draft. I'm worried about the last one. That said - I can't wait to read how everything finishes. What can I say, I'm addicted - however, at least in this case the drug just wasn't worth it.I'd look elsewhere for a summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LITTLE ANGRY","review":"By Stephen King including himself in this story, he takes some readers out of the imaginary world they have created in thier minds over the past several years reading these books. I have never complained much about any book, it is the author's vision take it or leave it, but with so much invested in this series it was a hard book to read. I hope the last book somehow brings the fantasy back for a worthwhile conclusion. CR. Regardless, SK Rocks!!! I reccommend almost all of his books!!!!just not this one :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Fantasy Supreme","review":"Chaotic, bizarre and gritty. The pace is lightning fast and leaves so many questions and uncertainties, keeping you turning pages like a madman. It finally explains a lot of curious moments that have been lingering for the last three books. Susannah's character development is a main new highlight and surprise. King takes her down in his own fascinating way. Spellbinding as she continues her downward spiral into the abyss. Perhaps the best of the series for anticipation and cliffhanger endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm holding out hope","review":"I did not think it was as good as Wolves however but I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt because of who the author is. The characters are getting very interesting and I found myself warming up to some of the newer ones even Mia surprisingly. The book kinda gets hazy in the middle but manages to sufficiently recover enough to keep the readers interest.Overall-I really don't know what to think of this book as much as I liked it I can see where the next book could go south really quick if King does it the wrong way. And just for the record I found all of those commalla quotes at the end of the chapters really annoying.

It is so close to the end of the long epic, but a lot has to be done. I hate how these books have cliff hanger endings but I can't wait to feast my eyes on the 7th novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song of Susannah","review":"I just started this book in hope that it would redeem my lost enthusiasm from Wolves on the Calle. I am disappointed. Stephen King does not seem to be even trying to hold his readers attention. It seems to me that he's just airing out all his inner life trifles on philosophy to nostalgia, it makes me think he is having a mid-life crises or worst writers block. Susanah is working together with her demon baby trying to fight off its evil intentions and get back to Eddie? Roland (our hero) is turning into a senile cripple, Eddie is love lost, and Jake is probally in the story just to add more pages to this disaster. I'm thinking of skipping a few chapters just to complete the whole series. I might just let it go unfinshed and create my own ending. Stephen King has wrote many creative stories in the past including The Darktowers 1-4 but now I think he should stick to his short stories and leave the bigger novels to J.K. Rowling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated!","review":"Having waited in anticipation for the 6th volume of the Dark Tower - the 4th and 5th I was absolutely enthralled in - I feel cheated.

I know this was supposed to be the 6th with a volume following but I feel there were waay too many loose ends left untied and I would've preferred to read the 6th and 7th together. Now I have to wait 4 months to find out what happened...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retirement","review":"Loved the story. I feel the same as others that it may have been too short considering only one more is left in the series. Has anyone heard how many pages the final is going to be? Lets hope it compares to It or The Stand in size!I saw an interview with King and clarified he never said that he was retiring after the final installment. I also heard the same rumour a few years back but what he actually said was taken out of context by the reporter he says.He says that he may take a vacation/break that may last anywhere between 6 months and 5 years if I remember correctly.

The MOST insulting thing before making a game effort to read the drivle, is the LARGE PRINT VERSION TRANSPARENTLY DEVISED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ENOUGH BOOK TO CHARGE $30 FOR!!!

Better to have a disappoited readership than a disgusted one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I was really into this series, I didnt even mind the cliffhanger at the end of the wastelands (though the wizard of Oz business in wizard and glass got tedious...)But this whole bit of the gunslinger and eddie meeting King was too ridiculous for words.If this was any but a top flight author who has made millions on millions of dollars for his publishing house, this book would never have gotten published.I am going into the last of the series now, what the hell, I am already 6 books in, only one to go...But I dont hold very high hopes anymore....If this were a TV show it would have been cancelled, and no one would get to know how it ended.There is probly too much truth in the parts of the \\"fiction\\" where King rambles about taking on the biggest work of his life and being afraid he had taken on too much.

Remarkably, most of the books are still in what is regarded as the upper tier of literature. Not surprisingly it has a strong British emphasis. About 10-15% of the authors were \\"unknowns\\" in my eyes - either authors that represented classics from the \\"past\\" or \\"modern\\" authors that have passed into the hidden realm of time in less than a century. The latter gives me hope that the avalanche of many modern publications will be covered by the same eternal dust as a future reader looks backwards.Regardless, a fun (and short) read for people interested in the perspectives of the western canon as viewed from 1916."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for quick prep and clean up","review":"Also make a nice funnel for pouring your food stuffs where they need to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget Chopping!","review":"The manufacturer of this product has missed a fabulous opportunity to market these chop mats.

Its only shortcoming (is it a shortcoming?) is that for anyone with little to no previous understanding of geologic processes, biology, botany, et al, they may feel slightly lost at times. Mr. Gilligan rarely gives a background to the process, event, or adaptation he is about to describe.

My bike does have a number of extra holes where I might put a number of things, but not where this product wants there to be holes. Most road bikes would not have those holes. I tried it on my husband's trail/mountain bike, a style more similar to hybrids, which almost worked except the screws provided were too large for his holes. Also, poor directions. Three sizes of screws, no way to tell which was for which area, though it was a moot point as these fenders didn't fit anywhere.

Unfortunately, the hardware included barely fits and the rear fender clip interfered with the front-derailleur cable. But even after getting the fenders to fit, they would wiggle around and even bounce on the wheel, which is far from safe. And the promise of clipping \\"on and off in seconds\\" is completely false. The front fender requires unscrewing a thumb nut and the rear fender gets caught in the plastic clip and is near impossible to slide out.I trashed these and went with a set of Bontrager Satellite fenders ($25 at most dealers or online) which are much sturdier, have a better clip-on system with quick-release levers, and even fit into my messenger bag to take with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of monye","review":"I needed fenders that were TRUE clip-ons.

I purchased these fenders to eliminate water splash during my commute. First of all, the hardware provided does not match my bike's frame.

The fenders are flimsy and easily acheive an off-center position, allowing water to splash on my back. I'm not really interested in adjusting my fenders everytime I ride. If you want a good fender, purchase one that is very hard plastic or metal and attaches to the frame near the hub. Do not waste your money here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, pay more for nicer fenders...........","review":"I agree with the other poster. I have a Trek 7.5FX and these don't fit the front or the rear. I can make it fit the front by purchasing a longer bolt at the hardware store.

I agree with other reviews in that For My Lover should have been included on this. I am a bit confused by the sound issues as this cd was an import from the UK but made in germany. Perhaps some of you got the cd that was made in argentina? I saw one of those in the used section of newbury comics today and took no chances going with the new UK import version.

But other tracks like \\"Crossroads\\", \\"Smoke And Ashes\\", \\"All That You Have Is Your Soul\\", and the popular \\"Give Me One Reason\\" are all wonderful too.

Why is the pin different?","review":"I have 2 of the same type badge, and just bought another one from this seller. The other 2 I had brought in a store in Puerto Rico. When I received this badge I noticed that it was different then the other two. Sure they look very similar, but this one is made different. The back has a different pin. Its not like a real badge pin like the other two I have. It also weighs less, and the reason is because the back is carved in instead of a smooth surface like my other 2. If you are okay with the stupid pin in the back that wont allow you to put it on any holster besides attaching it to a uniform shirt. I hate the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toy Badge","review":"This product is fulfilling its purpose without any complaints. The construction of this badge is great.

I can't believe that anybody could find something positive to say about this video. Out of the dozens of climbing videos I've seen, this is close to the worst. The footage is terrible, and clips are often repeated three or four times during the video to make it seem longer.

Curtis Nickel's book is a better buy, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It - Better Books Are Available","review":"A previous reviewer mentioned giving away 500 copies of this book. If that is accurate then it begs the question \\"Why this book?\\" Because it fills a void? This book IS a void! The author obviously hasn't bothered to keep the book updated since its original publishing date of 1996 and it shows. There is a substantial gap of knowledge present in this book and the reader is advised to seek a more modern discussion of the topics. An excellent alternative is 'The Prostatitis Manual: A Practical Guide to Management of Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome'. A bit more expensive, but it leaves 'The Prostatitis Syndromes' in the mists of time where it belongs. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total and Complete","review":"This is a \\"vanity press\\", self-published pile of junk! Go to Google and enter \\"prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain\\" and look at the sites you get. They completely discount the theories the author Hennenfent (who no longer practises as a doctor - check the AMA listings) is pushing. What makes this so much worse is that the author seems to have some sort of relationship with the two or three clinics in the world which profit from applying the unusual treatments he recommends. Buyer beware!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Book, not worth the price","review":"The author is sadly mired in the past. The other reviews here praising the book are completely unbelievable. I found the book's emphasis on microbial pathogenesis to be a rehash of old theories and treatments that are dubious at best, harmful at worst. The latest research all points in other directions for prostatitis, male chronic pelvic pain syndrome and male interstitial cystitis. Big thumbs down. I suggest a Google search for the exact phrase \\"chronicprostatitis forum\\", which will take you to a place where the very latest concepts and breakthroughs are being discussed, and where you can find more interesting data about this author Bradley Hennenfent as well. They also have excellent book recommendations there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"A rehash of old discredited theories.

It moves along fast enough to keep you interested and has enough \\"real\\" songs to make it fun. I finished it and my son is going through it now and it works if you can read music (like me) or can't (like my son), though he had a little trouble with tabs vs. staff music until I sat down with him and explained it.My only problem with the book is the perfect binding. By the time I got to the middle of the book, the binding had broken down and pages started falling out, so I'll probably have to take the three-hole punch to it and put it in a binder. Other than that, I can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Book","review":"Excellent instruction tool! This product is great for someone that wants to teach themselves. I highly recommend this instructional book."},{"rating":"2","title":"alfred is awesome","review":"I have Alfreds piano method with I enjoyed so I decided to pick up his guitar method too. I have no complaints about this book. After I played a segment of the danube waltz I knew this is my personal favorite guitar method, and I have a lot of them. There are a lot of different styles presented and explanations on basic skills I see lacking in other books like the Mel Bay series like the different muting techniques. I can't help but go back and play some of the pieces because there's something magical about bach on the electrical guitar. This book is great for beginners and will not suddenly ramp up in difficulty like A Modern Method for Guitar. Highly recommended guitar method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT come with all three CDs as indicated and shown.","review":"This item only comes with CD #3.

I had always envisioned them crawling around on the bottom of the sea waiting to be consumed. However, this book opened my eyes to the complexity of lobsters.This book tells of lobsters' habits such as reproduction, growth stages, molting, migrating, feeding, fighting, and so much more. But, the book is not just about the lobsters themselves. Like the other reviewer said, it's about lobstermen and their families and their lives on Little Cranberry Island. It also goes into lobster research and conservation efforts.This book is informative, interesting and amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melt the butter!","review":"A good book for breezy summer reading. Just a work detailing the scientific study of lobsters and how that science has affected the fishery in Maine. Well written, well researched and fun to read.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Potential","review":"This book seems to have a split personality. It seems to want to tell us about loberstermen or how lobsters live in the wild and efforts to preserve them. If it had stuck to one or the other it may have been a great book but what we get is disjointed and unfocused. There were many times when I would like to have learned more about a particular topic but it was left undone. The Discover channel did a special on lobsters in 2002 that was far more interesting and engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly brilliant!","review":"Corson's technique of switching between the catchers and the studiers works really well. He has taken what could be a very dry, academic subject - or a totally fluffy one - and made it both spell-binding and human.I'm familiar with the lobstering end of his material, and knew he was right on target with it (though I was pleased to hear the father of his primary fisherman-character speaking enthusiastically about the book - no one is harder to please than a family member, I'm sure.) But I knew next to nothing about the life of lobsters or of the efforts scientists are making to study them prior to reading the book. Fascinating stuff, and told with great enthusiasm and even suspense. Every time I had to put the book down, I could hardly wait to come back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book was given to me as a gift since I have a summer home in Down East, Maine.It was an excellent,fascinating book, very well written and attention-holding. It tells a factual account about the Lobster industry and research that is going on to preserve these creatures, but also interweaves a personal story of the islanders on Little Cranberry.Good book for an rainy afternoon and would recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice product","review":"I was unsure about purchasing this because of the limited pictures available online- it looked like it wold be a little on the ugly side. But I'm happy to report it is lovely in person.

Each story is different, and you can really tell that each one came from a special place in the artist's heart.This is a great place to start getting into independent graphic novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This book and also the following ones are must read graphic novels. Each one contains short stories, some continuing throughout the series and others are just a few pages long in one. But each story is captivating and wonderful, and every single stories artwork is different but amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good art, weak writing","review":"I bought this book because it was listed as a must-buy by the Library Journal and by a number of graphic novel bloggers.I have no idea why.The art is gorgeous, but the stories are generally very weak. It always takes at least two reads to understand what the point of the stories are and many of them are still lost on me. Many of them read like scenes from the middle of a story, and lacking the setup, or the general direction of the overall narrative, they make for strange reading. It's much like tuning into a movie an hour in and watching five minutes of the film. Or, like picking up a comic for one issue in the middle of a storyline.In general the creators of the vignettes are far more talented as artists than they are as storytellers. It seems that, by design, the art is far more important than the story here, so if that's what you are looking for, you will not be disappointed. If you want good stories, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing new start for the graphic novel genre","review":"Flight is a collaborative project giving readers the chance to sample varied short story works by several artist and writers. This is such a great idea and really a fresh new start for graphic novel genre. It's a real treat for those interested in indie (independent) comics but find it hard to get a hold of them or even find anything good let alone worth reading.An interesting and fun thing about the first volume of Flight is that many of the stories are based upon the same general theme of flight. So it makes for a fun read comparing the differences in each of the stories.A couple of these are by the famed Kazu Kibuishi. They both feature his characters from Copper. And explore their airplane adventures.Flight is an enjoyable graphic novel and well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy for the price","review":"The cherry finish is a little redder than I would like. I also wish the vendor inidcated in the description where the screw holes were located. As it turns out, I cannot screw these onto the backs of our closet doors. Not to worry, a high quality 2-sided tape will do the trick. The vendor shipped the product promptly and all arrived in very good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not about science","review":"Any approach to dreaming that is based on the idea that REM sleep is dreaming is just wrong. There is a very interesting state of REM sleep - a state for which we have lots of data from both scanning and animal studies. But there is little or no scientific evidence that dreaming is in any way specially associated with REM sleep. Sleep onset dreams are remembered just as frequently and are just as bizarre - if you don't believe this is so, visit a Salvador Dali painting at your local museum. Deep sleep dreams are more rarely remembered but even more bizarre - have you ever had a night terror? There is no logical basis for neuroanatomical research into REM sleep to be applied to dreaming. A presentation such as this is not based on science, it's based on Hobsons' theory that he calls AIM - a theory without supporting scientific evidence, and a theory that this book perpetuates as \\"science\\" when it is in reality scientific myth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Textbook","review":"I 100% disagree with the reviews others have given this book. Actually, I could barely trudge through this book, it was THAT boring. The author has no distinct voice. In fact, it's as if she just looked around the Internet and library and put together a bunch of facts about dreaming. It read like a college student's report... with much too many references to other research. If you're interested in the regurgitated history of dreams, then you might like this book, but I honestly was hoping for something more, not just a textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"So interesting","review":"I very much enjoyed this book on the history of dream research - it was written in an engaging style, and brought the stories of sleep research to life. This is not a how-to book on getting those much-needed zzzz's, but it is a interesting snapshot of a group of diverse men and women who were drawn to investigating sleep and why we dream.As much of a page-turner as you can expect for a book about academic research ... I stayed up late several nights to finish it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad mixing here!","review":"THE greatest part about this CD is the first track: \\"Snow\\" by O.R.N. It's just incredible!The second greatest part about this CD is the mixing; too often, DJ compilations take the form of one track jammed up abruptly against the other with little or no mixing between songs. Dimitri's mixes are far from that tired method, and provide a smooth move from track to track. Keeping music sewn together the way Dimitri has takes time to make the beat work and time to select the proper music so the songs work together. There is one small trainwreck that he quickly recovers from, but this compilation was mixed \\"live,\\" according to the CD label--you have to be forgiving.Mind your volume control a bit as audio levels tend to rise slightly through this CD.A good housey-trancey compilation... Worth the price if you want to experience Dimitri's mad-skill mixing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at Best","review":"Decent programming in the front half of the CD is overshadowed by some of the worst mixing I've ever heard come out of a production studio.

So, when I got back to the states a looked to see if he had any mix CDs out, and the only one is this one. I love it, his track selection is the bomb his mixing kicks major as*.

N'sync as an excellent boy band has great vocals, they blend in together and they always put in all their feelings into their songs to make it feel alive. Gloria just adds more harmony and feelings in which makes them sound even better. Their CDs are always available to the public and are selling at a very good price range. I am always glad to send my review for all the N'sync and Gloria Estefan lovers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Of My Heart","review":"This CD has the original song plus a remix of the song that is NOT on the Music of the Heart soundtrack.

If he's crawling toward something he can't have, all I have to do is start the train, send it his way and he gets distracted and plays with this train instead.
