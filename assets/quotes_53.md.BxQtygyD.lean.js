It was a great satisfaction when it was all done (and our 7-year old boy loved it), but we realized that I had left out a piece of hardware (item PE) that goes between the back board and the pole. I didn't see this piece pictured at the top of the page containing the rim assembly step so I assumed it was not needed in that step. The picture of the assembly step itself does show this piece (in the exploded view) but unfortunately I overlooked it. Even without it the structure felt sturdy and strong so I didn't bother to dismantle and reassemble. I filled the base completely with water. Today we had high winds in the area (40-50 mph gusts)and the whole thing tipped over, but nothing broke! I lifted it back up and so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system!","review":"I bought this for my 6 year old son for his birthday and we are both very pleased! First of all, you can not beat the price. I was actually a little hesitant to get it because it was so cheap, but it is a great quality hoop. I was able to put it together all by myself in about an hour and a half. The instructions were very easy to understand and there were individually, numbered bags to go along with each section in the directions. It is on the shortest setting right now and it looks like I will need to use a ladder to move it up to the next levels, but that really isn't a big deal.In summary, great system for a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"We bought this for our six year old. It is perfect. The set up was certainly a two man-job. But, my wife and I were able to do it. My son loves it. Like the other reviews - it is impossible to pour sand into it. Also, I'd recommend that you adjust the height of the rim prior to set up. The directions don't tell you to do this.But, for the money - you can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"I bought this items when it was on sale. I was very happy with the price at the time but would probably still purchase at full price. I like the color and design of the backboard. I wasn't sure if the clear boards would get cloudy over time due to sun damage. I was able to put this system together by myself. I only had to turn it on its side to put the backboard on and had no problems. I also extended the pole to full height without realizing it until I went to stand the system up. This presented no problem either. I opted to fill my base with water since I didn't want to haul 312 lbs of sand in my car. I am not worried about the water freezing because I can reduce the amount to ensure the base does not crack during the winter due to the water expanding during the freezing process. I bought this system for myself as an exercise alternate and to get some sun without paying for a tanning bed. So far my purchase has paid off and I look forward to enjoying it for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basketball backboard","review":"This basketball backboard is a good value (and made in the USA), however it took 2 hours to put together, not including adding the sand as a weight.

Seems to be constucted well. I would recommend a two person team putting it together. We at first put two of the poles in backwards and they were jammed in pretty good. I put a little olive oil (what I had on hand) around the seam and banged with a rubber mallet until they loosened. The directions were not the easiest so, read a few times before to start.

It arrived very quickly, but the directions are terrible. I saw that other people commented on how bad the directions where, but disregarded them. There was no exaggeration.

The company seriously needs to look at the directions..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner level goal!!","review":"This is a great beginner level goal. This purchase sure made an eight year old happy. The pro's are this goal is solidly constructed, adjustable and not so expensive. The con's are assembly and backboard material. I assembled this by myself and managed. Two people would definitely be the way to go. I would have liked a larger opening for filling the base with sand. This took some time and is one of the reasons I did not give this five stars. The backboard is a \\"plastic-type\\" material, but does just fine with entry level of play.

I'll have to get back to you on durability as this took all afternoon to set up. The assembly manual is AWFUL. They go to great lengths to label all the parts in the manual...and stamp different numbers/letters on the actual pieces so what is the point? Two bolts and two washers are not even the right size. The assembly book is all pictures, very few are helpful, and no words. The tube inside tube packing tacked on twenty extra minutes for assembly. I realize this is a cheaper model but a gas tank type cap would have made sand pouring a whole lot faster. I have never had such a mess with assembly and have assembled far more complicated things.

Once I did receive it we were able to operate it just fine. However, the wash cycle is ridiculously long. There is no dry cycle.

The shapes created by the way the carriage is designed and where the bars stick up, how far apart they are, limit the number and types of dishes that can be entered. Sincerely, you can only wash 4 cups, 4 plates, 4 bowls, etc. And they must be configured in the washer the way the thing was designed. It's a pain. I gave it away. I bought it originally because I felt that my silverware and tupperware were not looking \\"clean\\" after sink washing. I hoped the super hot electric washing would help.

I am truly annoyed that I spent both the time and money on the book. I thought it was trite and cliched, with stilted language and dialogue -- Dorothea was laughable, even considering how sheltered she had been, and I think the problem was that none of the characters were particularly well-drawn or sympathetic, all kind of simplistic or even simple-minded -- it was like a uninteresting, melodramatic soap opera for 13 year olds. The story is nothing new, but there were subjects covered that could have been very interesting and compelling parts of the story line IF the writing had been better. One reviewer said \\"blah\\" and I completely agree!"},{"rating":"1","title":"once upon a day-never in our lifetime","review":"This, much heralded, book sets the work to empower women who survive domestic violence back several decades. It is another of the \\"bad boy\\" fantasies where a man who controls every move of his entire family, culminating in the kidnapping of his children, is finally forgiven by his wife and children, when the children finally reunite with their mother after 19 years of being held captive by their father and paternal grandmother. The children, ages 6 and 4, are abducted by their father after their mother is brutally attacked when resisting rape by home intruders. The father raises the children in remote AZ, where they have no contact with the outside world, under the guise of protecting them from the horrors of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a bit far fetched","review":"Good story from talented writer. A bit far fetched and things left to an easy resolution: no hard feelings, kids all right, when in reality such a controlling personality and the life of recluse would have had devastating effects. Still entertaining story with strong characters. It is quite a jump for Tucker in terms of the subjects tackled and the developments in the story but is a good effort. I also highly recommend Tucker's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"man takes his children to new mexico and raises them in isolation. both children end up leaving the utopia in their 20s. they discover the world--interesting story and it keeps moving.

It offers a comprehensive survey of the problems involved in the definition of a realistic stance in philosophy of science. Moreover Niiniluoto writes clearly and exhibits an impressive command of relavant literature. However I have not found convincing the theses he defends. Niiniluoto's task is that of steering a middle course between realism and antirealism, rejecting both \\"hard\\" realism a la Devitt and Putnam's internal realism. I think he doesn't succeed in this attempt and that his critical realism is not realism after all, but a kind of internal realism under another name. This obviously doesn't diminish the importance of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"This item is the biggest piece of junk I have ever ordered from Amazon.

Even fewer decide on a country with wildly different cultural traditions. But Jeanne Eck did just that, after visiting Egypt once and finding a piece of herself there that required further exploration. This book describes her journey, her adventures, her friendships, her discoveries and her frustrations. It does so from a unique, personal perspective that brings the reader directly into the heart of her experience.

The downside is that it doesn't seal to the valve stem well, so that one is tempted to apply maximo pressure. However, sooner rather than later, the head of the unit will break from the body (only make of plastic). More frustrating, that area can crack before it fully breaks, so that one is getting artificially low readouts (so one applies more pressure, and \\"crack\\"!). Also, for motorcyclists, I prefer to place the wheel so that the valve stem is around 9 or 10 o'clock, so I don't have to stoop so far, and I can use my other hand to place the head firmly on the valve stem.

Ross and Lydia are only CHARACTERS, no matter how vividly Brown's stories bring them to you.

To use his feeling for her mother(Lydia) against him and ask him to use her(Banner) as a substitute? What kind of a self respecting lady would do that? I can understand that Banner was young and was in need of comfort, but she should have been woman enough to persuade Jake on her own. Then she makes Jake spend the majority of the book trying to convince her that he loves her and not her mom! As if that wasn't bad enough then Ross(her Dad) is killed. Was this so that the author could show once in for all that Jake only loved Banner? What a shame that Lydia would have to suffer so much because of an insecure selfish daughter.

He constantly seems to be guessing at the motivation of historical figures, rather than producing evidence of their actions. Add interminable quotations from sources that predate the actions he's describing by several centuries and the result is a shambles"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth Reading","review":"Cahill is a very skilled writer and many will find this a fascinating read. He is also a skillful researcher. Unfortunately Cahill seems to be unable to see characters outside of his twenty first-century context. He essentially ignores any evidence to the contrary (Historian John Bury for one) and describes Patrick as a devil may care schismatic. Then with the same myopic twist proceeds to paint Saint Augustine as a bitter representative of a dying religion. He bemoans the fact the Church has followed Saint Augustine, gleefully reports an instance of ceremonial bestiality, for some reason which only he is aware of, inserts gratuitous profanity, and insanely credits Irish piety as a chance to out \\"Victorian\\" the English. Still all in all the pluses out weigh the minuses and this book is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A narrow-minded book","review":"A book that obviously endeavors to be pro-Irish but is in fact quite narrow in its appreciation for Irish Celtic heritage. In praising the literacy, ingenuity and key historic role of the early Irish Christians, the author also makes a number of cutting remarks about earlier Irish culture. It's a book that obviously considers the Classical (read: non-Celtic) to be the standard of civilization. Thus it presents a highly misinformed opinion of anything that relies on oral tradition, pagan religion, or a tribal government. As an historian I was excited to read about the accomplishments of the Celtic Irish, and instead I got the accolades of the Irish-acting-Roman. Doesn't seem to me that this is at all a credit to the Irish, but rather to the invasions--both military and cultural--which began the downward trend for Eire. The types of events that interest Cahill are as likely to have been root causes of Irish culture-loss as they are to have saved civilization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very over-rated","review":"This book is poorly written. It is historically inaccurate. The author seems to pick and choose his data.

Instead he panders to Irish-American sentimentality and nostalgic patriotism to whip up a frothy story that has very little truth to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catholic doctrine masquerading as history","review":"This book purports to be about Ireland, but it is really about Catholic doctrine in Ireland. The historical material concerning the Roman Empire is already well known. There is some Irish history, but only as much as one reads in the lives of the saints. The title is misleading and the book, at least up to page 127 where I quit reading, is not worth buying. A one star rating is too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"History Lite","review":"The author pads three-fourths of this little book with stultifying exposition on ancient history and a quickie intro to pre-Christian Ireland before getting to his thesis, which doesn't live up to the preposterous title. \\"The Irish read a lot. They copied some manuscripts. Hooray for the Irish.\\" For perspective, the Arabs and Jews did far more to preserve Greek thought than the Irish ever did, but they don't even get a mention.It's too bad for Ireland that cruel, cruel fate chose the under-talented Thomas Cahill to introduce their cultural accomplishments to the world. His treatment reduces this area of Irish history to the level of a mildly interesting footnote.Maybe a historian will come along and give the topic the time and effort it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assumes!","review":"Very good history, but the analysis presents a fictitious schismatic Celtic Church and beats the heck out of great thinker and saint, St. Augustine. Cahill brings his disagreements with the Roman Catholic Church to 5th century Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"A history book this is not","review":"Unfortunately for the average reader this book reads like a history book but equally unfortunately it is not. It is everything that people say it is in the way of being an entertaining read, an interesting read etc. etc. but Cahill knows very little about his source material. As someone else pointed out his descriptions of pre-Christian Ireland are not accurate. His opinions are based on pro-Christian texts written in later times to denigrate the pagan Irish. The information he gives on St. Patrick is based on later myth and not historical texts of which there are very little dating from fifth century Ireland. As a history teacher I do not recommend this book to students expect as a form of fiction. It should not be read too closely and serious readers who really want to learn about this time in Ireland should go elsewhere for more accurate knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most fun I've had with history - ever!","review":"This book is a fascinating and very readable account of an important piece of history. Not only is it information that is omitted in the standard text books, but it is presented in a way that makes you personally involved in the lives and contributions of such men as Saint Patrick. These are living, breathing pages which give dignity and value to a people and a culture that has long been characatured or dismissed. I literally laughed and sighed aloud. This is a must-read for anyone of Irish descent and a very enjoyable look at western culture for anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent","review":"The subject had great promise. The author is witty. The presentation was poorly organized. He couldn't maintain even a semblance of chronological order. At one point he claims all of the libraries of Greek and Roman culture had been destroyed. Still, he has Irish monks copying books on the continent (one and two centuries later) without explaining where they found the books to copy. So much of the material was extraneous that I got the feeling he was padding. This reached its height when he offered a long passage from Plato, warning in advance that the reader would probably find it abstruse and suggesting it might be a good idea to just skip the passage. I did, wishing eventually that I had skipped everything beyond the introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"The unabridged audio is poor","review":"I won't weigh in on the merits of the work itself--it is fine for my taste, though not to others. But you ought to be warned that the narration for the unabridged edition, by Donal Donnelly, is deplorable. He reads with almost comically exaggerated vocal inflections. He often pauses after ever few words (sometimes after every single word) so that you can hardly follow the flow of the ideas. I found it so annoying that I had to stop listening, though I was engaged by the book itself. This criticism does not apply to Liam Neeson's reading of the abridged edition--I haven't heard it, but it seems to get good reviews. This is the rare instance when I wish I had bought the shorter version."},{"rating":"1","title":"They played a part but was it crucial?","review":"To live up to the title, Cahill would have to answer the following questions? What ancient works were necessary for civilization's rebirth? Did the Irish save these works? Did only the Irish save these works?The crucial works were the writings of Aristotle - which Aquinas studied and reconciled with Christianity. This helped lay the ground work for a renewed respect for the secular and rational. Notice that this influence is absent in the Eastern Orthodox Church. From the renewed influence of reason proceeds the Renaissance and Enlightenment.The works of Aristotle, lost to the west, were reintroduced after the Crusades. Copies were saved in the Mid East, often in Arab hands. The Irish monks contributed and deserve credit - as do many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patriotic Myth","review":"The Irish have been claiming for a long time that they \\"saved civilization.\\" But this is pure myth, and Cahill's entertaining and seemingly erudite book does little but perpetrate this myth. Let the reader beware: Roman and Greek texts were not preserved primarily by Irish monestaries--indeed Irish monestaries were always hard up for texts, and those that did circulate were primarily post-classical Christian works. The story of Irish Christianity is fascinating and of the highest historical importance, but it is not to be found in Cahill's somewhat silly book. I recommend instead The Rise of Western Christendom by Peter Brown, which contains a very illuminating discussion of the Celtic Christianity that arose around the great monestaries of Ireland and Northumbria."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word \\"LUDICROUS!\\"","review":"Very wishful \\"revisionist\\" thinking by Mr. Cahill. These books that the Irish monks merely copied, and never revealed or published for the world to truly broaden its knowledge, are akin to all the other monks across the mainland of Europe that did the same thing, yet revealed nothing to the public. It was the humanist Italian seekers of secular knowledge, during the early Renaissance, that uncovered these writings and most importantly made use of them, such as the Medici family that almost single handedly initiated the Renaissance. That is why Florence and Rome were pinnacles of the era, because this knowledge was UTILIZED in Italy, which clearly set the pace for other nations to follow. This is fact that cannot be revised by wishful thinkers. This is just a lame attempt to give monumental importance to a race, that although has many nice and humble traits, is insignificant on the colossal world-scene of Western Civilization."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXYMORONIC TITLE, ABSURD PREMISE.","review":"As a foreign exchange student I was shocked when I heard him speak at NYU. He even claimed that there was a conspiracy against his book. Talk about paranoid! Every time he did not like a question, he jumped to the next student. Exs: Where did the Irish get their books? There were other monks copying books? What about the Romans and Greeks, they and their cultures never vanished? How about the thousands of Arabs and Jews who built libraries wherever they settled? How about the scholars in the Roman and Greek Orthodox Churches? When did the big bad Germans destroy all the boooks? As a German I found his thesis very offensive. So too, should any other logical reader. This is bed pan history, and bigotry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Celts kept classics carefully copied","review":"God bless the Irish for preserving so much ancient learning and for promoting the art of story telling in poems, prose, and songs. Great read by Thomas Cahill. Especially recommend the parts with Cuchulainn and his \\"warp spasm.\\" Can be read in a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good history","review":"As I read How the Irish saved Civilization, I realized that a big part of history is left out of education in general. Most of the history that I have studied goes from the fall of Rome to Medival times, but does not explain much about what went on between times. Mr. Cayhill's book is a good way to percieve the \\"in-between\\" times. I have also recommended this book to several of my friends who homeschool their children, as a school book for post-Rome times. Since the book is very easy to read, I think it would be good for Junior High aged children as a extra corricular or summer reading project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideously researched and very biased. Don't listen to him.","review":"Cahill fails to cite almost any sources for his historical \\"facts,\\" and the few he does cite are either mistranslated or misquoted. The gist of the book is that the way in which the Irish saved civilization was by embracing Christianity. His definition of civilization is any Christian society; the surrounding Pagan cultures are referred to as barbarian hordes living in darkness till the light of God is thrust upon them. His point seems to be that Christianity took hold of Europe and the rest of the world largely because it managed to take hold of Ireland, but he fails to understand or tell us that Christianity was repeatedly rejected by the Irish, and that the older Pagan ways continued on for a VERY long time underneath a thin cover of Christian rule. In short, he Pagan-bashes like crazy and has the WORST historical methods I have seen in years of study"},{"rating":"1","title":"FIVE NEGATIVE STARS!!!!!!","review":"This review is for all of the 1 Star reviewers who were insulted by the last reviewers comments. First, the 1 star reviewers actually reviewed this FICTIONAL PACK OF LIES. Second, every single one of them made good points. This woman was born and educated in Germany and trust me the Irish are not held in any regard, that is if they are even mentioned. The last reviewer like Mr. Cahill did not prove anything by his childish tirade. I for one am going to be signing any petition by any ethnic group that wishes to censor this hate filled book. Calling all German, Italian, Greek, Hispanic, Asian, and any other group that Mr. Cahill chose to attack. I for one expect that Amazon will remove my rev. Which is fine, only if they do the same for Mr. D's rev. Regardless, I won't be reading any more books by Cahill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too cursory and not the best on this subject","review":"This was not as compelling or thoughtful as this subject deserved. It seems to be written (or transscribed) with the audiotape in mind. Cahill's statement in the preface that this subject (How the Irish Saved...) has not been addressed before is wrong. I recommend James Charles Roy's Islands of Storm. This is an earlier book and does a far better job of explaining this subject. In addition it adds far more Irish geography and meanderings about Irish religious development and influences. At 280 pages a far more worthwhile and enjoyable read. In fact after reading Cahill's, I immediately re-read Roy's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hinges Of Hate??????","review":"What's next, how the Irish built the great wall of China? How anyone with even a 4th grade education could believe that the Greeks and Romans needed others to preserve their \\"rich heritage goes beyond all logic and reason.\\" The 3-5 star reviewers have unintentionally endorsed the bigotry and misinformation that the author spews throughout. How can any reader overlook it? Even some reviewers who share the authors ethnicity have expressed their disgust, like-\\"I'm Irish.\\" The author failed to mention that most of the Continental monasteries they founded barely lasted a generation. The locals understandably got fed up with their \\"PARASITICALLY LIVING OFF THEM!\\" The Benedictines were self suffiecent Mr. Egolf! Where did these saintly{HAH} monks get their books? Other more educated reviewers had to tell us since the author refused too! That in itself made this book stink of Lindberger! I hope Amazon dumps this into their bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Any Irish/N. Irish schoolchild could have written this","review":"Very disappointing. Unfortunately, I fell for the catchy title. I felt the whole book's tone was summed up by Chahill's statement on the final pages that Jackie Onassis Kennedy had been kind enough to review the book and give helpful comments (or words to that effect). Well, unless I am much mistaken she is hardly the most eminent scholar of Irish history and nor is Cahill judging from this book. It is badly written, lacks both profondity and originality, and has a most irritating and condescending tone. I could have written it myself based on what I remember from school history classes a few years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at least","review":"I read this book due to the reviews found here at Amazon.com, what a disappointment. This book is not only disappointing but at times downright offensive. Cahill talks about Cicero being boring and Ausonius being pretentious, both these descriptions could and should apply to Cahill. The level of scholarship in this book is dismal at best. His attempts at being clever are no more than weak. His snide comments about Mormons and Jehovahs Witnesses (very out of place in a book proporting to be a history of the fall of Rome to Medieval Europe)are proof of his lack of study. The one thing that this book has to offer is the concise story of Saint Patrick, however there are many other and better sources for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quaint but historically uninteresting","review":"There is lots of good historical evidence, circumstantialand factual that leads one to believe that Ireland playeda crucial role in the development of Western Christian Europe.Unfortunately, none of that can be found in this book.

Do not buy it.I bought it for two reasons:1) I wanted a book about the Irish people and their history.2) The title, don't make that mistake.It only had a little about the Irish. The majority of the material was about the Greeks/Romans and Christianity. Of the small amount about the Irish, half or more, was derogatory material. For example, the author states that early Irish literary works were laughable, comparible to modern day comic books. It seemed as though the author missed no opportunity to slander the Irish people. Also several of the statements the author made about history, by his own admission, were suppositions and conjecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is merely a good intro to the subject.","review":"Being half Irish (my grandfather came to the states after WWI) I am always interested in reading current views on Irish history. As far as the book goes, it is excellent. But that distance is a mere chapter. After every section there were many questions that should have been answered. This book is barely the \\"Cliff Notes\\" version of how the Irish monks saved the Western literary civilization.Submitted by: don (Kavanaugh) shafe"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rare send-back","review":"Cahill has exaggerated an historical sidelight (and not a unique one, i.e., a culture with a bibliographic tradition that survived the relative chaos after the fall of Rome) into an overblown rumination on illuminated manuscripts and monks. Plodding and dull, with few surprises for the literate. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is too many","review":"Cahill is indeed attempting to rewrite history, his appeal can only be to those who have never read a non-fiction account of the past 2000 years. It was, in fact, King Alfred who started the interest in copying the great documents. It was a Welsh man who put together the Lindsifarne Gospel. Has this man even heard of Bede? The Irish were Celts, the Celts were Germanic in origin, they resided throughout Britain, Wales and Ireland. This fictional account has been written for the so-called \\"Irish-American\\" contingency trying yet again to legitimise their roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the Irish Saved Civilization","review":"This book came highly recommended by a couple of people. I'm not sure why. It was interesting if you're a history buff, but expect the reading to feel more like you're in school again and have to read something for a paper coming up. It could have been more engaging. I wouldn't recommend it, but I did learn some interesting facts about the Irish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read...","review":"I enjoyed this book, especially the in depth history of the pre-Irish Celts.

I LOVE him and got this because it's the only audio book I can find with him narrating. Well, I can't focus on the information long, or even Lovely Liam's amazing voice, because it's very monotone. Very quiet. No inflection. Now, being Liam's most avid fan (and future love interest, I hope) I think he has gotten better and better with age. This is pretty old and I don't think he would read it so monotone now, if he even recorded it now. But since it's my only audio of him, I keep it in my car and enjoy him all the way around town. If anyone knows of another audio by him, let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save Civilization; A Very Interesting Book","review":"I read this book a little while back, and it was interesting and informative. I can't really think of any qualms about this volume, and feel that it is a good read but not necessarily the most comprehensive volume on the subject.

Anyway, best of reading to you, and enjoy every moment of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DailyKos trashes a scholarly work","review":"There are too many negative reviews of this book - one star means you are a revolutionary bolshevik re-writer of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful, Arcane, Misleading","review":"I'm Irish, I have a Ph.D. and this book is dreadful. Basically, this is a book about the classics of western literature, not a history book. That is, this is a book about literature which will be difficult to engage or enjoy for anybody not already well versed in the major works of the western cannon such as The Confessions of St. Augustine. Finally, so much time is spent on figures such as Saint Augustine of Hippo (North Africa) that one cannot even really say How the Irish Saved Civilization is a book about Ireland. Rather, this feels like a book by a classics professor who knows more than you do and wants to show it off. It's title is magnificent and was probably the major driver of sales. I suspect that few readers will make it to the end of this book, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BOOK","review":"This is a very BORING book. Only read it if you have to for class, and then only if you can't find enough quotes for your essay without reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and lacks Focus","review":"For a product who's title makes a claim for the product, this book did little to back the claim. Mostly I saw it as a biased catholic and Irish catholic survey of a brief period of history. I have not done as much reading in the area as others might have, but from what I do know about the so-called \\"Dark ages\\" is that it is the east that we should be thanking for the preservation of cultural documents from Roman and Hellenic times. My largest complaint is that the author includes several overly broad generalizations about both the Irish people and the continental peoples they came into contact with and the cultures of both groups of citizens. The author seems not to be a professional historian, and thus perhaps should not be held to such great rigor, but the grand claim really is not backed up in the text. On the plus side, the book is both short and the writer is a good storyteller, so even if you feel that time is wasted reading this book, not much time is wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cocktail History","review":"The role of Irish monks in preserving classical literary and historical texts was something of a historical secret outside of Ireland. No longer thanks to Cahill. Yet, the reader learns precious little about this important history. Instead, the reader must enudre the smarmy, look-how-clever-I-am ramblings of an author who fancies himself as a renaissance scholar--seamlessly melding history, religion, anthropology, sociology and literature. Cahill's book reads more like an alumni weekend lecture--designed to entertain more than inform and better received if the audience has been drinking. The subject deserves much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun encounter with history","review":"Although I minored in history in college, There's a bit of a mystery in my knowledge, I'm not expert enough to know the actual and factual, from the exaggerated of just plain \\"agitated,\\" Nevertheless I enjoyed Cahill's book, And the whimsical roads (far from Rome)it took, The protesters, me thinks, are overzealous, Of the Irish they're probably just jealous."},{"rating":"1","title":"History this is not","review":"Unfortunately for the average reader this book reads like a history book but equally unfortunately it is not. It is everything that people say it is in the way of being an entertaining read, an interesting read etc. etc. but Cahill knows very little about his source material. As someone else pointed out his descriptions of pre-Christian Ireland are not accurate. His opinions are based on pro-Christian texts written in later times to denigrate the pagan Irish. The information he gives on St. Patrick is based on later myth and not historical texts of which there are very little dating from fifth century Ireland. As a history teacher I do not recommend this book to students expect as a form of fiction. It should not be read too closely and serious readers who really want to learn about this time in Ireland should go elsewhere for more accurate knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial knowlege of the literature and the time","review":"Mr. Cahill's book is very superficial. He does not deal with the real questions and complexities concerning Ireland in this time period. Instead he presents us with vague representations of Augustinian thought, or misrepresentations, and baseless conjectures. His reading of early Irish literature is specious, and shows no real acquaintance with the subject. It is typical that a book like this could become such a bestseller. It tells readers what they want, and requires no real intelligenmce or understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad history, bad English","review":"The author overextends himself in his desire to write elegant English, attempting an elegance of which he is incapable. His ignorance extends to basics (he confuses \`imply' and \`infer'). His Latin is equally faulty (his mistranslation of \`molesta'). His interpretation of history is equally faulty ('St Augustine is the father of the Inquisition'). The title of the book deserves better treatment than this pseudo-scholarship. Be advised also that the first 67 pages of this short book have nothing to do with Ireland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable","review":"If you already know that the Irish \\"saved civilization\\" through its monastic tradition, you are probably not going to learn much more through this book. Instead of telling us what is actually going on during the period, the author spends WAY too much time quoting select passages of from ancient Irish literature and then making generalizations about the Irish character from those passages. I could probably read the same books and pull passages that support the oppostite conclusions. The fact that the Irish literature from that period only represents a tiny fraction of the population makes this exercise all the more pointless. I could not find a mention of a single saved work of literature can be directly attributed to the Irish"},{"rating":"1","title":"How the Irish Saved Civilization","review":"I am glad to see that there were others who actually found the book entertaining. My father gave me the book for Christmas and, since I am part Scotch-Irish and visited Ireland with my father, the title looked inviting. However, Thomas Cahill wandered all over the place with this book. Another review that said 40 pages crammed in to 240 pages (or something like that) is probably the best description. If I wasn't so determined, I would have quit reading this book after 48 pages (which I almost did). I don't think I will be picking anything up by Thomas Cahill in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppily done in every way","review":"This is one of the worst books I ever read. It is inaccurate, poorly documented, racist, and calculated to appeal to ethnic pride alone. He even compares \\"hordes of unwashed barbarians\\" to Mexican immigrants! He denies to give many sources, saying they are all in his head \\"like radiation from the big bang.\\" He compares Confucius' lack of personalization to \\"a Chinese fortune cookie.\\" He says without the Irish we would have \\"a world without books\\"! This book does a disservice to the Irish, whose contribution to Western culture is considerable, by its exaggerations, sloppy documentation, condescension and outrageous statements. This is not a history. He mixes legend and fact and opinion, without making clear which is which. One star is too high a rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUICKSAND THESIS.","review":"Reviewers Spainiard and Ludicrous were 1000% right! Greek did not diappear on the continent. In the southern parts of Italy and Spain as well as much of the Balkans it was almost as widely spoken as Latin untill the 10th century. THIS FACT MAKES THIS BOOK A MERE FOOTNOTE. In fact Isidore of Seville had the largest library in western Europe untill the Arabs built theirs at Toledo in the 8th century. For Mr. Taylor 90% of all the Saints were NON-IRISH. Few people today worship them in Europe. Secondly, the alliance between the Roman church and the Franks built much of the Medieval world. The Irish had nothing to do with that. There is no EVIDENCE that they ever produced 1% as many books as the Italians, Jews, Greeks, Arabs, etc. That in itself should have dissuaded the publisher from printing this drek!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO FRANK McCOURT HERE.","review":"The only way this book would have had a drop of truth is if Italy, Greece, Persia, and the entire Middle East had sank into the sea! As others have painfully mentioned this non-scholarly book is filled with bigotry, lies, distortions, and selective amnesia! I saw the author on C-SPAN years ago, and like a politician he was evasive whenever his nutty claims were questioned. His book proved only that he can pad a demented thesis. He will never be as honest or as talented as Frank McCourt who wrote \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" But, I doubt even he could make the title convincing? I will never waste my time on anything TC writes again."},{"rating":"1","title":"truth?","review":"Several of my peers repeatedly told me that I should read this book. I've already done some considerable study in Irish literature in my graduate work, so I thought it was about time that I got around to reading this best-seller. Cayhill is a clever word-smith. However, I was sorely disappointed in the book. As a scholar, Cayhill is irresponsible and sloppy. He includes many details -- such as his description of a river running through Jerusalem in Jesus' time (Jerusalem doesn't have a river, only a spring) and his account of the Morrigan -- which are either inaccurate or misleading. His condescending tone and attitudes toward other ethnic groups, namely the Chinese and Mexicans, are also troubling. All of these problems lead me to distrust all his scholarship and writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Rubbish.","review":"The last reviwer is a bit daft.

The author is CLEARLY appealing to ethnic sentiment over \\"EVIDENCE AND FACTS.\\" I suggest readers read the dozen or so \\"Most Helpful Reviews.\\" Those reviewers were very in depth and know their SUBJECT."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Cahill rewrites history","review":"Cahill is rewriting history to appeal to the Irish American public. His thesis has no supporting facts and he ignores hard evidence of civilization in Europe. For example, Cahill says that theIrish saved civilization through the monastic work of copping books. However, there were monasteries in Gaul and scattered throughout the Germanic Tribal wilderness who were also copying books at the same time as the Irish. Cahill also states that with the fall of Rome, civilization lost the ability to \\"think, read and build.\\" He again ignores buildings like the Haga Sophia, and men like Charlemagne who built his palace in Aachen and brought back classically humanism. In short, Cahill is rewriting history to sell books to people of Irish descent who want to hear good things about their ancestors. His thesis holds no water and is laughable to anyone who knows the actual history of that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Second The Boycott!","review":"This is the most bigoted and shallow history I have read since graduate WW2 history class of Nazi Germany. The author revels in bashing anyone who is not Irish. I have news for him 99.9% of the world isn't! He barely spent 70 pgs, trying to convince the reader of his PREPOSTEROUS Thesis! He does not prove anything, nor does he answer any critical questions. Where was the bibliography and footnotes? I feel the neg. rev's were to kind. How can a publisher print such a hate filled book?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Like many of Thomas Cahill's books the author spends the first few chapters on background history (which can be a slow read for some - myself included), but once he sets up the time and place it is a smooth enjoyable ride that leaves you inspired and enriched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Very enjoyable.","review":"A fine example showing that history need not be dry and boring; this book was truly a delight. Starting with the end of the Roman Empire, it is a book about the transition from the Classical to the Medieval, the bringing of Roman-influences (read: religion and literacy) to Ireland, and the subsequent use of those newfound passions by the Irish to preserve the great works of the West from the general chaos following the fall of Rome. I'm not a specialist in this time period -- my historical interest generally ends sometime in the late Roman Empire, then picks up again around the Peace of Westphalia -- but this book seems well-researched, despites its meager pagecount. It is not hard to see why this book is a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Better Title: How Irish Religion Saved Civilization","review":"This book consists of the following elements:20% - historical views of the Roman Empire, Antiquity, and of Ireland5% - book copying and physical preservation of culture75% - religious lectureThe first two items are of some interest, though the presentation is slipshod and disjointed. As for the third item, my conclusion is the author was disingenuous in his construction of the title. It seems to me to be a fine book for what it is. But religious oration and sermonizing so thouroughly pervades this book that it should carry a more accurate title, and should be sold in the \\"religion\\" section of the bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the Irish Saved Civilization","review":"The book showed how Irish monks preserved much of western culture during the dark ages.

This would have been a good resource back then. Mr. Cahill's writing is witty and fun. He references Kenneth Clark and Will Durante, both of whom I've read. This is far more fun. I am excited to finish this first in his series and move on to the next"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book In Context","review":"Interesting to read some of the comments about this book, some seem informed, some less so. People shouldn't need a reminder that all books on history should be read (and reviewed)in context. Cahill gives an interesting insight into a time of tremendous change in Europe and explores a little researched area, it's as if he takes a look at the small things that others over-look and pieces them together to help make the 'bigger' picture more clear. A lot of what Cahill writes is quite in line with other historical sources I've read. An interesting question for our less positive reviewers is, if the Irish monastic movement wasn't such an influene, then why are Irish saints revered all over Europe? Just a thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just great...","review":"Before reading this book I had heard from quite a few people that it was a great read. They were wrong; it was better than great! The description of St. Augustine and his later, unfortunate, influence on Western Christianity was spot on as was his juxtaposition of this influence with the (much more Orthodox) Christianity of St. Patrick and his Irish children. This book was an engaging, lively, and informative exploration of Celtic Christianity and its adherents who would later save civilization for Western Europe. I don't have any Irish in me, but by the end of this book I was certainly wishing I did! The only complaint I have is that I wish Cahill would have taken a closer look at the ties between the ancient Celtic Church and the Coptic Church, as I think (largely through the influence of Aziz S. Atiya's writing on the subject) that Coptic Christianity was a very significant influence on the Celtic Church. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the roots of the West."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun storytelling, bad research","review":"I enjoyed reading the book for it's stories and look at a stretch of history that I was completely unfamiliar with. But from the outset the author blatently showed that supporting his personal theories is more important than providing a balanced look at history. It does make one want to learn what really was going on though.Also, it may just be me, but the author's excitement about latin and greek seem kind of freakish modern literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"starts poorly, doesn't recover","review":"In the first two chapters, I kept wondering, \\"so where are the Irish?\\", as the author chatted about the Romans, the barbarians, and some Latin poetry, among other off-topic matters. The Irish finally appeared in the third chapter (after maybe a third of the audio book), with some nuggets of historical interest, such as the arrival of the Celts. Even so, the informal style again concentrated on extended excerpts from Irish tales of marginal interest. By the time St. Patrick joined the book, I'd lost interest and had enough.The narrator's presentation was sluggish and not especially appealing, which didn't help a book that certainly wasn't what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unaccomplished promise","review":"Despite the fact that the main thesis of this book is plainly on debate, one expects to read about HOW the Irish saved the civilization. Instead of that, we find a lot of BLA BLA. The book obtaines its title from its last 5%. Even if there is NO PRECISCE EXPLANATION about the content of the book. The question as follows: you cannot decide whether the thesis is false or true, simply because the book is about anything but the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Perspective","review":"Fills in some of the blanks on the development of western history as Rome fell. Wonderful book, one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the Irish saved civilization...","review":"An elegant synthesis of history, contemporary issues, and humor, brings the story of the role of Irish monks in saving the classic literature of Western civilization to life. Cahill's prose is precise, and his genuine affection for historic figures shines through. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very accurate account of early Ireland","review":"I agree with the reviewers who say that this is a pretty inaccurate account of early Ireland. It's not very scholarly at all and Cahill seems ignorant of archeological evidence on Irish origins. He also buys into all the myths surrounding St Patrick without much knowledge of the early Irish texts and the politics of the Irish monastic system.Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has some real facts but is biased","review":"I have done research into this topic and have found that Cahill did supply the reader with some real facts. Unfortunately, he also came from a biased christian standpoint. Cahill made the celtic pagan Irish seem that they were a lower level of people in thier religion and that they needed to be \\"saved\\" by the new religion of christianity. He also goes on to say that they desired this saving in their subconscious mind. Of course, there is no evidence to support this statement. For someone trying to get a pure historical factual based recount of Irish history, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but biased, perspective on Irish civilization","review":"Cahill writes an entertaining overview of Irish contributions to European culture. His style is often narrative and easy to read, but he only gives perfunctory attention to the facts. Also, he seems to have forgotten that Europe, including Ireland, got the great classic works from the Eastern Mediterranean civilizations. The occasional bigoted statements about different religious faiths are irrelevant and unfortunate. Cahill seems to be overly prejudiced to anything and everything Irish; the Romans are depicted negatively in pre-Christian Ireland, then the English Protestants are evil ones in a Catholicized Ireland.Overall, this book suffices as light reading, but is mediocre in its scholarship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Let me start by saying that I read this book with the intent to ridicule it. Since I am not born on the pristine Western Hemisphere, I find the title to be a preposterous claim at best. Obviously this book was written as a 'feel good book' for the Irish descendents in America. However, instead of a true portrayal of the valuable achievements of the Irish monks, the writer set off on a much worthier mission, lets save civilization itself. This book is written with, dare I say, a Euro-centric mindset. There is a lot of good material in this book that could have been better served had it not been dealt out by such extravagent claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous waste of time.","review":"I had high hopes for this book. I was sorely disappointed. The author kept going on and on with his theories about why the Roman Empire collapsed. Every time I thought he was about to get around to some IRISH history, he went back to Rome, or some other culture. I can understand setting the stage, but this was ridiculous. Halfway through, I gave up, skimmed the rest of the book, and decided it wasn't worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Try","review":"Mr. Cahill is an entertaining writer but he appears all too blatantly biased with his material. The Irish did not single handedly save civilization anymore than did Christianity destroy it, although it is largely the Christian bias that he suffers from. At the end of the book he says: \\"---if we are to be saved, it will not be by Romans but by saints.\\" If it were not for the Romans there would not have been any civilization for the Irish to save in the first place. Mr. Cahill as well treats his idea as though it were unknown before him, when any student of European history is quite well aware of the contributions of the monastery system of the British Isles in helping to reorganize the west. As Cahill is an Irish name I wonder that anyone should be surprised by his views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wholley Disappointing","review":"I love anything Irish and this book was enthusiastically recommended to me by a friend. Well, I wish I would have saved the $14.00 I paid for it at Barnes & Noble and bought it used at Amazon or eBay for $0.69 or something. I agree with A. Scanlon's review (although they obviously are more learned on the subject) - I keep thinking to myself as I'm reading, \\"Okay, can you get to the POINT, man?\\" Mr. Cahill keeps veering off into these long-winded asides and I haven't come across anything vaguely historical or comparable to other books I've read on the Irish \\"civilization.\\" It simply does not hold my interest. But, in all fairness, I should probably finish it, but I have a feeling it's going to be a real chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Laughing! What A Sham!","review":"The last reviewer was right. There is nothing good in this SLOP!!! Who does the author think he is? Does he think that Americans are MORONS?

Sadly, we are a decade too late. The 45 million Irish-Americans bought this junk by the truck load. My friend in the Hibernians asked my opinion of this book since his club members were asked to buy it{PROOF OF MY SUSPISCIONS}. To my surprise he agreed with me that it was bigoted sewage. The author took barely 30 pages mentioning the actual topic. He failed in every way, except in offending my \\"Spanish-Jewish roots!\\" I also just wrote a rev. for His Gifts Of The Jews. It was not as offensive as this, but the author is an amateurish hack. Skip both."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO DETAILS AND BIGOTRY!","review":"The negative reviewers are all correct, this is a horrid book. Where are the DETAILS? The author never answered several key questions. Where did the Irish get their books? How long did their handful of monasteries last? If their church was so pure and superior as the author claims. Why did all of the Europeans adopt the more organized ROMAN CHURCH? He also bashed Hispanics, Chinese, Germans, Mormons, and the very Greco-Roman Civilization that he wants the reader to believe was saved by a handful of monks.

The content could have usefully have been boiled down to 1 chapter. Why do Americans suspend their commonsense when someone raves on about the Irish? The reality is that the state of civilisation there was even more backward than the rest of Europe during all this time. Some of the old books and learning was preserved there but this was a few monks. Nothing mentioned about the real heroes of the dark ages regarding the subject of preserving the wisdom of the past - the Arabs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't history, it's PROPAGANDA.","review":"And BAD propaganda, to boot.A friend handed me this book, telling me how great it was. The title alone made me suspect heavily what it would really be about. I began reading it, just in case my first impression was wrong... and it WASN'T.The author states an awful lot of half-truths and distorted information - I think that he doesn't name sources just to cover his lies (sorry if it sounds harsh, but that's what I've been taught half-truths are). I've read propaganda books WAY better done than this one.I think that only two groups of people will fall for this book: 1) people who have NO general knowledge of the Middle Ages. 2) people whose nationalistic pride obscures their skepticism and/or reasoning (let me be clear on this: nationalistic pride is good, but not without a limit).In my opinion, this book is not worth the money it costs: as a history book, it's completely worthless; as a propaganda book, is mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"review","review":"Item said like new but the case was all sticky.

While it does what it promises to do, namely grind down your nails to shape them, it is magnificently uncomfortable. If you use it for even less than one second, even in that short amount of time, the grinder overheats and it gets extremely hot. Extremely. Because of the pausing you'll have to do, using this for your nails would take more time than to just use an emory board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuter than they look in the picture.","review":"I had a similar pair of shoes by the same brand and they were so sturdy and comfortable they totally cured my heel pain (if you have this, you know how horrible it can be).

They have a nice 2 inch platform heel to give me some height and are very comfortable.

It looks more like an arcade game.the game feels very rushed, like they were trying to get it out at the same time as EA sports.Commentary isn't bad, but I liked how it was before. Enforcer system is kind of cool.Game play is the same.One of my big problems is with the roster. (Yes you can download new ones.) But majority of the great players are free agents, which is cool since you can make your own teams, but it isn't accurate.

I tested it in the house on the home stereo. It worked great while the transmitter was <1 foot away from the FM antenna. At 2 feet there was noticeable static. Anything over 4 feet away was ALL static. When I returned it to the store the salesman said they had only been selling them for a week and had already gotten almost all of them back on returns for the same problem.Summary: Terrible product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as the other reviews make it sound","review":"When I first bought this item I was really scared because of all the bad reviews that it got on this site. I decided to get it anyway and let me just say it serves its purpose, works well in my car and on other radios, it looks great and matches the ipod really well. The two different modes work well and the dial on the side makes for easy station selecting which is a nice change from having to have to songs on your ipod. So if you are planning on buying and itrip for your ipod don't worry about these negative reviews it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio quality rivals AM radio - NO HIGHS","review":"This device is convenient and easy to use, but it rolls off the high frequencies, and therefore sounds very muffled, like bad AM radio. It transmits only a few inches, so it is absolutely worthless in any metropolitan area where there are radio stations everywhere. So, if you like your iPod to sound muffled with static, this is the device for you! I ended up buying a Belkin Tunecast II which sounds much better - it doesn't muffle the high frequencies. The Tunecast II does consume a pair of AAA batteries every week or so, but it sounds good -- and can transmit at least a foot or so, so that my FM radio can receive it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for car audio...","review":"I was hesistant to buy this after reading the negative reviews, but I had no choice in the end as my car cannot be fitted with a CD player (due to factory installed tape player which is tightly integrated into the GPS/LCD control system) and the cassette player spits out the cassette type adaptors. I must as I was absolutely thrilled with it, the sound quality was pretty good (as good as FM can get) and the ipod can be safely tucked away in the glove compartment. I initially had some problem with static when I drove into the CBD area, but once I found a 'clean' FM channel, it was awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly Good Quality","review":"Sure, it's over-priced, but so are most of Apple's toys. This nifty little device fits snugly into the bottom of your iPod and transmits to most non-music stations on your car radio, boat radio or home radio. There can be some static, so it takes a bit of moving around to find the perfect reception. Mine works fine in the glove compartment of my car or sitting on top of my home receiver. It sure beats having an adapter to deal with and you can carry it out of your car for safe keeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concept - Not the Greatest Reception","review":"the iTunes works for me, but I have to have it in a certain spot in my car in order to get the least amount of static. That spot just so happens to be the floorboard of my backseat. other than that, it works pretty much as expected. as long as you have some nice playlists and don't need to mess with it much, you'll be fine with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"MITO wins, NOT this one","review":"July 2006. After testing the Jwin, Griffen 30BK, Edge DiskGO, and the Kensington Pico, and the MITO, the MITO wins hands down. The JWIN is not plug and play and presented quite a bit of static, the Griffin could not muster the volume, as was the case with the Kensington, and the Edge was just a P.O.S., with no stereo transmission, and a battery door that would not close. My test was specifically for transmission to a Panasonic Boom box, used while on vacation. In both N.J. and N.C., the MITO performed well, with little static, and plenty of volume for those late night jam sessions after the kids and wives were asleep. Go with the MITO, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the reviews, but don't be afraid to give something a chance.","review":"Whoever said it depends on the car and the radio was right on the money. I tried a lot of different FM transmitters. All of witch plugged into the cars power and all of witch got pretty good ratings. Then I tried this on, that didn't get very goon ratings. I don't know if this will be of any help to anyone else but I found that most of the interference that I was getting was not overlapping radio stations, it was engine noise.Using a module that is completely separate from the cars electrical system made all the difference in the world.This deserves a second look and more that 2 stars. My advice is find a store with a good return policy (like Amazon) open the packages carefully and see what works for you. This one works perfect for me and my 98 Toyota with a sony after-market radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Choice","review":"Very disappointing product. Produces very poor quality music transmission even when placed in contract with the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful..","review":"It's a very nice way to listen to your Ipod in the car, but of course it's not very clear though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good device for in-city driving","review":"When this device works, your iPod sounds almost as good as a radio station coming through your stereo head in your car. An iTrip is great, if you are driving in one city where you know where the 'dead air' is and can pretty much leave your iTrip tuned to one or more channels.I'd also suggest you find the location in the car where the iPod works well and leave the iPod there. Moving the iPod around causes annoying static and feedback.If you're going on the road, you're going to spend a lot of time going through the channels to find dead channels to play your iPod through. Plus, high power lines and truckers interfere with your transmission. On a 200-mile trip, we had to change the channel for the iPod to play more than 5 times and there were some spots where the static was so bad, we couldn't get reception at all.Rebecca Kyle, September 2008"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had one for 2 years","review":"I had this trasmitter for 2 years. It outperformed my firends and families transmitters by being compact, no cords unless you want to charge it. The transmitting wire is on the outside which gives it a stronger signal even though it runs off the Ipods power. The only drawback is that....it runs off the Ipods power and drains it after a good day of driving, unless you plug it in to a mini USB port cigarette lighter power thingy which you can grab at radio shack. I had to buy another one because I pulled the wire out of it not realizing it was the transmitter cable......not my brightest moment. But just press play and within 4-5 feet of my radio I had crystal clear music with NO STATIC. I could pass it around my car without interruption and people could play what they liked. Excellent product, dont tear the transmitting wire out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RF Ipod Transmitter","review":"After receiving the transmitter, I unpacked it and read the instructions.

It works very well and wanted another one for our other car. The Kennsington model I had was discontinued, so I bought the Griffin. BIG MISTAKE. There is so much static with the Griffin FM transmitter, that it's not worth having and you are better off listening to the radio. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Very Well","review":"I first bought a Kensington Liquid FM, which retailed at $100. It sounded horrible - static at it's best, even on a fully clear frequency. If you didn't position it properly, you didn't get anything. It was supposed to scan for empty stations, but half the time it came up with frequencies with a full blown station on it. It had RDS, which barely worked at all. And finally, you can only use it in the car.I then bought this iTrip, and what a complete difference. When I turned it on the first time, I got powerful, clear music, no matter what position it was put in. It's very small and can be used inside the house to transmit to your radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely usable for podcasts","review":"The transmitter power is very weak. In an urban environment like the LA area, you are unlikely to find an empty frequency that works well. I positioned the ipod 2 feet away from the antenna and used mono which doubles the power.

Maybe can be used for playing podcasts but I would recommended trying another method."},{"rating":"1","title":"I-TRIP... i will make the trip back to the store.","review":"this is an awful product. i purchased it less than one hour ago and i'm going to return it. its very hard to find a station that will play well. on my home stereo it plays fair, but they have something for that already which is at least 20 dollars cheaper. do not buy this unless you live in an area with very few FM stations. yeah. then go ahead buy it. if you live in LA or any other highly populated area with a million radio stations skip it. those four star reviews.. perhaps u live in a desert. but for city folk... this is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"Very plain and simple, this product isn't worth its weight in dirt.

It is extemely low powered and in most cases I had to keep it in the cup holder so it was close enough to the radio. The audio quality is pretty bad as well, this may be due to the limited power but basically I had to turn your radio up to full volume for most songs encoded at 192.In addition, I had to plug it into the bottom of the ipod repeatedly to get it to work at all. This got worse over time. I believe the jack (male) part of the itrip was not designed to the correct tolerance and over time the connection to the ipod jack continued to fail.One last item, the only reason I went with this unit was because my car has the lighter mounted behind the steering wheel, so the cradle unit does not fit.

I tried it on my car stereo, my friend's car stereo, my home stereo, changed stations many times, changed the settings LX/DX again and again. No use. The sound quality is terrible.

I was unable to get even mediocre quality in my car, and I thought that perhaps I could still use it at home with a radio in lieu of using my mp3 cable. I was wrong.

I have previously owned VHS-C cameras that perfomed well. I needed the Nightshot feature for the investigations I do. The first time out, knowing general camera operation, I found this camera very easy to use. The flip out viewer is very sharp and the sound playback is good for instant review of videos. The compact size makes it easy to handle. I have yet to use all features, but I am confident that they will be satisfactory also. If you need a video feed to a computer, you'll need a capture device or get one of the digitals that have the USB/Firewire hookups.

Used a straight razor with this soap and it was pretty amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a cream","review":"this is essentially the exact same lather as the proraso shaving cream. even though the item claims to be a soap on amazon, it's actually a granny sort of cream--it even says so on the case. so if you have used proraso products and wish to pay less money, get this cream. it's very good. does have that tingling sensation which feels nice. i consider myself to have sensitive, but this was fine. i read another review talking about the subject, this is a quality product that gives you a nice rich creamy lather and protects very well the skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SAME! Read the Review DATES before purchasing!","review":"The old version of Omega was excellent and was exactly like Proraso! Unfortunately they changed it...again. It is now awful! I don't know what they are doing when they had a clear winner but unless I start seeing new reviews down the line stating that they are back to the old formulation I will be using Proraso. If you used this in the past and liked it and are expecting the same product you will be disappointed. Amazon should make the suppliers disclose that they changed the product so that they can inform their customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best shaving soap","review":"I've been shaving with GFT and Castle Forbes in the past. While I like the scents of GFT and Castle forbes better, this Omega shaving soap consistently gives me the closest and most comfortable shave of all the shaving creams I've ever tried, the ucalyptus and the aloe act as an aftershave, so if you like stream lined simplicity and not have to apply bottles of product on your fact, this is the way to go. I can't believe that it's only 8 bux for a 5 oz of this stuff, the label says 100 shaves, but I think you could use this every day for a year and not run out. Highly Highly recommend this shave soap to everyone, Already got two of my friends hooked on this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Proraso. Not very good.","review":"A lot of reviewers are claiming that this is the same as Proraso. It is not.This has a softer texture and color, and the smell reminds me more of Vicks VapoRub.It is however similar enough that if you like Proraso you will probably like this one too.UPDATE: After a few uses, this turns into a slimy goo, and it doesn't last very long either.Not a good value. Apparently this used to be the same as Proraso, but they changed the formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think that they changed their formula","review":"I settled on Omega as my favorite shaving cream about a year ago, but it appears that they either changed their formula in the past few months or perhaps I received a bad batch. Since they also changed their container shape over the same interval, I'm willing to bet it's a formula change.The new formula is very oily and has the consistency/look of sour cream. It doesn't hold on to the brush well and creates a very thin foam."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you get in the mail is not what's advertised here","review":"I ordered this soap in 2011, liked it and ordered again recently. What I got the second time is a completely different product. It's not a soap - more like a goo/paste. The list of ingredients is different from the original too. The only things that still match what's being advertised on amazon are the name and manufacturer.Be warned - stay away from Omega!"},{"rating":"1","title":"easy but not as comfortable","review":"I picked this up for my first experience using a safety razor thinking it'd be the easiest way to get going. It kind of is, but I hit two issues with it.First, it goes on cold. It's sitting in my bathroom in the basement and it's already a cream type substance so you don't add as much water to it. This causes it to really be a cold cream when it goes on more.Second, I had a hard time getting water into it to build up the wet part of the wet shave. I thought things were good, but then i tried out using a william's mug shaving soap and it went on so much better and felt a ton better.So this is pretty easy to get going, comes in a container, etc, but I don't think it's going to give you the best experience shaving you can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boyfriend says it's the best shave cream yet","review":"Although I expected this shave soap to be a little suppler and in a wooden bowl, it works great. Bf says it's the best shave he's ever had, no razor bumps and the aftermath is clear, smooth skin. Seems like it moisturizes as it is lathered, but either way a great shave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shaving Soap","review":"I ordered this to go with my new safety razor. I figured I could skip getting a shaving mug for now. Overall I like the soap a lot. It smells nice and I get a nice close and cool shave with it.

This feels like a nice step up in quality. The scent is nice, not too strong, just sort of \\"pleasantly clean\\" smelling. It lathers a little easier than the Conk's soaps, possibly because the soap is quite a bit softer, I think it loads onto the brush better. Once on the face, the lather holds up well, and keeps the razor sliding smoothly. As the lather is shaved off there's a tingly cooling effect that's very nice. Best of all, since switching to this I've noticed fewer cuts and less irritation. It's hard not to think of this as an excellent performer, especially when cost is factored in. I'll be getting more of this when I run out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shave","review":"I am very happy with my purchase of this soap.

I only started wet shaving this year, and my only products before this one were proraso, which maybe set too high a standard, but I needed to at least check into cheaper alternatives; This is the first of the possibilities I've tried out. I thought at first that I was having a batch of bad blades somehow, after some time, I realized 1/2 of my razor burn/irritation problems were my skin having a reation to this soap. While it felt fine going on, I started to get irritation feeling with each pass... thought that I maybe should rework it a little thicker & applied a little more. It was soon very clear that my skin was starting to burn from the soap... though I hadn't any reaction to it before starting to shave. I had to quickly rinse it off & slathering proraso soothed everything quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on newer operating systems, company does not care","review":"This does not work on newer operating systems such as Windows Vista. The company does not care.They do not help at all. They offer you a different title, but give no assistance in findingan appropriate title that might work with your operating system (basically, they've updated noneof their stuff it seems and do not care).

This international compilation gathers their ballad singles, bookended by the new tracks 'A Thing About You' and 'Breathe'. Save for the new songs, nothing here isn't anything we haven't heard before, though it is the first compilation go-round for the tracks from HAVE A NICE DAY and ROOM SERVICE. Nonetheless, this is still primo stuff, and any excuse to hear the incomparable Marie Fredrikksen sing anything new('Breathe' is a classic Roxette ballad that is a hit waiting to happen)is reason enough for purchase.

The author reveals how Washington rose from a poor Virginia surveyor who by luck, planning and social skills (Kitman refers to him as \\"The Minuet Man\\" at times) to become the only choice as the first president. Kitman's style is modern satire, but he scrupulously footnotes his sources, quotes the famed Washington biographers and overall certainly lends a air of truth and convictiion to his narrative, even if it will enflame all the True Belivers. His humor does get heavy handed at times and by the last third of the book the witicisms seem somewhat strained, but there's real history to be uncovered here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best digital camera ever purchased","review":"This is the 4th digital camera I've owned and it is by far my best investment ever compared to Sony Cybershots and Nikon brands.

It was small, easy to use, offered good features, and took great pictures, so I knew I'd be buying a new Canon. After reading the reviews and comparing what each camera had to offer, I chose the SD750, but I know that I would have been satisfied with any of them. After I got my new camera, I realized that it WAS exactly what I wanted it to be, and offered so much more than my old camera. Once I realized that it was the memory card that was the problem and not my old Canon, I was even more in love with this brand of camera. That old camera looks well loved, it's been dropped, scratched, dropped, dealt with rain and sand, dropped, and it still works without a problem.

Most often the pictures were blurry, unless taken of a still object (like a table), or the camera was on a tripod.I don't expect a point and shoot to match my digital SLR, but I also can't always use a tripod either. I would hold the camera totally still (even with arms stabilized and holding my breath), and take a photo of still people, and the picture was blurry. The camera would always display the \\"camera shake\\" icon, even when I was as still as possible.In the end, I had to return it. I purchased a Canon Powershot SD 1100 IS instead, and so far I love it and have very clear focused pictures, even of moving objects.I chose one star because good pictures are the most important thing about a camera. Just wanted to warn others. Clearly, many people love it so maybe I got a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied at all","review":"I was expecting more from this camera but fell short on my expectations. The outdoor colors are not the colors that you see. When you take a picture in the sunshine, it turns out grey rather than natural greeen. I played with the other colors too, but did not give me good results. So, anybody that are looking for this camera, you get good quality pictures inside but don't expect more when you are taking outdoor pictures, especically senries and landscapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"What a step up from my 4.1 Sony digital camera.

I am impressed with the quality of the photos under most conditions. It is light, fairly well designed (some controls could be better) and the screen is bright and vibrant.

It takes excellent 7MB pictures, has some neat features including face recognition, custom settings, good quality video including time lapse. It is small enough to forget its in your pocket, yet has a big 3\\" display for viewing/showing pictures immediately (lets face it, that's one of the great benefits of digital vs film). And the display has a scratch resistant face that is scratch-free so far (we don't use a carrying case).Battery life is surprisingly good for a small battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE","review":"It lasted me way less than a year. And I treated it like gold. It starts with the lens and goes to pot fast. And neither Amazon nor Canon back up their product. This thing will last about as long as a bad television program. Do yourself a favor, seek another camera, and deal with an outlet where you can talk to someone should things go belly-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Point & Shoot","review":"I bought this Christmas '07 and have been loving it ever since. The picture quality is crisp and clear, and I simply adore the features like face detection, color accent (let's you take creative shots by choosing the dominant color you like and making everything else black and white), macro mode (I felt like a professional, zooming in on various objects), and you can combine them to take pictures in macro mode plus color accent! I've never had experience with photography and this camera made me feel like a pro. I took off one star, because it still could not lessen the effects of camera shakes and whatnot (but that could have been just my pretty unstable hand!).The downside is I lost this camera a few weeks ago, and now just ordered another one! I love it so much I'm willing to shed another $150+ for it! Don't hesitate to buy this sleek, powerful camera!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute camera","review":"I liked this camera for it sleek design, it just slides into my jeans pocket.

The size and feel of the camera were great as were the menus and options. However, the performance left much to be desired as the pics taken during the 3 weeks I had the camera were poor. With picture quality being the most important factor when selecting a camera, I was disappointed to see the SD750 repeatedly blurring faces of people who were not the main subject of a photo as though the camera was unable to capture different depths in the same photo. I tried multiple settings without success and consulted my local Wolf Camera for options to improve performance, but had no success. I'm sticking with my Nikon 8700 which, despite its size, still takes great pics and has served me well for 3+ years.I'll give Amazon credit for an efficient and easy refund process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreaded Lens Error","review":"I had the camera for a year and a half.

I am going off to college this fall, and I wanted a good camera to easily take pictures to send to my family. I researched every camera I could find, and it always turned out that I preferred this camera. The LCD screen is awesome because it is so big, and it has lots of scene modes programmed in. The zoom is great, and the camera works fine without the image stabilization. I have taken several pictures of rapidly moving objects on the kids and pets setting, and they have all turned out crystal clear. The color accent setting is really cool too, especially when there is one bright thing in a frame, like a flower.

However, It wasn't until I took a few pictures when I found out what a horrible piece of junk it is. Pictures taken with this camera are SO BLURRY! No matter how much I played around with the settings, I could not get a single crisp shot. If you zoom into the pictures, you'll notice the blur around edges of all objects. I am so disappointed.

One of my favorite features is the lack of viewfinder; nobody uses it anyways and it makes the screen bigger without having the camera bigger. The camera is sleek and sexy, I'm always proud to have it out. People are always impressed. The auto setting is perfect; it almost always gets a good shot, but there are so many features it has, like: color accent where you can have only the color you choose be in color and all other color are grayscale. In manual mode the shutter speed and exposure can be changed which I think if very professional. The microphone quality isn't great, but the video is. You can take 60 frames per second video. I bought extra batteries for cheep on eBay which has cleared up any battery issues I would have. I just love it for its portability, ease, appearance and versatility.

It's a great camera. If you want an everyday camera that is nice and compact, takes great pictures and is easy to use then this should be it. One of the reviews mentions the delay between when you press the button and shutter but all the digital point and shoot cameras I have ever used have a delay. It's not an SLR so don't compare it to one.

The SD 750 fits the bill perfectly. For its compact dimensions, its buttons are not cluttered and it's actually quite easy to hold. It takes very good pictures in decently-lit situations. It's only when you want to take no-flash photos in low-light conditions that the sensor noise begins to be problem. But that I think is a problem with most non-SLR cameras. It hasn't got image stabilization but I think it's other benefits outweigh this one omission. I would highly recommend potential buyers to check it out in the flesh to see how compact it really is, and whether it fits what they have in mind. I for one, am totally digging it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, but then...","review":"I absolutely loved my camera at first, but then, like other reviews, I was cursed with the black screen of death. The camera was on, the lens was out, but the screen was completely black. When I attempted to take pictures despite the black screen, they didn't turn out. Nothing seemed to fix this problem. I do have the warranty, but again, you have to pay to have this repaired. The worst part about this is that the screen decided to go black while on my trip to NYC and I had to buy disposable cameras instead. Don't let this happen to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ease of use camera","review":"I was very happy with the ease of use of the Cannon SD750 camera.

I would highly recommend this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black spots on the lcd display","review":"I own this camera since about 2 years, but now I'm experiencing what seems to be a known issue with canon SD : Black spots on the lcd display (see [...]).It took great indoor pictures, above average outdoor pictures, I love the size but now this camera is useless as this black spot appears on pictures as well as on the LCD display or on VGA movies. Another weak point of this model is the battery life, after six month I couldn't get more than 80 pictures, now after 2 years, the battery can barely make 20 pictures, I guess I need spare battery. So in conclusion, I probably no longer choose a canon SD for my next digital point and shoo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, large LCD, just fair picture quality","review":"I was attracted to this camera because I have long been a Canon fan and have had several over that past 15 years, however I was disappointed in this purchase. I LOVE the large LCD screen on the back, and like the overall design of the camera. It's also very easy to use and the menus are easy to navigate. My main gripe is that the pictures are more often than not, very fuzzy and unclear. My previous Canon SD400 took tack sharp pictures in almost all situations, it was difficult to not take a good picture. With this camera, I am constantly getting out of focus, blurry shots. It seems very difficult to capture a really nice sharp photo. This is a huge problem in my opinion. I would not recommend this camera to anyone for this very reason. I have already given away my SD400 camera, wish I had it back now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!!","review":"I purchased this camera 8 months ago. Still images are almost always blurry. The zoom quit working after just 4 months. The pictures come out grainy appearing, all no matter the setting. The flash works very poorly, as well, and you must be very close to your subject to have any effect. Also, there is a delay when you take a picture, of up to 4 seconds, so if you need a quick shot, it won't happen. I would not recommend this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excited but then frustrated","review":"When I got my Canon SD750, I was so excited! I LOVED IT!!

The best surprise was that this camera has a macro mode for extreme closeups.The flash leaves something to be desired, but if you're using a built-in flash then you shouldn't expect great images anyway. Normally i use an SLR, but the ability to switch functions on this camera quickly may make it my primary choice.Also, there is no need to install the driver on your computer (although i suspect there may be something useful hidden on the disk amongst the bloatware).

So from there, we just looked over all the possibilities, and my daughter finally said, \\"If I were buying one today, this is the one I'd pick.\\" Good enough for me. It was medium priced, and had the big screen I wanted. He really likes it, has used it a few times, the kids have shown him how to put the pics on the computer.

The sync cable would sync the IPOD, but it would not charge it. It turns out that the 3rd generation IPODs could only charge through FireWire. The product is advertised as compatible with 3G, but that is only partially true. Since it only charges through FireWire, the cable syncs, but it will not charge, and the other two parts are worthless. The plastic it is made from also feels a little flimsy. If you have an IPOD 4G and up, and you don't mind a product that is probably not all that durable, then the price is good.

My main camera is a Nikon D70s but it is too big to travel easily. The Canon SD750 is a very compact camera. The camera does not come with a carrying case so I purchased the leather case which I think is a necessary addition. Video is somewhat grainy full screen except in the 640 mode (30 fps) which seems to be quite good and very watchable on a 20 inch computer monitor full screen. Still picture quality is excellent. Side by side pictures with my Nikon show comperable quality which is quite amazing for such a small package. The camera is easy to use. I purchased the 2 Gb Extreme card which I think is perfect for my use, especially with video. The 2 Gb card appears to give me about 15 minutes of video at the 640 resolution.

I've had a Nikon Coolpix 2000 and was hesitant about getting a different brand, only because I knew how to use the Nikon and was used to it's functions. But I am happy I got the Canon. It takes great pictures, very clear. Having a mini tripod that I can carry with me makes some of the pictures a lot more clear than they would be with out it. I wasn't sure if it was neccessary to spend the $50 extra for the larger screen, but I am really glad I did. I can't think of one thing I don't like about the camera.I read several reviews before I got it, and one thing I read a few times was that the pics were grainy. I think they can be if you don't use a tripod (like in B&W;) But I have only had great clear pics.

The auto-focus and flash both work well. My pictures come out clear and colorful. Even the video is not bad considering the format. The best part of the camera is the large view-screen. It's a thing of beauty. I don't know why Canon didn't continue this size of view-screen with later models. They offer bigger picture sizes (in this size, who needs more than 7 Mb?) and more controls. With this size camera, you don't want to be messing with too many settings. I'll take a larger screen over more buttons any day!

The story behind the story about Stallone writing the script and with nothing he refused thousands of dollars to sell it outright but rather stuck to his heart and dreams and negotiated to play the part himself was just as inspiring as the movie.

I pumped and stored into the VIA cups and although I am not using the Avent bottles, it was not that hard to pour the expressed milk into another bottle. I only have one piece of advice (the reason for four stars)...if you are a larger cup size, you may want to wet your breast with a washcloth first before you attach the pump.

I ended up using the medela pump in style double electric pump, which was extremely efficent, although i did have very sore nipples from it!

It has been really helpful and extremely efficient. At first breast feeding and pumping was very painful. So I rented the Medula from the hospital for the first month. The Medula (a $1,000 unit) is a great dual pump system that works more gently than my newborn or the Avent. It was nice to use the dual pump as I got used to breastfeeding. But once I got used to it, I didn't use the Medula at all and was using the Avent. The dual pump had A LOT of parts to clean (2 pumps) and was a bit tricky to manuveur holding 2 pumps at the same time. The Avent was very efficient in expressing milk, easily extracting 5oz. from a single breast in under 10 minutes. It is very important to have the pump assembled correctly (my husband still puts the valve plug in backwards no matter howmany times I show him) So it's easy to see why some women may have had problems.

Well now that i have that one and it didn't work as well as i had hoped, i went back and tryed this manual one from isis again. I guess i wasn't doing it right at first or maybe thought the harder the suction the more milk you will get and faster..which is apparently NOT how breast work. Now that i understand better how to do it, I can usually get about 3oz out in about 10 minutes (my baby is still a newborn). It's very easy to clean and assemble(read the instructions first!)

I called advent , they told me to boil the small parts in distilled water and several teaspoons of white vinegar. They also said not to wash with antibacterial dish detergent, that that and the breast milk leaves a residue on the parts that make them not stick as well. Not real convenient when I have two older sons to take care of as well.

I guess I just don't have the tolerence for 30 minutes of pain every few hours. With this manual pump you have to pump one side at a time.

Those are the only two reasons I gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!!!!","review":"Apparently this pump works for SOME people but it doesn't work for everyone- it cetainly didn't work for me.

The Ameda hand pump that they gave me at the hospital worked MUCH faster!After one use of the Isis pump, it lost suction, I re-read the manual and even replaced parts with the spares it came with, nothing!It is absolutely not a time-saver. I though that I would try it and see if it did work as fast as it claimed and if it didn't, I hadn't lost that much money and would then buy an electric pump. Well, it didn't work and I ended up buying an electric pump. Also, with the Isis, you can only pump one breast at a time and with an electric you can do both or only one.

I could not justify buying an electric pump because I was not going to use the pump everyday. So I told them to get me a manual. They bought the Avent Isis. It was horrible. I read and re-read the instructions. I could not get any milk out. Eventhough without a bra I was leaking. I could not get the suction right. When I got it to hold on to my breast I would pump it too hard and be in agony. I went to go see a lactation consultant to show me how to use it after blood came out of my nipples. She told me there is a definate art to using a manual pump and to try an electric one for occasional use. I bought a Medela Single and boy am I glad. It is so easy to use and it does the work for you. Don't waste your money, it is not worth the time or the pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older book but very helpful!","review":"I ordered another workbook on tables and graphs that was alot newer, but liked this one far better.

I have been a prog fan since the glory days of ELP, Yes, Camel, and Kansas. LEX REX ranks right up there with the best of them. It is a keyboard tour de force! The bass playing is excellent too. There are not any weak songs, unlike the other Glass Hammer CD's I have. In some places the vocals are only good, not excellent. The same is true of the drumming; in one very brief place it is irksome. If this CD had been recorded with a great prog drummer like Phil Ehart or Nick D'Virgilio, LEX REX would be prog classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Babb is the Tolkien of music!!","review":"I've always loved Glass Hammer, but from the moment I heard the first samples, I knew this one was going to be spectacular. Now I think spectacular is an understatement.The tale of a young Roman soldier and his epic quest to find true glory, Lex Rex has awed countless critics with its excellent lyrics and storyline, majestic complexity of sound, and brilliant vocal sections. Steve and Fred shine through with the best work ever; the result is breathtaking.If I could only listen to one CD for the next twenty years, this would be the one.I am such a huge Tolkien freak that I can speak elvish - keep this in mind when I repeat my bold claim: Steve Babb is the TOLKIEN of music!!! I can think of no higher praise. If you like progressive rock at all, or even if you don't, you will LOVE this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"i believe this band said... lets make the most annoying sounds possible for over an hour. they have fully completed there mission. best thing is the cover art work.in the recycle trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retro Christian rock","review":"I expected to enjoy this album, after reading all the positive reviews, but after 4 listens I still can't find much to like about it. While some of the compositional complexity is interesting, the melodies are not memorable. The music seems somewhat derivative of early Yes and Genesis (which I'm a fan of), but not excecuted nearly as well. The female vocals are decent, but male vocals are weak. I didn't care for the sound of the keyboards or guitar; some bits in \\"Further Up and Further In\\" are annoyingly mosquito-like. The lyrics and story are not compelling, though perhaps a little above average for a Christian rock record (of which this is one). The goofy spoken voice tracks (1, 5, and 10) ruin the mood and are just plain embarrassing to listen to. Worth a full point off the score - I would never listen to this album in public! Though I didn't enjoy it, Lex Rex may be worth checking out if you're into retro keyboard-driven Christian rock - and are not easily embarassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never buy another Dell again!","review":"Wow! Sure wish I would have read these reviews on the Dell 964 printer. This is a piece of junk. What a waste of money.

I am a loyal Dell PC customer but the 964 is a piece of garbage compared to my 6 year old HP inkjet. It sucks on print quality and uses ink like crazy. It even uses the color ink when printing black and whites!My frustration today is that the gauges say there is 1/4 ink left and I still had to replace the cartridge because the photo has streaks!Buy and Canon or HP. Stay away from this one folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical bliss","review":"Many reviews have already summed up what is so great about this record, so I do not have much more to add. I just felt it was worth reviewing if only to give it yet another five star rating.When you buy this cd (not 'if' but 'WHEN' you buy it), kick back and relax and play this entire cd. You will be in musical heaven.I only have one more thing to add...\\"Your Hand in Mine\\" is possibly the most beautiful song ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Words cannot even begin to describe this cd. It's intense emotional impact is incredible. It's hopeful poetry in musical form, and the feeling you get makes you feel almost like you're on a natural high. This is seriously one of the greatest musical compositions I have ever heard. It has set the standard for me for the post-rock genre, and I have yet to hear anything quite like it. It moves you from extremely happy on the first two tracks to sort of a downer mood in the 3rd track and onto the emotionally powerful tracks 4 and 5. This cd is amazing and I more than highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their second best release","review":"The earth is not a cold dead place is a great post-rock album. I think 'Those who tell the truth shall die, those who tell the truth shall live forever' was a better album, and it is one of my top favorite albums of all time. I gave TEINACDP 5 stars because it is just a great album, I'm not comparing it with their former releases. This album is one that you can lay back with a nice pair of headphones and listen to on repeat for hours, and never get sick of. I don't think this album's songs stood out as much as the songs on their prior release. First breath after coma does stand out the most, though. I just saw Explosions in the sky in concert a few days ago, they give quite a performance, and a very loud one at that. I highly recommend you see them if you have the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"This is by far the best of Explosions in the Sky. The deep post rock music is moving although there are no vocals. If you are looking for a post rock album, I hihgly recomment this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"...in My opinion","review":"I'm trying.. I'm trying, but I can't quite put it into words.You will read countless reviews that express how amazing this album is. Those reviews are sooo very true. But I, personally, feel that it can't be adequately stressed how genuinely great this music is. If you ask me to share my favorite track, I'll say \\"Earth is not a Cold Dead Place.\\"...all you can do is cringe at the emotions that the sound of this album evokes. Beginning to end, this album is literally flawless. Not because it's perfect...but because it transcends the term beautiful. Because from beginning to end, it is the amalgamation of so many things that make us human.\\"Pretentious\\". That is the term that I often see is attributed to this band...this album...and the genre of post-rock in itself. And that's fine......I would love to hear those making such unoriginally fallible critiques compose an album that could stand up to This."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-rock loveliness","review":"As good as Mogwai's latest album is, its subdued dynamics still make one long for the sonic terrorism present in their early work. For anyone who sympathizes (and has already grown tired of Godspeed You! Black Emperor), Explosions in the Sky are the perfect choice. Swirling between dramatic, ethereal post-rock soundscapes and intense ballasts of sound, The Earth Is Not a Cold Dead Place is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Incredible.","review":"This is the first album I purchased by who I now consider to be my favorite band. Each song builds off of the last one, until the entire cd reaches its climax with the song Your Hand in Mine, one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard. They have managed to avoid the cliches of the genre and make something completely orignal and beautiful. Overall, EitS is the most talented band out there today, and I'm just glad that I'm able to support them."},{"rating":"2","title":"seriously. its phenomenal.","review":"nothing else to say other than its powerful and awesome. each song stands alone so well on their own yet they come together to form a greater sum. like a megazord or something. word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explosions in the Sky is unforgettable","review":"I am a big fan of the so-called \\"post-rock/apocolyptic soundtrack\\" type of music (though I despise genre labels), and Explosions in the Sky is at the top of the heap for me. More intimate than Mogwai, more hopeful than GY!BE, these guys create some of the greatest soundscapes with the most minimal instrumentation. In addition, their live gigs are absolutely spellbinding. They are the best live show that I've seen this year, and the loudest band I've ever heard, bar none. If you are into uplifiting instrumental music with a bent on cinematic soundscapes, then this band is for you. I highly recommend every track, however, my favorites are \\"First Breath After Coma\\" and \\"Only Moment We Were Alone.\\" Great music to study to, relax with, and realize how good it is to be alive. Guaranteed it will put you in a good mood. Simply unforgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Formulaic","review":"I bought this based on all the positive recommendations here on Amazon. I think I need to re-evaluate whether those recommendations should be trusted. This album is very unsophisticated, constantly repeating the same soft-then-loud shtick, attempting to conjure emotion through repetition, and all the other pitfalls that have already been explored by Godspeed You Black Emperor and other post-rock ensembles.Would it kill any of these bands to take their music someplace besides catharsis-land?I kinda dig the slow parts, but the big, sweaty worked-up guitar-churning spots are embarrassing. I feel like taking the musicians aside and saying, \\"Hey, you're really spinning your wheels here. Try something else.\\" But they keep repeating the same mistakes throughout the album, slamming their heads against the wall with masturbatory glee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgot to include the vocals","review":"Godspeed You Black Emperor have completely lost their minds. They forgot to include the vocals on this entire album, and I know because I suffered through the whole thing!!! I will be asking for my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explosive cocktail of every emotion you ever felt","review":"The first thing that came to my mind when i saw these guys perform was, simply, \\"whoa!\\". I have never seen people play their music with the same intensity and vibe, and yet they manage to create this \\"soft\\" feeling. i immediatley ran off to the merchandise-stand after the show but Earth... had already sold out. no problem, i got to the local indie store the day after and got the album nevertheless (although it costed twice the price).now, this album has just the same atmosphere around it. it's plain beautiful and breathtaking, the way these five songs crawl their way into your bedroom. i'd even say Earth... is almost perfect. the only thing i'd change about it are the bass-drums, they could've been a little bit louder. but this is really just a sidemark, getting lost within the sheer amazingness (is this a word?) of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I had a soundtrack to my life, I would want these five tracks to be at the top of the playlist","review":"This entire album is amazing. So simple, yet so complex. These are not just songs; these are emotions in the form of music. There is no need for lyrics when you convey your message with such beautiful instrumentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bored","review":"I'm sorry, because I know I will offend people. But I bought this because I'm a huge fan of GYBE, Silver Mt Zion, Grails, etc etc... A fan of the genre. But this put me to sleep. Pretty, yes, but in a minimal way. It doesn't divert from its course once. Put it on and sit down to listen to it and you'll find yourself doing other things and hardly noticing when it finishes.I highly, highly recommend 'Those Who Tell The Truth Shall Die, Those Who Tell The Truth Shall Live Forever' instead. It's a perfect example of what Explosions in the Sky -can- do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative Punk Instrumental","review":"Fresh off of witnessing a mesmerizing performance by this band in Sacramento (in a venue packed so tight I never saw the faces of the band members), I come in awe of everything this band does to those who listen and hear.Explosions in the Sky (what an apt name to describe their lyricless poetry) is a band out of Texas, who manage to play music with passion and without pretensiousness. They are the quintessential band of Right Now, they are making a soundscape that makes sense out of things with pure sound, like another instrumental band Sigur Ros.Comparisons are useless, but I've read comparisons to Godspeed You Black Emporer, Mogwai, and I'd throw in a little Fugazi. The guitars move from spacy one note melodies to a dense friction, over driving rhythmic patterns that entrance, enchant, and soak the listener in sound.The look on peoples faces at this show were commonly wide open faces and bobbing heads. Explosions in the Sky are worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instrumental Bliss","review":"The first time I heard Explosions in the Sky came from watching the film Friday Night Lights. Instantly, I was turned on to the moving soundtrack. This album takes you on a wild ride of ups and downs. The climax always comes near the middle to end of each track. If you've never listened to their music, Explosions... isn't your typical indie band; this is best listened to when you're relaxing for bed, alone on a rainy day, or emotionally drained. Perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, poignant and viscerally moving","review":"This book was awesome to read, a real tour de force on the human emotion. Anyone who wants to get a good and accurate picture of the Asian-American experience, especially those of the early Chinese immigrants who came to this country should read this book. Leslie Chang does a phenomenal job in evoking the triumphs and tribulations of these Chinese women who fought to find their place in America, to succeed despite all obstacles and the struggle to raise their children with both the Chinese and American tradition, constantly wondering what the best combination should be. Leslie mentions \\"bamboo generation,\\" this description is very appropriate, and to find out what she means by this, read this book, b/c by its end, you will know what the term means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"A fascinating story of 3 generations of Chinese/Taiwanese women. Chen beautifully paints a contrast between the older generation and her young self on a personal journey to discover her roots.

Well-written, I never lost interest and stayed with it until I really had to put it aside to sleep. The Burke novels have a quality and a ambiance that his other books lack.

His writing is edgy, and hard.This book was a disappointment. I read 318 pages of junk to get to six pages of classic Andrew Vachss' prose. When the ending finally came, the one big question was never thoroughly answered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the Series","review":"I am a huge Vachss fan. I really enjoy the Burke series. Mr. Vachss has also had a terrific effect on child abuse and child pornography in this country.That being said, this is the weakest of all of the Burke novels. It gets extremely preachy. He also spends a lot of time reliving events from past Burke books. This may be due to the fact that he changed publishers, but I don't know. All-in-all, I felt this was an OK story but it bogged down in several places and we got lectures instead of action.Oh well, they can't all be great--only most of them.Let's hope \\"Terminal\\" is back up to his usual stratospheric heights of excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for our DeLonghi automatic espresso machine","review":"Our DeLonghi automatic espresso maker requires descaling about once a month to ensure that it works properly.

I followed the instructions in the manual for the espresso machine and used one full bottle. For me it takes about 30 minutes for the full cycle as it is automated. If you have a different coffee or espresso machine, follow the instructions on the machine itself as Drugol does not give specialized instructions for every machine. It comes with a little brochure describing how to use it, but nothing too specific. Make sure to avoid dripping the decalcifier on granite as it literally destroys it. It is a wonderful product, and I will continue using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expresso Decalcifier","review":"Durgol Swiss Espresso Special Decalcifier was purchased at a fair price. So far it has worked well in our Delongi machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product!","review":"I bought a package of 2 bottles of Durgol espresso machine decalcifier, followed directions in the instruction book exactly, running one bottle with 12 oz of water through my SAECO machine. Then I washed the water tank, refilled it with cold water to run it through the machine, and no water will come out, even though the machine is on and making the buzzing sound it does when making espresso. I think the decalcifier has ruined my espresso machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"..should've just used water and vinegar","review":"I bought this along with my espresso machine though all the water in my home is decalcified. I ended up just using water with a bit of vinegar to clean my machine. It seemed like a better alternative to this chemical.

I still like the idea of water and vinegar over this chemical."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Lattes for me","review":"I had owned my pump-driven Espresso machine for a year before I decided to try this product.I followed the instructions exactly as specified.

While Duragol works the best, the distilled vinegar works almost as good for fraction of the cost.Each cleaning uses the entire bottle, so the two pack is good for two cleaning cycles. For someone who makes an average of four shots daily, I have to clean twice per year so this two-packs lasts about a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not be simpler","review":"I know it is always hard to measure the impact of preventive maintenance, but that said, I feel confident that for a small $7/use investment, Durgol Swiss Espresso Decalcifier does the trick. I have used it regularly (roughly every 4 months) on my Delonghi automatic Espresso maker, and have never had a problem with the machine after four years of pretty heavy use (I use it to make half a dozen cups virtually every day). I have relatively hard water that tends to gunk up other appliances, but this decalcifier has protected my not-insignificant investment in an espresso machine. I also like that it comes pre-measured, so i don't have to mess around with it a lot. And as mentioned in other reviews, absolutely no remaining after-taste after treatment. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by Starbucks for Verismo system","review":"This is the recommended decalcifier for the new Verismo system.

City Boy under the production talents of now famous Mutt Lange, had some of the fullest sounds of that era. Great vocal harmonies, rockin' guitars, solid bass and drums, with wonderfully blended keyboard sounds.

I believe Stephen Jourdain to be truly enlightened ; this word seems so cheap sometimes and so many books claim to come from enlightened beings. What truly fascinated me is how personable and passionately alive SJ is. Great masters have explained that when you renounce (or lose) your individuality you truly find what makes you unique. This is what this book will reveal to you : the intensity of love, the delightful pleasure of living together with the knowledge and awareness. This book will make enlightenment closer to your heart I believe. And very funny too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I loved this book. I wish SJ would write another one. Call it...Radical Awakening II.Mr. Jourdain was born with his entire body/mind already wired to awaken. It was only a matter of time and it just so happened at the age of 16 for him. The book doesn't teach you how to awaken but you can surely get glimpes of \\"how to\\" for yourself just from just from reading it.I don't totally understand why Mr Jourdain smokes 3 packs of cigs a day, because it is sort of stupid to do so. They say that he is in excellent health, but from his picture on the back of the book, it sure doesn't look like he's in excellent health, i.e, his skin and all.A little difficult to read a first, but ever so interesting and enlightening!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovingly written commentary on modern romantic life","review":"Each of these three novellas is fascinating in itself; taken together they comprise a work of depth and resonance.

Do you try to give a new interpretation of the song or do you try to mimic the original?Unfortunately, most of these artists decided to give their own renditions which made the songs lose their integrity and originality.The artists on this album are, by no means, bad singers. They are all good singers who have been privileged to record songs made famous by the legendary Edith Piaf. However, Edith Piaf fans would not be keen ont hese versiosn of her songs.

There are many books that feature eighteenth century children, but I have read few that are based during the industrial revolution, when children worked in the factories. This book deals with the hardships, diseases, and problems of children whose parents \\"hire\\" them out for wages. My students really got to know Lyddie and her brother, and to understand what it was like for them.

Anyone who is looking for a great thing to watch should watch this show. The first episodes, the ones on this tape, are mostly for introductory purposed, but are very well done. Subtly interspersed winthin the quality work are little tidbits of history and culture, which, I think, adds to the appeal of the video.

The musical score is astonishingly inappropriate. But, until a better source comes along (soon, please!), this is the only option to see this spectacular late William S. Hart feature.

There are, unbelievably, no city or town introductions whatsoever (you have no way of deciding where to go, which is the whole point of having a travel guide).

I figured I'd give it away. But then I made the mistake of listening to the CD for the heck of it. What I found was an old jaded singer/songwriter who has a voice filled with character and songs that are actually interesting to hear.This album made me a fan of Zevon. I wish I had paid more attention to him years ago. Perhaps I wouldn't have lost all my faith in popular music.I just attended his concert tour for this album here in San Juan Capistrano. Zevon's performance of this new material w/the old reinforced the fact that he is a powerful, personable and intelligent performer. He introduced the song \\"Hostage-O\\" as \\"proof that I have not evolved musically or morally in the past 20 years.\\" What a great guy!Buy this album. It will restore your faith in sex, drugs and rock & roll...albeit with a 25-year-later perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the hardcore fan","review":"If you aren't a dyed in the wool Zevon fan... skip this CD.

I wasn't sure where he was going with the Mutineer and I sure am lost with this latest enterprise. I don't get the yodeling.

Nevertheless, being the WZ fan that I am I bought it and am still disappointed. The words in most of the songs are cheap, uncreative, and I believe I could have written them better. However, the music in a few songs such as I was in the House When the House Burned Down, Porcelain Monkey Back in the High Life Again is quite good. A few down sides to this are Porcelain Monkey sounds just like Seminole Bingo, Hostage-O sounds an awful lot like Mutineer and the best song on the CD, Back in the High Life Again, wasn't even written by WZ. If you are interested in WZ I would suggest his Anthology, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, or anything from his first CD, Wanted Dead or Alive to Sentimental Hygiene. Anything after these would probably be a waste of money. I'm sorry to say it, but WZ has gone down hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life'll Kill Ya With a Smile On Your Face!","review":"First I have to thank an old girlfriend, Laura, for introducing me to Old Velvet Nose! Since I first heard his music, Warren Zevon has managed to pull me into his alternate universe and I don't care to leave! This new album can hold it's own with EXCITABLE BOY. From the first song \\"I Was In The House...\\" I knew it was another great album! The \\"tribute\\" to Elvis \\"PorcelainMonkey\\" is absolutely the best! Mr. Zevon can really deliver a musical black eye with his lyrics! I suggest that Warren Zevon be named the father of alternative rock.

Although the car had 96'000 miles on it, I don't think it required that much rebuild. The problem started with some bad fuel, subsequent engine misfires and rough running. I blew it out on the highway and got it running right again but still had the check engine light to get rid of. The dealer got rid of the light, however it soon returned. That's when I purchased the 3100 Innova and have corrected two knock sensor warnings. The car has been running fault free for several weeks now and I am very well pleased with the instrument. There is a wealth of information about OBD2 engine diagnostics format and how it works in the manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product only 1 problem","review":"I love the product right out or the box.

Prior to purchasing the unit I replaced my breather filter. The vehicle had close to 20,000 miles on the original filter. This is what apparently flagged the check engine light during a hard acceleration up a steep grade.I received the product very quickly (sooner than expected). I read the booklet enough to use the product (very important as improper use may damage vehicle and/or reader). Code reader indicated what the problem \\"was\\" (I had already fixed the problem but was not sure without the code reader). I researched the error code on the internet and then cleared the check engine light. All went as advertised. Without this device I would have needed to make a trip to the dealership for nothing (of course with much expense). This device paid for itself in its first use. Great product. Easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equus 3100","review":"I've used it twice and it has already paid for itself. I have a car with what I would consider a manufacturers built in money making problem. Periodically the engine light comes on. The dealer says it is because the gas cap is left loose which compromises the emissions system and makes the engine light turn on. I think it is because they charge you 150.00 to turn it back off and with todays gas caps it's nearly impossible to leave one loose. I got tired of this and purchased this tool. I've used it twice to turn off the engine light for the same reason (very small emissions leak). Takes seconds to diagnose the problem and another second to turn the light off. The software provided is very helpful if you want to be prepared when you take the car to have it repaired. Lets you know what to expect. So if you own a Ford product as I do, or any other car this will work on, you can't do better than this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"OBD-II is a great tool!","review":"After much investigation, I chose to go with the model 3100 OBD-II.

He is a master craftsman at writing. Having other books of his, under his real name, I'm struck by his Civil War era stories like this work. They reveal a lyrical and poetic side of him that I'm surprised and impressed with.These Christmas tales are not intended for children, just like the bookflap said. In the flashbacks, there are enough hints of violence to leave the reader the knowledge that Christmas isn't the day to read this aloud to children. When they getter older and wiser, they'll appreciate what these stories mean.The four stories contained in this book are full of what Christmas is all about: forgiveness, love, charity, and faith. Family is all important and no matter what emotional baggage and hurts, slights, and grievances there are, for one day at least, all of that is put aside.I look forward to his next collection of Civil Christmas stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE waste of money!!","review":"I bought 2 packages of these before traveling from MI to NC for a family trip. I wanted to continue pumping for my twins and they seemed like a great idea since they stack nicely. On the way down I lost 3 pumpings worth of milk because the mini padded cooler they were in tilted to its side and all of the milk spilled (like loosing gold!)...Thinking MAYBE I didn't tighten the lids enough, I really cranked the next ones on...had to call 3 people before anybody could open them. That was no treat since I had 2 screaming babies waiting for bottles.These containers really are constructed poorly...they are sooo easy to cross thread and at least two of them leaked no matter what when I tipped them to the side...what kind of breast milk container leaks??

After using the ones that came with the pump a few times, i didn't like them. They are good in the fridge, but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing. I returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead. They were a little more expensive but well worth it. I love those and highly reccomend them. They also sell just the sealing disc, if you already have plenty of bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks!","review":"I love Avents bottles, nipples, and manual pump, but these storage containers are not something I will buy again!

My main reason is that the cups take up too much room in the freezer and take much longer to defrost/warm milk than the bags do. Also, the cups started to warp when I sterilized them for the first time (even though you're supposed to be able to use them three times before discarding), and the lids don't screw on once the cup is warped."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like bags too!!!","review":"They are messy when they opened.

The Avent Vias are great. They don't stack as well in the freezer as I would like but knowing my baby isn't getting BPA makes it worth it. The feature I like the best is being able to connect the adapter to the container, then an O-ring and nipple and be able to feed directly without having to transfer milk to a different container. This does make them difficult to transport, but that's what we use the Gerber bottles for and keep the Vias for home use. These are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible containers","review":"these are horrible, they don't pour well, and can only be used a couple times.

DO NOT BUY","review":"The tops do not fit the bottoms properly, so when you mix formula it leaks out everywhere and the milk gets caught between the top and bottom, making it suction closed and impossible to open. The force required to eventually open this results in more spillage/milk loss. Also, there is no grip or leverage feature, so cups and tops are slippery - again, hard to open. I SO regret buying these things and curse them everytime I have to use them (and then clean my kitchen floor, counter top, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poor design","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before buying the Avent pump, which is only compatible with Avent bottles. The lids really do not close properly and we've had milk leak out several times. When you pour in milk that is a little warmer, sometimes the lid won't even open.

I simply could not ride very far on this. Trying this for the recommended 3 weeks would ruin my hands. Felt 'stretched out'. I really wanted this to work,too. You might be able to solve this by using a smaller bike frame, or a handlebar stem that would bring the handlebars 2 or 3 inches closer to the seat.

I tries to adjust the seat, but nothing. It was very uncomfortable to ride with this, and i ride fixie so im always peddling. the design of the seat digs into the back of your leg and creates sharp pain in the area. i ended up taking the seat off and returning it. not worth the money. i would go for a traditional well padded seat than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small - Very Uncomfortable","review":"I'm a guy, 6' tall, 200 lbs, and this seat is way too small for me. I can't even use it. It was a complete waste of money. The seat is 8 inches wide by 3 inches deep with a little bump in the middle. The bump is not a problem. The fact that it is narrower than the two pressure points on my rear end makes it extremely uncomfortable.

I have tried many different saddles over the years but this one seems to work very well. It took me 5 rides to get used to the new way you need to balance and sit with this seat but this was no big issue.I highly recommend this seat as a comfortable \\"Save my Behind\\" seat for the avid rider.

It extended my riding time by only 10 minutes after which numbness set in, and the seat was very uncomfortable, so I returned it. I experimented with my original seat by slicing off padding from the horn, hoping that by approximating the shape of the Ergo, I would get the same result with more padding and wider dimensions. It was not successful. I tried my wife's big, wide and cushy cruising saddle but it has the same numbness issue. This Ergo product takes getting used to but eliminated the numbness.

And it really pushes me forward so that I am leaning heavily on my handlebars (which are raised to the maximum height). Padded gloves help, but it's not enough.Then again, I do have a variety of nerve problems in my body (but none observed before in the place on my rear where I get the pain with The Seat), so for most people it could be fine.I'm going to try another traditional style seat, with more padding than the skinny/hard one one that came with my bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best bicycle saddle on the market, cheeks down!","review":"Ordinary bike saddles inflict enough pain that I have to leave 2-3 recovery days in between rides.

It does feel like I'm leaning back against the seat rather than actually sitting on it, and that takes some getting used to, but the comfort level is divine.

In my humble opinion using boy sopranos, screeching trumpets, and conducting not for the music's sake but just to come close to sounding like the original performances are just bad taste. Other conductors have recorded much more moving and beautiful accounts of these works. The only good thing about this album is that there are not that many other concise Bach choruses collections out there. But even so, why did they leave out the most famous part of Wachet auf?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Bland Bland","review":"Unimaginative and uninspired.

Very good looking, good quality however it came with very low amount of filling material! I tried contacting the seller to ask them to send me more fill material but there is no way to contact them, they disabled this feature. The bean bag will need at least an additional half of the stuffed quantity to be usable. If you are the seller and you see this message then please send me at least an additional half refill material and I will delete this review.For customers: If you are seeing this review it means that the seller did not even try to contact me after addressing the issue.

The colors are great, and the adult size is a perfect size for young teenagers. The bean bag does come over stuffed, so you will probably need to take out some of the styrofoam balls to make it more comfortable. This makes it easier to sit in and have back and head support.

I have submitted a complaint and see what the company responds with.Best,*the company did respond promptly once I brought it to their attention, but unfortunately \\"out of stock\\" on the adult chair.

The USB driver is not compatible with Windows Vista or 7 OS. Sony has no updated dirvers to install to correct this. You cannot download movies to you PC. The USB Streaming feature does not work with the new OS. You will either have to add a Firewire, which will add to your cost. Or just connect to a DVD recorder to transfer. Also, the Memory Stick is not made any more and outdated. If you use the stick adaptor, it works 50% of the time. Don't go over 1GB. Recording with the Memory Stick only produces a jerky playback. Not useful for quality recording. Only use for low quality picture taking. You will not be happy. Sony Tech Support not much help on the issue. They couldn't help. Hope this helps.

I'm just now beginning to find some of the neat features of this camcorder, too!The reason I purchased this camcorder was because of the colored infrared nightshot, which works great! You can take pictures in pitch darkness. Although I must say recently I've noticed problems with the handycam's playback feature. It keeps switching to Hi8 mode when the video isn't taken with the Hi8 feature (this makes the LCD screen turn blue so you can't see the playback). I'll most likely buy another Sony with the color enhanced nightshot, but I think I'll switch to the DVD or harddrive version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely prone to breakdown","review":"I've owned this vidio camera since July '04.

There is no way to get rid of the music and special effects and just have the raw video as you made it. Its a perverted piece of software that leaves you stuck with someone else adding things to your videos that you don't want. Don't buy this camera, don't buy anything Sony.

The only word I can think of to describe it is trite. The characters are barely two-dimentional and the story doesn't make you care about any of them. Most of the plot is predictable, except for the \\"big secret\\" at the end.

I had trouble really feeling much for Dena, the lead character, at first I found her terribly 1 dimensional. THEN, I realized, that was the point... she is indeed just that, until she is able to uncover her own personal history. It was strange, and at times rather implausible, but as I said, I couldn't put it down. It was a little depressing at times, but I loved all the characters \\"back home\\" -- they kept me going."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book had the substance of cotton candy.","review":"Be warned that this book may be pretty and sweet, but contains little nourishment for the mind or soul.

Due to her stressful job and digging into the past to search for the mother who abandoned her, she is experiencing extreme stress-related illness. Her journey to the truth is oftentimes bittersweet, however what you learn about Dena's mother is heartrending and adds to the poignancy of the story.Ms. Flagg describes small-town living lovingly. With honest-to-goodness, kindly characters and laugh-out-loud dialogue.This book also touches on a very timely subject. Scandlemongering ... aka, digging up garbage on celebrities; an unfortunate reading past-time for certain groups of no-life-people!Fannie Flagg is one of my favorite authors. I'm waiting anxiously for her next novel.This book was well done and I can see it made into a movie. You'll love the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only her fourth best novel","review":"This story isn't as entertaining as \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\", or even \\"Redbird Christmas\\", but it is still worth reading. Fannie's characters are always simple--but loveable--and this one is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started with a bang and ended with a whimper","review":"Flagg's story-telling style, much like Garrison Keillor's rich tales of adventures in Lake Woebegone, capture the charm and humor of ordinary people and events. One of the warm memories of my baby boomer childhood was being allowed to sit up late, listening to the murmur of \\"elder generation\\" voices carrying on discussions much like those of Dena's charming Missouri relations. As in Fried Green Tomatoes, Flagg's moving back and forth in time was sometimes fun, sometimes poignant and overall a creative method for moving the story line along. The reading was enjoyable until Dena's \\"BIG (unbelievable) REVELATION.\\" From that point on a story that opened with spirit fizzled into a disappointing melodrama with saccharine caricatures. Try again, Fannie, and stay with it to the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why did we wait","review":"It took a long while for Flagg to come up with this but what was the thinking or doing about during the time we waited? This is superficial, contrived, poorly pieced and as poorly stitched together as writing can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved Fannie Flagg's other two books and was really looking forward to this one. It was as if someone else wrote this completely. The book was one dimensional and really not very interesting. I didn't believe any of the characters. The story could have been interesting if the characters would have been more believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Found all the characters somewhat unbelievable, and by the end of the book I really didn't care what happened to Dena.

Fried Green Tomatoes was a joy, this was a trial. I had to read it for my book club, otherwise would have dropped it half-way through. The characters were cardboard thin with none of the three-dimensional subtlety of those in her second or first novels. The jumping around of time, view-point, and locale was confusing and did not really improve the plot line. Waiting for Dena to come around and join the human race just got tiresome. I really didn't care whether she discovered her roots so when her tragic family background finally was revealed I found it hard to empathize with any of them. I really don't like it when an author I have enjoyed comes out with such a disappointing work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"This was my first Fannie Flagg book and I really enjoyed it. The story continually switches from the past to the present and I initially found it confusing but came to appreciate the way it was written. I really felt for the main character of Dena. In the beginning I thought she was a bit shallow and selfish with her life spiraling out of control but by the end I found myself cheering her on and appreciating her for what she went through. The book slowly weaves characters in and out of the story and you wonder how the pieces fit together but by the end of the book everything comes together like a tightly wrapped package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy People Make for a Good Story","review":"At first I thought that the book was going to be too slow for my liking. Was I ever wrong. I particularly liked dealing with psychiatry in a humorous manner while hitting home on the seriousness of the problems being dealt with.

It's not a mystery or thriller - this is a novel about one woman and her search for happiness, but Flagg interweaves so many elements that this book is a pleaser at many levels.While I initially coudln't like the heroine, Dena, very much, Flagg fleshes her out by going into her past and surrounding her with truly lovable characters who get you to see the sweet person Dena really is. All of the supporting characters are memorable, including the villains, whose lesser traits are explained through Flaggs' narrative. You don't love them, but you understand why they do what they do.Fannie Flagg is a great observer of human motivation, and has a fabulous sense of humour. Welcome to the World, Baby Girl is a novel you will enjoy and not be able to forget for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not rival Daisy Fay or Fried Green Tomatoes","review":"Having read her other two books, this one was a disappointment because I was expecting the same humor and wit. I struggled with the relevancy of all the flashbacks. Also, there is little mention of her love life in the first half of the book; even if she had no serious lover, she had the beauty and fit the age to at least warrant some installments discussing love, I think. Fannie, please bring back some of those great exclamations like \\"Rats foot!\\" And tell us once again of an other half falling into a vat of lacquer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book!!","review":"When I started reading the book I thought it was going to be about small town life,boy was I mistaken this book took me all over the place and across the years.I could not put the book down....It completely took me by surprise and I could not let go.The book touched me on so many levels I learned a lot about myself and how I see things,just by reading about Dena and Elmwood Springs. Read the book, it will stay with you. You will not be sorry Fannie Flagg is amazing..she can tell a story and give you surprise after surprise. This book is a mystery, a romance and hilarious....When it unravels..you will sit there and say wait...what just happened!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fannie Flagg has hit the mark again!","review":"The characters in Ms. Flaggs most recent story are as endearing as the ones introduced in her first two novels.

Hope someone in Hollywood makes a movie out of this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the World, Baby Girl is a funny, enjoyable book","review":"For the past few months, I have been dying to get my hands onto the book Welcome to the World, Baby Girl! by Fannie Flagg. Almost everyone in my seventh grade class raves about how well written it is. Everytime I went to our school library to see if it was available, it was always checked out. Once I got my hands on it and started to read, I was facinated, touched, and filled with laughter. This book is about a young woman's journey to stardom in the 1970's and how one event in teens changed the way she viewed life, religion, and love. Some parts in the book might bore you, but the majority of it is an extrodinary piece. Fannie Flagg is indeed a wonderful author. I also recommend her book Daisy Fay and the Miricle Man (also known as Coming Attractions), which I happened to like just a tad better.Laura"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fannie does it again!","review":"We loved all of Fannie's books.

The author of \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" keeps pleasing---and surprising us with her \\"down-home\\" humor and great insight into all sorts of different human beings. I expected this book to be mostly humorous, but it has a story within a story. I got to a point where I couldn't put it down. I've read almost everything Ms. Flagg has written. Here's hoping for a new book of hers to come out very soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Passes the time, but not a satisfying read","review":"I wasn't really expecting anything in particular, not having read Flagg's other books. Rosie O'Donnell said she laughed heartily at parts of the story, yet I can't recall anything that brought more than a half-smirk. At times I was reading just to pass the time and finish the story. The storyline was goofy and seemed disjointed, not to mention the sticky-sweet, disappointing ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming page-turner","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Yes, the ending was a bit sappy, and yes, the surprise was not as astounding as I was anticipating, but overall I found it charming, suspenseful, and couldn't put the book down until I finished it.I loved the charming town and inhabitants of Elmwood Springs, and got a good laugh out of the very realistic conversations among Norma, Macky and Aunt Elner. Dena was less loveable as a big city girl with ruthless ambition, but as I got farther into the book, I found her more and more human, and found more and more to like, just as she did. I also found Gerry's pursuits very humorous, yet bittersweet. The ending was sweet yet warm -- I closed the book with a smile on my face."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully told story, you laugh, you cry","review":"Fried Green Tomatoes was a favorite of mine and when I picked up Welcome to the World Baby Girl I expected another light but heartwarming story. Welcome to the World was heartwarming but it wasn't as light as Flagg's other books. This book involved more character development and a more sophisticated writing style. It was a wonderful read and a beautiful enchanting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprise","review":"I loved Fannie Flagg's other two novels, so I had to try this one too. The way all the seemingly unconnected people and events come together was great. And when we learn the truth about Dena's mother, it was quite surprising and heartbreaking. Flagg is a first-rate story-teller."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Fannie Flagg's Best Book","review":"I love Fannie Flagg, Lord knows I do, but this book was, well, it wasn't \\"Fried Green Tomato's\\" and that's what I was looking for. It is a tiring read that leaves you only remotely interested into what happens to the characters. I believe a lot of these characters could have been cut out. The reader might be frustrated because of the lack of explainations for events, especially when, at the end, everything is suppose to come together in a nut shell...but it doesn't. Seriously though, don't spend your time on this book unless you're a big Fannie Flagg fan, like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment, this is a dull book","review":"A big disappointment, this dull book is a messy hash of trite story lines leading to a particularly silly ending - don't waste your time on it, read something beautiful and nourishing instead.

I expected more from Ms. Flagg. This book read more like something that Danielle Steele would write."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I was disappointed in the ending of this book even though it was an unexpected ending. I won't give the ending away except to say that it was full of holes, like swiss cheese. There were inconsistencies and no explanations for actions not taken that should've been. If a person went missing from your life wouldn't you call the police? If you were in boarding school in your teens and the support for that boarding school disappeared, how would you continue? The mother had a history of attending to the daughter, then all of a sudden she didn't. I'm trying not to give the ending away but one reviewer said it was as though it was made up along the way and that seems to be true. The whole premise behind the moving from place to place didn't even make sense. Don't waste your time on this one. Read 467 pages of some other good book with a tighter story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesiness Personified!","review":"I loved \\"Fried...\\" and \\"Daisy...\\", and enjoyed parts of \\"Welcome...\\" However, my overall impression of the book was less than favorable. I thought it was too cheesy. The \\"good\\" characters were too good. The \\"bad\\" characters were too bad. Gerry, the nerdy doctor. Oh, God, totally one dimensional character. Wasn't likable in the very least. Loved Aunt Elner, though. I thought the mystery behind Dena's mother was so lame, I put the book down with 30 pages to go and didn't touch it for days because I was so disappointed with that revelation. There wasn't one word or action in this book that wasn't predictable. I could have written it myself word for word after reading only the first chapter. Except the end. I wouldn't subject ANYONE to that ending. I believe Flagg has an excellent grasp on small town America. She's a great storyteller when she's telling an original story. I've read this one a million times before by a million different authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farfetched plot, boring heroine","review":"I found this book a real disappointment. Flagg's forte is obviously describing small town life and the eccentric rural types who live there. But put her in New York, introduce an ice-blonde heroine with ice water in her veins....and the whole story goes sour? Who could care about the scattered and self-centered Dena? The plot was full of unbelievable twists and just plain silly asides. The estate of Tennessee Williams should sue Flagg for the way she writes that poor man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small town girl makes good in the big city.","review":"Dena Nordstrom is intelligent, charming, and gorgeous. She has an impressive career in news media but for whatever reason it just doesn't sit well with her stomach. Fannie Flagg has created a world of wonderful and endearing characters that you won't soon forget, in a little town that we would all be lucky to call home. Neighbor Dorothy was my particular favorite; with her daily radio station she tells us everything from the latest town gossip to how to clean a down pillow.There is a bit of love and mystery as Dena uncovers her past, which she seems to have conveniently forgotten. She has dreams of carousels and memories that just don't fit into place. The haunting question in her life is why did her mother leave her at the age of 14 and is she dead or alive?

And oh how happy and close the cute country folks are! None of the boredom and dysfunctions common to some small towns.

This book, however, was as empty as its main character, Dena. I could not understand the reactions of most of the people she encounters to this empty self-centered woman. Almost everyone in the book loved her, although even she did not know who she was. The book's \\"secret\\" was uninspired and some of the scenes meant to be funny seemed ludicrous. And that ending--Welcome to Hollywood, Baby Girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite","review":"I would classify this book as the best I've ever read.

The interesting fact is, I was initially glancing through another title \\"Talk to Win\\" by Lillian Glass on Amazon. A reader made a review indicating Glass' book is not as useful as Cooper's \\"Change Your Voice...\\". On May 30, 2000, the offended author, Glass, wrote a review arguing that her book covers many aspects of communications while Cooper's only covered voice. Thereby, hers is more well rounded. Very interestingly, when I glanced through this page for Cooper's book, I found that ON THE SAME DAY (i.e. May 30, 2000), there was an \\"anonymous\\" reader gave a one-star, lowest possible, on Cooper's book. The reviewer said that the book is boring and not useful; this is in sharp contrast to all the 5 stars for this title from other readers. I think the readers can make their own conclusion for this very interesting \\"coincidence\\"! However, I do feel that Cooper's books are worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Enough","review":"Not quite enough. Not enough pages. Not enough exercises. Not enough real models of good voices (The book does not include a CD as is truly necessary for this sort of thing) Not enough visual illustration. Not enough good science (What does it really mean to say 'the voice should emerge from the upper two-thirds of the air passageway leading to your mouth?\\")On the other hand, too much. Too much motivational schlock. Too much celebrity name dropping. Too much evidence of the hurriedness with which this book was put together.I hope the author will remake the book, include a CD, explain the science better, and get rid of the pages devoted to hyping voice training. The fact the reader has spent money makes that superfluous. Let's try again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, provocative and masterful guide to your voice.","review":"Jam-packed with powerful insights, Dr. Cooper teaches ambitious readers how to gain control of their voices and improve their chances of success. Recognizing the power of voice in the success equation, \\"Change Your Voice, Change Your Life\\" abundantly gives the \\"trade secrets\\" needed to transform ordinary voices into powerful megaphones of success. Rejecting the notion that voice is inborn and unchangeable, Dr. Cooper teaches interested readers the easy, straightforward steps to developing an influential voice. With extraordinary clarity, this book proves that voice is, in fact, one of the most overlooked but powerful ingredients of success. By following Dr. Cooper's lively, entertaining discussion, readers truly change their voices and indeed their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done and enjoyable in more than one sitting","review":"This is well played and recorded but I agree with the reviewer that described the programming as dull.

Well this is one such recording - and 2 minute doses are its optimum listening time.Brueggen plays wonderfully. He has total command of his instrument: vibrato, dynamics, flying through the vivace passages with nary a misplaced note. The accompaniment is also excellent.But the programming is just too much. This recording is DULL. After 20 minutes you'll be ready to move on (and I'm a recorder player). The (trio) sonatas definitely hold one's interest longer than the (solo) fantasias, with the continuo to break up the monotony of the recorder passages. My favorite is the Sonata in F Minor. But on the whole, Telemann can't maintain the listener's interest for long.Hence the title of this review. The recording is fairly cheap and on a multi-CD player it would fit in well with other Baroque works in a shuffle sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is not made for insurance claim form at all.","review":"Envelopes are too big for insurance claim forms.

They are small so it isn't a problem putting 4 of these in my oven. They came well seasoned, even more so than some of the pre-seasoned pots I've had. I pre-heated for 10-15 minutes, swabbed each ear imprint with a little butter and added the cornbread batter out of a sandwich bag with the corner cut off. I filled mine fairly full and it made them actually round when removed from the pan. Each ear on the large pan holds about 3T - 4T of batter. Cook 10-12 minutes.

It markedly shows that no one, not even the native participants knew what was happening on all parts of the battlefield that day. Each had his own perspective of the area immediatly around him and that changed from each individuals perspective. In the long run I would go with eyewitness accounts unless directly refuted with iron clad evidence. The author tried to present the native side as they experienced the battle.

Miller's claim to have interviewed oodles of Indian survivors of the Custer fight is bogus. Most of the factual Indian material in the book is freely lifted from interviews recorded by other people such as Stanley Vestal. Even the Indian \\"portraits\\" which Miller supposedly did from life appear to have been done from photographs. It is significant that Miller waited until the last Indian survivor had died in 1955 before publishing. Like his spiritual descendent, Dee Brown, Miller writes nonsense while leaning on the works of more reputable authors...His \\"original\\" material is sheer nonsense, like his contention that Custer committed suicide and that the powder burns were somehow \\"wiped away\\" by cover-up officers -- and that Custer's body was taken away on the Far West rather than buried on the field.

The author spends a great deal of time talking about death rates and such, fact of life we all die. If you are looking for a way to learn to deal and live with MVP this book is not it. It is informative on some levels, but like I said, very negative. I do have palpitations and panic attacks but I've found ways to deal with them.

It is simple to use and doesn't have alot of features that you don't need. The only problem we have is that the coffee basket will pop open on its own and doesn't seem to be that tight of a fit when clicked into place. This is a problem when the coffee is brewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fabulous","review":"Love it! We were replacing a 12-year old Braun coffee maker (which is still working!), so the Braun brand name was a plus for us. The coffee tastes better. We love the gold cone filter and were happy to be rid of the paper variety. The machine runs well without the Britta water filter in place, but we enjoy that feature and use it. We also like the programmable turn-on/shut-off feature and the coffee is REALLY hot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as used to be","review":"Save your money and buy a cheapee coffee maker instead. This makes coffee on par with the cheapest makers around. Braun used to make coffee makers that were the best on the market for brewing. You could set the brew strength and get a piping hot cup of excellent coffee. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee pot!","review":"Braun products are consistently superior and this coffee pot is no exception. Over the past two years, we've used this pot daily and like it so much that we bought a backup just in case this model goes out of style. A friend also bought this model after seeing the pot and tasting the coffee. It basically sells itself with it's compact style and really good coffee. Ive tried many high-end name brand coffee pots over the years but always return to Braun for their quality and value."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like it, BUT.","review":"Very nice coffee maker. Easy to program and set up. Coffee is flavorable and the warmer plate keeps the coffee hot. However, the quality of construction and/or design is an issue. The catch that holds the filter to the top doesn't hold the filter securely and the filter basket has detached while brewing coffee. This caused the filter to swing out from it's position while the hot water is dripping into the carafe. Cheap plastic parts do not fit properly is probably the cause of this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"best coffemaker ever","review":"easy to use,clean, with the perfect features- who needs to grind coffee before brewing anyway? very sharp looking, fits neatly under counter.

Why argue with success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give it 0 stars if I could!","review":"I bought this based on the rave reviews.It broke after 5 months.The coffee was very bland and the measuring is far from accurate!Its a piece of junk.I had my little Krups for 10 years, but had read bad reviews about the newer ones. I had bought a cuisinart GRind and Brew, but when I opened the box, I saw it was made of cheap plastic and the lid would not click in place (cheap plastic).So I searched the net, saw the reviews about this Braun coffee maker and bought it.You have to use MUCH more coffee than normal to get any flavor. 6 cups is ultimately only 2. Then of course now that it broke, well...3 strikes its out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hot coffee..","review":"No bells and whistles. Good coffee maker. Nice and hot. I like the filter. I don't like the level indicator. It's on the left side and hard to see. It would be better if it was in front like my Krupps Pro Aroma. Easy to clean. Pours nice, but not as nice as my Krupps. I will be using this till it breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Premature Death","review":"My trusty Black & Decker lasted 4-5 years. The Braun? It started off great, but keeled over after less than a year. Maybe the hard water killed it. After decalcifying it 4 times, using vinegar, and two different commercial cleaners/decalcifiers, it now works. But, it's taking up to 10 mins to brew roughly 2 cups of coffee. And, the coffee's no longer piping hot. It's kinda hot. I only used it once a day, so it's not as if it was overused.I could take it to a repair center since it's still under warranty. I really don't want to devote that much time to resurrect a coffee maker.I won't be buying another Braun product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead After 2 Years","review":"This was a good coffeemaker until it stopped working two years from the date purchase (surprise! Braun only provides one year warranties). I think for the price and for being a simple appliance, it should lasts longer than 2 years. I'm looking at comparable coffemakers with a three year warranty for my next purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Lasting, good coffee","review":"I just thought I'd take a minute to rate this coffee maker. I bought this in 2003, six years ago. I had been frustrated with coffee makers that limed up after about a year from living on well water and thought this might do the trick. Boy was I right. The key is using the filtersThis coffee maker is now 6 years old and still brewing a good cup of coffee. I run a coffee cleaner liquid through it about once a year (don't forget to take your filter when you clean it). It brews about 8-9 pots of coffee a week.Simple math says I've put about 2400 pots of coffee through this coffeemaker and it's still working just fine. I came back to Amazon to order some new filters and thought I'd see if the maker was still available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative experience","review":"Came with a defective filter basket (not from Amazon), which took over 2 months to be replaced. Leaks coffee over the side sometimes. Not as well made as my previous Braun which I liked very much. Filter cost is somewhat expensive. Looks nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Coffee Maker","review":"I have always loved Braun Coffee Makers because they are reasonably priced, not too large and make good coffee. The only complaint is that the coffee sometimes flows over the lid and causes the container to stick to the hotplate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A far cry from the Braun it replaced","review":"Our 8+ year old Braun wore out on us, and we purchased the KF590 to replace it, despite seeing some fairly negative comments on Amazon. The differences in quality and usability are huge! The only positive things I can say about the KF590 is that it makes a tasty cup of hot coffee, very quickly. Everything else that previous posters have stated is true, to the point that we've already replaced the Braun with a Cuisinart. If I could return it, I would.Specific flaws; 1) Incredibly noisy, 2) Filter basket doesn't always stay shut (and when it doesn't, it makes a mess), 3) Water condenses everywhere and spills onto the counter, 4) overall, the design and build quality are second-rate. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a year: UPDATE","review":"I contacted Brawn. Even though the warranty had just expired, they did honor it and fixed my coffee maker at no charge. Kudos to Braun.This is the first time I've written a product review. I've found them helpful so I want others to know what I've experienced with our Braun KF590E coffee maker. A week ago I would've given the product 4 or 5 stars. The only problem we had with it at that time was that we had to pour the coffee slowly or coffee would drip on the counter.Yesterday, 12 days after the warranty expired, our coffee maker went totally dead after making a pot of coffee. The authorized service centers are nowhere near and Braun customer service is closed for the weekend. I hope to get this problem resolved through Braun next week but doubt that I will be able to do so. I would've expected a coffee maker at this price to last more than a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffee Maker","review":"I spent a month reviewing different drip coffee makers and ordered this model from Amazon. Works great. I realised after reading dozens of reviews that the people who have over flow problems with their makers, regardless of models, are using fine coffee grounds. Doye!A drip maker needed coarse grounds, not super fine grounds, or else it will clog your drip valve and spill hot water all over your counter. I would recommend people to grind their own beans if possible, this will help with optimum freshness.So after 8 months of consistent use, here are my observations:The programmable feature is fabulous. The flavor is good and the water comes out nice and hot. There's the filter that I rinse and put right back. All the parts that you want to wash are removable, quickly and without any fuss. I'm thinking about getting a better flavor by using a paper filter in addition to the regular metal filter. I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun quality","review":"This is our 3rd Braun coffee maker. We purchased this one to match our new stainless appliances (no real reason to replace our current Braun which was in perfect working order!). This one contunues to make the best tasting coffee. A couple of minor things: sometimes the release button on the filter basket sticks, requiring an extra push, and I think they could have made the water level indicator easier to see (location). These are minor issues considering the main reason we bought this (3rd) Braun coffee maker is the TASTE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Great","review":"I so wanted to really like this coffee maker, but alas, that was not to be.Pros:The coffee is really HOTTimer and programmable automatic shut off are really niceLooks great on my counterCons:Coffee brews waaay too fast. If you are brewing just 1 or 2 cups, the coffee comes out weak. I use a paper filter and the included gold filter, which helps some. Bottomline, a slow brew feature would have been nice.Occasionally the basket doesn't swing open as it should. 9 times out of 10, it works fine. Every once in awhile you have to give it a nudge. Not a huge deal, but thought I'd mention it.I still give this 4 stars, because it does function well and nicely designed. If only it had a slow brew option, I'd give it 5 stars. I like my coffee really strong, so this might not be a problem for most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun KF590 Impressions Digital 10-cup programmable coffeemaker","review":"I like the coffee maker very much but when I recieved it the cover over the water resivor was broken with a note put on it saying that it came that way.

It's a very nice coffemaker considering it's relatively low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes great coffee - but fragile filter basket attachment","review":"This coffeemaker was on our wedding registry and I had researched a lot before choosing this one from a hundred reviews that I had read. My husband who is the real coffee-drinker of the house, loves it and says that I made an excellent choice. We don't use the water filter b/c we have filtered water. One thing to be careful with, though, is the filter basket because it can fly out and catch you off-guard. Our accident was bad enough that it landed on the floor and the little plastic 'latch' (for want of the correct term) that helps the basket snap into place broke right off. We had to order a replacement ($20) basket online - which was ok but we were disappointed about having broken a one-month old and, therefore, techincally brand-new, gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"While it worked....","review":"...it was great. However, this was the 2nd time I purchased this model, thinking the 1st was a fluke. (The first one lasted 3 years) After 14 months, I woke up today to a machine that was on, but the warmer was not warm and the coffee never started brewing. As this machine only has a 1 year warranty, there isn't much I can do about it other than warn others. A little disappointing from a company that normaly makes quality products.It goes without saying that there will not be a 3rd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longevity is lacking","review":"The buttons stopped working.

I stopped replacing the outrageously expensive filters about mid-way through it's life].I like this unit for it's overall quality, small footprint and noticably hotter coffee than the others I've tried.Actually paid less for the replacement than for the original [including shipping -which seemed a little high]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tasting coffee!!!!!","review":"The water filter makes a big difference.

Highly recommended!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun KF590E Coffeemaker","review":"The coffeemaker sends the water through so fast and hard that you end up with very weak coffee. When brewing a whole pot, it isn't as bad but, if you want 4 - 6 cups of coffee, it's too weak to drink. I tried adding more coffee but didn't make any difference - the coffee ends up all the way up the sides of the filter. I used it about 3 weeks and purchased a new Krups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks!","review":"We have owned this coffee maker for less than a year and it has started leaking coffee all over the counter every 3rd time we brew coffee. We can't quite tell where it is leaking from and why it doesn't do it consistently. Each time we cross our fingers and hope for the best. This has been so frustrating! We have run the filter and the cone piece in the dishwasher and maybe this has caused the problem?? We brew coffee twice/day usually and have been more disappointed with this machine than any we have owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Coffee","review":"This purchase was very disappointing. Although it's attractive, it is designed in a strange way in regard to the basket and how it attachs to the rest of the product. No instructions about this and putting it together was a real headscratcher for a klutz like me. Unfortunately, it turned out to make rather bad coffee as well. If I want a decent cup of coffee,I'm afraid I will be forced to buy a replacement for this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"braun kf590e","review":"Not at all satisfied.

I have used Braun's for years, but will try something else next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TISKET FOR THE BASKET","review":"Makes good coffee, usual problems with glass carafe, but the big problem is the basket mechanism.

Don't think I be buying another Braun product; I'm going back to Krups, which had lasted years and years."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing!","review":"When our old Braun coffee maker quit I was determined to get only another Braun as I had been so happy with my other one! THis is not true of the new one. The new one has a smaller pot which is a big deal when you brew 6-8 pots per day. The new style pot LEAKS!!!! One of the best features of the old machine was unlike Mr. Coffee it didn't leak all over the counter each time you poured a cup. Stock up on paper towels! The new and improved brew basket pops out of place on it's own often. Nice mess that makes. I bought the original Braun based on Amazon users review. At that time one of the biggest \\"features\\" was it actually kept hot coffee hot. The new one does not seem to do as good a job. And oddly it seems that it takes longer now to brew 10 cups then it did with the old one that brewed 12. I sure wish I had the old one back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and short","review":"The book was so boring that I am having more fun now than when I was reading it. If you like books titled \\"1001 jokes,\\" then you will probably like this book, but then you are also probably too young to have had a boyfriend.

And it had the desired effect. She giggled, then read it, and ended up telling me that it would certainly make it easier to appreciate me more when things weren't gold between us. The reason I've given the book 4 stars is two-fold; A- it's surprisingly short, and B- some of the boyfriends seem like people you'd never run into in the real world. But there's still a lot of good material here though, and it's got a great amount of laughs in its pages. You could easily find many, many worse $11 investments.

This is a suspense-filled romance that is Bowden at her best. The plot is unpredictable and the character development leaves the reader feeling they know all there is to know about each and every one the intriguing 'family' members. Though the ending bears some resemblance to several of Bowden's earlier books, the twists and turns set this novel apart. For those who are reading Bowden for the first time, House of Shadows will leave you racing to the bookstore (or Amazon!) to fetch earlier works by this super-talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Student Review","review":"As a student taking a first year University course in which this book is an assigned text, I have to say: there must be a textbook that is less boring than this one. In terms of facts, this book is great. Style-wise, it is enough to lull one to sleep. Best read in sections, carefully, closely, and with attention to detail so one doesn't have to read this book more than once, I would strongly suggest to any teacher or professor considering this as a text to supplement it with something that has a radically different style. Perhaps something with historical accounts intercut with the actual text rather than documents tacked on at the end. Just my opinion of course. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally a good overview","review":"Studying for my exams, this book gives a pretty good overview of the Cold War and the significant events that took place, all at a good pace. By moving chronologically and according to the different stages of the CW (as sectioned), it makes it easier to comprehend some of the periods where the tension increased all the way to the fall of the SU. Generally it was a good, informative read, and not to mention, entertaining at points- I found out that \\"the greatest disappointment for Khrushchev was that his ardent desire to visit Disneyland was frustrated- the Americans said they could not guarantee his safety\\".

I buy a lot of books in the general vein of beautiful old homes/camps/cottages/cabins in beautiful recreational areas such as Maine and other Coastal New England and like most of them. This one just wasn't good fodder for the fantasy of what it would be to own one of these houses. There were only a handful of interior photos in the whole book, and many/most of the exterior photos are small black and whites from old magazines from the area.

Based on naturopathic and homeopathic medicine, the main thrust is good health through prevention - for instance dietary change instead of steroids for canine skin disease. I have used Pitcairn's advice to good effect for decades. Perhaps the highest commendation is anecdotal: The main cat in my life was diagnosed with feline leukemia - this was in the early days of recognition of that scourge - when she was about seven years old. Three veterinarians separately recommended euthanasia as the disease is almost invariably terminal, and painful. (For those unfamiliar, it closely resembles human HIV/AIDS.)

The information for some specific conditions for our feline friends had homeopathic remedies listed, that in my opinion, should only be administered by a Veterinarian with experience in homeopathy and one who fully understands all of your pets health issues. I tried to look up info on Hyperthyroidism in Cats and both the prescription pharmaceutical and the holistic herbal remedies that I had hoped to find where not even mentioned, nor was any homeopathic treatment for cats for that condition.

Then, check out your area for a naturopathic vet. You will not be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Euthanasia is bad and Homeopathy is good?","review":"Are we in opposite land? They let a kitten suffer and die needlessly in their home, watching it waste away, rather than doing the right thing and ending its suffering. Their opinion was that it was better to let it die at home than in a strange place, but the description of the animal's final days and moments was horrible and made it obvious it wasn't enjoying life. (It died with its eyes and mouth open, not a very peaceful way to go.) This was the first part of the book I went to, because I had recently lost two pets (yes I euthanized them rather than let them a. waste away to nothing for no apparent reason, and b. starve to death with stomach cancer), and after reading just those two pages, I put the book down in disgust.Also, homeopathy has not been scientifically proven. I could never take a doctor seriously if the word so much as came out of their mouth.I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"What in the world is this vet's PhD in? Can't be nutrition or biochemistry or anything related or he would understand more about how excess grain affects the body- especially a carnivore's. Grain is links of sugar with some added roughage. Most of it is in the grass family. How often do you see a wolf or wild dog eat grass- other than to make themselves throw up? And the vet is a believer in homeopathy.

The dog's problem clears up and we're on to getting a forever home."},{"rating":"2","title":"great resource","review":"this is a great resource book. It has lots of background info on dog foods and so much info on great supplements. It could be made easier with breakdowns or charts to guide you for quicker reference, because I find myself having to flip back and forth a lot. There is definitely lots of info and it has to be read more than once. I think the recipes are sound and easy to make. Although I can't cook for my dogs all the time, at least I can do it whenever they are ill or recovering from some ailment or surgery to ensure that their bodies are strong when they need to heal. This book makes it manageable to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame...","review":"...that an obviously experienced and well researched vetrinarian would recommend a diet that includes grain as one of the staples of the diet. Anyone who does even a minor amount of research about the special diet needs of a dog would easily find that dogs do not possess the proper enzymes to break down grain properly and can lead to either minor or serious allergic reactions. Dogs should not eat any type of grain at any time. Anyone who reads this book, do not take it as gospel. Please do more in-depth research before you make any solid decisions on your dogs diet.Besides that fault, there are only a few recipies included in this rather long book.

Unfortunately, it IS extremely distracting and makes a mockery of what is supposed to be a bel canto role. Gruberova is more than capable of singing without doing it. Why she chose to do it for Lucia is beyond me, but it makes for a very tentative and unsatisfying performance, like a climax which never arrives.

Whereas a .20 BB will safely pounce of it's target, .11's will probably shatter if shot anywhere over 250 FPS (300 is the velocity of a good gun) which can be very dangerous.

Good points: very complete, with much information about each species of bird listed. Interesting video, text, sound, and pictures. Bad points: most important, this CD-ROM DOES NOT RUN under Windows 98 (although it works with Windows 95). It requires you to reset your display to 256 colors, with a corresponding lack of color depth in the included pictures - frustrating in this age of high powered graphics adapters.

I was attracted to this book initially solely by its title which reflects management situations with which managers in Third World countries - as elsewhere - are faced. Managing the absurd is nothing new to managers in Third World countries where the \\"big stick\\" and threats are often used as motivational tools. The marrying of traditional - in its cultural context - management \\"techniques\\" and the effective understanding of the Management Of The Absurd concepts can only but make better managers in countries which tend to be fiercely conventional in this regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd? I'll Give You Absurd!","review":"Management is a series of two to three page essays organized into eight sections. Each section deals with a different issue faced by organizations including communication, change, politics, technology, and leadership. While Management can easily be read from cover to cover, each essay is self-contained. Farson has designed the book so that the manager in need can turn to an essay and hopefully glean new insight into his particular problem. But if you're looking for enlightenment, save your money. Management is wholly unsatisfying, filled with platitudes. Farson talks about problems in management that most readers will easily be able to understand. In fact, most of the time, you'll find yourself wondering why Farson is stating the obvious. The most absurd thing about this book is the time you'll spend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farson gets it!","review":"Farson's \\"Management of the Absurd\\" addresses business from a perspective rarely represented -- that of a wise man who understands business because he understands people.Best example: Instead of viewing managing as akin to a sculptor molding clay into the desired form, Farson suggests that the very best a manager can hope for is to fall into a pile of clay and make an impression...In other words, Who you are is more important than what you do.Great advice for managers who substitute management techniques for integrity and character."},{"rating":"2","title":"read this","review":"it teaches you that you can have two things in complete opposite to each other and still believe both e.g a event thus can be a success and failure at the same time. it was recommended by david deangelo who i highly recommend. he has read thousands of books. he recommends reading dying well by ira byock and so do i. if you really wanna change your life learn to meditate. if you wanna wake up to the truth of the world research alex jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"If you are in a leadership/management position you need to read this book.

If you like this group, be sure to check out their other Christmas discs, in particular (in my view) \\"Noel Noel!\\", a disc of French seasonal music, and \\"Sing We Nol: Christmas Music from England and Early America\\", which is an older but still wonderful recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Christmas Music from Old Sources","review":"This album is a treasure chest of great American music that happens to be enveloped in the theme of Christmas and predates the 1880's.

I have yet to share this music with any of my relatives and friends who are not dazzled by its authenticity and its stark contrast to what we think of as \\"American Christmas Music\\". The few songs that are familiar (A Virgin Upspotted, Joy To the World) are performed in the manner of earlier American times, when Christmas was more private, more of a family and community celebration. I cannot imagine anyone who seriously collects Christmas music being without this CD. You only have to hear the reworking of the lyrics to \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\" into the 19th century standard, \\"Jesus, the Light of the World\\", to see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PERFECT BAX CYCLE","review":"If a case needed to be made for the symphonies of Arnold Bax, this set by Vernon Handley makes that case. Powerful, articulate, warm and spacious recordings. Vernon Handley makes the case for each symphony throughout this set with engaging performances that are thoroughly considered rather than just played. Handley is a real student of Bax and a fan of this music. The BBC is first rate as well and there is neither a badly played note or a single awkward passage in what are certainly not standard repertoire pieces. Anyone can produce a Beethoven series that is passable. To produce a series of the symphonies of Arnold Bax is quite another and especially one of this high caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy now","review":"Both the conductor and orchestra obviously had a good time making this recording. My exposure to Arnold Bax was among my earliest orchestral experiences and I am happy to have this complete set in my collection. Generally I prefer the Scottish National and Gibson (Lloyd Jones is also pretty strong), but Handley is certainly up to the task of sorting out the textures in Bax's thick scores and he achieves more than a measure of success. This is a fine purchase fiscally & aesthetically - get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent work by composer Norman Orenstien. This soundtrack is very effective in the RoboCop: Prime Directives movies, and perhaps is just as effective on its own. The highlights of the soundtrack are \\"Prime Directives Overture,\\" \\"Death of a Hero,\\" \\"Young Murphy,\\" and \\"Pursuit.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful 'music'","review":"How totally inappropriate is this music? Nothing like Poledouris' score or even Rosenman's RoboCop 2 score. In fact it's probably the most unthematic music I've ever heard. I cannot possibly think what kind of movie or mini-series this CD might fit. It's all over the place. And not even in an exciting way.Spanish trumpets, the kind you hear at bullfights, are used too often and of course such an instrument being used to announce the arrival of RoboCop is baffling. The rest of the score sounds like rejected music from the British 1980's TV series 'World in Action'. I'm not kidding, it's appalling. Stay away. Well away. Nothing at all like Poledouris' score at all or even the TV series score which used his theme to at least mediocre effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good case!","review":"I ordered this case to go with the Epiphone EJ-200CE I ordered at the same time.

He obviously felt the best way to \\"retaliate\\" against Christians was to publish rubbish that knocked their faith.The greatest glaring error in this book (and all his anti-Christian books) is the failure of the author to address the fate of the apostles, post-crucifixion. Why would 12 men (plus Paul) invite death upon themselves by advocating Jesus as the Messiah? Were all these men as crazy as Jesus? Common sense says no and the author has no explanation at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The concept exceeds the execution","review":"in this supernatural confection. Prose too purple for the rather sketchily developed plotline (for all the bloodshed and fake-Hispanic hoodoos, Raven's motivation ends up coming across as anticlimactic, since her viewpoint is no more fleshed out than are the sudden shifts of location necessitated by her curse).

My biggest beef is that the author really needs a firearms consultant. Numerous errors in this regard ruined the ending a bit for me. I can handle an author who thinks there are safeties on Glocks, but [SPOILER ALERT] guns that just go click instead of discharging for no reason, other than it's been sitting in a drawer for five years, and the hero expected that? I thought he was going to say he removed the firing pin, which would have been rude, but at least comprehensible.

Jack Reacher, hired by a top secret service field officer to \\"consult\\" and beef up the security afforded our vice-president, is given no ear piece with which to communicate with the other secret service agents he is ostensibly monitoring and spends over 90% of the book carrying around a ceramic knife rather than a gun. This leads to some really preposterous moments like when Jack, sensing someone is in a church belfry noisily climbs ladders pirate-like with his knife in his teeth and thinking thoughts of how surprised the bad guy's going to be when invincible Jack bursts through the trap door. Most of this book is concerned with letting us know that Jack is really a tough guy and his ex-military female side-kick is . . . my gosh, even TOUGHER. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a Great Reacher Novel","review":"I really enjoy Reacher novels for the character and action but the plots tend to be farcical and sometimes even ludicrous which spoils the fun.Finally, here, we have a Reacher novel that has a nice, tight, believable plot.Reacher is contacted by the head of the Secret Service's security detail for the Vice-President to conduct an audit of the VP's security because of an assassination threat and security breach.

What happened to the Jack Reacher who kicks butt and takes no prisoners beginning from page 1? Memo to Lee Child: People buy/read your novels for the thrills, kills, violence and mayhem - not for history lessons on the Vice Presidency (or should I say the Vice\\"-\\"Presidency?) Sadly, there is absolutely no Reacheresque action in this novel until the last few pages, and by that time, the reader is so bored by Child's endless didacticism on American history, the much awaited climax is....well...anticlimactic.

Jack Reacher is hired to find out if there is a risk on the vice president's life. At first Reacher is quiet about it and doesn't show up for awhile with his findings. Then it is difficult to figure out how the perpetrator is getting access to secure offices. Reacher gets help from a former officer in the militia.Later they figure out what is happening and need to protect the VP. Finally they figure it out but his brothers ex girlfriend is killed and Reacher wants to get even which is risky and puts himself in jeopardy. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No credible","review":"The notion that a civilian, no matter how qualified, would essentially take over the investigation into an assassination attempt on the Vice President of the United States is completely absurd.

I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great, Not Even That Good","review":"I love a good thriller, and when you add-in some government special forces type protagonists... You can usually count me as a fan. But i'm no fan of this book. It's dull. It lacks the sort of detail and authenticity that I expect in this genre. It moves slowly. It's more about Reachers love interests (is Froelich just using him to relive her lost relationship with his brother? Does Neagly have a thing for Reacher? Who cares, i say!) than catching the bad guys.The novel just plods. We hear about what they discuss over coffee and how many cups they drank. We see Reacher give commands to colleagues and decline to say why. Oooohhhh...Sorry, the suspense for ME in this book was my wondering if I could bear reading to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without Fail Succeeds","review":"I loved this book! I could not put it down.

As Lee Child novels go, I did not think it was one of the better Jack Reacher stories, but it is still a very good thriller.

It would be like me getting caught knocking over your mailbox when I was a kid and carrying a grudge for thirty years and then deciding to kill your kids for it.It's just that implausible.

With female Army friend, Neagley, they are drawn into prevent a plot against the Vice President.

One piece is so warped it's hard to fit it with the other ones at all, but as it's the corner piece we just lay it there and are done with it. Still, M & D puzzles are great for little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great puzzles","review":"I was very please with the color and brightness of the pictures, they will be a gift and I am anxious to watch my granddaughter play with them, she loves puzzles and animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be better","review":"Overall a great product but I wish it had an image of what the puzzle should look like on the puzzle board so that younger kids can have a guide.

If you're a Bruce fan and know his schtick--and you're fairly well-versed in Yiddish--pick up this set. If you're new to Bruce, don't start here. The sound quality varies wildly, Bruce's references are even more arcane than usual--well, this is for aficionados. Newcomers should pick up Bruce's classic (and cleanly produced) Fantasy albums, notably: The Sick Humor of Lenny Bruce, Togetherness, and American. Once you've absorbed these discs (with a copy of \\"Joys of Yiddish\\" nearby), then move to the Carnegie Hall Concert, and then...to this multidisc set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting adventure","review":"If you like truly wild places and adventures, this is the book to read. This book was one of those gems that you do not want to put down until you finish. The goal of kayaking the forbidden river hooked me. The stories used in the book about the history and culture of Tibet and the people, put the magnitude of the expedition in perfect focus. The story that the author, Wick Walker tells is one that will interest you and keep you in awe of the power and grandeur of nature and mans place in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than a Trek","review":"This story expands on the notion that an expedition does not necessarily revolve completely around kayaking on a dangerous river. Instead, it reveals that the arduous trek, diverse people, personal challenges, and team dynamics are what define an expedition. Overcoming that, the challenge of the Tsang Po presents itself as a reward.There's much to ponder about the challenges that contain the certain risk of death. Wick Walker's recount of this expedition helps us remember just what to consider."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you make a book about kayaking a remote, dangerous river dull?","review":"Answer: I'm not quite sure, but that's what they did. I suppose it's not too hard to imagine that the skills necessary to mount a whitewater kayaking expedition in Tibet are not the same ones necessary to tell the story interestingly. It's just a very dry and workmanlike account of the expedition without any of the vivid description necessary to bring the story to life for someone who is interested in the subject but isn't a kayaker and has never been to Tibet (like me, on both counts).I was expecting something more like \\"Into Thin Air\\" with kayaks, I suppose. A key difference here, of course, is that \\"Into Thin Air\\" was written by a writer.One benefit I did get from the book was some good references to some truly interesting history books on central Asia (like \\"The Great Game\\"), which I have read and enjoyed tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Never Developed","review":"I was disappointed with this book. The story line never really developed. It jumped around and I never got a good feel for the expedition. I like to kayak and was hoping for a more descriptive book.

Very few shots of the actual river itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me fart alot uncontrolably and crampy.","review":"I used up all these fenugreek caps, but from day 1 of taking them I was crampy and I honestly could not believe the uncontrolable gas I had.

I can't really say that I've seen any results. I've been trying to consistently breastfeed every time my newborn baby is hungry (every 2-4 hours), but he still is only getting a very little amount (not enough to avoid making a formula bottle). I was pretty dry, and it is sloooowly coming back, but I think it may be more the fact that I'm letting my baby sleep beside me and nurse. Anyway, I may have to review again, but for now, this was not an immediate helper, like some reviews led me to believe.

This makes the lamp a good deal for this particular type. I've found cheaper lamps for about $20, but the arm on those cheapos doesn't stay in its intended position and the knobs don't do anything. The build on this lamp appears to be of good quality. Almost all parts are made of steel or some other metal. I was going to purchase this off of amazon, but I found out that there is a Lamps Plus store near where I live so I went there in person to check it out. The arm on the display model worked rather well and so does the one I have now. The main downside I've seen so far is that you can only get this in white. One last thing is that the one I purchased included both the circular fluorescent and incadescent bulbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference and beginer's book","review":"I liked this book because it included a CD with Perl Scripts you can use immediately.

The book is a good resource of information for people who want to study and learn and troubleshoot and learn Perl, because it is possible to get the scripts to work if the troubleshooter does not give up until they get things to work satisfactorily. I believe that it is practically impossible for a person to use these scripts without having some experience with Perl and CGI and HTML. The book has a lot of good explanations of code, which I find helpful and useful. I can't blame anyone for selling the book in the way it is sold. Salesmen sell the book.

This is book for beginning programmers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent code, excellent support","review":"This book is just what I was looking for...the printed equivalent of someone sitting down with me and explaining how their CGI scripts work and going over each one line by line.

A short list would include 1/ using \\"use strict\\" and \\"-w\\" in all your scripts, 2/ using the standard CGI.pm module and 3/ using taint mode to ensure that and data you're reading from the outside world is what you expect it to be. This book contains none of those. When you add to that the fact that Matt Wright is well-known in the Perl community for being a very bad programmer you end up with a book that should be avoided at all costs.Sure, Matt and Craig explain what they know really well and beginners learn a lot from this book very quickly. But they don't know very much about Perl or CGI. What you'll learn will be full of bad code and misunderstandings about Perl. The worst part is thar Matt and Craig know very little about CGI security and running their scripts on your server leaves you open to a number of attacks from crackers.Please don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"I found most of the coding to be impractical and amateurish.

The book goes line by line to comment on those scripts, which themselves are not very inspiring.

Not only would the unit take me to 18 feet, then as I was continuing in the direction that it told me, it would flip and say 45 feet the other way, and continue doing this until I gave up the search.Which brings me to my next point. It does not update AT ALL with distance and direction. It doesn't matter how slow or fast you are going, it will not change. When it finally does, it is too late and you are well past where you should be. So you start tracking back, it same thing.The unit is junk and it is reflected in its price.

In an effort to change the way people view works of art, Ivan Gaskell - curator and lecturer at the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard - opens up a discussion of one 17th century painting by Vermeer, suggesting how art conveys complex ideas via purely visual, non-linguistic means. He also describes the interface between fine art and photographic reproductions, the relationship between art and museums and proposes that museums serve a therapeutic function."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"I'm a Turkish french horn student who lives in Cleveland.

However you don't save any money because all the parts cost more than most sippy cups. The real problem is that there are too many parts. Too much trouble to have to assemble and disassemble and make sure all the parts get washed and dried and not misplaced. There is the bottle itself, handles, screw cap, mouth piece, valve, and finally the cap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is useless","review":"The cup comes with a rubber valve (which is the \\"spill proof\\" mechanism). When the valve is on the cup, there's no way to suck the water out, which defeats the purpose of drinking anything from it. If you take the valve out, then the cup is not spill proof. My baby just turns it over and the water comes gushing out. This things is useless. We ended up buying another cup at Walmart that works wonderfully (totally spill proof no matter what my baby does and easy to suck as well), I just don't know the brand of it becuase it's not on the cup itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad venting","review":"The venting mechanism designed to relieve the negative pressure makes it impossible to draw any liquid out unless the cup is tipped back far enough so that the liquid inside completely covers the underside of the lid. So it works fine if the cup is really full. If anything less than 50% full, baby needs to tilt his head waaaaaay back, or else he will just suck air. Returned the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many parts and LEAKS LIKE CRAZY!","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. I have 4 of these for my 14-month old daughter and she loves them. They're easy to drink from but... THEY LEAK! They're fine when they're upright but once they lay on the side, they start to leak from where the air is supposed to vent. There's also too many parts so I might just have to try the Gerber brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"grows mold","review":"Problem is the insert that prevents the cup from leaking grows mold very easily! Make sure you clean it regularly to prevent growth or keep it in fridge when it's too warm out. Empty every day before bed and wash immediately. It is best to prevent mold from growing on it - because cleaning the insert is close to impossible - in my experience. I'd recommend \\"the Safe Sippy\\" instead, or \\"Clean Kanteen\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spill proof and sip proof, too","review":"I bought the 6m+ version of these sippy cups as my daughter has used Avent bottles with great success. My major problem with these cups is that they are so incredibly hard to get any liquid through that my daughter couldn't drink from them!We tried several times over the course of a couple months (she was 6 months when we started them) with no success. When I tried the cup to see if she was just giving up on it because it was new, *I* had a hard time getting the liquid out!So, while I think the rest of the cup is designed well, the handles are easy to grab, the bright colors catch her eye, I through the sippy lid to the back of the drawer. We now use the colored cup part more as an indicator that it does not contain milk, and have started using a Playtex sippy with great success.It's definitely spill proof, but unless your kid is a master of sucking, this very well could be sip-proof as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste","review":"unless your child drinks their cups laying down, which is highly not recommended, this cup is useless and frustrating. i tried for 6 months to make them work and they just don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I was so excited to buy these with our first daughter. I thought it was really neat how easy it was to transition from the Avent bottles to the sippy cups and it is really cool because the nipples from the bottles also fit the sippy cups but the trouble starts when you replace the nipples with the white sippy cup spout. LEAK, LEAK, LEAK.... I tried everything to get these cups not to leak. There is a plastic piece that fits on the inside that is suppose to keep the fluid from leaking out but it doesnt work well at all! Definitely cheaper brands out there that work much better. I finally just threw mine in the trash!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Negative Star! Love AVENT, baby HATES this spout","review":"I hate giving AVENT products low ratings, but this spout is just a poor design. It is very difficult for me to sip from with the regulator in it. Without it, the fluid flowed way too fast for a 6-month-old. My DS is now almost 9 months old and he screams when he sees the cup. We put it away, but forgot to tell grandchick not to use it. She poured a small amount of juice in it and brought I to my DS and he screamed so loud. My mom was scared and concerned because she had never heard him yell like that. I had a feeling she used the wrong cup. I came running out of the bedroom and sure enough, she was trying to use this sippy cup. Bad idea! We are using the NUBY sippy cup but are going to try to AVENT straw cup soon.Don't stress out your little one and avoid this sippy cup!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby would not drink from this cup!","review":"We have tried several different sippy cups and this was the only one that my little guy did not like. He wouldn't even drink from it. His favorite was the Nuby 3 Stage sippy cup which I highly recommend to rookie sippy cup drinkers!! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design dont be decieved by looks","review":"I bought this for my 7 month old as I liked avent pacis. Looking outside it looked like the best buy among all other brands as it had a lid and also measurements in oz and ml on the side both great features missing in other brands. But the problem with this is it is very tough for baby to get any liquid out. I spent more time trying to figure out if my baby was getting anything in his mouth at all. As another reviewer mentioned this cup is sip proof too!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valves make it hard","review":"I used Avent for everything else, but these cups aren't that great. I like that they have measurement marks on the sides, but my 8 month old had to practically turn the cup upside down to get anything out with the valve in. He's just learning the sippy cup, so this one is bad for beginners. I also found that the air flow hole at the top sometimes leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST SIPPY CUPS WE TRIED","review":"As you can see by someone posting that helpful picture of the cups leaking, these are not the best sippy cups. Due to a medical swallowing problem my 18 month old daughter has, we have purchased basically every cup on the market to try and find the right amount of flow. Flow was a non-issue for these cups because I never let her use them for more than a few sips. The cups leaked so bad out of the vent hole that she ended up with more milk on her face than in her mouth. In my opinion Playtex has been the best brand we have tried (especially their cups with straws rather than spouts). Will not buy Avent again."},{"rating":"2","title":".tetero","review":".buena calidad , lo que más gusta es la calidad , se lo recomendé a los amigos, es bueno el producto"},{"rating":"1","title":"5-stars till it started leaking","review":"I bought a two-pack of these cups and my son had a hard time sucking out of them till he was a little older (9+ months), but he got the hang of it and didn't have a problem. Unfortunately, one of the spouts has started leaking exactly where the reviewer \\"Kimiko\\"'s picture shows--on the rim of spout where it adjoins the plastic ring (into which the spout is inserted). The first couple times the leaking started, I opened the cup to make sure I had remembered to put the rubber disk on the bottom, and yes, both times it was there. I then tried different rubber disks but the leaking persisted, so I narrowed the problem down to the edge of the white spout itself. So far the other spout doesn't leak, so it's time to toss one and when the other goes I'll probably just recycle both cups rather than trying my luck with replacement spouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This trainer cups do not work very well. I love Avent products but these sippy cups require a lot of suction. My 8 month old cannot get anything out. I could barely get anything out when I tried.

Hard as I tried to confide in family and friends; and hard as I tried to explain, there was really no one who understood. Ms. Cronkite's book is the first I've read - and I've read many - that truly made me feel as if I was not alone in my world of depression. It is honest, sometimes more so than I really wanted to admit. But it is also tremendously comforting and, most of all, it inspires hope.

There is nothing here except Italian Recorder Sonatas. The only accompanyment you will hear is from a harpsicord. The great beauty of the recorder is front and center and you can appreciate its distinctive qualities which separate it from its more modern woodwinds such as the clarinet, the oboe, the bassoon and the English horn.The publisher, Teldec has not, like Hyperion, indulged in little samples, and I appreciate their staying on message.

After seeing the famed epic Braveheart, I noticed that the Bruce was displayed as a betrayer in one scene. As a movie, Braveheart was great, but it lacked the Bruce's importance in late thirteenth century Scotland. Starting with Bruce's birth in 1274 and ending with the death of his revered comrade, Sir William Douglas (The Black Douglas) in 1331. The most well written part was the explanation of Bannockburn in 1314, giving just the right amount of details. I reccomend this book for every history buff or Scotland enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert v. Edward I & II","review":"An interesting read, but you had better like history.

Just don't buy the DVD in hopes of getting much more than is on the VHS tape. The sound is bad, it has no subtitles for the hearing impaired ( I Had to sign the whole thing to my girlfriend who had never seen it) and the commentary is more about the director in his good old days of working with Walt Disney and other older projects.

The movie is refreshing, spicy and full of laughs. It also takes a few wonderful knocks at other movies like Star Wars, etc., which I found to be clever and witty. Oh for MORE like this one!

I was that certain age, and of the mentality, to truly appreciate what this movie has to offer.

I'm not sure that if you haven't seen it 15 years ago that you'd be able to watch it and enjoy it now. Only if you love the 80's I guess. I hope this movie comes out on DVD, even with bad quality sound it would still be worth it. It's got to be better than what my Dad taped off HBO on his 20 year old VCR.

You have to pay attention to get the meat of the songs, which is in the lyrics. His songs are rich in imagery, with very nice turns of phrase. Though none of the songs tell a 'story', there is a story, if not a life, behind each of them. Actually I think the songs are written for men in their 40s & 50s who are maybe starting to think differently about the world and their place in it - but don't get me wrong, my wife loves the CD too. The music is not especially catchy, and Henning's voice won't win any awards.

The music chosen for the movie was amazing and the artist who led the soundtrack was Mulatu Astatke. No, this isn't the soundtrack to broken flowers, but this is a good introduction into the very interesting ethiopian style jazz. Mulatu, who is considered the father of ethio-jazz, is enjoyable to any music lover. Whether the listener is into rock, jazz, jam, or rap. Mulatu is known for his energetic and calming music that is very easy to listen to. I recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"Inside the cheapest cover I've seen in ages is a CD of various Mulatu Astatke tracks, from his now well-known Ethio-groove classics (i.e. \\"Yekatit\\"), to obviously much more recent stuff. The latter is not exactly bad but the overall sound is not as convincing as that of his achievements of yore. However, one track at least, \\"Tsome Diguwa\\", gets close to reviving the old Mulatu sound, with good jazz-funk arrangements and good solos.This release is a problem in itself: there are no dates to be found, no identification of the musicians involved. The mixture of new and old seems throwaway, since this is neither presented as a new album nor as a compilation.This is not a condemnation of the music itself, which is generally worthwhile; but those who already know Mulatu will end with quite a few tracks they already know from somewhere else; and newcomers to his work will not find any clue here (the only date being 2006, while there are tracks from the early 1970s thrown in the middle)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite Latin American","review":"Although this is supposed to be for Latin America it does not serve its purpose for two reasons.

The only problem was putting in the sand which I opted for because you won't get the weight you need out of water. We knocked this out in about 45 min. with the help of a large homemade funnel and a lot of shaking as the sand goes in. The manufacturer should have made a better/ larger hole for putting sand in .

Plus, the backboard was warped and had a dent in it along the top. Unfortunately, I didn't notice this until I had it all assembled. Not sure if the damage was from shipping, but the problem is that the backboard is made of plexiglass in the first place.I bought this based on the reviews. I agree with another reviewer - go to a sporting goods store and try them out for yourself first before buying online. I probably should have sent it back, but it would have been too much of a pain to put it all back in the box again after I had it all assembled.

The lady was very nice on the phone, but now I have to package the thing back up and ship it back for a refund. Pain the you know what if you ask me.

What I found was that ALL the Lifetime backboards are basically junk as are many of it's competitors. I am still looking for a portable system with the firm backboard like my old one (Spalding) but have not found it yet.

Great for any fan.track listing:The Man from Russia,He's Shedding Skin ,Atomic Lullaby ,Aeroplane City Love Song ,Forbidden Fruit ,Waiting for Mr. Moonlight ,Wildflower ,I Nearly Died Laughing ,It's Not Unusual ,Animal Magic ,Professor Super Cool ,Limping for a Generation ,Sweet Murder ,Bang a Gong"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have gotten a Lobotomy","review":"I bought this CD after buying the Los Lobotomy's live DVD. I really like the DVD, but this CD is pretty lame. The playing is decent, but the song selection and performances don't do much for me. Plus, what's with the 38 second version of Purple Haze? was that a joke?, if it was I didn't get it. In my opinion the DVD and the CD \\"Candyman\\" are much better.

This is pure, unadulturated, fuzak. It's amazing how you can get this many Gold Medal musicians in one room, and get such \\"Honorable Mention\\" music. Luke, an amazing guitarist, a beast in fact; Will Lee, the world's most dangerous bassist; Jeff Porcaro, nothing needs to be said....and yet, this is just horrid, unlistenable flatulence, unless you're particularly predisposed to that type of sound. If you're into rock, forget it. If you're into Spyra Gyro (hold the sauce please), The Bumblebees (or Yellowjackets if you prefer), maybe, just MAYBE, this might be up your alley.

He knows his stuff, and his input is most likely helpful.2)Read your own History text book, and take notes out of it.3)Read the AP review in this book atleast twice (i read it five times, it's good for your memory)4)Absolutely take all the practice tests5)Sleep well before the test6)Believe in yourself (honestly, a big part of this test is psychological)**optional**a)Pray if you have some faithb)cheat...no jk, that is bad...tell yourself you can do it (over and over until you believe it)Good luck"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Review","review":"This book has a really great quick review of US history.

There are some factual mistakes and errors but this is not the biggest problem. The book comes across as a frankenstein of joined together marketing theories and application from many of Kotlers other works and there seems little new here. Additionally, many of the concepts discussed, such as the BCG matrix hardly seem applicable to most professionals, particularly those working on large multi million dollar tenders such as engineers and architects. Having taught marketing at post graduate level using Kotlers text books as the core text, this work becomes even more dissappointing as it seems that there is little evidence that the authors have a solid understanding of professional services marketing as it for the professionals who practice it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are only going to buy one book, this is the one.","review":"After reading about 4 other books on the same subject this will be the only one that I will keep.

Lastly, the added height you get out of this mount is great, I am an average height and find that the other mounts are not high enough to wash my hair, I end up lowering my head right below the spray, that is not a problem with this one.

As for its performance while it lasted... I liked the fact that it was so light the kids could use it by themselves, however, the water sprayed all over the place, and not where it was needed. If you turned down the power of the spray, the water barely trickled, if you turned it up - the force of it was so strong the shower curtain got pulled in and clung to you while you washed.The discomfort of the experience overall is making me buy a different item, even though it may spend more water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does what it says, but.....","review":"...if you have a tiled bathroom and it's cold, your legs and feet will FREEZE!

Makes a LOT of noise ( loud rushing air sound, really annoying) and does little or nothing for water pressure. Almost no control over the actual spray of water. Just get a lot of water kind of pouring out in big soft streams. No real firmness. The first foot or so of water from the nozzle is okay but after that it just sprays everywhere with no pressure.

The new one looks the same visually but it is made of plastic including the tube. The tube does not fall nicely as it used to be with the old model.

So much for their lifetime warranty!.The unit stopped working after about 6 months of normal use. Would strongly discourage from buying this defective product.The showerhead is probably a better choice as it has fewer moving parts and is installed in many of the larger hotels (MGM Grand in Las Vegas for instance).The good points:- when it works, the pressure of the water is really good- does leave you feeling energized- looks sleek and 'luxurious' with no visible plastic stuffThe bad points:- defective handheld units - hold on to your receipts!- bad customer service and warranty- poorly designed plastic tubing inside the unit - prone to failure and leaks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invigerating","review":"This shower head provides a full even spray with a lot of power.

Looks fairly decent, although for $50 I expected more than just a piece of plastic. It was easy to install. My complaint is that because of the oxygen added to the water, unless I am 2 inches away from the head, I get a cold blast of air. It makes the shower experience quite uncomfortable. Which means I have to turn on more hot water. So I might be saving water but I am also taking hotter showers. The only way I can take showers now is by using the handheld and that is inconvenient.

The hose is very standard and I have no complaints there. Installation was a cinch. My complaints come from the fact that my (white plastic) Oxygenics had plastic smell and the spray is not very adjustable and very intense. I'll stick with a more traditional design. There are still good water-saving showerheads with a lower GPM (gallons per minute--the amount of water you're using at any given time) rating.The Oxygenics BodySpa SkinCare showerheads are minimally adjustable and have a wide powerful spray pattern.

Its made of plastic and broke I am short and my husband is tall so we had to move it up and down everyday. After awhile the plastic part broke. We went to a plumbing co and couldn't replace that part so we had to get another complete showerhead. I wish the manufactor had made that part in metal.

I always dreaded having to wash/rinse my hair, knowing it would use up a lot of water and take time. Used the Oxygenics showerhead for the first time and it lived up to its billing, woohoo! I did choose to buy a separate turn off valve, as the one on the showerhead leaves too much water dribbling out to save much water. But the pressure it gives makes up for that failing, in my book, so I'm leaving it at 5 stars. Installation was simple, requiring no tools, though I ended up buying Oxygenics own wall holder (another review, works fine), as the original in the RV was a little too small to reliably hold this larger showerhead while driving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shower head not all wet","review":"The shower head does take a smaller amount of water and create stronger water flow, but there is definitely not enough water to rinse a head full of thick hair. The most aggravating part of the shower is the wind effect the shower head creates. If you are not fighting the shower head to rinse off your hair and body, you are fighting with the shower curtain because the shower head creates a wind flow that blows the curtain in on you. Constantly. The curtain would touch the shower wall if your body weren't stopping it. I do not recommend this shower head."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS ALL PLASTIC!!!!!","review":"I just unpacked this product, and I'm repacking it immediately to send it in for return.

Duct tape works on a standard wrench. When first installing the unit, using only hand power, the shower head holder will stop (did for me) at about 45 degrees. The temptation is to use the unit itself as the tool to twist to the last position. Not a good idea.Thing has NO leaks. I have been using it just about a month.

Don't waste your $ 2.25 plus shipping on this. Poorly designed, doesn't even keep you coffee luke warm. Wires attached to inner mug and wrapped with heat tape. I wish a company could make a quality heated coffee mug. I travel a thousand miles a week and a hot cup of coffee would be great. Gone thru a half dozen different heated coffee mugs. Tried the digital coffee mug four times, one with the usb and 3 without. USB lasted a week, the others, two months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very warm","review":"This mug only keeps the drinks luke-warm at best, not at all hot. I found that this mug is thermostatically regulated. When the thermostat is on it heats with about 40 Watts of power which should be very adequate to keep drinks hot, but the thermostat cuts off too soon. No thermostat adjustment is available.

Some of it may seem obvious, but on a day to day basis, especially if stressed, it is so easy to forget how to be our authentic selves, and also, how to respond appropriately. It is an easy to read book, and also flows quite well, in my opinion. It is also a book, that doesn't necessarily have to read from cover to cover, but can be picked up at any time - before going to bed, on the train/bus into work etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest romance novels ever written!","review":"This book is basically one of the classic love story: girl falls in love with one guy, is pursued by another, and is befriended by and secretly admired by a third.

Adventure after adventure leads her to a tough decision to make. She must make a choice between her mind's idea of a future husband and her heart's secret wishes. In the end, she is very pleased with her choice. This book is a definate must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple And Powerful Wisdom Through Story","review":"Picking this book up can be deceptive - it might be seen as a children's book, not for very young children, but rather for young adolescents. It can be read as stories from a storybook, but this storybook is a collection taken out of a larger work called Srimad Bhagavatam - a holy book from India. I said deceptive because it is not a children's book, but is far deeper. The tales are constructed to raise consciousness. This book did raise my own consciousness.The stories are well written in English, and are captivating. The book is not unlike stories taken from the Bible, but of course the characters are very different. This book is filled with wisdom, compassion, and cautionary tales.For me, it is another view of how similar the mystical underpinnings of all religions are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed reading the book!","review":"Amal Bhakta has done an excellent job presenting selected stories from the Bhagavatam. Each story is less than five pages long and that makes it very easy for the reader to get through the book without feeling overwhelmed by it. There is a purpose behind selecting each story and they all are very well written.

There was nothing to differentiate between them. I picked one and put it in my Blu Ray player which plays either Blu Ray or DV formats. Well, apparently the disc I chose was neither of the above, for my player could not read it. I tried the other disc and it played, but I still don't know if it was the Blu Ray or DVD. It's not worth the trouble for me to try to return the set in order to get the correct discs.

So I came to this as an alternative. The price couldn't be beat and so far it does play my favorite games. The downside is it is very sensitive. One little bump and your whole game can be ruined, and you have to start over. That's happened a couple of time to me and it sucks when you get so far too lol. But otherwise it's working and it's been a lot of fun. But it will probably only be a temporary solution until I can get a genuine NES again. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"learn compatible games.","review":"This system works, so I can't really fault it.

It serves its purpose, my husband wanted the old school system and he got one. But if you want the orginal gaming system, you have to pay the price. This console overall was a good buy, especially since my husband has only played it one time since I bought it. Kids and there toys.

My friend and I were wanting to break out the Tetris and Dr. Mario from back in the day. When we realized my Core system was no longer functioning properly, I investigated the price of replacing it with another Nintendo system. The cost to replace it would be at least $50 and that didn't guarantee that another system wouldn't fail. I saw this item and because the price was so reasonable (less than half of the NES), I decided to give it a try. Well, I am so glad I purchased this! We were playing the old games in no time.

(I'm sorry to see that Amazon is currently sold out, but I hope they have some soon). These peanuts have a fresh flavor (it's a surprise if you're used to selecting yogurt peanuts from the bin) and the yogurt coating does not have that unusual aftertaste. I'm purchasing these as soon as they're back in stock as a treat (they are nuts in yogurt coating, so do pay attention to calories - they're so good it's hard not to eat the whole bag). They don't have partially-hydrogenated oil as an ingredient (so no trans fats!), but they do have \\"fractioned-palm kernel oil\\" (so I guess that's where the saturated fats come from). I compared a few other brands sold in my area, and this one has better flavor and less bad-fats per serving.

Unfortunately, it doesn't tie close enough with Ultima mythology to please fans, while at the same time not explaining things well enough for newcomers.The main characters are all pretty unlikable. One unsympathetic protagonist is fine; four or five turns the book into an exercise in masochism.There's really very little adventuring. Most of the text is devoted to the same argument rehashed multiple times, or to long, repetitive slogs through the muddy countryside, or to calming the panicky horse yet again.Avoid this; I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest single as far as new songs go","review":"Firstly make sure to get the jewel case version of this, the cardboard version has exactly the same bsides as the jewel case release of This Distance, also it is a lot more durable.However it is a fairly pointless release, no one wants radio edits of songs just because of the f word and all the other songs are found on different albums.So my 2 stars are for the release itself, the songs are great and everyone who knows cake will have them, best off saving your money with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are gems in this recording","review":"There is a lot to commend about this CD, but the one thing that really stands out in my mind is the quality of the vocals. For as beautiful as these trained voices are, the singers do not make the mistake of overwhelming the \\"feel\\" of the music by treating it as an operatic exercise.

This character is not London's, and, despite the name-dropping on the DVD cover, the character lacks the audacity of Daffy, the everyman quality of Donald, and even the production values of Howard. Comparing it to FRITZ THE CAT is an insult to Crumb (Fritz' creator) and Bakshi (FRITZ' animator). In fact, if the creators of DIRTY DUCK had not gone on to work on such projects as RUGRATS and TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, this early effort would be long forgotten (except by devoted fans of Flo & Eddie, who contribute music and dialog).

If you have ever seen the realy old show Crusader Rabbit you might have an idea of how the animation is... and that had the excuse of being the first animated show for TV, so the animation couldn't be good, it wasn't in the budget since TV never got that kind of money.

But, I can't be sending dented cans to our troops -- and I don't want to eat from dented cans myself, so I'm vexed. For purposes of this review, I opened a good can to taste the product, and the product tastes good. It certainly costs enough.

He also effectively weaves together the Old and New Testaments. And the 7 appendices really fill out the book. They're historical and theological additions which weren't necessary but are a tremendous blessing.

They both displayed maturity FAR beyond their years."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Hollywood and the media try to portray Henry Hill has some folk-hero, but BOY O BOY is the cat out of the bag with this book. Henry's own kids hold no punches back against him. They tell it like it is and give you the REAL henry hill, which is nothing more than a low class, white trash, drug addict drunk. I mean, when your own son hates your guts you know you are the lowest of the low. This is a very good read if you want to know what REALLY happened to HIll after he entered the WPP.If Hollywood decides to make another movie about HIll, they'd be smart to base it on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read- could not put it down","review":"I bought this book after reading Wiseguy, A Goodfella's Guide to New York, and Gangsters & Goodfellas. I am also a huge fan of Goodfella's the movie. This book was absolutely amazing, I could not put it down! The writing is so honest and heartfelt. This is the perfect wrap-up to the Henry Hill story as it exposes what it was really like to be on the other side of his dealings. This is definately a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"drags on endlessly after seeing goodfellas I looked forward to reading this but it would have made for better reading as a magazine article"},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE PRICES NUTS!","review":"Amazon, you need to do something about these Kindle book prices!

Stay greedy and your sales will sooner, rather than later, tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. Are we supposed to feel sorry for these kids? Please. The son will remind you of Saffy on AbFab, while the daughter simply had a great relationship with her father. Still, it's great to have all these stories about their eccentric father. I ended up liking Henry Hill even more after reading this- reminded me of that Hunter Thompson quote \\"there he goes, one of God's own prototypes... too weird to live, and too rare to die.\\" The guy's a character. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other side of the story","review":"\\"On the Run\\" is the other side of the Henry Hill story and his family as narrated by his son and daughter. When I first saw the movie \\"Good Fellas\\", I thought Henry Hill was the \\"good guy\\" (relatively speaking) out of the gang of Lucchese crime thugs. However, after reading \\"On the Run\\", it is obvious that Henry Hill was a low-life criminal and drug addict who didn't care how much his family had to pay for his life of crime. This book also demonstrates that the witness protection program is a constant life on the run. Maybe Hill's family would've had an easier time had he not made it more difficult for the Feds to protect the family. But Henry Hill's ego, drug addiction and criminal mindset would not allow that. I feel sorry for his family and the scars that they have to live with still. All in all, \\"On the Run\\" is a riveting account of a family's struggle to survive the imminent dangers of a life tied to the mob. For sure, this is not the \\"Sopranos\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read, worth your time.","review":"If you're interested in Henry Hill or are a fan of the movie 'Goodfellas,' then this is the book for you. There are books out there written by Henry himself but this is a much more honest, heartfelt account. His two kids (Greg & Gina) show a side of their father that you would have never gotten from his horrible books. Read this one, not his. It is truly from a much different perspective than anything else written on him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Biehn makes for a good psychotic villian","review":"Michael Biehn upstages the good guys as a psychotic killer who befriends two rich boys for reasons other then friendship.

I purchased the bit set with the tool and pretty much have a toolbox I can wear on my belt. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best multi-tool I have ever owned, & I've owned several","review":"I've used many similar gadgets over the years from various makers, mainly Leatherman and Gerber. This one is the best so far, for a couple of reasons. First, every tool on this thing locks in the open position. You have no more frustration with the tool you're using at the moment moving, sliding and/or closing in mid-job. That alone would put it at the top of my list. Second, in the age of digital gadgets galore, Leatherman has seen fit to include a screwdriver tool (with easily replaceable bit) that is small enough to work on the tiny little screws one finds holding the casing of pretty much any electronic item together. The large knife blade is accessible using one hand only, without opening the pliers.

Hutchinson \\"autonomeus, only his comment and review are very weak and disjointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak and disjointed","review":"I've heard several of the zillions of recordings of Shostakovich's 5th so far. Of them, both the best and the worst are by Rostropovich and his National Symphony Orchestra. Unfortunately this one from 1991 is the worst, and the best is currently out of print (DG #410 509-2, from 1983).Rostropovich (in the DG recording) conveys stark terror in a way no other composer even approaches. He does this by, among other things, slowing down the 4th movement. Mravinsky, the original interpreter, takes the 4th at a fast clip, but slows down the finale. Bernstein rushes through it and totally misses the emotional impact. Haitink's on Decca is quite good, and superbly recorded, but also fails to capture the finale.I hope DG reissues the superior Rostropovich soon. For now we have the next-best thing, a gorgeous new live recording of the 5th by Rostropovich and the London Symphony Orchestra in the LSO Live series (the recording is from July 2004), so do not settle for this tepid substitute."},{"rating":"1","title":"not Ms. Jarrett's best....","review":"This is the second Harlequin Historical I've tried by Miranda Jarrett. Sadly-these series Historicals fall short of her usual great writing.The main problem with this book is that the storyline and the behavior of every character is totally implausible for the time period. The characters behave more like people in the modern age and that's not I want in a Historical romance.I do not recommend this book and would instead recommend some of Ms. Jarrett's other, non Harlequin books.1.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mountain Year comes to Life","review":"Barbara Hallowell has certainly done it this time; written a wondrous book about life in southern Appalachia. The life she writes about is that which we step on, the ground, the worms and insects, trees, flowers, fern and birds. She has charted the book monthly so one can know what to expect at each time of the year, and she takes you through the depths of winter, to the glories of autumn, stopping off for a good look at spring and summer. Did you know there were orchids in 'them thar mountains,' and what to do about snake bite? Did you ever wonder what the early days of a baby robin might be like or what a ghost forest is? Hallowell has taught nature classes and workshops for many years and has now turned her knowledge into this informative book with beautiful photographs for those of us not part of her classroom.

The first time I tried using it, it said that south was north, so I thought that the magnetism was backwards. What it actually happened is the compass aims towards the metal pieces in the tool. If the knife, bottle opener, or even the tweezers are in place in the card, the compass aims towards them, messing up your bearing.

It reinforces what we have covered in class by setting the texts to lively, rhythmical melodies that show both French and Arabic influences.This CD is a fascinating overview of medieval Spanish Mariano religious texts and poetry and songs performed capably by Sonus.

The audio sound has never been that good, but now it is not even tolerable; in fact during our last outing, I was told by others to lower the volume because the sound was so distorted. Additionally, I noticed that the plastic bezel/screen is cracking exactly where the screws secure the speaker to the outside wall. Fortunately, the bezel is 'glued' to the outer camper shell for added waterproofness. I suspect that the speakers may have succumbed to the sun's UV and the heat-cold cycling in our region. I will be searching for something else very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Came as exterior speakers on our travel trailer. Sound quality was not very good, might have been due to the quality of the radio/CD combo in the trailer as well, as that's low-end too. But since we hardly don't use the audio system at all and especially not the exterior speakers, we didn't care too much.After the first year, the outside went from white to yellow due to exposure to sun light. Also, one of the covers came loose and I had to glue it back in. Not sure which one of the two that was, as now, four years after purchase of the trailer, we arrived at the campground with one of the covers missing (guess it was same one).

After spending an hour trying to thread the parts back together it was readily apparent that they were totally incompatible & could never function. I'll purchase a replacement wrench at my local Ace Hardware store & hope that the taps & dies are OK for limited house hold chores.

There were hardened steel burrs in almost all dies, they did not cut cleanly, rather teased the metal.

Whilst some may consider the content dry and lacking pizazz, as a guitar teacher I find the exercises are logical and well ordered. If a student makes his/her way through this and subsequent volumes they will have really solid reading skills. The DVD (more accurately CD-ROM) is great as it makes me feel like I'm attending a class at Berklee itself (rather than sitting in the far off reaches of the Pacific in little old New Zealand).

I've only been playing for two months now and this book is my main focus. I'm only about 10 pages in, and by no means do I have those pages mastered. But there is a lot of satisfaction when you do nail and exercise. My only gripe would be that the tracks on the CD don't have a count in (I like to play along with the CD). It just starts (only reason it didn't give it the 5th star) If you are a beginner like me, I would get this book, along with a few simpler ones, there will be times when you just can't look at another note and want a book that has some tabs in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent teaching book","review":"This book highly recommended by my son's guitar teacher, who is getting his Master's degree in classical guitar performance.

Is a sequel in the works?Regardless, Tim writes a very readable, enjoyable, and entertaining story that will consume its readers over a long weekend.

I don't like the fact that they are not attached because it makes them easy to loose if baby pulls them off and throws them.

In an ideal world, the condcutor and orchestra would draw us in emotionally, but there's nothing wrong with thrilling virtuosity. That's what we get here in a live Bruckner Sixth that has been recorded in up-to-date sound so that the Berlin Phil. can be heard in all its glory. Barenboim, a lifelong devotee of Bruckner, tends to indulge in irritating and arbitrary shifts of tempo and phrasing. He keeps that to a minimum in this performance, and where he does swoon and carees a bit too much, he remains tasteful. When it was originally released, this CD was greeted with high praise from The Gramophone. Given the absence of really superior recordings of this work, I tend to agree.Note: There is now a budget reissue of this CD from Teldec."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cover, shame about . . . . . . .","review":"I am half-prepared to believe in any recording that has such a wondrous cover - the planet Neptune - but my admiration goes no deeper.

It's junk.If you like your Bruckner 6 to be (a) stiched together from various live performances (b) where the acousic noticeably changes within a movement (c) the orchestra is lacklustre and (d) even a semi-maligned recording from a predecessor has more magic to it (Herbie 1980) then this recording is for you. Cherish it.There are much better recordings on offer: Sawallish, Klemperer, Nagano, Herbie (somewhat) and hell, even the truncated Furtwangler from 1943.Danny has made some wonderful recordings but this is not one of them.

They struggle against exploitation, prejudice and poverty in a hostile environment, ruled by Eurocentric plantation owners. They become little more than endendured servants to Brazilian plantation owners, who misreprested living and working conditions and their endenturement in order to recruit cheap labor from Japan. Excellent 5-episode television drama, well-acted with high production values. Story told through the lost letters of two sisters, found 60 years later.

We had to let it cool down a little before anyone could get in. We didn't want to leave bucket heaters in the water while people were using the hot tub for safety reasons, so once people got in, we moved the bucket heaters into 5-gallon buckets of water right next to it. That gave us a constant supply of hot (nearly boiling) water to refresh it with every half hour or so. We were easily able to maintain a ~100-104 degree range in the hot tub all night, although it did require a little bit of finessing.Note that these draw 8.3 amps each, so you can't run two of them on a 15 amp circuit at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep your hands warm","review":"This is a great product!

This album proves both of those statements right. Live, Sonny Rollins really opens up his sounds and does more improv and generally gets a freer sound. However, the members of the back up band are relatively obscure. If you want a real classic Sonny Rollins live cd, look for Our Man in Jazz which had Don Cherry and Billy Higgins and obviously shows the influence of Ornette. As for the interview on this Live in London cd, it was interesting but tends to drag a bit. Still when Sonny Rollins hits the right notes and takes some chances, it actually works."},{"rating":"2","title":"a damn good book","review":"This is the kind of adventure/mystery book that you just can't put down.

The more things change....Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick up the Pace!","review":"\\"Conspiracy of Paper\\" is a frustrating mystery for two reasons. First, author David Liss describes a situation that broadens, very slowly, usually by the introduction of new characters, for the first two-thirds of the book. Only then does the mystery deepen, with surprises emerging from unsuspected interactions between events and characters. In my opinion, mysteries should \\"deepen\\" more rapidly. Second, Liss decided to write in a fashion \\"suggesting the rhythms\\" of 18th century prose. Unfortunately, this language is elaborate and prolix and has a deadening effect on the exchanges between characters. In my opinion, this formality is smothering, and deprives the characters of emotional clarity as they interact. Regardless, the last one-third of the book is very good and fun to read. But it's work to get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Conspiracy of Paper","review":"I am an avid reader but I do not often find a book that captures my attention and imagination as this book has.

Further, it's so cumbersome and detailed that it becomes boring when it should have been fascinating.2. the protagonist's relationship with his father is unrealistic for the time period. Late 16th-early 17th century fathers were not usually -- or even frequently -- touchy-feely affectionate types. They were authority figures.

I was tremendously disappointed. I seem to be in the minority, but I wouldn't recommend this book.Maybe it was the fact that I took an instant dislike to the main character, and that dislike continued throughout the book. Or perhaps it was the very busy plot that spiraled around so many times that by the end I really didn't care who the was the culprit. I just wanted the book to end. But the worst part for me was the writing style. I just didn't care for it at all, and found it to be stilted throughout.I feel like I should be apologetic since so many people did like this book and many of the newspapers liked it too, but I just didn't care for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Conspiracy of Paper","review":"A Conspiracy of Paper is an excellent book. Anyone who likes a fast paced whodunit will really like this book. It also provides a good introduction to the history of the stock exchange as well as the psychology of hyping stocks that is quite applicable to today."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the same class as Sansom and Pears","review":"I guess I came late to David Liss, but reading this debut, I know I'll read more of his books. Nice story, brings 18th century London very much to life, well written. Kept me up till 3 am one regular work day - enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you would like to visit 18th century London...","review":"\\"A Conspiracy of Paper\\" is a page-turner. The novel unfolds in 18th century England as an intricately woven character, Weaver, investigates the death of his forlorn father. He enters almost all aspects of London's life (the law, the stock market, the taverns, gentlemen life etc..). And to top it all off there is a love story. Overall, it is a wonderful historical novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding characters; fascinating myster","review":"David Liss has a gift for character and plot that make this book brilliant. What makes this such an extraordinary book is the narrator -- a boxer turned detective in early 18th century England named Benjamin Weaver. Weaver is a Jew, and I normally don't go in for identity crisis fiction(of any cultural or religious stripe), but Liss isn't interested in psychodrama. Instead, he uses Weaver's Jewishness to show the complexity of London in the period in a way that had never occurred to me before. Like Weaver, I kept getting drawn in to this world of crime and money, deeper and deeper. And each new character you meet here is a pleasure. This is going to be a book a lot of people will probably want to scoff at -- the writer is young, and its a long book. But doesn't listen to the jealous reviewers: read it, read it, read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping, educational journey through old London","review":"David has done a fantastic job (a la Caleb Carr) of combining fact, fiction and suspense in a terrific novel. In the course of the book I understood not only the sights, sounds and smells of old London, but also the fundamental change in people's perceptions on currency. Although packed with historical details and significance, this is first and foremost an intricate thriller with vivid characters and interesting sub-plots.If you enjoyed The Alienist, David's book is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some thoughts upon reading \\"Conspiracy of Paper\\"","review":"David Liss has written an historical thriller of the swash buckling type concerning England's South Sea Company Bubble of 1720. Liss did Dumas up proud. Having said that, one can hardly imagine a more complex plot nor a greater cast of nondescript characters that this author brought into being. What could have been accomplished with a good editor defies the imagine. To paraphrase Margaret Atwood; one bought the admission ticket, now one wants to see how it ends. So with this book; one cannot put it down \`till all the ends are pulled together. This never happened! The major problem I had was that I was disappointed in not finding that ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine historic mystery","review":"This is a great mystery, set in 18th century England. The protagonist is perhaps the most likeable I've seen in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT great","review":"OK, the financial mystery around which this novel is built captured my interest. But the main character is quite unsympathetic; his sidekick, his love interest, and many of the supporting characters are cardboard. One does not become immersed in the period the way one does in, say, the novels of E.L. Doctorow or William J. Kennedy. The \\"detective wisdom\\" dispensed by the characters is pretty tame stuff. The dialogue is alright (that is, it doesn't get in the way of the story), but it's hard to imagine some of it coming out of anyone's mouth, no matter when they lived. There are red herrings, plot twists, and all of that good stuff.This is definitely light entertainment and nothing more. Sorry to disagree with so many other reviewers. Truth in reviewing: I didn't read this book, I listened to it on tape - I don't think my reaction is due to a tepid reading, rather I was quite impressed by the rendition (I've listened to some real dogs on the way to work)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complex conspiracy","review":"David Liss has taken the three major elements of any story: money, sex and religion and woven them into a well-told tale. He succeeds brilliantly at bringing early 18th century England to life with its veneer of gentility barely covering a dark underworld where anything can be had for a price. Our hero Benjamin Weaver is the perfect vehicle for helping explain the machinations of 'Change Alley as thousands flock to place their bets on often phony investments. It's impossible not to see a modern corollary in the books repeated theme of paper promises of future riches. If there's any fault to be found in the book it's that while Liss does such a superb job of explaining the financial markets and the life of the London Jews, the main plot becomes a little too involved. It's easy to lose track of who's doing what to whom if you're not careful. But it's still worth sitting up a couple of nights because you can't stop turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but I Expected More","review":"Given the author's background in economic history, I thought this book would be centered around the development of the stock market in 18th century London. While this played a central role in the book, it was never really explained how the stock market developed or how it worked. The central character is the younger son of a Jewish broker, who has made a name as a boxer.... The writing was extremely well done but the plot seemed to meander all over the place. The novel didn't remain focused enough to keep my full attention. I would read another novel by the author since the writing and the research was well done but hope that in the future he uses his background to give the reader some interesting background on the development of the modern economies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story, Slightly Disappointing Ending","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Liss is able to bring the reader into the time and place of the story; it's an engrossing experience. As a financial know-nothing, I was amazed that I was able to understand the principles and the principals of the plot, thanks to the author's ability to mesh important explanations into the storyline. Not once did I have to go back to earlier chapters to recall who a particular character was, as often happens in complex conspiracy tales. My only criticism is that the ending seemed like a last-minute tag-on. Nevertheless, the book is well worth the read. Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creaky and hamfisted","review":"An exciting premise, well-researched and detailed, but with the story mechanics of a seventh grade short story. Things like \\"...but he had no idea that the person he had just seen would change his life forever...\\" (not a quote, but you get the idea). Wished I'd waited for the paperback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after reading 300 pages.","review":"I'm having difficulty understanding all of the hype about this novel.The writing style is not engaging. The main character is not credible. Even though he makes his living as a thief-taker, basically a free lance bounty hunter for the city of London, he naively throws guineas and shillings at any suspect rogue who requests money. This, even though he was supposedly just scraping by, financially.I read just over 300 pages, then gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"Some people were born with the ability to write; others learn it. As is painfully clear, David Liss belongs to the latter category of creatures. His writing is woefully artificial--it reflects the inklings of an uncreative, eager student ambitiously following classroom formulae rather than the genuine and expansive passion of true talent. It is sad to see that ostensibly intelligent people (i.e., critics and readers alike) don't recognize this book for the waste of paper and ink that it is. You can't spare David Liss from his innate medicority, in any case (Random House has managed to find its own Britney Spears), but you can spare yourself from this book. Do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Conspiracy of Paper","review":"I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the book. I believed I was ordering a hardcover when in fact I got a large print library edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best not read a chapter at a time","review":"That's how I read it and the serial points of bewilderment of the main character half to three quarters of the way through the book became kind of annoying. I thought his befuddlement was slightly exaggerated to fit the first person narrative and to help create a picaresque atmosphere.But, I've rated the book with 4 stars, so I shouldn't speak only of quibbles. The author imparts a realistic sense of social divisions, by class, religion and occupation in early 18th century London. A few of the other characters are macchiavelli's prince as a crime king and a financier, both wonderfully rendered. The main character is likeable and charismatic. It's a story well told."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-rate historical fiction, first-rate mystery","review":"In this novel, David Liss performs a masterful job of taking the reader back to 18th century England. The characters and setting came alive and truly seemed to be the product of a different time and place. The intricately-plotted mystery was well-told with momentum building throughout. I have only a little interest in financial markets, yet I found Liss's explanations of the nascent British stock market fascinating. I also found this book just as compelling for its portrait of the role of Jews in 18th century England as well as the nature of crime and punishment during this period. This book is well worth reading on many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome Period Style","review":"Liss attempts to tell the story first person, but his early 17th century prose is as dead as synthetic meat. It lacks wit, style, humor, nuance, and a hundred other ingredients of good writing. The only time I laughed out loud is when I read the interview at the back of the book, and the interviewer claimed the book was funny.The novel also fails structurally. The plot meanders between conventional crime thriller and clumsy history lessons. By the end, I was reading out of duty. Enough said.Two stars for effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction at its Best!","review":"It's unbeliveable that this is Liss' first novel! I absolutely couldn't put it down. The history of early 18th century England which he weaves into the story so seamlessly is fascinating. And the story is one that keeps you reading late into the night (or at least it did me)!!I can't wait for his second book in which, I believe, the main character is to be the grandfather of Benjamin Weaver, the Jewish \\"thief catcher\\" who is the main character in \\"A Conspiracy of Paper.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"great historical mystery","review":"David Liss has written a novel which serves as a time maching pulling readers back to England in the turbulent financial times when paper money was first being introduced. The main character is believable and likeable, and his mission in the novel is realistic and suspenseful. If you want to escape the 21st century for a few hours, read A Conspiracy of Paper"},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary novel!","review":"What an extraordinary novel. As a trial lawyer I try, as best I can to engage in \\"pleasure\\" reading. This book was an absolute pleasure to read. Candy for the mind! I read a great deal and rarely find myself so engaged in a book I find it hard to put down. Actually it's sort of annoying to read a book that is so well written that you don't want to put it down. So this review is a WARNING. If you don't like reading a book that is so good you can't put it down, Don't buy this book. Otherwise...ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Fiction","review":"The South Sea Bubble has long stood as one of the leading examples of how investors can be caught in the grips of a temporary buying frenzy only to see their \\"profits\\" eventually erode. Although I always mention the incident in my lectures--I'm a professor of finance--I never really knew much more than the basic facts. The beauty of Liss's novel is that makes the events leading up that market crash come alive; he certainly captures well the hubris of the involved parties. The author has a great eye for period detail and his dialogue transports the reader back in time. This is excellent reading with more than a few surprises!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historical read","review":"A richly detailed story of old London that involves an unlikely \\"hero\\" in solving a murder in the stock jobbing business. In the genre of 'The Alienist' Liss gives us a up close look at life in 1719 London."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"I cannot see how this book won any award. The story is OK at first but really gets bogged down in a lot of useless detail, the thread is tough to follow at times, and by the 3/4 mark, I just plain lost interest in finding out why and who killed Weaver's father. Characters are not all that interesting. There are plenty of good historical novels out there, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"This is what happens when graduate students indulge in work avoidance. If you are interested in the history of the South Seas Bubble, Chancellor's \\"Devil Take the Hindmost\\" is a better read. If you are interested in the 18th century milieu, then Mount's \\"Sam (and Jem)\\" and Unsworth's \\"Sacred Hunger\\" bracket the times and mores. If you are interested in what Soro's calls \\"reflexivity\\", how financial innovations influenced the period and vice versa, then perhaps wait for Liss's disseration... and if you just want historical mystery, Bruce Alexander works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Financial Fiction","review":"Reviewer Lee Armstrong suggests that David Liss may have invented a new genre of \\"financial thrillers.\\" Au contraire! There are hundreds of books in this category, or at least in the \\"financial fiction\\" category (many of them, like Black Money, definitely thrillers).For a listing of books in this genre, see http://www.ex.ac.uk/~RDavies/bankfiction/ which also has links to\\"Money in History\\" and \\"Financial Scandals.\\" Happy searching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn good book","review":"From my title you can tell I liked this book. It was recommended by a clerk in a Tribeca book store. I cannot read for the sake of reading, so a book has to grab my imagination and keep me intrigued. This one surely did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ridiculously labyrinthine plot","review":"I love historical mysteries, and this one came highly recommended. I did enjoy the period touches. But imagine my disappointment when I finally get to the end of the book and discover that the plot was based on a complicated and ultimately unbelievable premise of various parties working to manipulate the hero to do their bidding. (When those parties could have taken care of their problem just as easily by themselves!) It required several PAGES at the end for the characters to explain the solution to each other! This tortured, convoluted plot is ultimately laughable.To make matters worse, the hero, a former pugilist, goes about finding out information primarily by pummeling people until they spill the truth. Too bad he didn't just beat up the right people early on in the book -- it would have saved the hero (not to mention the readers) a lot of wasted time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after all the strong reviews","review":"I did not feel as strong a sense that this author knew his period as I have from such recent historical novels as, say, The Dress Lodger. But what really frustrates me in a mystery is when the detective does not follow obvious trails or makes nothing of pretty strong hints. For example, Weaver had the manuscript of his father's book in his possession and knew it probably related to his death. Did he read it? No, it made him sleepy! Then someone stole it from him. Why not make it more difficult for him to get the manuscript in the first place than have him ignore it? There were many incidents like this throughout the book. If there is anything that makes me impatient, it is a stupid detective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Admirable but boring","review":"Mr. Liss's ability to write so authentically in this period piece is no small feat. Yet, inspite (or despite) of its technical brilliance, it fails to be an engaging story. I find myself checking the number of pages for a chapter before I begin one. After reading 120 pages, I am not sure I care enough to continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy enough for a beginner, Skilled enough for a star!","review":"The break-down format of this DVD is one of the things that makes it so great. It breaks down moves - smooth, percussive, travelling steps, and so on, making it easier to focus on a particular type of move. There is a warm-up and cool down, a performance piece in the end, and some other great tips, tools, moves, and techniques to improve belly dancers at any skill level. For beginners, each move is broken down and through the power of repitition and easy explanations, you'll have it down in no time! I have this DVD and have used it for a few years as a regular exercise and just for fun! Because of the types of moves belly dance uses, this is a great DVD additional to any dancer's collection!

I watched it and was HIGHLY disapointed. The humor was rather off and a bit innapropiate for children. The animals stand on TWO legs instead of four. That annoyed me terribly. And what was with a 'Dancing lion\\"? Where's the sense in that? And how cana Hippo and a Gyraffe mate? Use some sense here Dreamworks. I am giving it two stars instead of one only because some of the music was cool. The plot was really off and draggy. And the voices for the animals were pretty bad too and didn't match their characters. I would rather reconmand \\"The Wild\\" by Disney. Dreamworks are normally good with films.

The previous reviewer could not put into words what type of music Patrick Wolf is producing, and I don't think I could do that either, but I can try and give you all an idea.Patrick wolf implements electronics with organic instruments such as violin and ukelele, and pulls it off perfectly. If there was one artist I would compare him to, is Bjork, sounding similar to Bjork in the fact(s) that he has a very strong voice, and makes sounds uncommon to the human ear that sound very musical.Buy this album. It doesn't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's All In The Palm of Your Hand\\"","review":"Over seven years later, and the album still holds up. Patrick Wolf's music will never get old. You could hear a true progression from Lycanthropy to what's he doing now (new album is 'Lupercalia'), from the different styles he dabbled in, to a real growth in his vocals. Regardless of what song of his you listen to in his later albums, there is still some essence that could be traced back to Lycanthropy.I'm so glad I stumbled upon his music by accident all those years ago. I've not looked back since. It gave me a wake-up call (in a way), and looking back now I can't believe I didn't discover his music sooner.

We've been beating the heck out of this printer making posters and handbills and trifold handouts and etc. In short, any job that was too big for an 8 1/2 x 11/14/17/whatever but too short a run to go out for commercial printing. Or too unique to afford commercial printing -- like this giant map.

As a 16 year old many stories where relevant to me, the stories that where the most convicting where trusting in God, and being an example for Christ everywhere. True covers almost all of the issues in teens life ranging from drugs and pornography, to eating disorders and fitting in. You name it most likely the book has it. Another benefit is that these teens come from a variety of backgrounds so the book doesn't just cater to an individual race, home life or income. The book gives excellent examples of the struggles, perseverance, and ultimatley the trusting in God to handle your problems. Although you may or may not agree with some of the teen writer's spiritual approach to handling their situations, God still shows up and uses the situation to glorify Himself. To sum it all up, buy (...) the book and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"passing through","review":"I wanted to listen to a good recording of Wenn wir in höchsten Nöten sein.

To say that this CD sets an intimate mood sounds cheesy, but it actually does. The soft piano sounds, accompanied by the orchestra background really does have a mood-changing effect. If you like classical pieces, but prefer the modernized sounds (minus the heavy instrumental sounds that generic classical CD's offer), this is a good album. Rachmaninov's \\"Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini\\" is one of my favorite all-time classical piece, and this version ranks up there with others I've enjoyed. \\"Clair de Lune\\" is also a Debussy classic that any classical music fans will easily recognize, and \\"Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring\\" is another one that most people will recognize. All pieces are played with a very soft tone and soothing backgrounds, so if you're looking for a classical CD compilation that you can play through without having to skip around for the best pieces, this is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete - the song \\"Edie\\" is NOT on this!","review":"The Instant Live recording being sold of this show is incomplete. It is missing the track \\"Edie\\". There is a very blatant edit that cuts off Ian mid-sentence after they play \\"Wonderland\\", and then the song \\"Star\\" starts. Be forewarned. The tracklist showing is wrong. There is no \\"Edie\\", and in it's place is \\"Star\\". I was at this show and both songs were performed. Somebody at Instand Live messed up and they cut (very sloppily, as well) a track from this recording.The performance itself is great, but this is a sub-par, incomplete product."},{"rating":"2","title":"extremely 'user friendly' book","review":"Simply a fantastic introduction to the concepts and ideas.

I questioned whether the workbook format would help me when I have practically zero background in accounting but the format actually ended up teaching me more by forcing me to be interactive.

Would highly recommend this book for anyone needing to learn basic accounting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you buy the other book!","review":"This version of the Essentials of Accounting book requires you to purchase an additional booklet with the worksheets and exhibits that are absolutely essential for using this workbook. Since this isn't stated anywhere, and the additional book can cost near $50, I gave this book a low rating. (And yes, perhaps these worksheets are included in later editions, but I'm reviewing this edition.)As for the usefulness of this book, I found it completely dull, and annoying to work with, having to cover the side of the page all the time.

So far the worst example is the mysterious appearance of \\"part 3\\" of an exercise in the chapter 3 test, with no \\"part 1\\" or \\"part 2\\" in sight to get you the data to start solving it. Worst of all, I can't seem to find errata anywhere for the book.

This encourages retention of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding introduction to acounting basics","review":"I routinely use accounting in my investing activities as well as my management activities and I have found this to be among the most insightful short accounts out there. Plenty of detail is provided and the programmed teaching format is highly effective. Although simple in its approach, it also has one of the best overall approaches to accounting that I have seen.

I am a vegetarian seeking a cookbook that promotes low-carb cooking in addition to the no-meat approach. Most of the recipes in this book require pork, beef, chicken, and other meat substances-understandably so, since the diet is a high-protein/high fat program. For those that enjoy consuming meat, this book may be of pleasure to you. But for people like me who prefer a vegetarian lifestyle, yet still require a high-protein, low carbohydrate diet, you won't find success with this book. Good luck on your weight loss/management journey. May peace and happiness be unto you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original DR Atkin's Cookbook","review":"I was looking for original Dr. Atkins Cookbook & could not find it. I purchased the book in the late 1990's & lost it about 10 years ago. It was through his cookbook I became acquainted with Stevia. I looked everywhere to buy it again and couldn't find the old version only the revised version. I was amazed to find it in Amazon.com. After his death, the cookbook was revised and I was displeased with the changes they made. One of the changes in the revised version is the use of Splenda in the recipes, which wasn't around when the original cookbook was published. I am so glad I found the original. More natural ingredients used in the old version."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING!","review":"I am so disappointed with this cookbook; I expected something better from Dr. Atkins. The few tasty recipes were too high in carbs and the lower carb recipes just didn't taste good to me. It's obvious that Dr. Atkins and I do not share similar culinary tastes. However, there are a few really good low carbohydrate cookbooks out there now; I recommend \\"Lauri's Low-Carb Cookbook\\" by Lauri Randolph or \\"The Low-Carb Cookbook\\" by Frances McCullough. These are the best two available to date; they both offer a variety of cooking styles and tastes. I love Dr. Atkins diet plan, but I am very disappointed in his cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE ARE BETTER COOK BOOKS OUTHERE","review":"I too am very grateful to Dr. Atkins research but this cookbook asks for ingredients I've never heard off. If you don't have a food processor or an extensive spice rack, you're in trouble. These recepies are not for people who have little time to cook. You can try Lauri's Low-carb cook book or The low- carb cook book by McCulloughs. I'm sure he won't mind us trying more exciting cookbooks as long as we all stay healthy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I now Look Forward To Eating","review":"As a new follower of low carb eating, I have been cooking every night and absolutely enjoying his recipies. My husband, who is not on this diet, is VERY happy with the meals. Everything in the book is easy to find in the store, or health food store. The recipies are simple and delicious. Tonight we will enjoy baked salmon, pg 82, with Creamy Celery Sauce, pg 167. I can hardly wait. I work, am handicapt and recovering from a broken hip- nothing will stop me from easily making these DELICIOUS simple meals! Thank you Dr Atkins!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"I found that the recipes in this book were not to my liking.

Most of the recipes are either ones I can make up (like the 9 variations on eggs for breakfast, ex.: eggs with bacon wrapped around them, or 11 recipes for salad) or ones I can find elsewhere (like 58 recipes for meat or seafood or 16 variations for side vegetables) or ones with weird ingredients I can't afford (gruyere, chevre, endive, roquefort, sate, stilton) or ones I would never want to eat (like 3 recipes for veal). To top it off, there aren't that many recipes (about 150 total). I am definitely returning this book.

This book is packed with very good, easy to make recipes. The results are excellent, just like with the famous diet of this brilliant and courageous doctor. Once you flip that mental switch, and don't see this diet as a diet, but as a very healthy way of life (or way of eating, actually) you will gain health and lose weight fast.

I can absolutely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good enough for me.","review":"I'm especially in love with the greek hamburger recipe.

I have come to the conclusion that I can not eat a high protein diet for long periods of time. I need vegetables in the worst way... the breads, while I love them aren't the problem. Sometimes you want to just eat corn and carrots. I was hoping to see insightful menus that managed to incorporate carbs and keep them relatively low enough to still stay on the diet. This is clearly not attempted. The other thing is that most of the recipes were uninspiring. I didn't want to just rush right out and do them.I did find a gem though and want to give credit where credit is due.... I loved the roasted pepper soup.... now that's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put-------I didn't like it.","review":"This book seemed to be \\" quickly\\" put together compared to the NEW DIET REVOLUTION. The dishes were mediocre. I tried a few which could indeed be prepared in thirty minutes but were not simple to make nor were they enjoyable. When your dieting----come on------make it appetizing! I bought this book quickly on the basis of the last one , but I learned not to ever do that again. The information about the carbohydrates would be of help to a novice but it was repetitious to anyone who had previous knowledge about Dr. Atkins. I didn't even have the majority of the ingredients called for in my kitchen either.

(85% of married couples are married to thier first and only spouse. the 50% stat which the media is fond of promoting is the number of licenses taken out versus the number of divorces filed for per year). I highly recommend his original book (which I use as a cookbook ISBN 0 553 27157 1) and his \\"New Diet Cookbook\\" (ISBN 0 87131 794 X). His diet has given me a new life. I do not have the words to describe the impact that this man's work has had in my life. Please do not confuse my dissatisfaction with this one book with my satisfaction for his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adore the diet - but found only a few useful recipes","review":"I've long enjoyed cooking elegant meals nearly as much as consuming them, but found very few recipes in this cookbook that are practical to prepare. Some contain ingredients found on few shelves (except those of health food stores or, perhaps, gourmet shops), and one assumes that Veronica Atkins, unlike most of us, has help with both shopping and preparation. Many of the meals are not appealing, and others involve too much expense, fuss, and bother.This cookbook could create problems for anyone not used to tweaking recipes. For example, the chicken paprika is perfectly delicious, but following Mrs Atkins \\"cooking time\\" is far from adequate - the chicken was still cold and red inside when I did so. The number of main dishes for which one would easily have ingredients at hand (even if one loves to cook) is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Mass (The Imperial or Lord Nelson)","review":"I would have liked it to be a little newer.

There are several good points brought up which may help the non-Swede avoid making a serious fool of himself or herself at a business luncheon, but that's about all there is. It's not really a book -- just a very thin pamphlet -- and it brings up only about a dozen points total, most of which anyone going to Sweden will already know. All of its points are related to business and business people, with nothing of interest for average people, tourists, motorists, hikers, or job-seekers, and nothing for people who simply want to meet and understand Swedes as people and friends. Sorry, it's not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not worth the money","review":"I wouldn't buy this panflet that is what it is. I would buy a real book.

First 2 ingredients were Salt and Monosodium Glutamate.

There's got to be something better on the market. I love salt, and dashi should be salty, but not overwhelmingly so. And why sugar, let alone two or three types of sugar? While I don't have a problem with MSG myself, I do try to avoid it. Probably my own fault; I should have specified \\"No MSG\\", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere!Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better. Sad to say, because Ajinomoto is a venerable company, but stick with Maruhachi or one of the other, healthier brands!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled into thinking this is a traditional Japanese substitue for dashi.","review":"I thought dashi was a soup stock made from fish flakes and kombu.

This is perhaps the most popular western brand you'll find. Do know that the second ingredient (the first is salt) is MSG.

My wife trims my head every 2 weeks with it and she needs to adjust the calibration screw 4 or 5 times during the cut. It's just so annoying. It's also a little rough on the skin and just doesn't do the job too well in the end.I may have gotten a defective unit but I didn't return it to the store in time so I'm stuck with it.

It is a family story with the highlight on animals and human courage and belief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gillian Anderson, a talent that should not be overlooked","review":"I watched this movie because I am a hugh Gillian Anderson fan. But I never imagined that her depths in acting were so great. Terriece Davis really let her shine in his adaption of Edith Wharton's early American book. She managed to show the audience every emotion that Lily Bart was experiencing whether she was speaking or not. Her facial expressions were so vivid and clear that even I could feel her pain. Knowing that she was making this movie, I managed to get a copy of the book of the same title. Even though the movie did not contain a lot of the book it still represented what Lily Bart was brought up to do and the pain and anquish she went through to acheive it. Even though it led to her demise. The DVD had great color and clear sound which showed off Davies' scenery and classical music. I highly recommend this movie to everyone whether you are a Gillian Anderson fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie Worth seeing","review":"This movie on a shelf seems like a boring old movie but when you actually watch it its suprising great. All the characters were wonderful. Gillian was excellent as was Eric Stoltz. When you watch how these horrible things happen to her you just start to cry. Its so touching. ITs a movie worth wasting your time on. You wont be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks!","review":"Ah, if only the aunt had died early in the movie, left the inheritance to Lily within the first 15 minutes, and thus spared us the whole tedious show! I have read and enjoyed the book upon which this movie is based. But, I must say, Lily is stilted and noticably \\"acted\\" as is the Lawrence character. The editing leaves much to be desired especially the long drawn out water and song number in the middle just prior to the yacht scenes. The only decent acting was done by Elizabeth McGovern and Dan Aykroyd. I would only recommend this movie for forced viewing in America's penal institutions. Prisoners with particularly ugly crime records would be made to see it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but dreary","review":"The sets and costumes are beautiful; but my gosh this is a slow, boring movie. The reviewer who said they felt relief when Lily finally kills herself had it absolutely right. The acting is far too artificial -- only Eric Stoltz is bearable. Gillian Anderson is dreadfully wooden. This cast is simply not up to acting a period drama (at least Dan Aykroyd realized this and didn't even try).Compared with the other versions of James and Wharton novels, this is a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mirth here.","review":"This movie definitely needed a laugh or two; it was deathly dull. Gillian Anderson's dialogue sounded as if she was reading from a book, and the rest of the characters weren't much better. We didn't particularly care what happened at the end; we just wanted the tedious affair to expire. These period piece usually don't move very fast anyway, but this one made glaciers look like tornadoes in comparison. The DVD picture quality was uneven; some shots were spectacular, while others (expecially those with Ms. Anderson) looked like they were shot through some sort of filter. I know this film was well received by most critics. I guess we just missed the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have ever seen","review":"This movie was pathetic and easily the worst movie I have ever seen since \\"Au Hazard Balthazar.\\" Sound design was atrocious. Lighting was ridiculous. The script was stale, flat, stuffy, and forced. The acting -- easily the most wretched performances these actors have ever given. Almost every scene felt like a farse. Totally unnatural. just awful. made me have flashbacks of my junior high drama class. What a nightmare! I am willing to bet that every cast member is dismally ashamed of this movie and thinks it is their lowest work ever. The director? Should never work again. This movie was truly, truly horrible. Not a single true emotional moment. Nothing. A bunch of bad lines, bad acting, bad sound design, bad lighting. Oh, and did I mention the soundtrack? Well, you can guess....Shame on whoever was responsible for this cinematicn bowel movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. The story line is almost incomprehensible and the story itself is bad beyond belief. In my opinion the acting was poor as well. House of Mirth plods along at the pace of a death march, the dialog makes no sense and the characters are cardboard. None of the people in the movie even seem like people. The are so stiff and unlifelike that zombies would come off well by comparsion.The story itself is simply stupid. No one would follow the actions taken by the main character unless they were insane. And I think the produce may have been insane to even think about bringing this to the screen in this fashion.Avoid this lifeless, meandering, and boring movie. It was a total waste of effort to even sit through it. All good movies start with good writing. This one fails there and then goes on to fail in every other aspect of movie making. In a word - worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G","review":"I love her in the X-files, but this was the worst movie to break her into film starring roles.

But I just couldn't get through it. Three failed attempts to watch it later, I gave up.

The whole thing just seemed rather affected, and totally ineffective at entertaining me, or any of my other guests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting with terrible dialogue","review":"The acting in this beautifully shot movie was quite good, but unfortunately the script was terrible. Anderson, forced to roll out the majority of the ridiculously florid dialogue, occasionally struggled with it, but her emoting itself was good. Aykroyd and LaPaglia did a superb job acting and seemed to have no problems getting around the lines, but I must emphasize that the lines themselves were painful at times. Nobody speaks like that! And nobody ever did! The style fluctuated far too often between poetics and colloquialisms, many of the latter seeming entirely too modern for 1905.Personally, even though I am a huge LaPaglia fan, I don't know if I could stomach this movie again, wonderful though he is. I'm glad I merely rented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing story - fine performance from Gillian","review":"I was greatly dissapointed at the story, especially since most of the reviews were favorable. If you have a negative attitude toward life and hate every day, then you may like this journey to hell that Gillian Anderson's character takes. I did not think that the character caused most of her own problems, aside from the gambling debts mentioned early in the movie. There was no moral to this story other than people can be mean - didn't we learn that back in kindergarten? The actors themsleves, Eric Stoltz, Dan Ackroyd, and Gillian Anderson do quite well. I was not impressed with Laura Linney."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst ever","review":"Talk about a downer movie. We have compared bad movies to \\"The Dead\\" for a lot of years. I think we now have a new lower standard. The dialogue is horrendous. The movie moves at worse than a snails pace. The characters are totally unlikable. No redeeming qualities except to know how shallow of lives the rich lived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I had no idea that Gillian Anderson was such a fine actress. Her performance was on the level of a great. I do mean a \\"great.\\" Gosh it has been a heart wish since the 50's for a \\"great\\" to emerge. Meryl Strep has been a contender but that winner is Gillian Anderson.No one is watching the movie for the movie in my opinion. The movie itself is a little pressed for time and has some disjointed jolts. It is to watch a magnificent performance by Gillian Anderson.Who could have known that under all that X-Files goofiness was a great? She's a great. I'll go to my grave swearing that. You see it here. A classical great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film about a tragic story in a cruel world","review":"I really liked this film because Gillian Anderson was great in this film, and the movie exposes the shallow and almost stupdendous nature of european/american society at that time. The setting is beautiful, the actors are good, the story, is good, although you will probably need to see it more than once. Its great film for those with patience and intelligence. For those of you who have neither I recommend you seeing Arnie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing--read the novel instead","review":"Gillian Anderson's acting is stilted, and the lavish sets and costumes hardly make up for the slow, plodding, spell-everything-out-for-you-and-hit-you-over-the-head-with-it pace of the plot. She seems in awe with herself, which is entirely unbecoming. Her entire manner reeks of, \\"Look at me!\\" It comes across as very self-conscious and narcissistic, which detracts from the story itself. The focus is more on Anderson in a costume than it is on Wharton's novel. She's trying too hard, and the role obviously does not come naturally to her. Her attitude is grim rather than dignified. Give it a miss, and read the novel instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Dreadful","review":"Fresh from reading and loving the book, I was really looking forward to seeing the film. What a shock to see how slow and lugubrious it was on celluloid.Eric Stolz made a weak, effeminate male lead; more suitable would have been Linus Roache (\\"Wings of the Dove\\"). LaPaglia, whom I loved in \\"Betsy's Wedding\\" and more recently \\"Lantana,\\" was miscast as the snubbed Jewish Rosedale, and Jodhi May, after such a moving performance in \\"A World Apart\\" when she was a girl, chose the trembling lip of melodrama. Combining Grace and Gertie did not work for me.Even Dan Ackroyd was not floridly obnoxious enough as Gus. And Elizabeth McGovern was insipid as Carrie Fisher. The one bright spark was Laura Linney as Bertha. This film was a huge disappointment. Read the book; skip the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe House of Mirth","review":"I offer additional info as to the wonderful music in this film. Per the previous posting regarding the music, yes, Bordin's \\"This Is My Beloved\\" is played several times throughout this film. However, the more prominent theme, the theme that plays during the opening scene and the theme that the Lily Bart character pecks out on the piano, is the 2nd movement of the Marcello Oboe Concerto (sans oboe). It is a beautiful and lamentful theme that, in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written. I am an oboist and have played this full concerto many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House of Mirth","review":"This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.

Sorry Edith."},{"rating":"1","title":"no laughing matter","review":"I did not like this movie. I tried but I found it devoid of feeling. One does feel for Lily, she is a tragic figure. She does not represent a person, but an ideal - an uncompromising figure sacrificed by lesser souls.Eric Stolz is a disappointment as her \\"lover\\". Indeed, no chemistry evolved between him and Gillian Anderson, whom I personally found stunning. He is, as another review says, too immature for the role, he has the voice of a teenager, is glib, heartless and insincere.The film is somehow gut wrenching, but not in a cathartic way. You do not feel good when it is over, or cleansed, just empty. And sad, very sad because it was all so meaningless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tragedy by Terence Davies","review":"The House of Mirth is a perfect tragedy based on Edith Wharton's first major novel published in 1905. This is one of those rare situations where both the book and the film are so brilliant that neither will ruin the other-- read, watch/watch, read-- it makes no difference. The story is deeply agitating; it is set in Old New York and follows Lily Bart as she falls, lower and lower, down the social strata from her high perch in upper class society.Lily's soul torturing struggle was one of the highlights. She had all the tools necessary to regain her social status, but instead of losing her self-dignity by using off hand means, she chose the higher road which meant misery. The title was taken from Ecclesiastes 7:4: \\"the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.\\"Everything about the film was beautiful, set design, costumes and especially the theme song: Alessandro Marcello's \\"Oboe Concerto in D Minor.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly made movie","review":"I loved the book, and didn't mind the rewriting of the storyline. But this was just a badly made film. The acting was terrible, for one. As much as I like Gillian Anderson, I felt she was out of her depth for the role. Everyone else (with the exception of Laura Linney) seemed to be \\"faking\\" it. The worst part was the transitions between scenes, which were too long, and usually without dialogue or music. I'm not looking for an action-packed film, but the transitions really added nothing to the flow or emotion of the film. There were some good moments, and the costumes were beautiful, but otherwise, I'm waiting for someone else to make a film adaptation of Edith Wharton's wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Imitation of the Book","review":"After reading the book, I was looking forward to a fine adaptation. What I got was a miscast Lily Bart, poor screenplay and actors saying their lines like school players. A great disappointment. If you are going to do Edith Wharton, you need to let her great words come through. They don't come anywhere near in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful casting","review":"This a favorite book of mine--I've read it twice--and I eagerly awaited the film version. What a disappointment.Biggest problem for me was poor casting, starting with the lead role. Gillian Anderson proves here why she's only been successful on a sci-fi television show. Dan Ackroyd and Anthony LaPaglia are both good actors, but both seemed out of place here. Only Laura Linney shined; the film would have been far better if she had played Lillie Bart. (And speaking of out of place, using old, ivy covered Scottish houses for old New York brownstones looked ridiculous.)Save your money and read, or re-read, Wharton's novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coconut Milk - But Buy It Locally","review":"This is the best brand of coconut milk/cream I have found.

The author is an acknowledged expert in the field and bases his study on the Roman Ritual of exorcism which has evolved over a 1,500 year period. The approach is chiefly historical. His examples are drawn from documented cases that have been accepted by the Church as genuine possession, as well as testimony from the Scriptures.In a conflict-ridden age, often filled with despair and faithlessness, Possessed by Satan reaffirms the ultimate powerlessness of Satan in the face of Good, as it offers the reader much-needed light on a phenomenon of increasingly serious inquiry."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST WONDERFUL","review":"Joachim is a genious ..appears in my film Monet's PalateMonet's Palate - A Gastronomic View from the Gardens of Giverny"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-Off","review":"You think you're recieving the paper back edition of the hardcover book represented.

That's Me Trying (featuring Aimee Mann and Ben Folds) is another surprise tune that I found quite appealing.

I mean, maybe it can be good to give some laughs like I did when I heard his \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" version of the other album and blew away my head laughing, but it's not \\"artistic\\", nothing to take so serious. The problem of people today is that most of them don't know to separate the things. I mean, c'mon, people, William Shatner is a great actor, the immortal Captain Kirk, and I'm a fan of him like this and the serie, and I respect him for that. But he's not a singer... I recommend him to enter the teletransport and go to planet Hollywood make some good productions again, instead of keep wasting his time with that failure of a musical career."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no quality of life when the patient is dead","review":"Just when you think Shatner has artistically hit rock bottom, he pulls a bunker buster out of his arsenal and starts blasting. Absolutely unlistenable. Shatner proves he is truly the Dr. Kevorkian of the spoken word, the Marquis de Sade of the digital age. A true scourge on the ears. Beam me up Scotty, no talent down here. He's dead, Jim.Still, the CD makes a nice tea coaster..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, what is wrong with you people?","review":"I can't believe what I'm reading here. The average is 4 1/2 stars for a WILLIAM SHATNER CD??? One of my crazy psycho friends bought this cd because he's a crazy psycho, and forced me to listen to it. I can't stress how awful it is. William Shatner cannot sing, simply put. He talks over an odd African beat on most songs and has some real random lyrics. At one point, he simply lists off dead people. It makes no sense. Now, I think random humor is funny, but this is not. If Shatner is trying to be funny, he failed. And if he is trying to be serious, he failed even more miserably. May God have mercy on your soul William Shatner."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has grown slowly into one of my favorites.","review":"I thought this album was going to be mediocre, and that was only because I knew Ben Folds had produced it (otherwise I may never have even given it a chance).On the first listen, I thought it was better than mediocre, and every time I listened to it after that, I fell more and more in love. It is one of my favorite albums on rotation now.There are a few imediate grabbers, like the colaboration with Rollins \\"I Can't Get Behind That\\", It follows the rollins comedy spoken word and yelling, but is a nice change. The deeper you get into the album, the more you uncover some really emotional gems like \\"Real\\".I find that albums that grow on me, are usually the ones that stick with me the longest, and so far that has been the case with this one. An album of redemption for Shatner, that shows his talent when cultivated by the right hands.I underestimated Ben Folds. He was able to \\"protect shatner from shatner\\" as he said, and help Shatner make a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really good album.","review":"I read the reviews, and had to find out for myself. You'll like this album a lot if you enjoy Leonard Cohen."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album. Seriously.","review":"How many of us can say that we listen to lyrics more than the melody? With this CD, the lyrics just grab me. They are amusing as well as thought-provoking and real. The music is great to. I haven't enjoyed a CD like this in quite this way before. Do yourself a favor and pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely unexpected","review":"When a friend told be about this album I shrugged it off with a \\"yeah right\\". Boy was I wrong. By turns rocking, hilarious and deeply insightful, it never loses its pace or feel. Musically it is punchy and sometimes challenging. And if nothing else, you can add the cover of Common People to your iTunes party playlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"a solid effort from a mature performer","review":"I bought this CD after hearing the title cut. I expect a \\"novelty\\" CD I would play a few times for friends, for a few laughs.Instead, I got a strong album from a mature entertainer.The lyrics, mostly written by Shatner himself, are filled with ironic and sometimes biting humor. Most of the cuts are collaborations, featuring some amazing performances from veteran vocalists and musicians, including Joe Jackson, John Mark Painter, and Aimee Mann.I found the middle of the CD a little weak, but there's enough great material to earn this CD a regular spot on my playlist.Approach \\"Has Been\\" with an open mind - it's worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relax and enjoy!","review":"Look, you simply cannot compare Shatner to anyone but himself. For all of you who are so mystified as to why we love Shatner for the wonderful ham and icon that he is, just chill. He doesn't take himself any more serious here than he ever has before. You either get the joke or you don't. Relax and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing - and no, I'm not high, or a Trekkie.","review":"This is unlike anything you've heard before. Spoken-word by Shatner, but with musical accompaniments from some popular music greats like Aimee Mann, Ben Folds, and Henry Rollins.It's not background music, and it may take a little getting used to, but his rhythym and pacing is addictive, and the undeniable influence of Ben Folds as producer keeps the music catchy and well within the realm of smart pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Kirk sings the blues","review":"Better than you ever believed it could be. Shatner's collaborations with the likes of Joe Jackson, Henry Rollins, Nick Hornby, Aimee Man and Brad Paisley are things of beauty. Overseeing it all is Ben Folds, who weaves it together as a true masterpiece. Just look at those names again. They could be working with anyone and it would be interesting. Working with Shatner and it is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"I heard about this album while listening to the Howard Stern Show when Bill Shatner and Ben Folds called in to annouce it. At first the idea seemed as if it was being played for laughs, but when you listen to the songs, they are heartfelt, honest and sincere. \\"Common People\\" is a flat out rock tune, \\"That's Me Trying\\" is a sad look at a father trying to reconnect with a long lost daughter he walked out on years ago. There are some great guest musicians on here like Aimee Mann and the tracks have that definete Ben Folds sound to them-which is great. I never thought that one of my favorite albums of the year would be by William Shatner, but here it is-and it's fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be Surprised!","review":"I listened to the free preview of the album on Windows Media Player after having read about it in Entertainment Weekly. The album is good! Sure Shatner can't sing, but it doesn't mean that with the help of Ben Folds they can't produce a good album. The songs are touching and some are fun. Yes, it's a good one to put on for your friends and then surprise them by telling them it's Shatner. And for those who give it no or one star - bet you didn't even listen to it and are cutting it down just because it's Shatner. Give it a chance. You'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shatner comes down to earth","review":"OK so you may have heard the Transformed Man and other campy work from Mr. Shatner but this is a whole different sound. This album manages to swing styles from pop-rock to country and then ballads to rants and all of it is fantastic. When a friend raved about it I was exceptionally sceptical but I am now a believer - it's great.Stand out tracks are 'That's Me Trying', 'Real' and 'It Hasn't Happened Yet'. It's hard to listen to 'What Have You Done' given how personal the song is. I could have done w/o the overly long 'Together' or maybe it's just a little too long. Overall this is a solid and varied work that I guarantee will pleasantly surprise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic genius!","review":"The man is a comic genius! Actually, besides being quite funny,there is some nice music on here too. There ARE a couple songsthat I could do without but everything else is very good.Obviously, I can't get behind Bill's \\"singing\\" but hestill does do a nice job of delivering some very crafty & unique lyrics.Also, there's a good Shatner/Henry Rollins duet on here. Very touching! ;P"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE Shatner!","review":"William Shatner is just the coolest guy. I love his acting style (He is FANTASTIC in Boston Legal!) and musically unique. His humor and wit are refreshing and brilliant. My favorite song is \\"Ideal Woman\\". I played it for my husband and we both agreed that we would play it as a theme for our wedding anniversary party. Simply AWESOME!

Great cd for a nice car ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny!","review":"I love this CD, it is so much fun to listen to. Who knew! The words just crack me up. I borrowed the CD from my mom who said it was good, and she was right. The music is good and so are the lyrics. Worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"Okay, let me say that I am a huge fan of William Shatner and Star Trek. I was pretty suprised when I found out he was coming out with an album, and I was quite anxious to hear it. Unfortunately I think if Mr. Shatner wants to get serious into the music scene needs to learn how to either PLAY AN INSTRUMENT OR SING. He doesn't even sing on the album at all! He just reads poetry while other people play and sing around him. There were parts that I liked, but a lot of the album I can't bear to listen to, I just can't take it seriously. It feels insincere to me. What is he doing? I would download this, but sorry Bill, I don't think I could spend my money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find the mixer and break his fingers","review":"\\"that's me trying\\" is awesome and simply fantastic ... if you could only hear it. BUT YOU CANT because the idiot mixer has the lame muxic louder than anything Shatner is saying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Surprisingly Insightful","review":"Warning!!! This album is not typical, not typical at all. Shatner does spoken word and guest artists typically sing (except for Henry Rollins who does his own spoken word thing). The music is extremely catchy and the lyrics are shockingly attention grabbing. Some are obviously highly personal, especially the country western influenced songs -- Real and Has Been while others are laugh out load funny. The arrangements are obviously Ben Folds and if you are a fan if his music, you will probably enjoy this album also. This is a fun, upbeat, entertaining album. Not bad for a Has Been!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shatner is the freakin' man!","review":"After having heard THE TRANSFORMED MAN, I was expecting more \\"so bad it's great\\" music. While this album does feature much of that, there is also some genuine emotion to be found here. Tracks like \\"That's Me Trying\\" and \\"Real\\" really stand out and are quite good. The cranky rant with Henry Rollins \\"I Can't Get Behind That\\" is probably my favorite. I really loved the end with Shatner screaming \\"I CAN'T GET BEHIND A FAT ASS!\\". Hysterical. Overall, it's at least worth a listen and Has Been is one of my favorite albums in recent memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, self-aware, at times insightful - great rainy day album","review":"First off, for all the people who are complaining that Shatner can't/doesn't sing, I think you are missing the point. An album does not necessarily have to be singing. Since when is spoken word not a viable option? This album doesn't pretend to be something it's not - it is, plain and simple, a spoken word album.Beyond that, I think many of the arrangements are beautiful, I think Shatner's delivery is classic and often powerful, and I think there are a wide range of emotions to be had here - from out-and-out funny to soulful to jaded to hopeful.In the end, it's just a man trying to express himself. And I can get behind that."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good that it's GREAT!","review":"My predecessors in this review-line have said it all quite well. Suffice it for me to add that I was expecting \\"so bad that it's good,\\" a la Shatner's \\"Rocket Man,\\" \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" & \\"Lucy in the Sky\\"...but found this new record to be beautifully conceived, written, performed, and produced. It's moving; it's funny; it's insightful -- & it makes me feel as if I know Bill, & as if he's more \\"Real\\" than most NON-celebs I know. Dare I say it? Yes, I do: masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise! Shatner and Folds deliver!","review":"The words drip with self-deprecating humor, tragedy, and regret. The music is stellar, a great collaboration between William Shatner and Ben Folds. This album is an unusual home-run. My personal album of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious - Buy it you wont be sorry!","review":"Funniest album I've Heard in a Long time - musically Ben Folds does A very Good job, and as for Shatners singing, well.....That's What makes it so funny- is that he doesn't shy away from poking fun of Himself, songs like \\"You'll have time\\" and \\"I Cant Get Behind That\\" which lyrically are written by Shatner are great laughs while other songs are very revealing as far as Shatner's own feelings. Great Album, I've Listened to it a Dozen times, and will many times more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed...","review":"I had gotten one of these several years ago and it worked fantasic.

Well documented, like a doctoral disertation, it does not lose the realism one expects in an otherwise scholarly work. I felt like I was next to him in the cockpit of the Spirit.

I trust the perspectives of crime experts on the kidnapping facts over a biographer enamored with his subject. Berg's may be a \\"good\\" read for some, but some of it borders on pure fiction, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"An In-Depth Study","review":"A. Scott Berg's biography of Charles Lindbergh is jam-packed with curious and interesting details, many reported for the first time. Although this is not a short book, there are no wasted pages. Berg dove headfirst into the sea of Lindbergh's life and came up with pearls in his fists. Berg has an eye for the dramatic, but he is also a top-drawer researcher. I had the impression of a historical scholar hard at work as I read his book.Berg's Lindbergh is a must-read for all those interested in the aviator's life, but I give him four stars because I thought other biograpers (Brendan Gill, et al.) did a better job of capturing Lindbergh's spirit.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]"},{"rating":"2","title":"engrossing account of a most enigmatic personality","review":"If Berg had written only of Lindbergh's antecedents and the flight to Paris with the world-wide adulation which followed, this still would have been a first-rate story. We are also given a most readable account of Lindbergh the husband, father, inventor, misguided statesman, and idiosyncratic individualist ---an engrossing read. This compliments the diaries and letters of his wife, and leaves the reader wondering how much she chose not to include. The reader who knows only of Lindbergh's flight and the kidnapping will learn much more about this multi-faceted man and his family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book, if a bit redundant in places","review":"A very fine book on Lindbergh. I have read many books on him and his wife down through the years, and have remained an avid reader of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's diaries and letters plus her other books. I find it disturbing that so many reviewers here think Lindbergh had something to do with Charles Jr.'s death simply on the basis of another book written recently for the sole purpose of making a buck. I will never believe that Lindbergh had anything to do with his first child's death, and I find it shameful that some authors will go to such lengths just to turn a profit. The best part of this new biography, for me, was in learning more about the Lindberghs' marriage after WWII -- that part was very different from what I had imagined, and very enlightening about two unique individuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author enamored of subject and loses objectivity.","review":"Just like he did with his Max Perkins book, Berg has once again become enamored with his subject and loses his objectivity. Berg dances around Lindbergh's outrageous anti-Semitism and love for Hitler by claiming that his private writings don't support the fact that he despised Jews. Berg never stops to think that Lindbergh edited his own private writings, knowing that it would someday be read by a biographer.Berg has shown this naivete before in his book on Max Perkins where he tries to portray notorious anti-Semite Thomas Wolfe as a cuddly character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, family approved biography","review":"The story of Lindbergh's unusual (strange) childhood and his courageous flight across the Atlantic were gripping. But overall Berg's biography of Lindbergh is a big BORE. So much nitty gritty detail....with no substance. Berg never gets to the heart of this man. In fact, Berg's portrayal of Lindbergh makes me wonder whether Lindbergh HAD a heart. He seemed oblivious to the horrors of Nazism and he appeared indifferent to his family. (So indifferent in fact that I now wonder whether Lindbergh could have been behind his son's disappearance and murder.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A BORE !!!!","review":"I want my money back.

However, I believe this book to be a monumental waste of money. Mr. Berg seems to be one of those compelled to adore his subject to death.Others have pointed out -- more or less correctly, I believe -- the various flaws that abound in Mr. Berg's effort. However, I feel that his incessant gushing over Mr. Lindbergh (arguably a flawed hero himself) turned me off about one-third of the way into the book. It became like that unfortunate aftertaste that one experiences when compelled to drink a second-rate bottle of wine or liquor because there is nothing else in the house. What tore it for me was the unbridled adoration Mr. Berg expressed in his writing about Ms. Lindbergh and her poetry.Couldn't finish the book, but then again, there were probably not enough car chases in it for me.Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible book.","review":"This so-called biography is tedious, redundant, and saddled with flowery writing. It has to be the over-hyped book of the year. It tells more about A. Scott Berg's lack of writing skills and investigatory ability than anything new about Lindy. Anyone who praises this book is simply a victim of \\"the emperor's new clothes syndrome\\" -- they're either friends of the \\"author\\" or too narrow-minded to realize they're praising trash passing as biography.

The treatment of Lindbergh's flight over the Atlantic and the baby kidnapping are dealt with very well. Berg leaves no doubt in the listerner that Hauptmann was the kidnapper. I would have liked more details on other parts of Lindbergh's life, though, but that's probably because the audio book is abridged."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a phenomenal life","review":"Scott Berg's biography of Charles Lindbergh is breathtaking in its detail and length; stretching from Lindbergh's Swedish forebears to his funeral in Hawaii. Yet, it never lags aided by the phenomenal life of its subject. Lindbergh's fantastic flying feat at age 25 propelled him to heights of acclain that few have or will ever know. He became friend to despots and presidents alike; a world-wide recognizable image with an impact upon flight that is felt to this day. The kidnapping and eventual murder of Lindbergh's first-born son, his non-interventionist stance on WW II and his continual abandonment of Anne and their remaining 5 children in the pursuit of further adventurous causes are treated sympathetically by Berg. To those of us generations removed from THE EVENT that had the world holding its breath, Berg's book reveals the story of a man who in spite of himself was flung onto center stage and while there, made the most of it dhul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read - a real page turner !","review":"This book deserves the Pulitzer Prize that it won ! Rarely do I find books of non-fiction that read as fast and engagingly as those fiction works by Grishham, Paterson, or Cornwell. Lindbergh is a terrific read. This man did far more than fly solo across the ocean...buy this book !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been twice as good at half its length","review":"Berg's book is slow going because of the writer's tedious, ponderous style. Some judicious editing would have made it a lot better read. He takes pages to say what could be written in a paragraph. The subject is interesting but the writer doesn't offer any real new insight into the enigmatic man."},{"rating":"1","title":"The audio version certainly was a disappointment.","review":"Maybe the book version is better. But I was looking forinformation on his infatuation with Hitler and the Luftwaffe. Nothing!The audio version does talk about the \\"America First\\" movement & his \\"alleged\\" anti-semitism but skipping entirely the many trips he made to pre-war Germany is really inexcusable. Either this is a really bad editing job or a whitewash of an important part of his life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nine years for what?","review":"I think a little skepticism is in order with biographies authorized by a deceased subject's family -- especially a subject as controversial as Charles Lindbergh. Subsequently, I didn't figure to find an objective analysis of Lindbergh's life and nor did I find one. Even more disturbing was Berg's apologetic tone in explaining Lindbergh's outright antisemitism and less than passing interest in eugenics. Why make sorry excuses for a dead man? America doesn't need another Colombus; we don't need another contrived American hero. Oops! I almost forgot: it doesn't pay to spend 9 years writing a family-authorized biography which would upset the way America looks at itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"hagiography and non-history","review":"There should be a zero or minus star category. Read the book a few years ago, only to find after the most superficial googling and fact-checking, the author omitted or did not find out about Lindbergh's multiple illegitimate children by two German women. Besides soft pedalling his notorious racism and anti-Semitism, how can this be considered a biography when such basic information is left out? Is there going to be a corrected edition?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't mention his illegitimate children","review":"This book is extremely readable, which is why everyone gives it 5 stars. But it fails to mention the fact that Lindbergh fathered at least 3 illegitimate children in Germany in the late 50's-60's. In 2003, 3 German siblings took a DNA test vs. one of Lindbergh's legitimate grandchildren and paternity was proved. Lindbergh kept their mother as a '2d family,' and he possibly fathered others. This book was extremely well-researched, so I can't see how Scott Berg can continue to sell this book without an update that talks about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivaldi as it should be","review":"What can be said? This is Vivaldi's music performed as it should be. The players' commitment to the music is obvious, their technique irreproachable.The interpretation is ALIVE, and brimming with passion. No single movement or note is played without conviction.This is how it should be - not like those now out of date dry and dull recordings of Vivaldi (or just about all baroque music...) that used to be the norm.These players really understand the music, and through their advocacy all who hear it will also understand.

This review is for those who are well versed in the poetry of Jim Morrison. This book is a crock and a waste of time. Although, it is listed very quietly as \\"fiction\\", many people will miss this and think they are viewing true \\"lost diaries\\" from the real Morrison. The text itself is a lame attempt to emulate Morrison's voice using overly used cliches and poor metaphors. At times the author tries desperately to insert the theme of \\"death\\" into the writing as Morrison used to so eloquetly do but it is really like my blind grandmother who has only one leg try to mimic Michael Jordan's fade-away jumpshot.

I thought. And then I thought - Is this real?? This book is not a biography of sorts or even a collection of Jim Morrison's diaries - It's an excellent exercise in the use of imagination! The many streams of thoughts that go in many directions - something indicative of an artist/musician - puts the reader in a state of mind that creates a multitude of emotion, and desire, and experience. The difuse quality could be viewed in any way, but I see it as the mind of a great musician.. whether it be Jim Morrison or NOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaries a scam?","review":"Those diaries of Jim Morrison are probably a forgery. It reminds me of the fake Hitler's diaries a few years back. Furthermore, according to a friend who visited the website for the book, he left a message in the guestbook expressing his doubts about the diaries, and it got changed by the webmaster into a positive review! Many witnesses were present with my friend when it happened. This, already, is a bad sign.I visited the website myself to read some excerpts of the book. The writing doesn't feel like Morrison. It doesn't have this sparkle you see in his poems, and believe me, I have ALL of Morrison's writings. It doesn't feel right.I think that poets in general, and Morrison in particular, deserve better than this. If you love the Lizard King, buy his books, they are all available at Amazon, and pass these \\"lost diaries\\". Go for the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Found","review":"Don't be conned like I was - I though I was buying genuine lost works by Jim Morrison. This is just pure baloney dreamed up by a fanatic. It's not even good! A man as troubled, vociferous and omnipresent as Jim, could not live in quite exile.

It's likely less watery than fresh pumpkin puree, but definitely more watery than Libby's or the generic brand at my grocery store.The texture upon opening this organic one was smooth while the other was irregular. It made my pies taste a bit bland as well, but I also made a mistake with the crust (too much water) so that had a hand in my pie disappearing in two days rather than one.I really liked the art, though. The label. It's nice.Basically, it won't make a fantastic pie, but it'll do. Especially if you would like organic.

Out of a package of 12 cans, only 3 were not dented in the package I received -- and I see from other reviews that I am not the first to experience this. I wish I'd read the reviews before placing my order.

I love my iPod. So I thought, \\"Hey, a match made in heaven!\\" Not so much. The audio quality is quite poor - reduced volume, static, and frequent popping sounds. Furthermore, the iPod controls on the TomTom are very limited. For example, I often shuffle an artist or genre, but you can not do that on the TomTom. Also, I listen to a lot of podcasts, but there is no podcast option on the main iPod menu on the TomTom, only audiobooks. And, when you connect the iPod to the TomTom, the iPod locks up so you can only control the iPod via the TomTom. I would not recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor sound quality.","review":"I bought this product a couple days after getting my TomTom 510. Great idea and I like it for the most part, but I experience the same problem with popping and crackling noises. The connection to my iPod is fine and it plays through the speakers fine, but the quality is a shame. I don't know if a software update by TomTom will fix this or if it's a hardware issue, but I hope it gets resolved. I love the unit and the iPod and phone features too much for this sound issue to ruin it. I'm hoping they come out with an update to address the missing podcast menu at the same time fixing the sound issue. Right now not really worth it, but could be with a fix from TomTom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Add-On","review":"I am not sure why so many other people had issues with this device.

I have a 720, and the user interface leaves you going through too many gyrations to make this something you want to do every time you turn on your car.

I viewed the navigation part as a bonus. An iPod control box from Pioneer and a bluetooth handsfree solution from Sony Ericsson would have cost me about half not including installation. Things were looking good until I plugged in the iPod. It sounds like an old turntable with a dusty record. I thought there had to be something wrong so I contacted Tomtom. They said it had to be my windshield mount. They sent me a new one. No help there. Then they wanted it sent in for service. I did. It took 5 weeks. No help there either. I am thinking it is a software fault in the operating system, or the CPU in the unit is just not up to the job. Now for the second big let down. It doesn't charge the iPod!!!!!

Combine his inability to write a proper sentence, with intellectual dishonesty, and lack of any worth while scholarship, this book proves once again that anti-catholics have no business speaking about or judging the Catholic faith. They are not qualified. The author contradicts himself throughout this book and shows that he lacks even a very basic understanding of the Catholic faith. Sure, fundamentalists can continue to sustain themselves in their own little closed circle, refusing to have their claims examined, refusing to engage in discussion and think with intellectual honesty, but they will continue to ever be taken seriously by the Catholic community, and much less, by the academic community. This book is an insult to people who do real work in theology and biblical studies, both Protestant and Catholic alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catholicism from an Anti-Catholic!","review":"An absolute waste of money and time to read this pack of lies.Do yourself a favor, if you're really interested in learning the truth of Catholicism, pick up a Catholic Bible and a Catechism of the Catholic Church and study them.

But each chapter has a different focus on a unique doctrinal belief or practice of the Roman Church. The author uses a testimony of the experiences of individuals and the problems they had with the Roman Church. The major Roman doctrine or practice is then briefly highlighted and critiqued with the applicable Scriptural viewpoint. A good easy to read presentation of some of the unique Roman Church doctrines and practices that will give one a general understanding of both basic Christian doctrine and the traditions of the Roman Church from which these unique beliefs evolved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe them","review":"As a Catholic who works with top Catholic theologians, this book is incredibly weak. They have no understanding of what the Catholic Church actually teaches. They give very little Biblical references. For each issue they pick one verse and proclaim that it must mean the Catholic Church is wrong. Well with every one verse that they give, I could give about twenty verses to support the Catholic faith. It is true that people are not being educated properly in the Catholic faith, but that means we have to fight harder and search for the truth ourselves in the Bible and through Tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leightweight","review":"Many of the reviews listed compare this book, and it's protagonist Sunny Randall, with Parker's Spenser books. This is the first Robert Parker book I've read, so I'm not going to try to make that comparison. Instead, I will give you my impression as an out-and-out newcomer. There was one word that kept flashing through my head as I was reading this book. That word was \\"lightweight\\".The mystery, involving two murders never really became intriguing enough for me to care who committed them. The story never gathered any momentum nor reached any heights. Rather than building up suspense and reaching some thrilling conclusion that had me on the edge of my seat, the story just petered out. No high point to speak of.Sunny appears to be a Stephanie Plum character - only capable and with more boring friends. The shtick with the dog struck me as too cutesy. I'd call this a good beach book, a nice quick read to kill some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dull","review":"This whole book could have been written in the thousand words allotted for these Amazon reviews. It would've been less painful to read and there still would have been more than enough references to Sunny's ugly dog and friendships and relationships which still wouldn't enhance a sluggish, twisted, and thoroughly uninteresting plot.The characters were more like sitcom characters and the real mystery here was why Parker even bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a boring story !","review":"I had enjoyed the first Sunny Randall book \\"Family Honor\\", but this second novel is definetely the last one I shall read. The main character is OK, she is witty, she has a strong personality, but some people surrounding her in this story are just not convincing. That Mary Lou Goddard, a so-said feminist, lesbian, etc. who cannot even smile... i hope i never meet one like that !And apart from Spike and Richie, the ex-husband, all other characters are not even funny. I also felt sorry i did not have a sister, well after I read this book, thank God i do not have one like Elizabeth Randall !The entire plot could be summarized on a poststamp ! booooooooooring !"},{"rating":"2","title":"SUNNY RANDALL BOOK 2","review":"I love the Spenser series and I like Jesse Stone and I like Sunny Randall, ok?

PERISH TWICE is the second book, like the first one better ( I have enough of Sunny's sister Elizabeth to last a life time, and was almost at wits end with Julie but the story was good. Hired to find the stalker on prominent lesbian, Boston P I Randall goes above and beyond. Good twists and Parker's great back up cast, like Richie and Spike and even Marcus. Going to book three. RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"I've never wrote a review but i wanted to share some comments. I read the first book in the series and i liked it but Perish Twice left me less than impressed. Am I the only one who wants to know what happened to Millie from the first book? There should of been at least some mention of her in the second book, since she was still living with her at the end of the last one. And why does this investigation end pretty much the same as the last one? I guess I'll read one more but if it doesn't get better it will probably be the last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parish Twice, Parker finally fails.","review":"I own 23 hardbound Robert Parker books, and I rate 22 of them 5 star, however, he failed in his latest attempt when he wrote Parish Twice. He introduces a new private detective, Sunny Randall, a female detective. She seems to be a very poor remake of Spencer, and she fails at that. In the novel we meet two other main characters, a good friend and her sister, both of which you cannot stand. They are flat not likeable in any way. The conclusion of the book is also unsatisfactory in that nothing really is resolved. The bad guys get away with it and the good guy (Sunny) is also unhappy. Over all this book does not leave a good taste in your mouth. I enjoy female detective novels, but Mr. Parker needs to stay with Spencer and keep his fans happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashing old hash","review":"After delighting in \\"Family Honor\\", I was expecting great things from PI Sunny Randall's second outing. I was bitterly disappointed to find what amounts to little more than a contemporary rewrite of \\"Looking for Rachel Wallace\\" solved by a female incarnation of Spenser. The plot is so banal that when I finished, all I could think was \\"Geez, who cares?\\" The rest is fillers of psychobabble, neuroses, and non-believable relationship problems. Shoot, the sanest and most believable character was the dog. Maybe Parker should ditch Sunny and let the dog solve the next case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perish the Thought (of reading this book)","review":"Sunny Randall, a Boston P.I. (like her Parker stablemate Spenser), is a smart-alecky streetwise ex-cop. Hired to provide security for a lesbian activist, Sunny quickly finds herself involved with a prostitution ring, Boston's Irish mob, and multiple murders. One gets the feeling Parker intended for his sleuth to be charming, but her character misses the mark. There is too much changing of POV, and way too much non-essential filler stuff--and not nearly enough mystery or action. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Robert B. Paker...but...","review":"I really really wish he'd stick to just writing Spenser. Sunny is OK. To be honest, if anyone other than Parker had written this book, I'd be happy with it. However, I've come to expect more from Parker. Sunny truly is Spenser in a dress, other than a few crying jags from Sunny, there's very little difference. They have the same asides, the same thoughts, the same obsession with clothes. He cooks, she paints. He has a wonderful girlfriend, she has a wonderful ex-husband. And so on and so on. I wish Sunny could find her own voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spenser in drag?","review":"Really, this is Parker's male persona stuffed into a petite female form. It was like reading Spenser as a weird female impersonator. This may have been my own limitation as a reader, after enjoying so many \\"Spenser\\" novels -- but it was frankly unsettling and unsavory. Yuck. Parker is not convincing, writing in the female \\"voice.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I applaud Parker's efforts to develop new characters outside of the Spenser series, but this book fails to engage or provide any of the interest or suspense present in that body of work. You have to write what you know I suppose, but the parallels between Sunny and Spenser are too strong not to see this as an extension of the same character (same job, same city, same philosophies). The problem with this book is that most of the surrounding characters and flat and innane. The only engaging characters (The Burkes) get little development. If you are looking for a departure from the Spenser series, put this one aside and read Parker's excellent perspective of the Earps and Tombstone in \\"Gunman's Rhapsody\\" or one of his Chandler novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting tired!","review":"Well, even Mr.Jordan had some bad games. Mr.Parkers second novel featuring protagonist Sunny Randall is a pure air ball. I really liked \\"Family Honor\\", despite the similarities to \\"Early Autumn\\", however this is border line self plagerism.This book is so close to \\"Looking for Racheal Wallace\\" that you would be far better off going and buying a second copy of said book. The issues here, sexual harrasment, sexual identity, are right out of \\"Wallace\\". Sadly, even Mr.Parkers trademark banter wears thin. I have been a fan of almost all of this authors work, though the last two Spenser novels were not up to par, but this travesty is literary drek. Mr.Parker has been at this genre since the early 70's, with a yeoman like outpouring of work every year, but it may be time to retire his pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perish Twice perishes","review":"I regret writing this; I'm a great fan of Parker's and have everything he's written. The first Sunny Randall book was great; a nice transition to a woman protagonist, as good as John Sanford's, for instance. In Perish Twice Parker, and his publishers, are trying to cater to what they think is the female market. The result is a mish-mash with nearly no plot. The dialogue might have saved the book, but now almost everyone is cracking wise. Add to this that the dialogue takes up a LOT of the space and the book is therefore barely book length, and the cost of the hardbound adds insult to injury. Too bad; another good writer scuttled for marketing purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRE Exam Verbal Workbook","review":"I needed some extra help boosting my score on the verbal section, and this book did the trick! It was very thorough, and the strategies they give really worked.

The only thing I can figure is that Morgan was himself an extremely boring person -- why else would Strouse spend 85% of the text on peripheral people and events only remotely connected to Morgan? If you are interested in things like: why Grover Cleveland's potential successor, William C. Whitney was opposed to the gold standard, then by all means, read this book!

Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I've been playing flight simulators/dogfighting games for over 10 years. I can honestly say this is the most frustrating I've ever played. The controls are like lead and the missions become difficult right off the bat. Poor instructions and objective add to the frustration, as you will spend a great deal of time just figuring out WTF you are supposed to do. I had to resort to walkthroughs just to survive the training mission. The game is also buggy and froze on me more than once in the brief 2 weeks I wasted my time on it. Save your money and check out the Ace Combat series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is Stressful Enough","review":"If you enjoy getting angry at video games, by all means, run out and purchase a copy of this fiendish attempt at a flight simulation.The Wii controller is no match for a proper joystick and the game does not include rudder control for proper flight dynamics. You'll find yourself drifting in the air trying to get a bead on your opponents, while trying to beat an impossible deadline to shoot them all down.I snapped my disc in half after numerous attempts in the Henderson field mission: try landing your plane while it's on fire and the controls are shot up. If you're using the simulation settings, your plane will not fly straight and the arcade settings aren't any better. You'll end up making a crater regardless of how careful you set it down.Life is stressful enough; I'll stick to X-Plane for my Mac, made by intelligent programmers who understand real flight dynamics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard!!!!","review":"This game was hard!!!! Wii needs to improve before this game was published. It took forever to pass the first level and I was stuck on the third level. I think this game was made too hard.

We were unable to get it for him because it contained inappropriate language. Wish companies would produce clean games we could purchase that did not contain swearing. In the last few years we've had to throw away games, and return this one due to inappropriate language. Too bad this has to be included as a part of the experience. Many families don't want it. My son refuses to play games that contain swearing, and has commented that you used to be able to turn it off, but not anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK as a Game; Not a Flight SImulation","review":"If you just want to blast around the sky shooting things... this is your game.If you are concerned with historical performance, forget it.The Gloster Gladiator out performs The F2A Buffalo in this game ...In real life the Buffalo was significantly faster, better armed and armored (any beats none), rolled better and had some 150 to 300 more horsepower.It's only one example... another is the ease with which the Hurricane II eliminates the Ki-43 Hayabusa.Don't the Britsih pilots of WW 2 wish that was the case, as they suffered badly from the Hayabusa's performance.Hopefully someone will make a decent flight simulator for this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it PC games old time were better","review":"In a word it sucks. You have to hit all targets or start from scratch. Mine starts diving and will not pull up no matter what and crashes. Tried different controls etc same thing. I prefer the older PC flight games.

The nice thing is you can turn the sound and subtitles off, so that removes the problem. Otherwise my boys (10 & 7) love this game. The controls can be a bit tricky at first, but I would guess it's nothing a normal gamer couldn't master quickly (my kids did)."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"nearly completed the whole game except for the tricky parts and difficulty level as the game progresses. Sometimes really put off by the difficulty. Have to search the web to pass levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great...","review":"The game play is difficult and hard to maneuver. I couldn't get past the second level no matter how hard I tried. The game would freeze up a lot and I'd have to completely restart the Wii to get it going again. I like the idea of the game, but the game itself is a disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bottom Line","review":"The bottom line is, for Wii and for $20, this game is pretty fun, especially if you like flight sims or World War 2. Will you be amazed by the graphics, no. Are the flight controls fun, absolutley. The story line is long, probably 15 or so missions, with some being quite challenging, especially landing a broken aircraft. Don't worry about what this game isn't and enjoy it for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away! Run Away!","review":"As a long-time computer user and game player ... and one who loves flight simulation and flight-based games, I have one word for this game: junk. The basic problem is the Wii controller/nunchuk setup. Unresponsive would be a generous way to describe the controls. Look, if you can't make tight turns (against enemies who seemingly have the most maneuverable planes ever built--especially against the pigs the game gives you), you won't last long in a dogfight. The aircraft (because of the limitations of the controller) handle like garbage scows, instead of thoroughbred fighters. The running commentary gets REALLY irritating, and the camera shoot missions are far too \\"challenging\\" to be fun--just annoying and tedious. My recommendation? Stay away from this game. Or better yet...run away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Build with anti-american accent...","review":"Player can get through all levels until reached battle of Guadalcanal.There is no way to win that since at last check point aircraft became uncontrollable. Basically it is controlled by the game and user has no way to win it.Even if user gets aircraft on the ground as I did (checkpoint reached) - it exploding and you need to go all over again...Fun in first 3 levels, not bad in ace mode or arcade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Disappointed that the makers of this game felt it necessary to use The Lords name in vain during game play.

We used this guide along with 2 other well-known guides, but the Bradt guide was without any doubt the best of the three. If you like to get off the beaten track (without necessarily missing out on the highlights), this is the guide you're looking for! It also includes reader reports and funny anecdotes. One negative point: the maps are far from perfect.

It seemed to be written more for people who like to read about travel and fantasize that they will trek in the Madagascar wilderness than for those who actually find themselves trying to find lodgings after a late night taxi-brousse stop. Far too many personal anecdotes and far too little practical info (and what there was is not always accurate -- FYI, the lemur sanctuary is much farther from Andasibe than the map would lead you to believe)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Probably the best book on Madagascar ever written.

It's perfect for my short,thin, fine hair. It probably would not work for longer, thicker or more full-bodied hair. I would imagine it would tangle easily and would not be powerful enough.That being said, it does have a downside. It overheats fairly easily and spontaneously shuts down as a result; and this seems to happen more frequently the older the styler becomes. However, I've learned to always have a back-up one just in case. This may seem like a major issue for some people, but I find that this type of styler works the best for my hair, so once I became smart enough to always have a second one on hand, I don't find it a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy at all.

I usually air dry my hair until it is almost dry and then finish styling it with this product. The curls and waves hold beautifully. If my hair dries to much, i just brush through it briefly with a damp brush and then style. I have never owned a hairstyling product I liked better.

I have thick hair which doesn't dry very quickly. My hair tangles very easily and this one does a great job. It really does not tangle. The release button allows the hair to come out easily.

This dryer feels really cheap, like there's hardly anything going on in the handle (on the positive side, it makes this really light), but it doesn't put out a lot of air or heat. It also gives off a nasty off-gassing smell even after using it multiple times. My hair (straight, fine-ish) has also gotten tangled in this as I've tried to release the curl, and not just a little tangled, but ripping-hair-out-by-the-roots tangled. My husband even had to help me get it out of the back of my hair once.The few times I've been able for it to hold and release successfully, it does leave a decent curl/wave on small sections of hair, but it's not worth the hassle or the nauseating smell.

They were very helpful and sent me another brush which also doesn't rotate. I called the company to find out whether they were both defective or if the description was wrong. I was told that the brush does not rotate. Both Amazon and Vidal Sassoon were extremely helpful when I contacted them but I am very disappointed not to have a rotating brush.

I did buy a Salon Edition brand in the 3/4\\" size, but it is not as good a product as Sassoon. It works fine, but the adjustment switch from low heat to high heat is not ideal - a bit clumsy and rough to move.

Thankfully, my friend was able to cut the brush up into little pieces around the hair and save me from having to do that, but I still lost about two fists full of hair.

Seems the design of the attachement of the clips are on an angle that interferes with this saw's legs- I could see a better design, but I was able to make it work with just a little shaving of the ends. The operation of the pins is fine. All fixed from previous reviewers comments. The stand needs a better way to stand up on its own. The adjustable extension wings are not as nice as the DeWalt or Ryobi but work. This stand is simple, lightweight and rugged. Not very refined or polished, just a solid stand.

My second grade son could design, layout, write and instruct better than these directions for assembly. I also agree with other comments regarding the saw mount. Maybe I'll like this stand better after I start using it, but right now I'm too tired to try it out after my 6 hour fiasco with assembly.

It was a 4-hole mounting instead of a three hole, which required an additional configuration.--Misleading. Also the mounting of the saw on the rails and the picture which it showed was,I believe,wrong and resulted in the saw falling off of the rails and cracking the case of the new saw, which I had to tape together. The stand itself is ok but I would rather buy one I saw at another retail store designed for the 3 hole model and had a better grip on the saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"PM4400","review":"Received the PM4400 stand last week. Had it assembled and ready to go in about an hour. I agree with one of the earlier reviews that the assembly instructions could have been a bit better but I think that most everyone should be able to get through them OK. The stand is solid and sturdy and I really like the saw mounting system employed. If you're using the Bosch 3915 saw with this stand be forewarned that you'll have to remove the little plastic feet on the bottom of the saw for it to mount properly on the rails. The rail lock knobs are a really tight fit with the Bosch but do function properly. My only complaint thus far is that the extension arms move around a bit when trying to adjust them for the proper height. Turning the locking knobs tends to change the height of the end supports but that is easy enough to compensate for. Overall a nice product and you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing item","review":"I was not able to use this stand since the two aluminum extrusions were missing.

That was months ago and I have yet to see the paint. As for the product, it's great for light molding but the extender arms are not strong enough to support anything beyond crown molding and it's difficult to release the leg buttons when you install the wheels on the frame. The wheels can be installed on the legs but that makes it hard to fold the legs without laying the saw on the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy Stand","review":"Great stand. I have used it now for about a month with my 12\\" Bosch. Previously had a sliding 10\\" on it and was great with that too. It has been very sturdy.

In typical Howard fashion, the male is dominant and the female is a doormat, and after a night of hot sex decide they're soul mates.Howard's dated story reads like an entry in an anthology, and is simply not good enough to warrant a separate printing.

Some more prestige classes and feats of course but most of the prestige classes are geared toward NPCs than players. Although there are some good toys for undead hunters as well. Much more new monsters in here but very well done. The small section on undead PCs bears mentioning as it was well done and if a DM wants to allow it, the idea is intrigueing, not something I would want to pursue myself but the option is there. All in all a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This book, I think is more useful to me that Draconomicon. Dragons are only really useful as a foe later in campaigns. Undead are useful for any occassion. What I like about this book is that it makes the undead more versatile and creepy in game. The new spells and undead monster classes allow you to tailor your undead to fit any situation. I like the new prestige classes here, especially the 14 level True Necro. Unlike most prestige classes, you're epic before your done with this one. That's great because I think its possible for some characters, if you're careful, to pick up 3 of some of the other prestige classes before 20th level.Anyway, this book is great for DMs. Players need not look at it and I would encourage them to leave it alone so that the DM can surprise them... and make the game better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge this book by its cover.","review":"I don't have much to add here.

Breathtaking? Sublime? I'm not sure words have been invented for it.It was my first Chanticleer CD, recommended by a music club, and it certainly hasn't been my last, but it's still my favorite. I love it so much that I listen to it year-round--even in the heat of summer, when I put on this CD, it's Christmastime to me by the end of \\"Es ist ein Ros\\".The voices are simply amazing. It sounds like angels singing. I think part of the haunting, resounding sound that sets this CD apart from other choral CDs (and even from other Chanticleer ones) is that it was recorded in a cathedral, so there are some amazing acoustics. I don't know all that much about music theory, so I'm sure my words seem amateurish and maybe a little silly, but this is a truly glorious CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing We Christmas","review":"There's not much more I can add to the glowing reviews of this CD except to say that I'm surprised that \\"A un nino llorando\\" doesn't get a mention!

He stopped doing that around age 2, when he had his crayons and markers taken away for a month or so for coloring on the walls. It comes completely clean when you wash it, and is just alot of fun.

A loose (in more ways than one) collection of 100 tales, this book was written to keep Italian maidens entertained during the Rennaissance. Want a highly amusing tale? Take your pick. An idea for a prank? There's plenty! Including pranks that have backfired...... This book is also loaded with rather bawdy if not outright shameless tales. Do not be mistaken by the literary merit of this masterpeice! It is indeed rather naughty, while something you could read for an English class.

Having read \\"all\\" of his works, when Matthew Greenblatt first presented this book, it really changed the standard on how to access Ramana. So much of Ramana's teachings are visual, or in silence, that, more than virtually any other teacher, this is a uniquely powerful way to convey his messages. If you buy no other book on Ramana, buy this one - everything is there. Among many \\"hard core\\" Ramana Maharshi folk, this has rapidly become the great favorite. Buy it - it can change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembering the Self","review":"I would recommend this book to every spiritual seeker of truth. The truth already IS,there is nothing to add, and Ramana Maharishi's teachings help you to discard all that is not the truth of your being. All you need do is remember who you really are. And then your Beautiful Self stands revealed. I would also Recommend The wisdom teachings of Nisargardatta Maharaj, and also all materials by David R Hawkins(Power VS Force, Eye of I and (I)This will help you to avoid the pitfalls and spiritual trapps that can delay true spiritual attainment.

Don't blink or you'll miss it!","review":"Considering that the book was billed as a great adventure novel, where is the action?

The author's research is obvious, not skillfully woven in (to use a cliché), and often relegated to parentheses.So far, I say, Get started with the story! It's like a military and political soap opera. Maybe things will pick up once, or if, the action begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Set It Down","review":"Another terrific story by my favorite author. The folks in various places where I read this, were wondering about my laughing and chuckling. An excellent adventure with wonderful subtle humor. Griffin continues to have great research for the authenticity of people, places, and events. This is such a relief from the cookie cutter events of certain other best selling adventure authors. I can't wait to find out what happens to Pick and Capt. Weston. Quickly, where is that next book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As spellbinding as the first seven!","review":"It seems that I have waited forever for this book which I consumed with fervor in just a day and a half. Now I am left on the edge of my seat, longing for the next one.

My favorite author delivers as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"A typically excellent read!","review":"As usual, Griffiin has come up with another story in his excellent series about the Corps. He has answered some questions that I have had about other characters from the first book in the series, but, unfortunately, does not follow through with the outcome of the action as he has in his other books. However, there is a \\"hook\\" so that I will be on pins and needles for his next book in the series so as to determine what happens next!!!!! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of paper and time.","review":"How can Griffin write 500+ pages about a so-called adventure yet devote less than 100 to the actual adventure itself? Those who enjoy learning about military bureaucracy will love this book. Those who look for character and plot development will do better to buy any Clancy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No-Danger, Little story, lots of Inconsistencies","review":"I've read most of Griffins books and have enjoyed the character development in them. Not this time, there was no character development. There was very little story telling - mostly rehashes of previous books. And the rehashes had so many parts in conflict with other books in the series that I question the competence of the author or editor of the series. Does anybody read these books before they are published? If someone goes to the trouble of developing compelling characters - why destroy that effort through such laziness? Griffin would do himself and his readers a great service by hiring someone to proof the next book and catch the outrageous conflicts. Wait for the paperback on this book - its easier to stomach the poor quality when you only spend $7.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out With a Whimper","review":"I was greatly disturbed to find out that the Corps series is finished. The main characters at the beginning were exciting and very intersting to watch mature over time. McCoy was the main guy, a true everyman who became a leader in spite of himself. As the series developed, I, as a former Marine, wondered, with all the dalliances going on, how we ever got anything done-much less won the war. This theme runs through all Griffin's series that I have read. It would be better if there was more battlefield and less bedroom action. This last novel has left us all hanging with no end in sight. Come on, wrap this thing up. Let us know what happened to the real heroes, Stecker, Pick, McCoy and the other junior officers and enlisted. Not one more word about Malcolm Pickering, let him fall face down in his \\"Famous Grouse.\\" I'm truly intersted in the Banning dilemma and how Pick and Weston resolve their differences.

If you have ever known a Marine, If you are a Marine \\"For once a Marine always a Marine\\" Then this book very well could touch you as it has me. I have read the Corps series Several times. WEB Griffin's Tell of a man, Under dog and loner for the most part grabs you. The supporting Personalities and story line are gripping. I could not stop reading, forgetting about bed times, forgetting about lunch. You will enjoy this Series of books if your not a Marine, You will find yourself pulled into the story, shaking your head YES and Fighting along side these hero's if you are a Marine.Few books cause emotions to spring free from deep within, The Corps touches the forever Marine deep inside of me. Even after 22 years after taking off my Uniform for the last time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ.","review":"WEB Griffin is one of the premier writers of military history of our time. The only problem I have with his \\"Corps\\" series is that his editor does not read with the same attention to detail that most avid readers do. The only problem I had with this book, was the total transformation of Zimmerman's personality. Come on Mr.Griffen, do us all a favor and re-read what you've already written, so that the little details that make your characters so much fun are not lost between books. All in all, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent continuation of the series.","review":"Griffin again is able to write a very interest book that you won't be able to put down (I was up till one o'clock finishing it the first day it came out). He is able to tell a great war story were the war is completely in the background. I don't think a single shot was fired in anger in the whole book. But, once again there is Griffin's usual problem with continuity. Things change in the series that any other author or editor wouldn't allow to change. Example in the first book of the series McCoy is a Irish Catholic and in the seventh he is Scotch Protestant. I have talked to other fans and authors, such as Joel Rosenburg, and we think he actually does this on purpose. And I have to admit that once you get use to it you actually enjoy being able to catch the changes. Griffin is probable my favorite author, at least I get driven more nuts waiting for his new books to come out than anyother, and I recommend his books to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you wanting to know more, hard to put down","review":"After having read all of Mr. Griffins books, this is one in a long line that gets read again and again. He has followed thru with details of the actual war and has not forgotten the characters he has created in previous books. This book like the others make one anxious for the next book in line, you really want to know how the story will end, although we all know who won the war, but the characters come alive in time and space and as usual Mr. Griffin has left the ending open as more stories can be told. An author of the very best who does not overlook any detail. For a reader of history this book or series of books is a must to get the true feeling of everyman in war."},{"rating":"2","title":"The incredibe journey continues","review":"This series is the best one I think I have ever read. With characters that have been developed in earlier books coming back in the series with a little back story for those who have not read the previous books. All books in the series can stand on their own, but read in order, they tell an incredible tale. I am always checking to see when the next book will be available and preorder it the day I see it. I devour them, they are so well written and interesting, worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing end","review":"I have read the entire Corps series, back to back. FIrst off, this was a dissapointing read as it wasn't the Corps, but the OSS. Second, I am tired of Brig Gen Pickering being the central character. I was much more interested in what the enlisted and lower officers were up to, rather than Pickering's big boy problems.I wondered what happened to Jack Stecker's son - he was a great character. Would have liked to see more of Pick, although was dissapointed that he turned out to be more of a playboy than a Marine...but I loved the interaction between Pick and McCoy and Stecker's son.But what I really object to is that although I understand this is the final book of the series; it didn't wrap up all the loose ends. Sorry but I want to know what happened with Carolyn once she found out Mrs. Banning had been rescued. Who got Martha? How did Weston solve his woman problem? Did McCoy marry Ernie? Did McCoy get out of the Gobi Desert? Did Donovan incur the enduring wrath of the President??"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, I can't wait for 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.....99","review":"WEB Griffin does it again.

If so, I hope it doesn't last - the story line is good enough. I also admit that I'll be standing in line for the next book even tho' I suspect Griffin is toying with my emotions.

The only drawback is that once it loses its charge - you have to wait several hours before it recharges. In other words, you can't plug it in and use it. It only works if it's charged.

The thought of having to reinstall all those programs, modify all my settings, etc., was too depressing to contemplate.I immediately went looking for an external hard drive to back up both my desk top and laptop computers. An external drive would allow me to easily move the HD between the two machines. The USB connection is easy, and with WinXP, there were no driver issues. The instructions with the HD told exactly how to partition the drive, so I set it up with a partition for each PC. I was up and running in no time.A good value for a name brand piece of equipment.

Second, I thought it would be an hour of lights, but they used at least 20 minutes or so of filler footage of these weird looking winter \\"paintings\\" or postcards or something, and what lights footage they did use, was very amateurish and they re-used throughout the program.

He teaches 80 VERY catchy licks on this video. The other two guys, not so much. Greg Harrison teaches his segment using a 9-string guitar, whick is RIDICULOUS. Most players don't use one of those, so it makes it difficult to understand. His licks are not nearly as catchy as Troy's either, in my opinion. My approach to videos is this- if I learn a couple of killer licks off the video, I feel satisfied. Anything to break out of the box. If this sounds like you, go for it! Troy Stetina has been around for a long time, and I found his book \\"Speed Mechanics for Lead Guitar\\" to be one of the most informative and useful books ever printed for rock/metal style lead. Learning licks from someone else is a great way to get a fresh approach and perspective on the scales and licks you already know, and Troy's segment in this video IS a goldmine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Unfortunately there are no subtitles (I'm an italian buyer) but explanations and videos are very clear.

That it does, therefore losing any value from the S-video since the separate signals are coarsely combined by the converter. In fact, the s-video done with this adapter is far worse than just the regular composite output!For all intents and purposes, this DVD player provides NO useable s-video signal!

The AC adapter broke. The charge indicator light on the battery pack doesn't work. None of the adapters fight right.

It was delivered quickly, and the packaging was good. The battery charged in less than 5 hours, rather than the stated 6. Everything you need is included. It works great in the car, out by the pool, in the house, everywhere. I would have given 5 stars, but the external speakers are pretty tinny, even when using the built in equalizer. Use the headphones...it will sound better than at the movie theater. Additionally, although the picture quality is very, very good, it is not perfect.

When he was tiny we would lay a hand towel over the seat to give him some cushion, but stopped using that after he was around 3-4 months.

The only thing I know for shure is that there is a problem with the unit because I can\`t access the main menu but that is as far as I can tell.My other alternative was the Tvisto unit.....wich was almost the same, but probably with the firmware in English, so you can follow the instructions on the screen.Javier"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"THE SECTION ON GERMANY WAS DISGUSTING.THE CZECH REPUBLIC NOT DISGUSTING JUST VERY POORLY DONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stroll down memory lane","review":"We bought this CD to play at a family reunion honoring my wife's 91-year-old mother, an 87-year-old uncle and two aunts of the same generation.

This adds extra weight and doesn't feel securely attached (doesn't look good either). An AC adaptor and car adaptor are provided to power the device, but I bought it for my commutes on the subway...Aside from the power situation I found the screen quality to be poor: very pixelated, motion was jerky, colors were off, and there was a dead pixel in the middle of the screen.

It is possible that I accidentally tore both of them when removing the cardboard packing material but I don't think so, having been warned by previous reviews.

I noticed that my paper money would be a little damp at the end of the day - but not completely soaked, and it wasn't as if the whole wallet had completely filled with water. Since everything else in there was a plastic card, and merchants are still willing to accept wet money, it wasn't a huge issue.

It'll also hold a couple of regular keys, but not if it has a big hotel fob on it. The lanyard works well, and the pouch will fit into a swim trunks pocket as well. It should be fine for river rafting, kayaking, hotel pool, etc. For snorkeling, I'll probably place any cash in a small ziplock first, as a backup. Not sure if it would work for scuba diving, considering the pressure. I'd probably squeeze as much of the air out of it before sealing.

The text quickly moves into derivations for the analysis of extrusion equipment; and without this background one will easily be lost in the math. That being said, it has pretty much everything a practicing extrusion engineer would need. I haven't had the chance to read through the entire book, however thus far have found the screw design quite helpful in the understanding of the process (as a working engineering in plastic extrusion).

DeLint has an ability to merge mundane 'reality' and the realm of Faerie that is absolutely unmatched. This novel is one of his best; an amazing tale of fantasy, suspense, magick, and the power of Nature. The story is of a mother and daughter who have just moved into a very rural area of Canada, the man down the road whose past is threatening to catch up with him, an elusive elfin girl, and an ancient horned Mystery in the woods. Note: For Wiccans and Pagans, this is one of the finest explorations of the Horned God bar-none (and DeLint's not even Pagan)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to see its return...","review":"Having read everything I can get my hands on by Mr. DeLint, I can't say that this is my absolute favorite, but the story is still a delight.

Superlatively successful, in both arenas.Ordinary People concerns a well-to-do family's painful adjustment to the death of the elder son by drowning. The book begins when the surviving son, who blames himself for his brother's death, has just returned home from a stay in a psychiatric unit after recovery from a suicide attempt. The family is wealthy but dysfunctional: grief is weighing each of them down, but no one talks about their pain openly.

He is as subtle as a sledge hammer, and totally craven. He took a upper middle class family and made them fat-cat caricatures. The boy's barking scene with the mother is a gross violation of the boy's nature. Redford has no compassion for the mother, who is flawed enough without making her evil. A disgusting adaptation. Redford has no talent for directing and should have stuck to acting, where his mediocrity is less damaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny","review":"Like watching a bunch of 4-year-olds throwing temper tantrums about early bedtimes. The main characters in this film spend their time either sulking petulantly or delivering semi-coherent, self-indulgent speeches.The movie is nonetheless well-shot, with some superb scoring to Pachelbel's Canon. Indeed, the opening montage, in which scenery shots dissolve to the choir performing, is great. It also gives interesting insight into its era.

I didn't think that Mary Tyler Moore did an overly good job, nor did Donald Sutherland.

Precipitated by the death of their eldest son in a boating accident, the timebomb starts ticking under the cosy middle-class denial of an American couple and their second, guilt-ridden son and finally blows them apart. Mary Tyler Moore gives the performance of her career as a woman whose lifelong facade of debutate gaiety and charm is starting to crack, though Judd Nelson, Timothy Hutton, Elizabeth McGovern and Donald Sutherland all shine. Redford's film is finally about the American middle class, its vulnerability, its artificiality, its disconnection from human emotion and ultimately its lack of resource in the face of human disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordinary People - by Extraordinary People","review":"A sad, but uplifting film, the story unveils the dissolution of a family afer the tragedy of having lost a teenaged son in a boating accident. The cast is perfect! Timothy Hutton is the younger son, suicidal from having witnessed his beloved older brother perish. Judd Hirsch is his therapist. Donald Sutherland is his Dad, sympathetic to his younger son's plight, and Mary Tyler Moore is his Mom, struggling the most with the loss, while trying to avoid the horrendous pain by attempting to retrun to normalcy.

Watching it makes you realize Redford's passion for Independent films(and why he started Sundance)and why they are so much better than what hollywood usually has to offer. This film takes it's times to unfold and lets you get to know the characters and WHAT a payoff. This is explosive stuff and you won't soon forget, hell you won't be able to shake Mary Tyler Moore's actions off your own mind for a while. One Problem, this DVD has no special features and for me that is what DVD is for. A making of would be excellent and a commentary, for inspiration Redford could look at DePalma's recent foray into DVD with his excellent \\"Special Editions\\" for both Carrie and the also underrated Dressed To Kill films.

Donald Sutherland excels as the dad who tries desperately to assuage his wife while the fear of losing his only living son is omnipresent.

Mary Tyler Moore's performance as the intollerant mother Beth Jarret is superb. In the Lake Forest Cocktail Party scene her aggrivation with her husband's telling their friends about son Conrad's therapy becomes evident and she lashes out at her husband played by Donald Sutherland on the way home.

I bought the unabridged audiotape. If you have been to b school, have managed for more than a couple years or manage in a professional service business, do not waste your time with this book. It was all I could do to get through the first tape but since I had spent good money I forced my self to listen to the whole thing. The advice is not only pretty elementary, the tape is put together with so much preview--what we're going to tell you, and so much review--what we just told you, that unless you have a very short attention plan, 2/3ds is repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is the first book I've read on the G-Spot, and it certainly has changed my sex life. Especially during times that some women still believe that the G-Spot doesn't exist, I can only recommend to read this book, which contains facts and lots of useful and interesting information. The best thing about it is that the author points out that every woman, and every orgasm, is different, and that G-Spot play shouldn't be goal orientated but a lot of fun, which it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting, I reccomend the lecture","review":"I was for a long time curious about finding out more about this fascinating part of women's bodies. The book is great in giving you lots of information about it, as well as how to better use your skills to give your girl more pleasure. It gives great descriptions about what some women may or may not like. Unless you are an expert in sex, you should read this book. It will help you when you are in those most intimate moments with your women. Not only I advise this book, but also to read other sex books. Most men think they know everything about women, as I used to think myself, but after I started reading this kind of books I realised I knew nothing about it. So if you want to have a better sexual life (and therefore a better overall life), start reading more. I reccomend this book as one of the first you should take it. I liked and my girlfriend loved the improvements I made."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading synopsis","review":"This book was VERY disappointing. It was much more about swinging than about BDSM. Any BDSM scenes were so stereotypical, it was worse than the free stories I can find online. Also, this \\"strong, independent woman\\" is only so for about the first paragraph of the book. The rest of the time, she is a mindless slave. Oh, wait, that's right, she's not a real slave - she can over-rule her master any time she really wants to, which happens often throughout the book. There is nothing in here about the conflicting forces wihtin her, and everything about her desire to please her master. In all, I was very very disappointed with this book and I ended up throwing it away since I (unfortunately) didn't read it until after the 30-day return period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I leave less than 1 star?","review":"This book is utter tripe. If you're interested in BDSM relationships, find another and don't waste your money. It has nothing to do with a realistic m/s relationship, and frankly, the woman, Misassa, is not a slave, she's arrogant, narcissitic and as pompous as they come. The \\"slave rules\\" she quotes were ripped right out of a piece I read on the net 12 years ago.Unless you're a complete masochist, leave this book alone. It's painful to your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're So Vain","review":"I purchased this book last weekend. I was really looking forward to reading it, but I must say I was very disappointed. Missa's constant comments about how beautiful she is, combined with her nasty and mean spirited comments about everyone else really nauseated me. Enough already! We get it. Also, most of the the book is devoted to swinging, which I really didn't understand because Missa does nothing in the book but whine about how much she hates everything about swinging. This book was painful to read, even for a masochist. Do yourself a favor and flog yourself instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"thank goodness for refunds","review":"This book sucked, it was repetative, tedious, and completely turned me off from bdsm/swinging, etc. The author is pitiful and easily tricked.

Very unlikable, and a bit snobby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous poof","review":"The author's constant \\"I am better and more beautiful\\" than anyone else gets cloying.She seems to think that Dominance/submission consists solely of swinging (which she always spells with a capital S--why?)For many, many pages she can't achieve a successful swinging relationship--everyone else is fat, ugly, impotent--which to the reader (suffering through her attitude, just like her partners) is not much of a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"This is a very sophomoric attempt at erotica proper.

It also seems clear that she missed the significance of the title of \\"The Story of O\\" when she used the same title but substituted the first letter of her first name. She has read the book several times; she borrows quite a bit of the language. My guess is that this was published for the \\"shock value\\" of the language which will always attract some, no matter how bad, instead of any real talent. She may be a submissive, but she's not a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"This is a great book for board review!!!

Anyways, I'm glad I didn't buy a whole case of the stuff. I tasted it before I added it to the eggplant dish I was making and it was gross and watery.

Got 54% through (according to my Kindle)and couldn't stomach another page. It started off fairly interesting but where Ms. Adair lost me was when AJ was having dinner with the terrorist -- she dropped the poison in his glass and just as the terrorist was getting ready to drink it, her little secret microphone in her ear says \\"abort the mission\\". OK. Next scene, she's having sex in the elevator with Kane. I thought \\"did I accidentally go forward several pages in my kindle?\\" But, no -- evidently our author had no way to get her out of the poison scene so she just skipped all of the relevant stuff and got directly down and dirty in the elevator? Makes no sense at all and totally ruined any chances I had of enjoying this book. I think a third grader would know better than to just leave a scene hanging with no reference whatever to it and jump to another ridiculous scene.I'd give it ZERO stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope this one was just a bad fluke...","review":"I've been a big fan of Cherry Adair since her first book in the Wright series. It seems, however, that with each consecutive book, the quality has diminished. This one was a utter disappointment. The summary of this book made me want to buy it right away. Imagine my sadness, when instead of being transported into an exciting and sexy story, I was treated to a science fiction novel filled with a dirty sandcrusted couple traipsing across the desert. Even though Kane seemed like a hottie, I couldn't understand why he would want to spend time with A.J. the one dimensional robocop. The sex scene on the camel was one that I will never forget (not a good thing). Sex and romance sells, I want to see more of it in Cherry's next novel or she will lose this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Declining series","review":"I enjoyed the other books in this series, though strangely, it seemed to me that each successive book was a step down from the one preceeding it. Kiss & Tell remains the strongest and most enjoyable. By the time I got to Out of Sight, the decline in reading pleasure had sunk so low that I was unable to finish the story. I was completely turned off by the self-centeredness of the heroine. Her inability to see the larger picture in life and death situations endangered not only herself but others, and ultimately led to the death of another character. She seemed less troubled by this than she was with proving herself, which I found contemptible. My two stars are for the hero, who deserved a much better woman. I'll be waiting for Ms. Adair's newest entry, On Thin Ice, to be released in paperback before purchasing. I sincerely hope this series, which began with so much potential, will get back on track. The author has a lot of talent, and I'm looking forward to better things from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed! Too much terrorism, not enough romance.","review":"I waited SOOOO long for this book. I'm a huge Cherry Adair fan. Like most of the other reviewers, I found this book to be very disappointing. Part of the problem was that the action part of the book (involving chasing Osama-like terrorists, doomsday machines, potential mass casualties) was just too intense. To have the main character experiencing a romance in the midst of this terror was just ridiculous. I was too freaked out by all the terror to really buy their ability to jump each other in the midst of severe danger. This formula CAN work if handled gently... for example, Suzanne Brockmann does it with her Navy SEALS. I'm really hoping that Cherry Adair scales back the terror and cranks up the romance in her next book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined the Wright Family Series...","review":"What a major disappointment!

The radio reception is great but the CD player stopped recognizing CD's after only a few plays. What's the sense of having an appliance that only partially works? We just finished remodeling our kitchen and I told my husband not to reinstall this piece of junk on our new cabinets. What's wrong with GE? Can't they do anything right?

The first purchase worked, then the CD player became unable to identify the CD to be played and would give a \\"No CD Present\\". After cleaning the CD's, and the player itself, it continued until it no longer played any CD's. GE's quality control is terrible. I since brought this one back and returned it for the same model, and the same issues are creeping back. This is garbage. Go for the Sony model if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"My CD player didn't work, either!!","review":"My son sent me this kitchen radio for Christmas. I installed it without checking to see if it worked. Well, it never played a CD!! It would say \\"no CD\\", so I took it to a repair shop, thinking something happened during shipping.

However, I really, really wanted a light on my radio/CD player so I went ahead and got this model. I purchased the first, it wouldn't recognize the CD. I got a second, it wouldn't recognize the CD (are you sensing a pattern here?). I even tried a third, after I had an employee at the store test it, but the CD player stopped working after one CD.

What is one to do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful....","review":"I originally bought this at the local Best Buy, rather than Amazon...and good thing I did. The first one had to be returned because the CD player didn't work, the second because the radio reception was terrible.Beleive it or not, the 3rd one I kept. :) The reason I like the model is its incredibly small size and profile. All the others on the market were too big, and stood out in my kitchen like a sore thumb. Subtlety, people, subtlety! This is a *kitchen*, not a theater!Still, my model has some trouble receiving some more distant stations, and the \\"search\\" function is not very sensitive. The CD player works fine, and the speakers are adequate. It will do.If I could, I'd love to give a \\"dope slap\\" to GE's engineers, though. Improvements in this model are needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one's not worth the effort","review":"Despite the suprisingly good sound, this audio system is an utter disappointment and worthless for its intended purpose.

Neither the troubleshooting guide or user's manual offers any guidance, and there is no live customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great - but beware.","review":"This is a good looking item and I was delighted with the design and concept. One BIG problem though - the cd player is extremely sensitive and skipped many times even on brand new cds. I'm sending mine back - won't get a replacement as this is the second unit I've tried. Same problem with the first one.

I bought a different brand for my own kitchen which plays owner created cd's with no problem- we should have bought the other brand for the gift. When I called GE their answer was that it does not say in the manual it will play a burned cd so they are not responsible.

Incredibly frustrating; am suspecting they're all made in the same factory in China and all have the same defects. At least I tried this one before drilling more holes in the bottom of my cupboard!! In any case, am not sure what I'll do next, but this is really disappointing and annoying.

He specilizes in hunting the Night Breed-supernatural monsters that prey on humans. His friends are Yayoi, a woman who works for the N.O.S., a goverment agency that deals with unexplainable phenomina, and which is so mysterious that we never find out what it's initials stand for. Guni, creature that looks like a tiny gargole but calls herself a fairy and stays hidden in his long hair, and Riho Yamazaki, a college student who's parents were killed by the Night Breed and who works as his secretary.

The car kit works, but I had to go through extra steps with knowledgeable friends because the poor manual has almost no instructions. Worse is mp3 playback - 1 out of 5 songs CANNOT be read. When that happens, the player simply freezes, and you have to unplug the AC adapter and replug it in. I use this mainly for my car, and I have had to unplug the adapter from the cig lighter, plug it back in, turn on the power, select the music and hit play, too many times, WHILE DRIVING. And that will only last maybe 20 minutes, and I have to go through the same steps again.My conclusions is the cd player is extremely unreliable in the mp3 playback department.

Those of you pureeing meat in your food mill --- do we have the same product????? Mine has a plastic grate. I **barely** mashed up some cooked peas in this thing. I can't imagine getting meat through this! That \\"blade\\" is like a dull butter knife. It worked great with a ripe avocado, and that was about the end of that. You really need three hands to get this working - two to push down and stabilize at the same time (I have to press really really hard), and a third to turn the handle. I have yet to be able to successfully turn the handle and press at the same time in any effective fashion. You also have to get messy to get the grate disk off, the only way to do it is to press down on the dirty grate with your thumbs and work it off. When it's covered in a slick puree that's not easy. Also, the plastic stains easily. I put a watermelon chunk in there, and now it's permanently stained orange. It's a great concept, but I would NOT buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for selected foods","review":"Great idea but didn't work for me for most of the foods that I cook.

It has changed over the years and at one point it had a metal blade that they need to put back in to this one, that now has a plastic blade.It is unfortunate though, that the company that manufactures this item came out with a newer version, some odd oblong shaped grinder that doesnt process enough food for a serving. It is harder to handle and is so disappointing. What ever they were trying to do, save money on parts or whatever reason, the new one is a huge fail in my opinion.I am seeking out their old product and have purchased and used them for almost 15 years, fortunately I have the old metal blades to use for the past version with the cheap plastic blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"If I could give this product less than 1 star, I would. My Mom told me that all's I needed was a grinder to feed my baby, so I bought this one. It never ground up a single piece of food. My Mom was convinced that maybe I was doing it wrong and she had the same experience. Her reaction was \\"they just don't make things they way they use to.\\" It was a waist of money and after many attempts, it ended up in the trash.

The very few times I tried to use it I got so mad that I swore I'd never use it again.It turned out that I didn't really need to puree food for my baby anyways. Simply mashing in a bowl with a fork or cutting into very small pieces was completely sufficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Blade and Problem with Leakage","review":"Even though the blade is steel it took way too much work to get this food mill to mash up food. I put in some apple pieces and had to stand up at the table and push down with all my might while turning the handle to get the mill to work. Even then, it did a very poor job of grinding AND juice from the fruit leaked out the bottom of the mill. We also tried with bananas and got the same result. The plastic construction also gives it a flimsy and unstable feeling. Once, when pushing down while grinding, the whole thing slipped and tipped over.Worthless!

It doesn't spin very fast and there is only one blade, so it doesn't really work very well at all. If you are trying to mash up green beans it doesn't grind up the stringy parts or the skins at all.

We can't imagine not having one now.The mill is handy, especially when out at a restaurant. We don't have the tote, but we keep ours in a plastic baggie. After using it, we just pop it back into the baggie and wash it at home (which is a breeze).The food that is ground isn't super smooth. It's more like the No.2 and 3 baby jar food. For dinner, we might have chicken, brown rice, and veggies.

I was able to feed my son easily and also clean up quickly by just putting the food mill back into the tote to wash later. I use it in restaurants and also at home.

First of all, it mashed the food. The grate is plastic and the blade isn't sharp at all. Don't let the picture on the box deceive you (with the metal grate). I think having metal turning against metal would help...not to mention a sharp blade. It is difficult to remove the plastic grate after you have sent food through because the handle unscrews from the grate before you can get it to turn and \\"unlatch\\". I spoke with a customer service rep where I purchased this item and she told me that the plastic grate was a fairly new change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend.","review":"This food mill is very easy to use and clean.I have found that a food processor works better for making food in bulk, but this does the job for small meals and dining out.Great value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!","review":"I was excited to try this after receiving it as a shower gift. I remember watching my mom use this kind of grinder over ten years ago for my brother. When I finally tried this product, I was very disappointed. The blade isn't sharp at all, and it is very difficult for any food to come through the plastic grate. I end up just squeezing the life out of the food. Even macaroni and cheese had a hard time. I don't know why this has so many good reviews. Maybe those people have the version with the metal grate that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not cut food","review":"I got this as a baby shower gift and was sad when it did not work. The blade did not cut anything up. I had to take the food out and put it in a blender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable and easy to use","review":"At home a food processor is great, but when are out and about, this product is wonderful. When your baby is just starting solids, foods, especially meats, will be too course. But once they are on stage 2 and 3 foods, just about anything will come out of here fine. Vegetables you can feed right after grinding, but meats you will probably want to have milk/formula available to mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Rusts!","review":"I was excited to try this product so that we could share our homemade food with our baby girl. I used it once to grind spaghetti and meatballs (more of a blunt crushing action than true grinding). Our baby was not quite ready for the consistency of the food, so I promptly hand-washed all the parts in warm water and mild dish detergent and let it air dry in the dish rack. When I went back to use it after a week, I discovered a reddish ring had formed underneath the grinder ring between the ring and the blade. At first I thought it must be pasta sauce that I had missed but upon further inspection it is undoubtedly RUST! I would have assumed any kitchen utensil that would repeatedly be exposed to water would be made of stainless steel but this appears not to be the case! The \\"grinder\\" is now sitting in our garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could return it","review":"I enjoy making baby food for my son, and this seemed like a great tool. Unfortunately, it basically is junk. I cooked carrots and put them in the mill, which stained immediately (so I can't return it). It was nearly impossible to push down to get enough pressure to grind the carrots without another pair of hands, so my husband ended up helping me. A stick blender is much, much easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great product for parents!!! Will help your child graduate to solids very easily, not limited to what is bottled, you can actually share your food with your child, easily and cleanly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kidco Food MIll","review":"The food mill is very convinient if you are feeding your baby bland table food and just wish to grind up enough for one meal. But it is a horrible pain to clean the top handle piece that is connected to the strainer, it is almost impossible to remove and has no leverage to help get it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a dissappointment","review":"I thought this was like the one I had for my children 25 years ago. wrong!! I thought it was advertised as stainless steel cutting blades, like my old one . well the blade was steel but the strainer part was plastic!! did not work well at all .Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I am VERY disappointed with this product. It worked the first two times I tried it, with an apple and a pear. I tried it again this morning with an apple and couldn't get it to grate the apple at all. I think the blade has dulled... Anyway, I am thoroughly unimpressed and will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"messy","review":"good concept but very messy and hard to clean up. i should have bought ended up buying an electric food processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Useless","review":"First we bought an adult sized food mill, great for Thanksgiving mashed potatoes, not so great for baby-sized portions. So we bought this food mill, which is clearly kid sized. BIG MISTAKE! It was hard to use, because it is plastic and needs a lot of muscle to grind things that aren't actually cooked too death. Hard to assemble, because of all the plastic bits, they tend to disappear when reloading or washing. It makes enough for one meal, so unless you cook only a bit of a bit of something, you are going to have to reload. Be careful when you are grinding, because if it tips at all, the mashed up food will just slide right out of the top. And hand-wash it! We put it in the dishwasher and it warped, so now it is very difficult to use. After a week of suffering with this do-hickey, we received a mini-food processor and I nearly cried with gratitude. It works! It's wonderful. And it doesn't cost much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless and deceptive","review":"no sharp parts to process food! when i received this, i thought the stainless steel 'grater' part was missing. i called kidco and what they sent me was already included in the box. this mill is made almost entirely of plastic and has no sharp parts that are able to process anything tougher than ripe fruit. it basically just mashes very soft things through a plastic strainer. it is also difficult to take apart for cleaning. i'm sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Food Grinder","review":"This is the greatest baby item on the market. I used this food grinder when my children were infants (30 years ago), and it was great. This grinder has been on the market a long time, that says a lot about the product! It is easy to use and it is more healthy for the infant to grind fresh food for them. It comes with a carring case so you can take it with you when you go out to eat. We are expecting our first grand child this summer and I knew that I had to get one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just wasn't for me...","review":"It sounds like it worked for others, but I guess it just wasn't for me. It seems to stick and feels like it would require a lot of pressure to actually get parts to move. I tried it and thought I'd nock the table over it took so much pressure so I stopped. I've had it in my car for months, but I can't bring myself to give it another try. It was just too painful. I was really optimistic about it so I got rid of the box before I ever tried it so I couldn't return it. I might sell it on e-bay or give it to someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Works well, especially considering the cost. The handle is plastic, which I have some concerns that it could break in the future. Otherwise, I'm happy with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"an oldie but goodie...glad it is still around for next generation","review":"I used this grinder probably thirty years ago with my first child: now my youngest is using it with her ten month old. It works great. No annoying people in a restaurant with noise...and no reliance on bland pureed baby food...just use the healthy food the family eats. Obviously not for first introduction to solids, as it is not smooth like yogurt...but most babies like variety,and texture. She loves this grinder, just as I did. Cheap, well made, useful, basic. It isn't great for tough meat, or raw veggies...but for cooked veges, stew, soup, pasta...chicken, it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"The food mill is great for my 9-month old. I mostly use it for avocados because it keeps out the strings and makes it a smooth consistency. I have a feeling we'll be using this for a while as you can mash up the family's table food when the baby is ready for that. The carrying case is nice, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!","review":"this food mill is awful. cheap plastic, doesn't puree smoothly, and is really really hard to manually turn. the handle is so long, it feels like it will snap right off and you have to push down with all your force on the whole device while turning it. my arm is exhausted from just trying to puree some peas. i threw it in the recycle bin after one try. really bad product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea, but...","review":"It was probably a great idea overall, but I did not find any use for it.When you go out to eat - you have enough stuff to carry with you so the jares were just fine. At home I'd just use the food processor - easier and faster.The product is good, if you need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Either the product was too hard for it - a carrot or too soft - bananas.

Celia is given credit as an early enthusiast for lucid dreaming and helped make the practice well-known, or more so, in popular culture. But she admits to not ever having a lucid dream, at least, not before publishing this book. Hm? Elsewhere, she goes on and on about being a child genius and how the world is set-up against her type. Take some responsibility! Any way, you may want to read this just to saturate your mind with everything available about lucid dreaming, or as a historical artifact. I've heard that \\"Celia was spot-on when she proposed the idea that lucid dreaming most likely happens during REM-sleep.\\" No kidding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dangerous","review":"We used this toy only once.

Barrett proves herself to be a virtuoso talent. Whether she's uncovering the true source of Marilyn Monroe's voice, following a team of Elvis impersonators on the road, or chronicling the personal lives of tweenage girl-band members, every word has the glint of truth -- it's as if the author has actually done all these things.I think anyone who aspires to write short stories should read this book to learn how to construct a story in such a way its seams will be invisible. The stories are polished and perfect. Barrett is skilled at her craft, and this book leaves me wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Characters With Poignant Stories","review":"I was really impressed by the range and depth of Ms. Barrett's stories. From a purely technical view, each story could be used as a model for writing certain kinds of stories. Aside from that, though, are the strong, interesting characters that lead the reader through the pieces.Stories that stood out for me were Elvis Lives and Hush Money. In Elvis Lives, we follow three Elvis impersonators that signed a contract they can't get out of. I won't say anymore so as not to ruin the story, but I will say that this story won the Edgar Award for best mystery short story. Hush Money involves Marilyn Monroe and how she \\"found\\" her voice, the one that \\"sounds like she just finished having sex.\\"There are stories in this collection for all tastes, and all told with such clear mastery of the craft that we all should admire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to do the job","review":"I could have spent a day sanding, but I'm to lazy for that on this metal outside cabinet.

However, this book is written in an annoying fashion. The author over-did it when it came to attempting to build atmosphere. The book was also not completely consistent with the Warhammer universe. There was also the problem about consistency in general. William King has got some misconceptions about helmets. He's got Marines spitting while wearing a helmet, etc.... If you read his short story, \\"In the Belly of the Beast,\\" he has a group of scouts (with the same names mentioned in this book) fighting Tyranids after they took off their helmets. Anyway, this book does have some interesting parts but I would suggest Barrington Bayley's: \\"The Eye of Terror\\" over \\"Space Wolf\\" any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whimpering \\"Wolf\\"","review":"This book is the kind of pulp SF juvenilia I expected the other Warhammer 40K books I've read to be and weren't (these include Eye of Terror and Dan Abnett's two Gaunt's Ghosts books). William King is just not a very good writer. The plot is not bad -- and it's very interesting to see how a tribesman from Fenris goes from being a primitive to being a Wolf -- but the writing is flat and poorly constructed. If you're dying to read about Space Wolves, you'll likely enjoy this book (although you won't even get as much background as can be found in the recentSpace Wolves issues of White Dwarf). If you want WH40 fiction AND surprisingly good writing, check out the books mentioned above."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good book","review":"Yes, this is the bible of Palm computing.

What a difference!The Oxygenics unit made quite a lot of noise, almost like the roar of a jet engine from 300 feet away and had very low water flow. My hair never seemed to rinse clean of shampoo with this shower head. Oxygenics certainly pulls a good trick that probably works well for hotels trying to save water. The trick is that it feels like you're getting a decent amount of water, but your are really not.When I tried the WaterPik, the water flow was quiet, soft, and utterly comforting. And my hair rinsed very clean with the WaterPik. So I went out and bought another WaterPik to replace the Oxygenics.The Oxygenics unit is sitting in on my storage shelf now. Anybody want one?Oh and one last thing: The unit really does have too much cheap plastic that is easy to mar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short hair only","review":"I bought the Oxygenics 5-star for my daughter to replace a water waster showerhead.

You will experience an invigorating shower with lots of air mixed in. The shower head is designed to mix lots of O2 with the water to create a unique cleaning experience. My son and I both like it a lot. My wife is not too sure of all the air blowing around while you are washing.I prefer the setting on full blast while my daughter would rather have the lower setting. Either way it is a great shower. One thing I would recommend is that if you are using a shower curtain, rather than a door, you will have to make sure it has a way of fastening down to the tub and walls. Otherwise it blows all over while you are using this shower head. My wife says it reminds her of a hotel shower.The finish is quite nice looking and should match many bathroom fixtures."},{"rating":"1","title":"too noisey and poor temperature","review":"The water pressure was fine for low flow (we had great water pressure to begin with). Unfortunately, the noise was so loud it hurt my ears. Additionally, it cools the water down so much that even when using only hot water the shower was cooler than desired.

The shower itself is nice, and I love the adjustable lever to save water, but this is in essence a 1 year throw-away. At the price point it should last longer than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very average","review":"When I bought it 8 months ago they were playing up the 'powerful spray' and 'non-corrosive' aspects of it, saying it's the last I'd own and was maintenance free. Not impressive. I sent a picture to the manufacturer b/c it's rusting and corroding and they told me to wash it with water and vinegar. I can't really replace it with a new one from them considering I'd need something to shower with, thus, will have to do with this one until it becomes too unsightly. Maybe for the price my expectations are too high, which I'd say, should be reflected in their marketing. I wouldn't recommend these folks, nor their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmm....lovely","review":"Lovely! If you want to feel good about your water consumption, lower your bills, be environmentally friendly BUT don't want to sacrifice a great shower spray for all these things, then THIS is the showerhead for you.
