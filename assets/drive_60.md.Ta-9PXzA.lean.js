But, they also meet horrible orcs, and fearsome monsters. Frodo has to destroy the one ring before Sauron the Dark Lord gets it.J.R.R Tolkien's message is even the smallest person can make a difference. Take away one character, the good side looses.

Upon opening the shrink-wrap I discovered several flaws with the quality of the book.1. The back-top corner was bent in, leaving a tear in the leatherette covering.2. SEVERAL pages were bent in at the corners (and since the paper is so thin, it stays bent)3. Two pages had large creases in them, running through the text.4. A few pages were uneven, cut too short.5.

JRR Tolkien is a genius in the art of storytelling. If I had the money I, this box set would be on my bookshelves. Until I do it will stay in my wish list. This set has illustrations from Alan Lee. If you don't recognize the name, he is like the official artist of Middle-earth. He even did the concept art for the films. This is a hardcover set so you know it is a good investment for multiple readings over time. I've read The Lord of the Rings twice and plan to read it again next year before the final film is released. If you are a true fan, upgrade to a better set. This is my set of choice.

It's the same story, a new cover which, might I add, is charmingly seductive. The leatherette collector's edition is a rich, catchy word. Say it in the morning. Say it in the evening. Buy a sword and slaughter some orcblood at your neighbor's house and all the way to the mines of moria*cough*jail as you fend of goblins*hack*cops every step of the way. Good for old people.

The roots of modern fantasy begin here. Yes, it's also terribly formulaic writing--but it was written to be mythology. Myths and legends are generally pretty big on formula. Beneath that stiff prose, though, is the rich and complex world of Tolkien's Middle-earth...and what an amazing place it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"this book is awsome.when you first look at it you get a little bit scared ,because it's very big (about 1000 pages)and the first pages are really boring,but when u really start to read it,you just can'tstop,its very exciting,it makes you very curious to know what's going to happen next and it gets you inside the book,taking you to a different world.the characters complement themselves just perfectely and it's very well written (way better than ''harry potter'')and if you watched the movie and liked it,you are going to love the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, no doubt.","review":"This book was my first foray into that fertile field known as fantasy and science fiction.I found myself captivated, and I still am, even though I appreciate different things about it than I do today.The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because it's so LONG.Three thick books, each chock full of characters and people.Even so, I was never confused about what was going on. Tolkien knows how to write so he was UNDERSTOOD.Lord of the Rings is also the reason for my lifelong fascination with elves. (As you can tell from my name.)Tolkien is a master of making his characters seem REAL, no matter what their race and general shape.Even the orcs. Let's just say I've known people similar to Tolkien's orcs.I've CARED about the characters in this story. I've cried when they cried, I've laughed with them, I've rejoiced with them...RUN to the store and buy this book, if you haven't already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"60 pages in and I have already found a number of obvious typos.

It is red, which is just as Bilbo would have written it. It is an excellent edition for the true collector and fan. I received this as a Christmas gift. Wow. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because there is a lack of illustrations, which I think should have been included given the price of this edition. However, I am very glad to have it. I believe other Tolkien fans would as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolkiens Trilogy of Middle-earth","review":"Masterful storytelling, epic adventure and unforgetable characters await those who delve into this wonderful book. The story weaves a tapestry of tale through quiet villages, magical forests, thunderous battles and the stronghold of the enemy. Characters are brought to life in the endless struggles of good and evil, fear and heroism, greed and nobility.Part of what makes this story so wonderful is its completeness. Rich in detail, it is a history as well as an adventure. There is a basis given for the actions that unfold and for what will follow. We know that what we have read is just a chapter in the long history of this world. The consequences of deeds and war, both past and present, are seen is how the story develops. It is more like life and history as we live it, knowing what passes today is not the end of the story.Take the time to thoroughly read and enjoy this book and you'll probably do it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"caveat emptor","review":"Undoubtably one of the best works of literature ever written and on its own merits deserves 10 stars.That said, the praise from earlier purchasers/reviewers (2004, etc) of the leather binding no longer applies, as this is not bound in leather any longer. It looks really close, but it is a thin paper imitation now. I bought this book for my son for Christmas, and when it arrived it was shrink wrapped. I did not want to remove this wrapping before Christmas; now I wish I had, because it is too late to return it and ask for a leather volume as advertised. Too bad - does not speak well of the integrity of the publishers....By all means order this and enjoy it for the extraordinary tale, but do not expect that you are getting real leather for the price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Bound Book","review":"I purchased this book after seeing the Fellowship of the Ring movie. I read about two chapters into the book and the binding started to fall apart and pages began to come loose. I think this is due to bad binding on the book and the fact that it is so thick so it strains on the binding alot when you are reading it. I would recommend buying a different version of the book or buying the three books seperately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not five stars?","review":"Well the most important things have been said before, it's an enchanting tale filled with imaginative characters that carry the story, it's an instant classic, it's one of the best fantasy books ever and it's a book that'll survive even my grandchildren, but the reason I didn't give the book a five star rating is that it was a slow beginning.I had to read it 3 times before I passed the magical number of 100 pages, I couldn't get into it at first, but after I tried it the fourth time I was swept, like most of the other readers, off my feet. But it did take a lot of concentration and persistence to reach that far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it now while you can at a great price!!!","review":"This is simply a stunning edition of this immortal classic. Yes its thick and heavy so it may well not be the easiest edition to read but the time and care put into this edition makes it stand well above other editions. This version of the book I am not afraid to say should be as much a display piece as much as a book to be read everyday because of the high quality. The story as we all know by now is timeless and one each of us can relate to in some way. If you really want an edition worthy of the grand imagery and passionate attention to detail Tolkien put into his work this one is the way to go. Stick to your paperback if you want something easy to read while on the go but if your at home with your kids bring out this handsome edition. Hats off to the publisher. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lord of the rings","review":"I thought this book was outstanding. By about 10 pages into the book i was hooked. I gave this book a five star rating because it is by far the best series of books I've read. The story line is one of a kind with alot of exciting twists and turns. This book was referred to me by many people. I watched the first movie and read the first book. I liked reading the book a little more belive it or not i think i could have visualized the book in my head beter than the movies.

I am not, however, a fan of this edition. Being in publishing myself I can spot a quality product versus an inferior one. This \\"Collector's Edition\\" is horrific. From page to page the type is either light or so dark that the print seems to blur. Leather bound? It's not worth even mentioning. Please think twice about spending the money on this one folks.

It is essentially 7 little paperback-type books with hard covers on them. The print is small, of course, but worst of all is the sorry excuse for \\"binding\\" used by the publishers (done by just glueing a bunch of single pages together). I kid you not, upon opening the first book, a page was already in the process of falling out!

I have read LOTR in German and English but like the detail in the original English version better. Tolkiens LOTR is timeless. It is about good and evil - which we'll face in every century of our time and can relate to.

I am glad to see that a set of Tolkein books are offered that don't have the pictures from the movies on them.Of course, I wouldn't complain to look at Viggo Mortenson or Orlando Bloom, but I am a purist!

The plot is rich, heavy and vibrant, full of subtalities and esoteric undercurrents. The characters feel as if they were flesh and blood, and not just ink and paper. They experience internal and external anguish, fear, doubt and sorrow. In esence, they appear to be actually living, not just existing for the transient amusement of the reader, only to be extinguished as the pages are closed. Every thing is placed in a living, coharant, world, which Tolkien took great pains to construct and populate. Overall, this book is required reading for anyone even remotly intrested in literature, and fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these books","review":"J.R.R.

Not a substitute for Fonstad's Atlas of Middle Earth.- content...priceless"},{"rating":"2","title":"An indesputably great book!","review":"It would be a waste of time to review \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for the content itself. Numerous critics have established its importance to the fantasy genre specifically, as well as literature as a whole. I'm convinced that this 50th Anniversary Edition is one of the finest editions of LOTR ever produced, from the crisp gold trim on each page to the fine, sturdy binding. It would seem nearly no detail has been ignored. One minor complaint is that the maps (of which there are two in this book) are a bit awkward to fold out but this is quickly overlooked when compared to the other thoughtful details. Some might find this edition to be a bit pricy, but you really do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding reading of a great work","review":"I can only echo the strong praise given by other Amazon reviewers who give this audio book edition five stars and their highest accolades.Rob Inglis does an amazing job portraying all the characters in Tolkien's masterpiece. As others have written, he is not merely reading the book, he is acting out all the parts and bringing them all to life in a vivid and compelling manner.I have read the LOTR many times like other convinced Tolkien fans. In listening to Mr. Inglis' presentation, I was moved more deeply and profoundly than by my own readings. It goes almost without saying that the pure and unabridged, unchanged Tokien text as read by a great actor is also far superior to any dramatization of Tolkien, audio drama or film. I recommend this audiobook with the strongest endorsement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"'The Lord of the Rings' book trilogy by author J.R.R.

The characters are alive, the events real and the landcape ever so uniquely convincing.Perhaps, for once, the legend lives up to its reputation.Never before has the choice of the best work in a given genre been such an easy and universal win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this book","review":"This is, by far, the greatest book ever written. It's not a story so much as it is a world, and it's not a fantasy so much as it's a tale of incredible friendship. Everyone should read this book. It will change the way you view life."},{"rating":"2","title":"need an incentive to read this ?","review":"think about it... It has sparked an entire genre and has been used as a benchmark for any writer trying the Fantasy genre, it has also created a tremendous following in the game industry (Dungeons and Dragons) plus countless books, biographies, companions, movies and drawings...It simply cannot be that bad even if you're allergic to everything that remotely involves fantastic.The book is simply beautiful, rich and well built, peppered with poetry and action.You, like many, will be sad when you turn the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent edition","review":"I think I speak for many when I say that after many years of enjoying Tolkien's book, I wanted to have a nice copy for my library. The books I read as a boy show their age and as Lord of the Rings is one of my \\"must have\\" books, I wanted an particularly special edition. Sound familiar? For like-minded individuals, there are essentially two choices: the single volume with Alan Lee's gorgeous illustrations (he later became artistic advisor for the movies) or the 50th Anniversary Edition. I got the best of both worlds -- bought the illustrated version for myself and this one for my finacee! As nice as the Lee watercolors are, the 50th Anniversary really is the better book. The binding, paper, cover, and feel are amazing... THIS is what a great book should feel like. Also, this is the final revised text, so it is marginally better. Don't let the price discourage you, it is definitely worth it, and this is a book to treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing reading by Rob Inglis","review":"This is a must have for any Tolkien fan. Rob Inglis does a brilliant reading of the entire book, with songs and everything. Every single voice is done with perfection. It is incredible how one man can make his voice to so many different things. I only wish I had more time in my life when I have nothing to do so I could listen to these CDs. It is worth ten times the amount of money that you're paying for it. This recording is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why people should read books","review":"I have never been an avid reader. I'm still not one. Sadly, most fiction cannot hold my attention, unlike my wife who reads like someone's going to burn her books tomorrow. :) My father MADE me read this and The Hobbit when I was nine, and I hated both. Later, in college, I re-read them. By the time I got to The Two Towers, I was skipping classes and staying up all night (I'm also not a very fast reader). I read the series in four days, and nearly cried. If this is not the perfectly written fantasy, then I believe Tolkien himself took the one that is to his grave. I admit that the first book takes a little work, but building a palace begins with a foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it appears to be","review":"The bargain hardcover ($29.99) has the identical cover as the illustrated hardcover ($44.10). It also has the same illustrations, but it is nothing more than a paperback wrapped in a hardcover binding. Worst of all are the maps, which are not foldout maps and are the same as the maps in the trade paperback! I have returned the copy I ordered. This is extremely deceptive on the part of both the publisher and Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Lord of the Rings Trilogy","review":"Overall I like this presentation. I wasn't expecting a condensed radio version however its not bad. What I didn't like was how some of the names were pronounced i.e. Gloin was said as Glow -in. Really? Seriously? Where did anyone get that pronunciation from? Also didn't need to know all the voice actor names after every disc (since I have no idea who they are anyway). However overall its not bad for those wanting a speedy version to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"These books deserve 5 stars. A wonderful story with incredible illustrations.

It's full of trite acting (and pardon my Anglo-bias) done by American actors, some with shrill voices. I couldn't make past the 5th tape before this went to the used book store. It's only advantage is that it retains some key events (like Tom Bombadil) that the BBC version skips. Time is better spent reading the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No final inspection - folded pages","review":"The edges of the first twenty pages were folded and the first red page even torn.

This is a great addition to any library, it is in my opinion one of the greatest literary works of our time. If you are a fan of the Peter Jackson films then you definitively must read Tolkien's pages upon pages that burst alive with so much more detail and vibrancy than any film could possibly portray. And I say that as a rather big fan of the films. The complete volumes in short is a masterpiece.Seller was very gracious as well and I am a satisfied customer. Keep it up =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Voice Acting","review":"The voice acting was unappealing and often contrary to what one expected from several of the characters in this masterpiece.

Take your pick of ailments and treatments. The author offers all you could wish for. If you suffer from IBS, go right to chapter 14. There's much useful and sensible info here along with a plethora of alternative therapies and theses (some presented with too much certainty--the controversial candida yeast connection, for example, or recommendations to \\"flush out\\" your gall bladder by drinking a \\"pint\\" of olive oil upon retiring and arising!).

I now get how to take vitamins, home tests for my digestion, and perform home cleansing and rebuilding programs that will make the rest of my healing attempts work.

Apparently, some manufacturers use a \\"new\\" method for thread count which is totally different from the one we know and rely on. According to my research, thread count is the new marketing mantra for sheets. The higher the better, you'll hear. But some sheet makers are boosting thread count simply by counting wrong. The right way to count is to add up all vertical and horizontal threads in a square inch of fabric. Two hundred is typical and perfectly fine; 400 may provide a finer, softer sheet. Above 400, the only difference is likely to be price. Many sheet makers are now counting plies--very thin yarns that make up a thread. Hence your 1,000 thread count sheets are probably 400 thread count shees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"I had older 500 thread count sheets that were better, lighter, smoother.

It was extruded (formed) in such a way that it had what could be called a series of cuts going lengthwise with the string in what could be seen as almost a star shape if you looked at the end of it. This string of the past could spin a ball to insane levels and would often rip the majority of the fuzz off of one after a set or two. Now a days, their Spiky Shark is the string most similar to the old Super Smash Spiky but it's subdued a bit. This new Super Smash Spiky just has a series of what appear to be almost randomly spaced very (I emphasize very) shallow cuts across the string here and there. All in all I found it did nothing desirable for spin and played like your basic poly.

This movie does have some clever humor which makes the repeated gender jokes acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even deserve one star","review":"You know a movie is bad if goes from the theaters, to the new release shelves, to the $1 rental section all within 6 months. I thought the two-minute \\"Pat\\" skits on Saturday Night Live were funny, but there weren't two good minutes in this entire movie.

And I thought the Police Academy movies were bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst SNL movie ever","review":"This movie is bad; really bad. The entire movie is filled with predictable and stupid jokes (if you want to call them that). After about an hour, I couldn't stand watching it any more. In fact, the only reason I continued to watch it was because I hoped to at least find out Pat's gender. But NO, like in most TV based movies, nothing new is revealed. If you never watch this, you'll have saved ninety minutes of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think It's PAt is the best movie ever made","review":"I have never ever seen a funnier movie. It is so awesomely wrtitten and with people like Ween in it, and so many different plot turns, it is so cool.

Don't get me wrong- I love dumb-funny movies as much as anybody, but it's usually good if it has a plot revolving around more than a neutered fat person.

No. Is it a great 'SNL' movie? Yes! I adored the Pat character from 'SNL' reruns, and was encouraged to buy this movie by a co-worker who'd seen it many times on basic cable back in the day. Having never seen it before myself, I thought it was well worth the $5 or so I paid for it. I loaned it to my co-worker and he and his wife enjoyed it as well.

I just got done watching \\"It's Pat: The Movie.\\" Actually, I saw it three years ago and am still recovering. This movie has gone down in history as one of the worst films ever to be made. The comedy, which is as funny as \\"Schindler's List,\\" works so hard at producing so little. The plot is a one-joke premise and the joke is funny for less than a heartbeat, then it gets stale and old. Is Pat a man or a woman? Does anyone care after this film? I don't think so. By the end, we still don't know what Pat is, and I don't think anyone is really all that interested to find out. By the way, Pat's played by a woman, Julia Sweeney, who's funnier in everything else she's ever been in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Made...","review":"This movie is an abomination of a film. How can people enjoy it? The whole thing was worse than a train wreck (pardon my cliche).I saw it on TV a while back. I admit to being sucked into the mystery of Pat's gender. However, as soon as I googled it and found out that the truth was never revealed, I immediately turned the film off. There was no other incentive for me to keep watching.The so-called \\"evolved\\" humour is nothing more than one lame joke. I actually cringed quite frequently at some of the gags, which were very immature and not funny in the least.This film may appeal to adolescent males and permanent frat boys, but no one else. For anyone looking for a intellectually stimulating film, I would certainly not reccomend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst SNL movie ever!","review":"My god stay away from this film it's terrible. It's not even funny from the sketch that I watch off SNL. It's only 76 minutes long! There are only a few parts that can be funny but the rest of the movie is just stupid. If you want to watch a better SNL movie go watch Wayne's World and Night at the Roxbury the rest of the SNL movies are dumb just like with the retarded movie Coneheads."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made","review":"On Saturday Night Live, the \\"It's Pat\\" skits were always funny. The movie, however, was not. Yes, it is a very bad idea to take a few minute sketch and try to stretch the joke into a 90 minute movie. While it's is not a great movie it is pretty funny at times. Especially the neighbor who becomes so very psycho obsessive in trying to discover Pat's gender."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ween scenes are better but the whole movie sucks!","review":"Only thing that's great about this movie is that Ween is in it but the rest of the movie is dumb.

I don't really watch SNL that much as I use to it's not that funny anymore most of my favorite comedians died like Chris Farley and Phil Hartman. It was sad to see them gone off the air they made me laugh when they were on. As for the skit of It's Pat and they made it into a movie it can be sort of funny but it looks like they put all of the sketches into the movie and they made the running time 76 minutes long. Like if you are an adult and have a brain of an 11-year-old you'll probably enjoy it but if your probably smart enough then don't watch it. It will probably lose your lack of intelligence forever. It felt like I was watching some lil kids movie at daycare it's really bad. Please do not waste your money on this crap. The best SNL movies are Wayne's World and A Night at the Roxbury.

It was written in 1969, and gives a fairly accurate description of the marijuana high, and an honest discussion of the social mores about its use in the 60's, from a teenagers perspective. Robert Coles, the author, does not seem to have any political axes to grind; he merely presents the facts in a way that teenagers can understand. Coles was a psychiatrist, and seems to invite the reader to draw his or her own conclusions.

We have found that you have to hold your wrist steady and be confident in your pouring, otherwise it spills. My husband has no trouble with it, but because it is a little heavy for me, I tend to have more spillage when the pitcher is full. After a couple drinks have been poured out, I have no problems at all.

The power in playfully exercising their imagination is that it leads to connections to their own feelings, to other people's feelings and to discussion with the person sitting with them as they actively read together. What a joy to look in a child's eyes and see their mind at work, ticking away, one precious imaginative moment after another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fishnet ever","review":"When I bought this pair of fishnet tights it was only because there were none left of the plain kind I liked.

The heroine never meets a man she doesn't want to trot off to bed with and describe the coupling in minute detail. After awhile, every time she met a man (no matter how unappetizing) I'd wince, thinking, \\"Oh here we go again\\" and brace myself. It seemed aimless and pointless and pathetic. At one point the heroine says (moaning yet again about some man who had done her wrong), that he had separated her from the two things that meant the most to her: her child and her writing. But in truth she doesn't seem to care much about either of them and treats them as peripherals in her life while she pursues her sweaty encounters with anyone with a Y chromosome.Join Charlie Sheen, Tiger Woods, and Rob Lowe...just don't write about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isadora Wing hasn't grown up yet?","review":"I loved Erica Jong and FOF, but was really disappointed with this book.She is still wondering why she hasn't found her \\"one true love.\\" Isadora has become sort of pathetic, really.

Now it is up to the police and the curious solicitors to piece together a tangled puzzle to solve not one, but two murders.The title of this book conjures thoughts of ghosts and family secrets in an old gothic castle, but this is simply a straight-forward crime mystery as is typical of Fletcher. He followed Arthur Conan Doyle's rules of mystery writing. The protagonist should never be the guilty party. Give enough clues to the reader so he can guess the solution with the characters. Never rely on the supernatural for a big finish.This is a good read that will maintain your interest throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful & timesaving when renting movies","review":"I discovered this video guide several years ago, and it has saved me from wasting time watching less than great movies.

Last night, as we snuggled up to read, I chuckled at the book's first scenario of a kid always wanting a baby elephant, but then turned the page and was definitely not chuckling at the knight cutting off the dragon's head complete with illustration.When I got to the line \\"would you like me to shoot a hole in your head\\" matched with a drawing of a little boy with a large revolver pointed to his temple I had to close the book.

The book was first released in 1958, and I know people that long ago generally had different attitudes towards violence than we do today. I wish it had been updated!I was really shocked, I'm very grateful that my 4-year-old son didn't ask me to explain why I didn't read the words exactly as they were written on the page!

This would be nice if you don't have an amplifier, but most people who have need of a 7 device remote use an amp.It is possible to \\"learn\\" the amp volume controls onto other buttons, but that makes for confusion.

When he discovers his new abilities at second base he finally feels that he has overcome his fathers shadow. This is a great story and I would recommend it to everyone who loves sports.

Lots of info about how they dressed and personal hygiene and some housework information. It is an easy read. The book is over 200 pages, but the margins are huge. I'm an old house fanatic and a history buff and this book didn't quite hit the spot for me, but it's in my personal library as a good reference work.However, if you can only buy one or two books about life 100 years ago, I'd recommend \\"Never done\\" by Susan Strasser and \\"Victorian America\\" by Thomas Schlereth.These books get to the nitty gritty and have more substance. Again, \\"Light of the Home\\" is not a bad book - I bought it, after all and I kept it! It's in my top five favorite books of women's life in history. I'd just put a couple books above it, in my personal preferences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historial account","review":"What a wonderful insight into the Victorian Life Style!

The songs on this album vary greatly within the funk style, but the bottom line is they are all brilliant classics in their own right.With the catchy, jiggy \\"Gangster Boogie\\" to the soulful, grindy \\"Your Mama Wants You Back\\" and the rhyming, clever lyrics of \\"Cloudburst\\"; this album has it all. I cant agree more with my fellow reviewers, that this album is what funk music in the 70's is all about.I cant praise this and the other Pulp Fusion albums enough. When it comes to compiling the best of 70's funk and groove, their (the Producers) fingers are still on that 30 year old pulse.A must buy if you are a fan of funk, soul and jazz or if you are interested in really good, original music!!

We did not want a bulky, heavy stroller system so we opted for this simple frame. We've used it almost every day since our daughter arrived seven months ago. It is lightweight, folds compact into the car trunk, and can be opened in a snap with one hand. The Graco Snug Ride infant car seat fits easily into the frame.My only complaint concerns the wheels which are hard to use when turning corners on some surfaces. If you plan to shop often with your baby, the mesh basket may not be large enough. I find that the basket keeps me from spending too much money when I shop so I do not mind the smaller size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for Peg Perego Primo Viaggio","review":"I saw this online and decided to go to the store to buy it. The description says that it accepts the Peg Perego Primo Viaggio baby carrier -- It does not!! The carrier wobbles in the frame and is not safe. Even the sales associates at the store did not reccomend it ... they said that it is best for the Combi carriers. At the suggestion of the sales associates I purchased the Kolcraft universal - which seems much sturdier and safer than the Combi. The only drawback is that it does not fold down as small as the Combi."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"I agree with the previous review - it is completely incompatible with the Peg Perego infant car seat.

This car seat carrier is over-engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary.

We went out and purchased the Kolcraft Universal carrier-- it is much simpler, easier to fold, and has a large, functional basket underneath the car seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for....","review":"After a quick breeze through of the contents this turned out to be a business \\"how-to\\" book with a few chapters about music at the end. The business portion was simple no-brainer material, and the music section wasn't linked in to the business end at, but just examined elements of gigging and gear. If you are looking for a rock-business guide I suggest: Managing Your Band by Dr. Stephan Marcone, All You Need to Know About the Music Business by Donald S.

The original version is slower than the \\"Dub of Doom\\", clocking in at about 100 bpm. Unfortunately, this version did not see the popularity as it's Dub mix did.Here is the line up:1.

I will probably take off the plastic shields if I can without breaking it.Otherwise, it looks nice and appears to work as advertised but the manufacturer needs to fix the GLARE issue.

Vann Woodward which won a Pulitzer Prize for History in 1982. Woodward's edition offers a more complete text and is heavily footnoted with explanatory material. The text in Woodward includes many interesting passages excluded from \\"A Diary from Dixie\\" because of limitations of space and because some of them reflected unfavorably on the South and Southerners.One virtue of this edition is a fine foreword about the diary by literary critic Edmund Wilson, but Wilson's foreword can also be read in his book \\"Patriotic Gore.\\" I recommend you read Woodward's \\"Mary Chesnut's Civil War\\" instead of this book.Smallchief"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good until it dies.","review":"I understand that these thing degrade over time with use.

So any you buy, just know that they've been sitting around for quite a while, and may have problems with old batteries.

Regardless of small pixilation issues on the cards themselves, they are still hauntingly beautiful and readings are just as hauntingly accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich Symbolism Open Gates","review":"Though the pictoral symbols on these cards may not be the most colerful, the images hail to ancient gnosticism and all the mysteries that have tormented the minds of men since the dawn of time. These cards house a myriad of symbolic keys which allows just as many interpretations; lending themselves perfectly to divination, since one truely reads the cards from the soul. These mixed and varied symbols allow the reader to draw inspiration from any number of religious schools of thought, the very fact that attracted me to purchase this deck. I am most highly joyed by the fact that these cards are now in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad","review":"The pictures are fine and clear but yes some parts are small like hebrew characters but they are easy to make out.

In interest of full disclosure, am I not the world's biggest fan of this deck but that being said, US Games has done a terrible disservice to these keys. Although the image quality varies from card to card, the pixelation and fuzzy scans are just inexcusable as they greatly diminish from the art work of the cards themselves. If you really want this deck I would strongly suggest buying an older printing. It's a shame that a deck that has so much to offer would be subject to such poor production values."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have done a better job on printing","review":"I was really excited when I found this deck on-line. I had the original printing from the 80's and had given it to a friend never to be seen again. The images are fantastic and filled with symbolism. However, this edition was so poorly executed I actually gave the cards away after I received them. The printing was so off on the images it almost looked like the images were out of focus some cards were worse than others but the pixelation was too much for me...Then again the price of the cards was not high. So if you had the original and get this one I feel you may be unsatisfied. If you never had them and want a copy go for it for the price. I'm going to try and find a used copy on line they are not cheap for the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art-wise, not so great","review":"When I recieved the entire deck and looked through all the illustrations, I felt them to be lacking in comparison to the examples provided online. Maybe I don't know very much about the artist, but I felt the overall art, while I'm sure it was meaningful, to have an immature look to it. I hate to say this, but kind of like the Led Zeppelin Icarus drawing. The drawing style is crude in an unskillful, unintentional way.Say what you want of my critique, but I know that in the art of Tarot you should have a meaningful bond with your cards (and I have plenty of decks myself that share this bond with me) but I never felt it with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying deck","review":"Overall a very crude and amateurish deck. If you are interested in hermetic Tarot, the Crowley-Harris deck is truly all you need. This deck, with its clumsy, off-kilter, amateurish art and complete lack of color (and yes, that is important when working with a Tarot deck) is not worth bothering with. There are any number of better Tarots that address hermetic material and concepts. I fail to see why this badly drawn, poorly drafted, confusing deck would attract anyone. The Crowley-Harris deck and the Cicero and Wang decks are still available, and are far superior to this colorless, crude mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Route - Great Trains","review":"I spent about 4 hours so far driving the Biggetal Route and I love it.

Regrettably, I found it to be everything that gives Christian fiction a bad name: predictable, trite, unrealistic, and patronizing. The story was choppy and lacked any real connection between characters (much less to the reader), and the narrative repeatedly is a convergence of events that shatters any ties to credibility.There are several authors who skillfully synthesize faith and quality story-telling; unfortunately, this book is not in the same league."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good synth pop, some catchy tunes","review":"I downloaded \\"Death with Soft Names\\" and was immediately hooked.

The book provides detail on the professional triumphs and the personal problems. Both were so much a part of the Dorothy Kilgallen story. It certainly discusses her untimely death in 1965 and the on-going controversy surrounding it 4 and half decades later.

The outside is a satin-like fabric in an orange-golden color. The general design is very pleasing, with small pictures of flowers and more, scattered throughout the book. Inside and out, a very attractive book.The style of the book is more like a quick reference. In the front of the book is an explanation on how to cast your coins and how to get your result.

Chevaller, both relatives in their own time, and both with a great interest in S&M. Genie is a girl who's moving in with her father in the East, and she get's herself into parties run by Paul Chevaller. I'm sure this movie was ment to have a great plot, and I'm also sure that it was ment to be a kind of epic film, telling the horror stories of S&M...but that goes straight down the drain.

It sounded like nothing I had ever heard before. Dog Man Star follows up on Suede's freshman effort and nothing could prepare you for what awaits! This CD is soaring, moody, dark and strange all in good measure. The first track, \\"Introducing the Band,\\" sets the tone for the trippy, drug fueled, songs that follow. Each song infects following the first listen--and the songs stay with you for a long time. The highlight track for me is \\"The Asphalt World\\"--listening to this song convinced me that--in 1994--the greatest band in the world was named Suede. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and self-congratulatory","review":"There is a character in this book who most readers will recognise. Simon is an acquaintance (rarely a friend) who must \\"win\\" conversations. He is smug and asserts 5 words where one would suffice.While Mr. O'Donnell may identify with Tad, the sterotypically sweet main character, he really seems to me to be so much more a Simon. His writing is laboured and his sense of sentimentality, while earnest, is always overcome by a need to be clever. I like writers to be clever but more than that, I like them to write characters, not to prove to me that they know a whole lot of really big words. Mr. O'Donnell's writing lacks depth and humanity. I understand that Finding Homer is his better work but this piece of tripe will prevent me from experiencing that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, bittersweet, heartwarming, universal","review":"Mark O'Donnell is one of the funniest writers that I have read.

The only thing good I have to say about this book is that it has a nice cover, very drole. But as they say: One cannot judge a book by its cover.

The book could possibly be of use for someone who is new to the subject. Benson only touches on material in a overview.

I've been fooled by those reccommendations before, so I got it at the local library first. It was a big letdown.As other reviewers have written, there were no concrete techniques; no take-away's from this book. There was a paragraph or so on \\"disappearing\\", but it primarily served as a teaser for another Paladin Press Book on hiding your idenity. There was nothing on the design, selection or provisioning of the survival retreat (since \\"that information was covered in other books\\").I read it in a couple of hours; many pages are little more than full page, stock-image photos.

It's hard to believe I didn't notice at the time how absolutely pathetic the female characters are. Though set in the future, women cook and look after children - that's it! The protagonist's wife is the only woman who gets to say more than a sentence or two and she spends most of her time in tears. Except when cooking. The author was able to create female characters who weren't idiots in the Pern books, so it's surprising that she made no such attempt here. Even thirty years ago, this should have seemed oldfashioned, and it certainly isn't necessary to the plot.

It's very quiet and the cooling system within the unit seems to be consistent.My only issue with the wine cellar is that it claims the unit can hold 60 bottles however it's a very tight squeeze. I would say the unit holds about 50-55 bottles. The shelving has two design issues:1.)the shelves are not spaced far enough apart to hold non-standard shaped bottles of wine.2.)the shelves are not concaved enough to keep the bottles from rolling.All the same, I'm satisfied with the purchase and would recommend the Vinotemp Wine Cellar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frozen Wine and Terrible Customer Service","review":"This thing worked fine for a couple of years--then I came home to find 7 bottles of wine frozen solid! No warning, no sign of any problems except a little bit louder noise from the compressor. Vinotemp literally laughed over the phone--all they cared about was whether it was still under warranty. Absolutely no concern, no ownership of the problem. I'll never buy another product from them and I recommend you don't either.

It seemed to work fine, albeit fairly noisily, for 7 months, but then it stopped cooling altogether. Since I was out of warranty I had an appliance guy look at it who told me there was a faulty switch which caused the compressor to be turned on constantly, which eventually overloaded and fried it. He also said it would be too expensive to repair, more than it's initial cost. Whatever; all I know is that it only lasted 7 months. I have not yet attempted to contact Vinotemp, but based on other reviews I am not predicting success. I did buy it at Costco, and they sometimes will take all kinds of things back, we'll see... My next unit will not be a Vinotemp.

In the last week it had been fairly loud with the compressor running constantly. Now I have the dreaded \\"LL\\" error.

First of all make sure you brush up on your greek before reading this book, there are more greek symbols in it then there are numbers or letters from the english alphabet. This book is so vague that you may as well consult a magic 8-ball for guidance. Basically, if you buy this book, prepare to fail. It skips so many steps its rediculous.

Contrasted to James Stewart's Calculus book that I've used for the past year, this book almost makes me want to cry and turn into an English major.

This book is well written and contains numerous examples and a plethora of problems. However, a student would do well to have a very firm knowledge of calculus and a quick mathematical mind; some of the methods covered are not candy coated to go down easier. As such, it is important that a strong professor and a strong curriculum accompany this book. This is NOT a good book for self-instruction.

It was written in a very complex, dry & boring way, with virtually no graphics, and the examples were never explained enough (i.e. to give you a solid intuitive feel of the subject). Thank God for Schaums Outline to get me through the course. As a practicing engineer, I have found other books, calculators (HP-48GX, TI-92, etc.) and the computer to restore my interest and fascination in DE.

I never take to the time to go to a site and write a review unless there is some outstanding reason. This is my fourth year as an engineering student and while I have had some bad books, I have NEVER had a book this bad. For example, the text almost never gives full examples let alone examples on how to do the practice problems/homework problems. When the text gives example problems, it will randomly skip important steps. Ironically, in a lot of cases, it will skip the step/method that is being covered in the section. Also, the text mainly discusses theory and usually doesn't really show how to solve these equations. Furthermore, the solutions manual is just as bad. Solutions are given in a sloppy manner that are unclear and incomplete.

Nowhere else in contemporary English-language fiction have I found such memorable passages about landscape; nowhere else have I found such a subtle exploration of self.

It is no longer a Brothers Grimm story. And the musical arrangements do a great job of concealing the talent of Diana Damrau and her beautiful voice. We only watched about a third of it before turning it off. We love Diana Damrau; but, this production is one she should have refused to do, as it does little to show off her rare musical talent. Do a You Tube search for her and you will hear her true ability as she does the Magic Flute. This production is more like a Broadway play than an Opera; and, a poor one at that.

She had many great hits through the years but her signature song is the beautiful 'Kalaniyot'.Her voice was rich and throaty but bell-like in its clarity.

It is a trancy little song that has cool sound effects and a nice beat. The vocals are a little weaker here than on other 2 Brothers On The 4th Floor songs, but it is so completely worth a listen. This song definitely does its job - it will have you up on your feet dancing. I am beginning to wonder, though, where their new album is.

This was a golden era of deep progressive sound, with stars such as Deep Dish, Hernan Cattaneo and many others at their apogee, and I'll never forget those days. \\"How To Live 100 Years\\" is sampled in Omid's original progressive/trancy/deep sound and runs in breakz/chillout rhythms/ambience with stunning Morel's and other artists' vocals. Make sure you don't miss best tracks from this album which in my opinion are Inbetween Your Choice, Escape (though Omid Full Vocal Mix is even better than original version on this CD), Keep On Changing Shape, Doubt (though I prefer Instrumental version to vocal mix that you can find on this CD), Behind The Face and Colours Reprise (one of the most beautiful chillout trance accapellas ever, as rightfully pointed out below).

You should be ready to spend some time playing around in the software to get it to work the way you want. In between poking around on the PC software and tech support I have spent about 3-4 hours total (over 3 days) getting it set up for my TV, DVD, Satellite (with DVR) and lights.Telephone support was GREAT, when an oddity of my system made setting up the remote a bit complicated they fixed it on their end, and I downloaded it to my remote.

I've always had problems with the charging cradle. I would have to really jimmy the remote in the right way to get it to charge. Recently, it just stopped charging. There is no way to charge the battery other than using the cradle, so the remote is completely broken. There is no way to buy a replacement cradle, and the device is out of warranty. I really liked it when it did work, but a one year life span is just not acceptable. Keep that in mind when buying other Logitech Harmony remotes with charging cradles. I did a little research and have found that the charging cradles have poor performance across all their remotes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remote","review":"This is by far one of the easiest remotes to set up. Within 20mins of opening the package I had all my eletronics in my house set up and ready to be controlled at the push of a button. The large color display is also great.

I also have the 880, which I use in my family room. The 720 is for the bedroom.The 880 works virtually flawlessly, turning the components (TiVo, Samsung TV, Harmon Kardon receiver) on and to the correct setting. The 720, which has good sight lines for the IR, fails on something (Yamaha soundbar, Aquos TV, TiVo) about 90% of the time. I go through the Help button and it then turns on the sound or the TV, but it's really annoying. I would have sent it back, but had setup problems with the Aquos and it's way of treating inputs, that by the time I was done with technical support, my 30 days were up. I wish I had bought a refurb 880 instead.P.S. Never deal with Logitech through Email support. I've had to so so both with remotes and with my Logitech diNovo Mac Edition keyboard (see my review there)and to say it's awful is to give undue credit. Telephone support is much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"I bought this because of all the great reviews and I am very disappointed. This is only for gadget geeks as it takes at least two hours to program it and even then none of it worked properly. For example, my new Sony HDTV is listed on their list, but not an option for the HDMI input needed for a DVD. Therefore, when using the DVD I have to pull out my old TV remote and switch inputs. The software you use is archaic and confusing and the unit itself has a cheap feel, not what you'd expect for $200.

I would have expected the remote to accept all of the functions of the individual remotes but it does not. It was even a standard Sony tv that doesn't make the link. Once it is set up, it is difficult to change the original settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great remote","review":"After much research, I decided to buy the 720 instead of the 880. The 720 provides many functions and features that the 880 has. The remote was very easy to program. I was able to program the remote to control my xbox 360, HDDVD, tv, reciever, and satellite reciever. I got it to work the firt time I tried it. I read a couple of threads on AVS forum on how to properly program the remote, so I was pretty much prepared on what to expect.The remote does a great job. I have customized it to my likes such as my favorite shows, slide show, and activities icons. This is a really good investment. The price might seem high at first, but the remote essentially pays for itself in the long run. Now my wife can do any activity with my system by the simple press of the button. This remote is better than any of the original remotes for my components. Overall I would highly recommend it to any in search of nice remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not ideal, but easy to use and customize","review":"I really like the remote, it is easy to use and higly customizable with software. However there are few things which can be better:- most commonly used silver buttons center/left/right/up/down (in the center of the remote) are somewhat small and hard to press; at least not as soft/convenient as Menu/Guide and other 8 black buttons right below LCD- when selecting activity, unit cycles through TV and AV Receiver inputs even if they were already set on the right signal input.- would like higher resolution of LCD screen"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Everything Remote","review":"This remote was easy to set up and even easier to use. The ability to macro tasks, such as \\"Watch a DVD,\\" or \\"Listen to a Record\\" make even your most complicated electronics available to your guests. If you are cooking dinner, you can just tell them to hit \\"Watch a DVD\\" without skipping a beat. They get to watch Master & Commander and you don't burn the pudding.The thing I like most about this remote, however, is the ability to customize every button. I like being able to control most (if not all) of the settings for each device with one remote, in any macro, i.e. changing the contrast on the TV, the sub-woofer settings on the A/V, and the Progressive Scan settings on my DVD player all while \\"Watching a DVD.\\"Ultimately, time will give the final review for this remote. If, indeed, I am able to use it with each new device that I purchase for many years to come, then the small investment I made early on will pay off 100 fold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Harmony Remote - Wonderful!","review":"I love this remote.

I also, at the same time, purchased the rest of the books in this particular series (and some of her others too). I AM HOOKED!The sexual tension between the characters is quite strong. As the plot unfolds the reader is drawn more and more into the story, hoping that Reese, the \\"strong and silent type\\" and Dr Tory King, the wounded but strongminded town doctor, will realize who they are to each other, and to the town.I loved this book, and couldn't put it down.

I just bought another copy and after re-reading The Magic Cottage, I've reconfirmed why I loved this book. Herbert does a masterful job of sharing his story about Mike and Midge, a young talented couple, who venture from the big city and buy a quaint cottage called Gramarye out in the country. Told by Mike's POV, it is as if they have moved into an enchanted cottage straight out of a Disney production as they are greeted every morning by cheerful critters as the couple falls in love with the place. Gramarye proves to be truly magical but it conceals a darkness that will soon take over Mike and Midge's lives.One of my favorite lines is: \\"My fear had reached a new zenith, rising from the sloshy morass of dread like a dripping creature from a swamp.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Been looking for this book for years!","review":"This was one of my favorite books.

I was just completely bored with these movies. The first one is definitely the lesser of the evils, but not much as far as being a scary movie or even an entertaining one for that matter...the movies you get in this package are much worse than the original.

An Excellent Marriage Book","review":"After reading many discouraging marriage books full of half truths, \\"To Love, Honor and Vacuum\\" is definitely a breath of fresh air. This book is not a doormat manual like others. Sure, it is aimed at helping us be good wives, but this book does not do what others do, blaming the woman for all the marriage problems. It helps women where they are at, realizes that sometimes husbands can be jerks, and how to live your life so that you are doing right but are not burnt out.I felt that this book was enabling to me as a woman, while it seems that other authors think that I should be walked all over just because I'm a woman.

Uncle Roy went to alot of work researching southern sayings and such, and enjoyed (almost) every minute of it. Countless fellow writers (including Charles Frasier, who owns a copy and who also wrote a book called \\"Cold Mountain\\"- maybe you've heard of it?) credit Roy with writing one of the most well researched, insightful and just plain fun to read books out there!

It was an amazing album but it just seemed incomplete. After I had received 'Mythmaker' This album seemed to make up for what their previous album was missing. To me it seemed that these two albums should really be one. They complement each other, with the reminiscent Skinny Puppy which is easily apparent in the song in 'Dal.' If your not familiar with Skinny Puppy at all I would suggest you listen to 'The Greater Wrong of the Right' to ease you in. This album is very OhGr'ish and is unbound by conventional music laws that you'll find in their earlier albums, which may dart away a first time listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puppy this in your audio files .....","review":"Puppy this in your audio files ..... and cut the crap by enjoying their audio brap [why listen to immitators when you can have the original?].

This CD leaves me scratching my head and wondering what the hell happened"},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds a bit too much like ogre's solo stuff","review":"However... I did enjoy a couple of the tracks..particularly PASTURN and UGLI. I thought it did sound like Ogre's stuff but you can feel alot of cevin key's reliable backbeat which is more methodical than a lot of it has been.though i am afraid they can never top rabies or too dark park..

I have loved every skinny puppy release, even the process and gwotr. but i am really at a loss with this album. every track reminds me of yanni new age synth music with ogre doing his cher effects. and then there are these really cheesy repititious melodies. \\"jesus wants to be ugly. jesus wants to be ugly\\".. so annoying.remember when listening to a skinny puppy album was like being forced to watch a freaky snuff film or horror movie? this album is like watching one of those ghost hunter shows on tv... lots of annoying gadgets and you never get to see a ghost.godd*mn i really wanted to like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CHILD DEVIANT!","review":"Many long time Puppy fans are dissapointed with slightly different direction that this band has taken in recent years. All I can say, is that I love both the old and the new Skinny Puppy style. I like Ohgr's solo work as well. If you don't like this neo-pop, electro industrla style than I don't recommend this album...but if you like Ohgr, or the prior Skinny Puppy Album, than you'll love this album to.

When I fill it again, completely saturating the cotton reservoir and the same thing happen, with only 3 or 4 uses it runs out of fluid. I've tried under and over filling it and have done this a few times with no sustainable luck. The only thing I can think of is that this is a factory defect and it's leaking. BTW I have plenty of zippos that work just fine. I don't leave it in a car on a hot day. It is stored safely in my room.

Also the lid is not very stable and very loose. I am very disappointed about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighter fluid evaporates","review":"I don't assume this is unique to zippo lighters, but the fluid evaporates extremely quickly if you don't use it. If you're not going to be carrying this around in your pocket, get a 99 cent bic lighter. If you are going to be carrying a lighter around then it's still easier to just buy disposable lighters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Count On It Working","review":"I'm not a smoker, so I bought the Zippo lighter for outdoor camping-type situations. The good news: it seems sturdy and the striker always creates a spark. The bad news: to make it work you have to fill it manually with lighter fluid. Then, within a couple of weeks, regardless of how you store it, the fluid evaporates, leaving you with a useless lump of metal. This is not really what I want to discover when I'm out in the field trying to light a fire... So if you are a smoker and will only use this at home and are prepared to re-fill the device every week, it will work fine for you. But if you need a reliable source of flame in more general circumstances, this is totally worthless and you should go for storm-proof matches and/or a cheap disposable plastic lighter because those somehow manage to retain their fluid reliably for years, instead of letting it evaporate over night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful Hints before You Buy","review":"*Doesn't work out of box* This is a good quality product with a great guarantee behind it; however, no where on the description does it say you need to buy the fluid separate.

So overall i like the product just don't forget to buy the fluid"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good product!","review":"I bought this one a month ago.

Having used PRG's review books (for the CCA and CCS), I was looking for something else to study from. This book is truly a waste of time and money. Pitifully basic, this book would not even be a good study book for the CCA exam. Most of the information reviewed was basic and not advanced enough to help for the difficulty level of the CCS-P. Specific number of pages and information present is woefully inadequate. I would recommend the PRG books 100% of the time, they actually do prepare you for the certification exams.

The illuminated toggle switch will allow a person to never enter into a darken room and the smooth operation of the toggle is quite during its operation when turning on the lights. The 600 watt switch allows for two light fixtures to be lit and dimmed at the same time giving me the lighting effect for the room that I am in, be it living room, dinning room or kitchen I can set the light level that I want.

Unfortunately this book is iconoclastic, and therefore not recommendable for Orthodox - Celtic or Eastern alike. From page 5, \\"Believe direct in the King of elements, Put behind thee ikon-worship\\". The Orthodox do *not* worship images, but believe that the veneration of Holy Icons will be translated to the one depicted on the Icon. Those who refuse to venerate the Holy Icons were anathemized by the One and Undivided Church in 843AD. Perhaps Duncan is not aware of this? Or perhaps he is a protestant. This is not clear from his introduction. In any case this book is useless for Orthodx - Celtic or not. The Celtic Orthodox Tradition possess a Spiritual Wealth of Holy Icons, and it is really a shame that Duncan apparently is unaware of this. 2 stars for the nice binding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the woods, you go again, you have to every now and then","review":"Into The Woods is fantastic musical, and the soundtrack is just as amazing.

I think that this soundtrack will be a great additions to anyone's music collection.

She loved it, and proceeded to buying the soundtrack, and in turn, the movie. She would rant and rave about how fabulous it was, and I would smile and nod, but remain skeptical. Finally, she forced me to watch it. From the moment the narrarator uttered the now familiar words, \\"Once upon a time\\", I was captivated. I've bought the music, the book, the video, and both versions of the soundtrack. I also have the entire play memorized, pathetic as that may be. I'm not going to say I'm necessarily the biggest fan, though I am obsessed. But I really, honestly love this play. I strongly suggest it"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the recording to buy. Insightful, Human and Loads of Fun","review":"The great thing about Stephen Sondheim is this: the more you listen to and explore his scores, the more impressed you are by his genius.Nowhere is that genius more apparent than in this musical. Sondheim and James Lapine stir together a stage full of fairy tale characters, give them each a burning, insatiable wish, and formulate happy endings for most.Then the fun begins. At the start of Act 2, the audience learns what messes are left when one must have one's wish at any cost. Happily ever after melts into battles and infidelities and untimely deaths and heartbreaks.Sondheim and Lapine explore the human condition with wisdom and insight. Listen to \\"Your Fault,\\" where characters shoot and are shot at with finger pointing accusations and deflections.

I have never heard anything funnier than the two Princes' ode to \\"Agony\\".The lyrics are delightful. Each time you listen, you catch some new joke or deeper interpretation.

Although it lost to \\"Phantom\\" for Best Musical, it did pick up Best Score & Actress (Joanna Gleason).Unlike some of Mr. Sonheim's other scores, \\"Into The Woods\\" contains many \\"accessable\\" songs which are thoroughly enjoyable outside the context of the show. The lyrics, as usual, are clever & the cast performances (namely, Bernadette Peters as the witch, Chip Zien as the baker, and the aforementioned Gleason as the baker's wife) are terrific.Best Tracks include:AgonyEver AfterAny Moment/Moments In The WoodsYour Fault/Last MidnightNo More [beautiful song!]No One Is AloneFinale: Children Will ListenAnother great score from Mr. Sondheim!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The score is well written and the singing is fabulous.","review":"Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods is a wonderful recording. The casting for the musical was perfect, every cast member seemed perfect for their role.

Also, the book pre-supposes the reader's depth of knowledge on the subject -- the lack of which is quite obviously my problem in enjoying the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Like a lot of Motley fans, I was excited when they got Vince back and was really looking forward to this album. Finally! Real rock n' roll again instead of all the post-grunge Nirvana wannabe bands. But, the Crue failed to bring fun heavy metal back to life. This album is awful...and the good times 80s bads apparently are all sadly headed to a slow, painful extinction. The reunited Crue was the last chance to bring back the old days and they put out this terrible album. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two songs on the album are decent......thats it!!!","review":"Save your money and purchase greatest hits which has \\"Afraid\\" on it. That is the only track that should catch your attention. This album was originally going to feature Jon Corabi, who sang on the '94 release of Motley Crue \\"4 star album\\". Generation Swine sounds hurried, it seems that when Corabi ubruptly left the Crue, Vince was hurried in to complete the album. The Greatest Hits album should also tell Crue fans how much the band thought of Generation, only two songs on Swine are on Greatist hits. In concert the band only plays \\"Afraid\\". I have been a Motley fan since \\"Too fast for Love\\" and have seen the Crue 11 times. The top Motley albums in my opinion are as follows: Too fast for love, Quarternary, Dr. FeelGood, Shout and Motley Crue. Check out the release of Motley Crue with Jon Corabi, it is the heaviest album that they have done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds nothing like the Crue!","review":"Except for LET US PREY and SHOUT AT THE DEVIL \`97, this album sounds nothing like Motley Crue. First, where is the pounding bass drum and the wicked guitar riffs? They seem to be completely missing. Then, I don't know what he was doing, but Vince Neil sounded nothing like he did on their earlier albums. It was almost as if they had yet another lead singer there. When I listen to a Crue album, I want to hear that high pitched scream of his.Not that this was a bad album. For another band, this is a very solid rock album. Nothing special, mind you. Just a good piece of work. There weren't really any songs on the album that caught my ear...they all seemed pretty mediocre. For a Motley Crue album, it was a disappointment, but an improvement over their self titled release with John Corabi on vocals (ugh!).If you're looking for an album that smacks of old Motley Crue, then this album will be a big disappointment. It was to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good album from the CRUE","review":"Generation Swine is a very good album despite what some people might say. I'm tired of people saying that the album sucks because it sounds diferent. Generation Swine is a little more modern than their other records but that dosen't mean that it sounds like everything else now. It is simply heavier. It is heavier than Dr. Feelgood but not as heavy as their Motley Crue release with John Corabi. Although certain songs sound like outakes from that album. \\"Let Us Prey\\" sounds like a track written with Corabi. The album is very strong and the new version of \\"Shout At The Devil\\" rocks. My personal Favorites are \\"Shout at the Devil '97\\",\\"Afraid\\",\\"Find Myself\\", and \\"Generation Swine\\". I would recomend this album to most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated Crue album ever","review":"This album has it all. It goes from one spectrum to the other.

Great job Motley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vince Neil May Be Back, But Swine Is A Big Step Back","review":"Vince Neil returned for \\"Generation Swine\\" in an effort for the Crue to start making some money again. However, the result was a horrible album that showed the band going through the motions in a lame attempt to modernize their sound.Although mostly uncredited, John Corabi apparently co-wrote many of these songs before he was dismissed from the band. I can only imagine the songs might suit his style more than they did Vince Neil. Die-hard fans might find it interesting to hear Tommy Lee and Nikki Sixx singing lead on some tracks, but almost all of the songs are at best lousy.On a somewhat related note, in the summer of 2006, John Corabi was playing with \\"Adler's Appetite\\" and was touring briefly with Vince Neil (solo). One night, Corabi actually saved Vince's show by stepping in to sing Crue songs with his backing band when Vince was too drunk to perform."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's Corabi","review":"I'm sure Sixx is thinking the same thing.Vince belongs no where on this album.considering Corabi wrote most of the matrial.This sound does not suit Vince,he should stick to lipstick & make-up and shake his ass elsewhere.Leave this kind of music to real musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"motley crues generation swine","review":"I think this album would be better if they did it with john corabi then it would sound better"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"I love the Crue their my fav.

I wanna blow my brains out\\" What the heck? o.k. I have never listened to the album completley! On Shout '96 the intro sounds like a fax machine, Generation Swine sounds like Kurt Cobains sucide note(not to offend anyone), the album was suposed to be like Nine Inch Nales. Sorry Nikki bought if I wanted to listen to NIN I would of bought there album, not a Crue album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motley Crue's first comeback album","review":"Some fans give this album bad reviews, but it was an interesting heavy album by the crue.

His works are a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Sharing","review":"This book can change you if you are open to it. It made me rethink a few assumptions I had about myself.

This book is warm-hearted and inspiring. Its organization is well suited for discussion groups. The Lakota Way should be the way of our leaders, neighbors, family members and our hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"The chapters are laid out by sharing a story from the Lakota tradition that communicates one of the virtues within this culture. Marshall then discusses the virtue more and includes personal stories of how his family and community helped him to learn the virtue. The book also has interesting information about how Lakota are socialized, and more about the history of this nation.

For example, Aruna's parents don't let her have sleepovers or become what she wants when she grows up but other Indians do that.

Children who read this story will be able to relate to Aruna because they have dealt with similar situations regardless of what culture they are from. Aruna's journey would be relevant to use in the upper elementary and lower middle school grades. The book could easily be integrated in a large unit focusing on diversity and culture. Character education could also be emphasized. Concepts such as respect and kindness could be discussed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"In my point of view, I think that the book Aruna's Journeys wasn't the best book I've read. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone in particular because the way it was thought out was showing ways that what the author thought was how all Indian Americans acted when talking about their culture. When Aruna says that she's different than her classmates, I find that true, but I don't mind that I'm different, unlike Aruna who wants to change the way she looks so she can fit in. I was born here in America, but I still visit India every two years and I celebrate my culture whenever I can. If a teacher or one of my friends asks me about India, I can answer without feeling guilty about it or feeling out of place. Aruna always feels uncomfortable when she's asked questions about India. So in the end, I don't feel awkward when someone asks me about India, and I like to celebrate my culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straw lovers delight","review":"My husband has to drink his coke for a straw.

It just goes out and rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a Motley fan it's definitley worth a listen","review":"New Tattoo by Motley Crue definitley should have been the follow up to Dr. Feelgood. Of its 11 tracks I believe most of the songs could have been radio friendly. Hell on high heels is an awesome opening track. I also liked Fake, Treat me like the dog I am and 1st band on the moon as my favorites. The only track I wasn't too impressed by was White Punks on Dope,I didnt really dig that one. It seems Motley went for a raw sound , something we havent heard from them since Feelgood. I do think some of the songs were a little forced but all in all a good Crue record. If you liked Too Fast, Shout, or the Feelgood album you would want to add this one too!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MOTLEY CRUE HAS THEIR FIRE BACK!","review":"Finally, an album that's a worthy follow-up to the very popular \\"Dr. Feelgood\\"! The Crue is back in the saddle with this newest release. Vince Neal sounds better than ever. The chemistry that made \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" sound SO good is there once again. As with most Motley Crue albums, this album is just for fun with tongue firmly planted in cheek. But it's also entirely possible that they are the only band that could pull off a BALLAD titled \\"New Tattoo\\". It's sweet really, but when you read that title you don't expect a ballad. The song \\"New Tattoo\\" is very much in keeping with their traditional rock and rebellion style . . . with a softer edge. The whole album rocks and longtime fans will love this new release. A good Crue staple for any melodic hard rock collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'm gonna cry...","review":"I'm a HUGE Crue fan, have been since SATD. I wanted to LOVE this friggin' record. It's not bad, but it's so AVERAGE, so run-of-the-mill, so boring. It used to be that each Crue record was something new--a step forward. This is their first step backwards (can't blame 'em for trying to get their audience back)... What happened to the cool lyrics Nikki used to write? Dragstrip Superstar? ... And what happened to Randy Castillo? His playing on some of the Ozzy records is pretty good, but this? No imagination. This CD sounds like they put no effort in at all. Sigh..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Good cd but not there best.and Crüe fan I say should have but not there best album by all means"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very good, but expected a bit more","review":"Being a HUGE Motley Crue fan thats dying to go to their nextconcert, it saddens me to be the first to give them 4 stars and not 5... but I gotta be honest. The songs are very good and it has excellent riffs, but Mick's guitar playing is very good but not catchy. Randy's drumming is EXCELLENT... makes me not miss Tommy Lee at all. All the songs are great, maybe 1 or 2 are good but not great. Hell on High Heels, Punched in the teeth by love, Treat me like the Dog I am and Hollywood Ending are by far my favorites. Fake is an exact replica of Shout at the Devil so its cool, Pornostar is good except for the nanana part. Dragstrip Superstar is too similar to HOHH and the rest are ok. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because its a good cd but there's not enough agressiveness on it.. especially on Vince Neil's voice. But overall an excellent cd.. I strongly recommend everyone to buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the..?","review":"I just can't get into this CD. After the more experimental \\"Motley Crue\\" and \\"Generation Swine\\", this one's a bit of a disappointment. The lyrics are dull, and the band sounds like it's had the life sucked out of it. Even Mick's solos, normally a high point on any Crue CD, sound flat. I was excited when I saw that Randy Castillo was drumming, but, as talented as he was, even he couldn't save this album. \\"Punched In The Teeth By Love\\" is the only song with any life to it; it sounds like classic Motley. If this had been the follow-up to \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" or if it had come out instead, I might have liked it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back Motley Crue","review":"In the age of talentless, boring drivel that somehow manages to pass for rock and roll, Motley Crue's New Tattoo is welcome relief.

This follow-up to the less-than-popular Generation Swine CD shows the Crue at their best. Hell On High Heels gets the CD off to a fast start and it never slows from there. This is one of the few CD's that does not have a bad song on it. Vince, Nikki, Mick and Randy really outdid themselves. If you are a fan of just solid rock and roll, than this CD is definitely worth buying. Though it is difficult to pick any one song as a favorite, some of the notables also include \\"Hollywood Ending\\", \\"Dragstrip Superstar\\" and \\"1st Band On The Moon\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Tattoo smokes","review":"I cant believe it when I hear people ragging on this album. This is easily their best work of the 90's. As for the 80's; it's better than Theatre, it's better than Girls, it's as good as Feelgood...New Tattoo is one of their best. It's not over produced like Dr. Feelgood either: how many Vince Neil's do you really need singing over the top of each other?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it grows on me it will be like a fungus","review":"There is nothing great about this cd. It appears to me that the Crue have been living off their past laurels of Dr. Feelgood and other earlier works. At best I enjoyed 3 songs. I wish I'd purchased it at a store that allows returns or exchanges. I have a 200 cd changer and will put it in there occasionally in full random mode so the songs will only pop up only once in a while. To listen to it beginning to end is not a very appealing idea. Quite a few bands I grew up with have been very disappointing the last few years. The new Dokken is very good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crue is back!","review":"This sounds like old Crue from the Shout days. The lyrics from Nikki are solid and the music is heavy.

I've heard great things about New Tattoo, so I bought it over the weekend & had an open mind when listening to it a few times.Other than the great opener Hell on High Heels, the rest of the music went downhill from there. Their music is just not as good as it once was, when they were in their prime. This is a good effort, but overall I was disappointed. In fact, I returned the cd back to the place I bought it.I also think alot of those positive reviews, (saying this is such a great cd)were written by Motley Crue die-hards who would say great things about their cd's, no matter how lousy it was. (I personally know a few people like this.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motley Phew.....","review":"Phew.... Thank you Motley for releasing something with some 80's flavor! Too much of today's music lacks that grit-in-your-teeth attitude of the early 80's hair bands. This album brought back many memories of being a teenager and watching Head Banger's Ball and the countdown on MTV when they used to actually play videos. I didn't give this album 5 stars because the last two songs are a little too cheesy. The rest of it I have been cranking in my car like I was 17 again. If you like the sound of 80's hair metal, you will enjoy this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Tattoo---A must have CD","review":"Motley Crue have finally gone back to straight ahead Rock-n-Roll.

There was nothing useful in this book for me, and I have to admit that I felt really ripped off.

There isn't even a hint of a \\"step-by-step\\" guide to building a website found anywhere in the book. Instead, the author continually states the obvious chapter after chapter by going over each menu item and what it means. Do you really need the author to tell you to place the title of your page or module in the box marked Title???? For modules and components, it explains what they are but does not offer one line of text on either telling you how to use them. I can go on and on, but to make a long story short save your money. Simply stated it is a pitiful excuse for a development guide and does nothing to live up to the title. There isn't a thing in the book you can't get from the available online Joomla! manual or from just plain common sense.

Leave the lid on with two chickens or a medium size turkey inside and the moisture stays inside creating great results every time. No dry poultry for me! Plus the steam helps to cook the bird faster than traditional pans. Yes, it's large and I like it that way because it holds what I want to put in it. I don't mind it taking up valuable real estate in my kitchen because I use it at least once every month. I am now thinking about ordering one for my niece as a wedding gift in hopes that she'll enjoy using it as much as I do! I can't tell you how many wonderful dinners this pan has been a part of.

A brief reading of all the reviews quickly reveals that those who think that L.V.H. should never be released simply hate the book, and those that are willing to consider K. Faith's perspective typically liked it.I don't think that K. Faith's perspective is completely objective, but it does raise some very interesting points: Should we be open to the notion that people can change and that prisons should serve not just to punish criminals (at a tremendous cost to society) but also to rehabilitate? Perhaps one of the most interesting questions is \\"should taxpayers continue to keep someone behind bars when they clearly are no longer a threat to society?

The author goes on and on and on (and on) about how wonderful of a person Leslie Van Houten has become. In fact, Ms. Van Houten does sound like a fine person, but the author's reverence towards her is hard to stomach and it makes the book hard to take seriously. 2) The political yammerings are also offputting.

And clearly, the author is extremely biased towards Van Houten. I know this IS a BOOK REVIEW, but I feel compelled to express my opinion about the subject matter. Leslie Van Houten made conscious and sane decisions back in 1969. One of those decisions was to join the Manson family. Another was to participate in the murders of the LaBiancas. Whether she stabbed Mrs LaBianca after she was already dead or not is moot. As for her reform in prison, SO WHAT. She should feel lucky she avoided the Death Penalty. I hope that she never, ever gets out.

It is hard ot determine if Leslie is ready for parole. Her parole was denied today. I guess it is in Gods hands if she ever gets out. The book does give a strong agrument for her parole.

Both crusaders share the fact that they have no super powers but rely on wits & detective work to solve their mysteries...The story respects that. The plot is coherent & the atmosphere is deadly serious & the characters are well drawn. You feel that Green Arrow has more to say to his dark friend but your desire for the stars to interact is left unfullfilled.That was a good read, all in all, and could serve a primer for those two fine characters to meet up again & defy evil. Whether you get the full comraderie thing out of it is not certain...but the ending is dark & well deserved.Here's for seeing them together again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What a boring read!The artwork is awful!

Also the unecessary bit about the Winx stating their powers during their transformation was back (which was quite off putting since during the Day of the Gifts Stella was again the fairy of the moon and sun instead of just the fairy of the shining sun as she is in the Nick dub)and Nick changed Bloom's mom's name.All and all it is a good movie, the effects are nice and the detail that 3D animation allows to be put into the Enchantix outfits is lovely. I just wish some of the lines and Bloom's birth mom's name wasn't changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Humor and dialogue were second rate, even for kids, and with naked fairies spinning into torn bikinis to channel their powers, I'd say this show was written with older guys in mind, not kids.

The actual footage shot, or used, is only ten percent of the film; the rest is a well edited collage of old movie clips with the new sound track running v.o. This in itself is not a new technique, but to do a whole film this way is an innovation -- and it works (at least for me it does). If you don't know anything about L. Ron Hubbard, Jack and Cameron Parsons, and their magical high jinks in the late 1940s you may find yourself lost in a surrealistic maze. So, I suggest you read \\"Strange Angel, \\" and/or \\"Sex and Rockets\\" before you watch Mock up on Mu, then you will really enjoy it -- that is if you enjoyed the misadventures of America's favorite mad scientist and his nemesis who became the mad guru of you-know-what.

(They sound like something from the Lawrence Welk Show, only he would have done them better.) Five of the 16 songs on the first CD are recorded by the United Studio Orchestra and Choral Singers of Holland. One of them has a portion of the lyrics in Dutch. The second CD is guitar music.

His only failing was that he was a Tejano in a land being overrun with Anglos who were hungry for land and power. Seguin's service during the revolution was quickly forgotten and he was abused by the Johnny-Come-Latelies who filled Texas and San Antonio after all the fighting was over.

Although I greatly enjoyed that series, I always had the feeling I was missing a lot of what was going on under the surface. 'The Fifth Head of Cerberus, although still somewhat opaque (especially the second story), is much more straight forward. In this case the answers are ambiguous but at least I felt I knew what the question was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging and Provocative","review":"As one expects from Wolfe, this is a first-class, three-part sci-fi novel that merits rereading.

The recipes read well, have easy-to-follow instructions, and rave-review results. The titles of some are not \\"European-cuisine\\" perfect, but these recipes came from small communities all across America from people who used packaged mixes sometimes and started from scratch sometimes, have never set foot in a cooking school, and maybe don't title things just right.

I logged a defect ticket with Sirius radio assuring me that I would receive a replacement radio within 30 days. Well, its been over two months and counting. Sirius customer care says it may be several more months before I get a replacement radio. The product is bad, and the Sirius customer service is worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sirius Radio Rocks !","review":"It always a shame when one customer review trashes a product for what may well have been simply a defective end-user installation (as previously reported), but I think anyone considering a satellite radio system should note what everyone else is stating in their reviews, which is simply that the radio and service work as stated by the manufacturer and get 5 stars in their reviews.Simply put, anything made by man \\"can\\" go wrong, but in the world of electronics 99.999% of the time the item is either dead out of the box or works practically forever.

Yes it's cheesy, yes some of the special effects are...well..bad, yes it is completely \\"historically\\" inaccurate. If you're a hard core Arthurian scholar you are unlikely to enjoy the show - to say it takes liberties with the legends is putting it mildly. This is kind of \\"Merlin and co. are all teenagers together\\" and the show's creators don't seem to be concerned with being overly \\"high brow.\\"This is clearly a First Season. Meaning, the actors become more comfortable with their characters, scripts, and sets.

The writing is awesome, and the show never fails to draw me in week after week dying to know what happened next. I cannot say this about very many shows today. Merlin is now going into it's fifth (5th) season and it still has me wanting to see more of it, hoping that it won't ever end.

I'm a fan of \\"The Sword of Truth\\" books if not the rather sad TV series by the same name. This series is head and shoulders above the TV series of Sword of Truth and captured and held my full attention from the beginning. If you've enjoyed Harry Potter or the Sword of Truth books you will enjoy this one as well.The acting, scenery, directing and costumes are convincing and satisfactory. While there may be some casting questions those are of little enough significance to not compromise the total quality of the series. I recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merlin - Season one","review":"The Merlin series is a fun way to escape into the world of kings, wizards and dragons without leaving your comfort of your home.

I have gotton soooo many people hooked on this show. We NEVER want it to end. This show NEEDS to be on a main network station...it is just toooo darn good to show up here in the US on the SYFY channel at such a late hour. So if you actors are reading this, thank you so very much for bringing this fine show to this Grandma...I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear, oh dear","review":"Lots of folks who like medieval things recommended this to me, but it seems to suffer from the same plague as the newest BBC Robin Hood: so many blatant anachronisms it is simply unwatchable. First off, trousers? What is the costume department's aversion to hose? And, of course, a mishmash of centuries in the general garb of everyone, like a re-enactors festival. All right, it is about the Arthur legends and where does that really put it in terms of costumes, but pick a century already. Signs on the walls for people to read as well as letters written. Dear, dear. I suppose I don't mind so much the language used, a little updated for contemporary audiences, but with everything else, it's just too much. Why does it have to be so dumbed down? I was only able to get through twenty minutes of it. That's twenty minutes I won't get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"simple and sentimental","review":"This series is good for kids or young adults, as long as they have access to the more original arthurian legends to balance it out. The acting, directing, and writing are precious and overly sentimental and the retconning of the arthurian legend seems so unnecessary as to make one wonder why they didn't just create a whole brand new story with new characters and call it something else entirely. I'm disappointed that they made Arthur, Gwynn, Merlin, and Morgana all the same age. It's like watching Young Hercules with all that entailed. If you're a true fantasy fan, don't waste your time with this, especially if you like the more classical stories of Camelot and King Arthur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"That is the only way to put this show into words.

I was so impressed with this version that I stopped looking for the definitive version.(I considered this good enough, and I'm pretty picky!!) The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because there are no extras. I just wanted to let people know.

THE CONVERSION PROCESS DOES NOT WORK! You cannot see any meaningful depth whatsoever! They did the same thing with some other movies, such as Night of the Living Dead, City Girls, etc. etc.IF YOU ARE BUYING BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SEE IT IN 3-D, FORGET IT! If you are satisfied with seeing it in 2-D, then you are fine. If you want to see real 3-D, you can do so with a field-sequential 3-D viewing system, but only use movies that were released to theaters in 3-D and then released on DVD in field-sequential 3-D. Some of the anaglyph movies (red/blue glasses) also work fairly well, but again, only if they were originally shot in 3-D. Quality varies widely.

Even though Little Shop was colorized(which is bad enough), I thought the so-called restored B/W version might be good to have. This so-called restored version had a major splice in dialogue in the scene where Jack Nicholson comes into the dentist's office. I have a dollar store version where that scene is intact. So much for Legend's restoration. This shows how little they think of their customers. The best thing all-around would be for Legend to be put out of business for this and their multilation of other films. Legend insults the consumer and the filmmakers with their colorization and editing of films. Legend=Rampant Incompetance."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie, lousy copy","review":"If you've never seen Little Shop but love humor on the edge, this is more than worth the money (though I bought the same copy from another source for a dollar less).But, if you love film, this copy is abysmal, not even close to Corman's original. There's dirt on the film, contrast is limited (though the movie is watchable) and detail is definitely compromised. It's recorded in VHS EP mode.Corman made some great films, this title is arguably the best of its genre, and I hate to think that the original may be lost or missing, and this is all we have left.It may have been shot in two days, but it was excellent B/W not so long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the funny version","review":"I didn't realize there were other versions of \\"Little Shop of Horrors.\\" This one is kind of creepy if your looking for the Rick Moranis version.

You should just watch this movie, because it's not what you think it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original is still the best","review":"This is the original black and white version, at least on one disk. Supposedly produced in just a few days near Los Angeles' Skid Row, the treat here is to see and hear the comic one liners, the outrageous accent and performance of the shop owner, and the 1st acting role for a certain now-famous actor.For me, definitely, turning this into a musical was a step back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roger Corman's florist-shop bloodfest classic","review":"Roger Corman's original LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS is a classic cult B-movie that is full of classic one-liners and immortal performances.Jonathan Haze is fantastic as the nervous Seymour, who grows the Venus Fly-Trap plant (whom he calls \\"Audrey Junior\\") and ends up supporting it's flesh-eating habit. Jackie Joseph plays Seymour's long-suffering girlfriend Audrey, while Mel Welles plays Seymour's eternally-flabergasted employer Gravis Muschnick.But it is Myrtle Vail, as Seymour's mother, that gives perhaps the most hilarious performance. She is superb.

Boy, is it obvious that this was written by a much younger writer. The plot is interesting, the action fast-paced, but the writing is pretty awful. Let's face it, having the villain stand on a hill and shake his fist at the escaping hero is so cliched as to be embarrassing. Read it only to fill in the background for the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great continuation of the story.","review":"I'm am sitting here wondering if those people who gave this book such a bad review even read it; or perhaps they didn't understand it. I will be the first to admit that it is not her best work ever done, but it is far from the worst book ever written either. This novel has quite a few unpleasant moments in it, but that is part of the story the author is trying to portray. how true to life would it seem if everything in all of the novels was always peaches and cream?

If you're going to spend $6.00 on this thing, considering how much $ and time go into dealing with the sheer volume of stuff to wash, do yourself a favor and spend a little more and get something, or a few things, that work -> are well-built -> and are not a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faithful dishwasher basket","review":"I used this basket for years with my three children, without problem. Eventually after about four years, the top hinges broke loose, and while that wasn't ideal, it still worked by just placing the lid part on the basket.

It was so great to find this one on CD.

Eric Gale (guitar) and Richard Tee (Fender Rhodes, piano), both whom we lost sadly, really pull it together. Ralph Macdonald on percussion, among some very tasty string work on Dream Lady and Shadows. And, a catchy version of \\"Gotcha\\" Theme to Starsky and Hutch. My only complaint with the recording, originally, was the saxes sounded tinny and a bit loud but it's forgivable because this work is so well done. If you love 70s style fusion as much as I, this is another one for the library. See, also, Tom Scott and the LA Express albums, several, like \\"Tom Cat\\" and \\"New York Connection\\".

I checked the settings on the router itself and it shows there is \\"modem not ready\\", but when I plug the Netgear in, it worked flawlessly... so just boils the problem down to the Dl-713P.Another complaint is the print server part is very slow once there is a bit of activity on the router. Sometimes I don't even get any printouts although the print que show them printing. I don't think this unit works very well at all from my experience.

Now I use a Netgear 401 card in my XP Pro laptop and I get amazing range. I think it must be a combination of the card and the router. Anyway you just have to understand whether or not you recieve a Static IP or Dynamic IP ect. from your ethernet provider and you will be fine. Also the SSID thing can mess you up. Just make sure the SSID on your router matches the SSID entered into your wireless card and you will be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, Stay Away!!!!!","review":"The D-LINK 713P worked for about 10 days and then the connectivity dropped every day progressively till it finally stopped working.

Calls to DLINK are fustrating to say the least. As far as they are concerned the problems are related to the fact that I do not have a DLINK card. Go view the reviews on practicallynetworked.com.

With my 30+ years in the IT field you'd think a consumer product wouldn't be much of a challenge, but with the dearth of support from Dlink and the lack of anything resembling a useful user's guide - well, what can I say?

For a novice user it is extremely difficult to configure. I have a windows 98 desktop and it couldn't detect the router. I couldn't upgrade the firmware like others said cause it wouldn't even detect it. The windows xp laptop did detect the router but I couldn't get it to work because the product came defective. I spend four days trying to install it and an hour with the D-Link tech support. Their magical formula was hold the reset button for 5 sec, and while holding it unplug the power cord for another 5 sec. Still holding the reset button, plug the power cord back in and wait another 5 sec. It didn't work for me cause they determined my router had defective ports but you can give it a try. However, I did find the tech support nice and helpful, unlike what the other reviews stated. For AT&T cable modem users, you must register the router's MAC address with AT&T to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"it just works","review":"I don't have major needs right now, I just wanted something that I could plug in and it would just work.

Installing the printer driver takes about 10 minutes each per machine.I did *not* need a firmware upgrade - the firmware version listed in the config screen was the same as the one available on Dlink website.I have a 3COM wireless card on my laptop and it works well with that - except that on the laptop, I get only half the download speeds (500 Kbps) that I get on my wired desktop(1Mbps).

I had the Internet connection up and running again with that first try of setting it up. I use it together with Orckit Fast Internet/ADSL.I also use Adobe Web Workgroup Server and it will be interesting to see how computers from outside of the LAN will get through the firewall feature of this and work properly, I have configured it but my co-workes are sleeping at this time of the day, so I haven't heard from them yet...whether it has caused any troubles or not.

For one thing, they do not seem to have a checklist or any kind of strong customer database to systematically walk you through steps to solve your problem. Dlink customer service also seemed to have several trainees when I called, and supervisors seemed unwilling to step in more quickly when these trainees floundered. The representatives often gave oversimplistic answers: \\"buy a crossover cable\\" or \\"we don't support that operating system\\" without explaining why or making any kind of suggestions. Too often, you are left feeling that you are trying to figure out the equipment on your own. Additionally, after several calls, customer service found that I had received a defective item.

I've used the old gray/black version for years and have been most pleased with it. With all the Wireless G stuff out now, this old B version with a print server is avaiable for $15 on ebay regularly. Unfortunately, the newer silver version has been consistent with many of the negative reviews on here. My wired connection seemed to work initially for 5 minutes (but very slowly), then cut off and I have never been able to ping the router since. The wireless portion is also similarly sporadic with odd disconnects and stalling. Maybe I was sold a known defective one, but at this point I can only recommend getting the old ugly gray version.

Not being sure if it was my Netgear card in the laptop, or the router, I picked up the Linksys router to troubleshoot with. Unlike, the D-Link product, my range is better and the connection quality seems consistent at 11Mbs. All indications are that the D-Link transmitter is flaky.Take a guess which one is going back.

A buddy of mine also wanted to go wireless and asked me to help him out. He's on SBC Ameritech as well, but is moving soon to an area that is serviced by Direct TV.

You catch glimpses of how the war affected the lives of everyday people. The movie is well made with wonderful scenery.

But Martin's character, Dr. Frank Sangster, makes one incredibly stupid decision after another, to the point of unbelievable absurdity.For the most part, the story was dull. The plot was dumb, and the villains motive is never explained: why would someone develope such an extremely elaborate plot to steal a dental practice?

Martin stays in character, without reaching for a laugh when he thought the script was letting him down. The supporting cast is good, the script fair to middlin'. Of course, it is the star who holds the thing together, and manages to keep us from laughing when a laugh is not called for.

This movie isn't a comedy and is too awkward to be a drama/thriller. Dr. Sangster is so relentlessly bland that he's too dull to care about, and Carter's slutty drug addict character is completely repulsive.

The characters are good. The story is engrossing. It's got a fresh take on historical fiction/fantasy. There's no Deus ex Machina. While some of the plotlines are predictable, I am surprised many a time. The back story is pleasantly well fleshed out. The back and forth between flashback and present-day works exceedingly well.Was it perfect? No. But this is a first effort and I can't wait for more.

That's okay, and I wouldn't have minded so much if the rest of the book made up for the fantasy-lite experiences. However, the book starts off rather slow. It's a long while before it picks up as the author lays out the elaborate \\"scheme\\" the characters are involved in. Those were some of the slowest parts. It did pick up in parts of the book and there were so geniune good moments, but in the balance of things, not enough. Also, I'm no prude. I swear myself on occassion, but the characters swear nearly every time they speak, high class, low class, middle class, they all do and for not reason. I swear when I'm mad or tense. The characters in this swear for no reason at all except that the author seems to think it's cool. On the plus, and the reason for 2 stars, is some of the action scenes were pretty good, but they were far apart and few."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This book probably deserves three stars, but I was so disappointed after having read so many glowing reviews that I can't help but give it a lower rating! The main character doesn't seem to have any substance at all. He's supposed to be extremely clever, witty, and street-smart, but he makes mistake after mistake in his adventures, getting his friends killed in the process. I found the one-liners to be inappropriate and annoying. The swearing doesn't bother me too much, I just didn't feel any respect or sympathy for the main character. It's not really the same type of literature, but you might try Robin Hobb's Farseer series if you're looking for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Impressed with the positive reviews this book received, I decided to give it a read, but finished feeling like I wasted my time. I'll skip discussing thing like technique, writing style, etc. and just cut to the chase - I didn't particularly like the story. There were some parts that I found entertaining, but another reviewer described it best as a \\"confection\\". It never felt like there were any teeth here, and in particular, I found Locke's character inconsistent with the stature attributed to him. Writing \\"clever\\" is very difficult, and the action in this book never seemed as clever as the character was supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Desperate to find something to read in between Hobb's, George R.R. Martin's, Guy Gavriel Kay's, C.S. Friedman's and Donaldson's latest, I chose this title primarily based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. I've been reading fantasy for over 25 years and appreciate all the aspects of world building, so was considerably dismayed when I saw my very own American foul language peppered throughout the pages of this fantasy. And despite all the rave reviews, I would argue the plot plods, the characters are two dimensional and the \\"twists and turns\\" become annoyingly repetitive and predictable half way through the tome. I feel no pathos for the orphan who only finds purpose in life when he seeks revenge. To keep this review short and put it bluntly, this book bored me enough to write my second review ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN!!!","review":"Fantasy book lovers (and lovers of good books in general), this book was just simply a lot of FUN! The story telling is great, the dialogue real and genuinely funny at times, and the world created feels real. Give this one a try, you will not disappointed. I am looking forward to reading the second book - Red Seas Under Red Skies. Thanks, Scott Lynch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First, build a world. Then, save it.","review":"I really enjoyed this book.If you're a fan of con men, swindlers, and heists, as well as spells and swordplay, you'll probably like this novel. I was surprised and happy with the amount of world-building that went on, until I discovered that this is to be the first of seven novels for the author. Scott Lynch never lets the action bog down in one place by alternating a chapter of story in the present with an interlude from the fictional past, where he weaves in clues that pay off later.I really don't have anything in particular that I disliked about the book, though the length may turn some people off."},{"rating":"2","title":"No lie","review":"I just want the 3rd book to be released! I've been waiting awhile! There is a first chapter floating around, but it wasn't enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling story, offensive delivery","review":"The story is good enough that I really wanted to finish the book, but the offensive language was a huge turn off. I did not give this book away--I threw it away, thinking not many readers would tolerate the foul words. Now I know to always check the lower ratings on a highly rated book in the hope that someone will give more clues about the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"senoir reader","review":"i got tired of using white-out to cover swear words and trying to figure what period of time the auther had this section of chapter. it is not a good book for it takes 10 pages to get any action but by then you are off to another time. go to a resale store and pay 50 cents for it for you'll end up tossing it out like i did after 200 pages of swear words and more to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from Amazon","review":"This book so far has been great however halfway through the book there is a printing error that ruins the book right during one of the best parts. The pages are cut off at the top of the page meaning you only get half of the page then the bottom half of the page is printed upside down and has nothing to do with the top half so you miss out on about 40 pages of the story. I would suggest buying the book as it is really good but go to a books store and flip through the book to make sure its printed correctly look at pages 389 to 420."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mafia and Con Men with a Magical Twist, even an Oliver Twist.","review":"This is really a book about organized crime. Think Al Capone. Or think some swanky British gangsta film, like \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\", or \\"The Limey\\". Throw in a medieval backdrop built on the fossils of some alien race and you will understand the book's genre. A melange of everything.For those of you who are hell bent on magic, be forewarned, you'll find none until page 250 of the book. The author's pacing of the novel can be compared to a steam engine that has just left the train station at the top of the hill. The plot starts rather slow, but gets better and better and faster and faster.I highly recommend; especially to those who put up with the multiple story lines methodically found in Sanderson's \\"Elantris\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was ridiculous","review":"The Good: This book is all good. Lynch as a flow about his writing that allows readers to flip through quickly and enjoy every bit. He is descritptive without being overbearing and the characters are enjoyable and have their own personalities. The ending is biting, brutal without being overly grotesque, and overall satsifying.The Bad: Throughout the book Lynch has included \\"intermissions\\" where the main story veers off and he examines a back story or historical footnote. This wasn't too bad but I found I was skipping past some pages because I was so enthralled by what was actually happening and cared less about the footnotes.The Ugly: F-bombs. There are a lot of f-bombs in this book. Personally I did not care but for someone who isn't ready for it, it can be a bit of a surprise. I actually think they added the necessary grit but others may not think so.The Verdict: If you don't mind the cursing, then read this book. You will not be let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was amazing....","review":"It has been a long time since I \\"escaped\\" into a novel. Locke Lamora is a fun character... and there isn't a wasted word in the entire novel.Mr. Lynch did a tremendous amount of rewriting and editing. I don't want to spoil anything, but everything you read about no matter how minor becomes important later on.What a tremendous endeavor to undertake and it all slowly builds to a very satisyfing and believable conclusion.I cant imagine how much work went into this, but great gob Scott and good luck!Great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"I liked the story. The world was fasinating and the characters were funny and interesting. It seemed to be a book of flashbacks, which helped in the reading for the slow parts, but my only complaint is that the story dragged a bit here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know what I was getting into","review":"I picked up this book off the library's new book shelf. I had not heard the hype or any publicity about it. I love it! I was sorry when it ended and now I find it's a trilogy! For once, I'm thrilled. I want more. It was inventive, colorful, and twisty. I was surprised to find it was the author's first book. I look forward to more of Scott Lynch as well as Locke Lamora. I thought it might make an interesting movie. I am not sure what Hollywood will do with it, I hope it does not dissapoint the fans if it ever gets made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Venice","review":"Locke Lamora is a fantasy debut set in the sort of city that Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser would be happy to wander through. A dingy and corrupt fantastic Venice built on the ruins of alien magic.While some of the characters are underdeveloped our protagonist and his foe are worthy of note as are the laws of magic underlying the world.Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story of Revenge","review":"A band of tricksters and an orphan may sound like Oliver Twist but these are not your average criminals in this great story of revenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I was prepared to like this book but couldn't get past the tedious and lengthy descriptions of the scenery, the clothing, the way of things, etc etc etc. The elaborate descriptiveness totally got in the way of the story. I skipped ahead a few times to see if it was possible to get by the tedium but finally gave up in frustration. I read for pleasure and there are too many good books out there to waste time on the hum drum."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this introduction to an interesting world with captivating characters. I look forward to future adventures and getting to know them better.I could nitpick this first novel to pieces like some of the other reviewers, but why? I ENJOYED IT. It made me laugh. I gasped aloud for the first time since the red wedding. I even got a little teary eyed. That's the point. The Lies of Locke Lamora is a strong start and I truly hope it only gets better. I'll start nitpicking when it is a trilogy. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining from start to finish","review":"A refreshingly different setting, interesting characters with detailed back stories, and an engaging plot... what's not to like?OK, a couple of things... there was some extraneous writing here and there - for example the scenes of Locke trying to find new clothes were long and, in the end, unnecessary; and there were a few silly bits (fighting leaping sharks from platforms? Really?), but is fantasy after all.A high point for me was the world building. The thought put into the political and cultural infrastructure is outstanding. In fact it could have easily been a longer book had the history been explored more. The writing is also very good, in my opinion. Lots of humour mixed with generous dollops of pathos.It definitely left me with an appetite for more. I'll be getting the next in the series soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I promise you won't be able to put it down after getting sucked into this new World created by Scott Lynch."},{"rating":"1","title":"so much potential","review":"This book had so much potential. It has an interesting culture, it has a few characters that could glow, and a plot that could go places with volition. It does none of those things.There are flashbacks galore, interludes a plenty, and language that is gaudy. There are no cases in this story where a character uses a small word where a large one, or several large ones can be used instead. Worse, it feels as if the author has tried to shove an extra-superduper-extraordinary line of description every eight or twelve pages. The language clunks. It tries to be lyrical, it tries so hard and it fails. On top of this _all_ the characters have the same fulsome vocabulary, which seems a bit off. Sure, the group the title character is a part of is explained well, and the nobles are too, but the rest of the thieves, cut throats and petty criminals?This book is what I imagine it would be like to watch The Nutcracker be performed in plate armor and clogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for fantasy readers only","review":"I've read many of the thoughtful and honest responses to the book. Although I agree that there are too many flashbacks and some superfluous scenes, this book kept me rapt until I finished the last word. A phenomenal first effort and a great mix of excitement, intrigue, and pure fun. I recommended it to my brother (who is not a F&SF fan by any means) because it has the ability to resonate with non-fantasy folk. He LOVED it. I couldn't help but get attached to Locke and his artful dodger antics. Not a children's book, but appealed to the child in me. I highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dislike switching time lines","review":"I liked the characters and I think the story line would have been good. I hate reading books where the authoir keeps switching between past, current and future. It gives too much away about the past, and just gets irritating. Just as you get engrossed in the current story you get whisked forward or back and lose the momentum. Scott Lynch does so much of this that for the third time in my life I abandoned a book half way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Book","review":"I thought this book was really fun to read. It had a \\"Count of Monte Cristo\\" type of feel, which was really interesting to read in a book in the fantasy genre. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did I Happen to Mention That I'm Impressed?","review":"Actually, I believe the phrase is \\"hella impressed.\\" I've been let down by the past few books I've chosen based on reviews, and went into this book with a few pouting expectations. I should not have worried. Although the language is definitely adult--no Harry Potter here--the game's afoot and the story unique. I am looking forward to adding many Lynch novels to my fiction collection.Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get into it","review":"I don't understand how this book received such stellar reviews. It is just plain boring from the very first word of the very first chapter. I tried, I really did but if you find yourself skipping entire paragraphs or pages from the fist chapter, well then you already know it sucks. Didn't care about the main character, didn't care about his crew, and ultimately never finished this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth the effort","review":"Mr. Lynch has some decent ideas but this book is a tough read. The story jumps around with very little transition and can be tough to follow. It is also filled with gratuitous vulgarity from curse words to obscene comments. I am not easily offended but the language shocks you away from the story. This book desperately needs an editor and a rewrite, until that happens don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refershingly Exhilerating","review":"This was an excellent read. The story was fresh, the characters were real, and the world was very well realized.For the reviewers who complained of the level of profanity used through out the novel, all I can say is that it brought even more realism to the story when taking into consideration the class of society that the story revolves around. It's unfortunate that this could be offensive to some people, just understand that the whole world isn't as proper as the little bubble people have a tendency to form around themselves.With that being said, This book does have a high amount of profanity in it. So keep that in mind!Excellent Book, all around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"Maybe not the best book ever written but it kept me in my room on a saturday night which tells for itself ,I like the character, the atmosphere and the plot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"I enjoyed the book, but it felt a bit slow up until the middle. It wasn't until you met the story's main antagonist, the Grey King, half way through, that the book actually got good. Before that, it was just Locke running around doing his business and character background information.I will admit that the ending was a bit disappointing. It was a bit over the top. The ending is a bit like cheesy action movies where the actors takes 50 bullets, 200 stab wounds and multiple beatings and yet somehow has to strength to get one good hit on his enemy and lives to tell his tale.I'd recommend this book but I wouldn't would it on the top of your list, maybe towards the middle. For a very good fantasy series, I recommend the Mistborn Trilogy by Brandon Sanderson.Oh and one more thing, for those of you looking for magic, there isn't much in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"I found this book to have great dialog (reminiscent of Jack Vance), interesting characters, a picturesque setting with good world building, and a good plot. It is a great first effort for a new author. I would give it 5 stars except it dragged a bit for me and perhaps could have been better presented in a slightly shorter length. Never the less, I look forward to tackling the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly charming fantasy.","review":"Most fantasy isn't very good, and a very small portion of what is worth reading isn't worth purchasing, but Scott Lynch has really created a fantastic book in The Lies of Locke Lamora. A humorous tale of a band of rogues and the well-described city they inhabit, this novel starts off as self-satisfied as its hero and is easy to write off. Given time, however, it becomes apparent that Lynch isn't arrogant; he's merely confident, and the story gets better as it goes, all the way through the rousing climax. The characters in this book leap out of the page, and the recommendation from master author George R. R. Martin is well-placed. If you're tired of sorcerors and knights and kings and their kingdoms, give Locke Lamora a chance. It's like Perdido Street Station but without the deadly seriousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Clarity","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and would definitly recommend this book.

He is not for everybody. He is for those who are interested in the mind, in desire, in language. Specifically, for those who have developed an interest in \\"theory\\" or \\"post-structuralism\\", which he helped to develop. In this volume Lacan sets out some key concepts in his thinking - but he does not do so systematically! Do not expect him to explain everything to you in a clear, linear fashion. Rather, he plays on words and on ideas, he maneuvers and evades, he skirts around the issue, and comes back to it. Have patience if you choose to read him - discuss his writings with others. If you do this, you may come to understand why Lacan is regarded with so much respect in France and has virtualy reared an entire generation of first-rate theorists and thinkers.It will help (but will not guarantee understanding) if you have some background in Freud, even if it is only a slight one. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not a classic","review":"For my child who loves stories, I like to give nice books that are both picture books and that have long-ish stories to read out loud. This book fit the bill. The stories are imaginative and the illustrations in this volume are pretty nice. Overall it is a nice package and my child was excited enough about the gift to read through all the stories once. But it doesn't seem that it is going to have the same staying power as other previous choices like \\"D'Aulaires Norse Myths\\" or a nice volume of tales from the Arabian Nights. It's just not in the same league."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginers","review":"The book has some very interesting plans and good photos for those how like to work with wood and make toys for children and as keepsakes.However this is not for the begining wood worker.

Unless the part is drawn to scale you will need to make it to fit on your own.Having a complete wood shop, I found that I had to use many tools that were not listed as needed in the book. In some cases I needed to improvise, such as using my drill press as a vertical lathe. Just watch the grain paterns as shown and you will be able to produce somthing to be proud of.To date I have made the Pick Up (29 Ford), Peterbilt Tractor with box trailer and Buick Sedan.

For instance, the addition of Angela Gossow on vocals, replacing Johan, and Christopher Amott left after the recording of this album. Once again though, I think Arch Enemy have proven that they are better than they have ever been. This record truly shines, the guitar tone is sick. Not much else I can say about it because words can hardly describe it. Andy Sneap (as always) did an amazing job mixing this album, as with other great albums from Exodus, Trivium, Nevermore, Killswitch Engage, Caliban, As I Lay Dying, and countless others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Solid","review":"Much like the previous Anthems of Rebellion, Arch Enemy delivers a solid yet somewhat forgettable album. With the introduction of Angela on Wages of Sin, the band delivered a really powerful outing, creating an album with many must-hear tracks. Here, you get a very solid album top-to-bottom, but few of the tracks have that \\"special\\" feel to them.Nemesis was the obvious choice for a single, and it does stand out among the rest of the album. What the next single will be is beyond me...nothing is screaming for that need. My Apocolypse is probably the next best offering off the CD, and the intro track is pretty sweet as well. But everything else just kinda blends together.The album is by no means bad. It rocks. But Arch Enemy can and has done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its over","review":"I will at least show my true colors and admit I think they have gone downhill since the addition of Angela at vocals. I think musically they have lost their spark and I think her vocals are overrated by a plethora of googly-eyed male teens. The fact of the matter is there really is not a lot of substance to this album. \\"Machtkampf\\" and \\"Nemesis\\" are among the few songs that have grabbed my attention. \\"Hybrids of Steel\\" is actually a pretty engaging instrumental that really doesn't sound like anything else on here. This was not enough for me though, and I think it important for potential Arch Enemy fans to know that this album does not touch the greatness of \\"Burning Bridges\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"First three and then let it be!","review":"The First three songs rip and then it is on to the crapiest Arch Enemy has been since their last singer. If you likes the first two album that were any good then you will hate this one. Arch Enemy is melodic fast paced metal and Wages of Sin and Anthems of Rebellion were amazing and Doomsday Machine sucks. I am disappointed and am waiting for the next cd hopefully they will bounce back. The closest I could compare the crappiness of this cd would be when Metallica came out with St. Anger. The old Metallica fans hated it and now Metallica has a bunch of new fans that like the new sound which I think they sould have broken up instead of coming out with St. Anger. I will say one good thing about the cd and that is Nemesis is like the Arch Enemy of old and completly kicks ass. I suggest that anyone that wanted to metal it up should go pick up the new Trivium, As I Lay Dying or some Children of Bodom.

I like Angela, she's a talented metal vocalist, so I don't put all the blame on her, even though I think that the albums following Wages of Sin have been lame.I could only listen to this album twice, and the second time I listened to it, it was hard to imagine that Arch Enemy of all bands are making this transition.

This is evident from the slow lazy guitar riffs in the LOAD albums up to their disgracefull slacker performance in St. Anger.AE Plays amazing guitar riffs especially on this album. their very full and rich in tone with a metallica-ish type of chug to it. Unlike the other Scandanavian Metal bands such as Dark Tranquility, In Flames, and Dimmur who cheapen their songs with symphonic background music, Archenemy keeps their sound raw by emphasizing there guitars drums and vocals.. These guys (and the gal) are pure black metal.. I get a lot of enjoyment listening to their guitar mastery complimented by their vocals.

They put on a really good show. It amazes me how this swedish woman could have such a devastating scream, and it really does work for the band. The only downside to Arch Enemy, I would say, would be that the music is repetitive after a while. I like listening to a couple Arch songs every now and then, but I will get tired of trying to listen to the whole album. They have a solid epic formula that doesn't move around much. Arch Enemy is a great band with enourmous talent, but it just isn't my favorite metal group. Bangers on this cd are: Nemesis, Taking back my soul, and Skeleton Dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned the alphabet, but where did it come from?","review":"Nice illustrations and explaination of development of our alphabet.

Now being a former Marine and I know what that is like. That alone was enough to make me read it, and I was suprised as to how tastfully it was done. I loved the characters McCullers created and how she was short and to the point with there feelings. A quick read and a ...honest one at that. Very honest about gay supressed passions.

It's not a standard 7 days per row, Sunday to Saturday. It's 10 days per row one month, 12 the next month, seven the next (but going Wednesday to Tuesday). Unbelievably stupid!! Did someone actually think they were improving the calendar this way?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't I read the reviews first?","review":"Pretty pictures, but useless as a calendar.

Two minor nitpicks...wish it was in standard format instead of sideways (of course if they did that the pictures would not look nearly as cool!) and I wish they would start putting descriptions of the pics in the calendar.

This calendar only has art work from the original (Captain Kirk) series.The art work itself is significantly inferior to that of previous calendars and the ideas behind the pictures show no imagination, no indication that the artists tried to take any risks, no sign that anyone tried to illustrate the Star Trek universe in a different way. If you want an example of what I am going on about get your hands on a copy of the Ships of the Line 2002 calendar done by Mojo Lebowitz and Robert Bonchune - superb. The images themselves looked like they were knocked up on a home PC - no sense of depth or scale.If the original series of Star Trek is your bag then this calendar might be of interest you. For everyone else keep your money in your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save you money","review":"Previous calendars were dramatic and creative but not this time around - it seems they were just interested in getting it out for print. It is solely from the origial series and I wonder why this is as it will limit the appeal to customers from all the other incarnations of Star Trek. Why don't they open it up to the fans to create their own images and have a book published (which they were originally planning)- it would be much more interesting and would spark the imagination of viewers just like the many generations of star trek."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed. Some nice pictures, no calendar value whatsoever","review":"The dates in this calendar are the smallest I've ever seen. Beside nice pictures of some Star trek ships, you can't use this in your office as you need a magnifying glass to recognize the dates.Moreover, there are 2 holes at the top of the calendar to hang it on the wall, but this means making an extra hole but the regular single hole that other calendars are using and that's not going to happen in my place.I consider this product a total FAIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful as a calendar","review":"Whoa, I was extremely disappointed in this \\"calendar\\"... The pictures are fabulous, no arguing that, but the \\"calendar\\" function is completely unusable. First off, the calendar opens sideways, so you need 2 hooks to hang it and it will take up more horizontal space than you may have planned for. That's strange, but not an insurmountable issue. The main problem is that the \\"calendar\\" printed on each page is not a standard Sunday-Saturday calendar format. The months are displayed starting at the first day of the month, sometimes in only 2 lines, not the standard 2 week format. For example, if the first day of the month is a Tuesday, the calendar starts with Tuesday and may have 2 weeks worth of dates printed on 2 lines, instead of 4. This is not useful as a calendar. Maybe I missed all these details in the description, I don't know, but thought I'd warn others before they bought this. I am SO disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous...","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I'm TOS/TMP/TWOK-era fan, far more than for any of the other eras (though they were, for the most part, quite fun). I love seeing the TOS-era stuff... which people tend to dismiss as \\"cheesy\\" (without any real basis other than \\"it was made in the 60s so it has to be cardboard and strings\\"... which, of course, is utter nonsense!) done with \\"let's make it real\\" sensibilities. The cover of this calendar is a masterful example of this practice... and there are multiple other images in this (and its predecessors) which I absolutely LOVE looking at! I also enjoy the other stuff... the only Trek designs I've ever actually disliked are the Voyager and the ST-2009 \\"Enterprise redesign\\" (which, thankfully, is not to be found in this work!).If you love the ships of Star Trek... you can't go wrong with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a wall calendar","review":"I ordered this product expecting a wall calendar. Instead, I received a \\"magazine\\", complete with the staples in the middle for binding, etc. There are a couple of little holes on top of the pages if you hold the magazine landscape. I was VERY disappointed. They should advertise it as a magazine that you COULD make-shift into a wall calendar. The dates are printed very small on the corners of the magazine. It's not set up like your typical wall calendar format with squares to write in events. If you want a magazine of pictures, this is for you. If you want a calendar, it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This calendar made me angry- DO NOT BUY HERES WHY","review":"Every calendar I've seen has been either desktop with rip to remove pages or they'e been wall calendars which flip up.This calendar opened side to side requiring 2 nails to hold it on the wall.

The calendar is in \\"widescreen\\" format, so you need two hooks to hang it, but it's worth it to have great artwork each month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Pictures, but bad calendar","review":"There are 8 columns for days in the calendar, which makes it extremely confusing to figure out which dates correspond to which days. Also the print of the dates is extremely small so you can't make notes. Since the purpose of a calendar is primarily for this things this is a horrible calendar in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ships of the Line 2007 Wall Calendar","review":"I was seriously disappointed that there was no ST: Enterprise calendar this year, but this one is a fair substitute. Problem is, I haven't found a place to hang it up yet. Its the 'wrong way' to fit in the place where I have always hung my calendars. And, there isn't a place to write your important data on the calendar. Appointments, notes, and reminders... etc. However the ship pictures are incredible and wonderfully detailed. I'll save it for sure, as a Star Trek memento. But as a functional calendar it leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about buying this \\"calendar.\\"","review":"I bought this product with the idea of purchasing a calendar.

I found the book to be good but the totally mature and X-Rated content was offensive and totally horrible to be seen by me, a teenager. Some people might disagree with a teenager reading this book but I read it anyways. Parents if you are letting your teenager read this book, I suggest you think twice. The book was good though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Third in trilogy no more hopeful than the first two","review":"Whistle completes the trilogy started in From Here to Eternity and The Thin Red Line. Four characters are carried over -- the 1st Sergent, the clerk, the mess sergent, and the misfit. Here, they return stateside on a hospital ship, each with their own wounds, and the novel follows their intertwined and separate destinies. It may be one of the best attempts to outline Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, but Jones never dips so low as to call it some buzz phrase like that.Recommended to those who have read either or both of the first two books. Maybe a tough slog for those without that background. Out of print for a long time, I read a copy in the library. This useful reissue is presumably being driven by the film of The Thin Red Line. I found that book and film moving. Whistle can be immensely *more* saddening in comparison, esp. the film, which is almost hopeful compared to Jones. -dB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whistle - an interesting end to the WWII Pacific Trilogy of James Jones","review":"I was unaware of the Trilogy and of Whistle when I came across it on Amazon / Kindle and appreciated the opportunity to complete the story. Whistle is different from the ENTERNITY AND THIN RED LINE in that it is after they leave combat and are rehabing in the hospital. The story sheds insights to how our Vets come back from the wars to follow as well. Jones really gets into the characters deeply, but the last 3 chapters close out the story without this depth as Jones had died prior to completing them.I recommed this to WWII buffs and Jones Fans, but it is a different story line.TDB"},{"rating":"2","title":"A world that never existed, or did it or should it have?","review":"Ben Katchor's magical, sketchily precise illustrations lead us through a grey other world where people face problems none of us will ever know. Or fathom. But who cares! Every step of the way is uniquely Katchor's, grounded in a strange logic that seems to make perfectly good sense... at least to his characters. A wealth of invention infuses every page, conjuring exotic maladies, bizarre business enterprises and wierd obsessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical and mesmerizing","review":"What an amazing book. I found myself torn whether to linger over particular panels or rush on to find out what happened next. Katchor clearly inhabited the archive for a long time before putting this together, and he really captures the beauty, strangeness, and confusion of Jewish life in the early republic. Complex and funny storyline, often surpisingly moving. And although the drawing style is a bit crude, the design is always subtle -- the overall effect only adds to the weirdness. Just brilliant, brilliant work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"This book is one of the greatest graphic novels ever made! A must read! As good as Maus and Ghost World! Sure to be the Best Book of 1999!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Live Up To The Reviews","review":"From the reviews and supposed reputation of Katchor I was expecting a thunderous resurgence of the graphic novel. It seems a shame that the glowing reviews it has garnered in no way reflect the sloppiness of the story or artwork. As a artform the graphic novel has been richly exploited in the fantasy world of comics. However as a mainstream novel method it has been largely ignored. But if employed with skill, as evidenced from Japanese authors, it can be a compelling format.However this book falls far short of that mark. The story is stock and uninteresting, and the characters and ending are sadly predictable.The only redeeming feature of the book is its binding. It is unfortunate, though, that every page the covers hold in place, lacks soul, skill, and imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funky Construction","review":"I must say, for such a ...piece of equipment, this device is not made very well.

For the rest of us who are by nature creative and are looking for ways to expand our self expression and method of thinking this book is a few steps back on that road. Maybe it was because it was assigned to me in a design class, but I found the exercises and commentary very 'right-angled' and redundant."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought-provoking and practical","review":"I found this book excellent for expanding one's intellectual arsenal of problem-solving skills. As the author himself admits, no single person will benefit from all the techniques described in this book, since every person has a unique way of thinking. Nevertheless, becoming familiar with the existing techniques will allow you to pick and choose the ones that work for you. Personally, I found many of these techniques to be applicable in every-day situations, in addition to solving scientific problems.As an added bonus, the book includes a list of excellent references to cognitive science and psychology material for the interested reader.The only minor complaint I had was that the material could be a bit better organized. Sometimes it reads more like an enumeration of techniques rather than a coherent text."},{"rating":"1","title":"More blocks, less busting","review":"If you're interested in learning about problems people encounter that keep them from being as creative as they might be, this book is for you.

The majority of its bulk is taken up describing various blocks people have which inhibit creativity -- cultural, societal, emotional, and so on. The author never describes how one can work past these blocks. Later on he points out that people have five senses and we should try to use all five of them when solving problems. All in all hardly groundbreaking stuff. In the end his message seems to be: you have to exercise your imagination if you want to be more creative but he doesn't include enough exercises to do that with this book.

I admired the economy of Malamud's writing style, especially since I had to read two very long novels by Saul Bellow for the same class. I thought all the characters in this book were sympathetic: the grocer, the thief/assistant, the daughter, the wife. Each had their own hopes, dreams, fears, desires, all of which crashed against one another in a tiny grocery store in Brooklyn.One thing about this book bothered me: that Malamud had Frank keep repeating the same mistakes over and over, and at times it seemed as if the author didn't know when and where the novel should end.

Pianist/composer Sayles leads the sextet, in which violin and cello figure quite prominently, and she wrote all the tunes as well, sometimes nudging them into lightly jazzy terrain... It can sound a bit prim, but mostly it's pretty engaging. Worth checking out if you're looking for something new and off-the-radar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great jazz-influenced Celtic music!","review":"I heard a tune off Sayles' new CD on my local Celtic radio show and it blew me away so I picked up the disk. Sayles has somehow fused my favorite music genres, Celtic and Jazz, into a beautiful, swinging mixture. The melodies are lovely and the musicians are playing their hearts out. Great flute, violin and cello solos are heard throughout. I also like the \\"live\\" feel of the recording.

Things slowly start to fall apart. The only weakness was the ending to me.** SPOILERS **One thing that kept hitting me as I read this, was several scenes were used almost exactly in The Truman Show. The filmakers should have given some credit to this book. I liked the way this book did it better than Truman Show though. In the movie, the viewer knows what is going on from the very begining.

This, however, is not the only 'gem' this book provides.Read the short scene with the youth--spiked, colored hair. Wait a minute. This book was published in 1959. Spiked, colored hair in 1959?

Neither is this movie. You'd think that the powerhouse pairing of Susan Sarandon and Goldie Hawn would be a shoo-in.

My only comment is the beginning. For some reason the first reel (20 minutes) is a bit boring and i thought a better segway could have been provided for the two main stars to reunite. But when the film gets going it's wonderful talented comedy the rest of the way. The story also has a wonderful moral aspect which is basic and true.

No way!

Beyond that, it's a sad film peopled with caricatures rather than characters. The message seems to be that life as an upstanding citizen is a bad and deadly boring thing but reliving a former life in the fast lane can keep you \\"true\\".

Susan and Goldie trie their hardest, but even they can't overcome the bland script. Goldie is her normal silly outragous self, but she tries to hard and Kate Hudson did the blond, ditzy groupie role better in Almost Famous, which is a shame. Susan does well with what she can, but she seems bored. Geoffrey Rush should be embarrassed to play the role he played, and Erika Christenson and the other actress playing Susans daughter in the film, are so obnoxioulsy annoying, I wanted to fast forward all of their scenes. This could have been a better film, if it had better writers and better supporting actors, but all you get is a mess of a film that wastes the talents of two remarkable actresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This movie is great!

It is predictable, cliche, poorly written and extremely short on laughs (and any real understanding of what makes the characters tick.)

This book exemplified that ability. Being from the same part of Maine of which she writes, I can identify strongly with these characters. Reading this book thrust me back in time to my youth in Maine---I was overwhelmed with nostalgia simply because Mrs. Chute wrote so well and was able to breathe life into her story. The characters of this novel were Maine personified. Anyone who grew up in Maine can understand what I mean---it wasn't like reading a novel, but rather was like actually being there and experiencing it. Thank you, Carolyn, for treating me to a part of my life I had previously thought forgotten and past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another enthralling epic from the unabashedly real Chute","review":"Chute's cyclonic novel absolutely captivated me and revealed a world within the state in which I live, but one that will always exist outside of mine as an \\"outer-stater\\". The characters, their struggles and disappointments were utterly realized. However, I have a problem with Lloyd's final \\"Robin Hood\\" act. For nearly 700 pages, Chute gave us an utterly endearing and sensitive character in Lloyd Barrington, one who NEVER hurt anyone and only acted against faceless corporations. For him to act so contrary to that nature was unfounded, no matter the economic status of an individual. Any feedback?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad about the ending","review":"Living in a small Maine town, I can attest to the veracity of Chute's vision. The characters are well-realized. Many scenes are breath-takingly well-written. Two problems with the novel: (1) It would be better without Chute's sermons about the grotesque evils of hunting & corporate America. (2) It would be a great novel with a different ending. The final act of the protagonist, Lloyd Barrington, is uncharacteristically & gratuitously cruel. That Chute had to change her protagonist's personality shows that she did not know how to end this wonderful, sprawling novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun book for kids","review":"purchased this after seeing the movie Hugo and hearing an interview with Brian Selznick.

Historical facts are so smoothly woven into the storyline it is difficult to determine the line where reality cross over into fantasy. Replications of posters, pictures and articles from the era mixed with Selznick's notable illustrations show us the emotions felt by Victor as he pursues his hero, Houdini.This is an excellent book for the family to read together. Note it was originally written to the 9-12 year age group; the publisher recently listed it for 7-10 year olds, and Amazon has pushed that down to 4-8 year olds. No!

It 's a historical romance ... duh ... which means they all tend to resemble one another. There's usually a strong hero and a beautiful heroine who are initially in strife, yet sexually attracted to one another. Then, the hero fights some enemy to save the heroine, and they eventually fall in love. It seems that a person would read this genre and expect it to follow a certain pattern, since all them do. I enjoyed how the author seemed to stay true to the language and dialect and lore of that era and setting, although I don't know much about it. I also really liked the hero and heroine - he ... masculine and fierce, yet vulnerable ; her ... courageous and bold. They are a good match and destined to be together. That's what romance is all about. You'll see once you read it. The only reason I gave it a four and not a five is because I personally like more eroticism.

Fantasia outdoes herself on her second album. I love the ultracatchy Hood Boy and Like the Way that I Do. She made most of this album surprisingly upbeat. I like the cool groove of When I See You and she chews up her man on Two Weeks Notice. Most songs she boasts that this is her man and nobody else can have him and she delivers on every track. Producers like Missy Elliott, Bryan Michael Cox, Harris/Davis, Tone Capone, Swizz Beatz and others give Fantasia some solid urban tracks that match with her vocal style. And Fantasia's raspy voice is far better on this album than her debut. I love this effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the Person Singing This?","review":"Sounds nothing like the Fantasia from American Idol, whom I loved. Nothing of her unique voice or talent in this one. She lost herself in her first album and I had hoped maybe in the second she'd come back. Nope.

True, if you already have the original 1984 album, you might want to skip this one, and go for The Ultimate Kansas.

Although I personally felt that \\"Point of No Return\\" was probably one of the bands' most creative albums, this greatest hits compilation is one that every fan should own. Every song, besides toping the charts, was a reflexion of the thought and insight that true musicians put into their music.

The maps were good here too for Waikiki: I never got lost as I drove around, amazingly enough, even though my Hawaiian born friend and her friends did!!

One of his lyrics is \\"Now check it, I got more mck than craig and in the bed--Believe me sweetie I got enough to feed the needy\\" and his album, Ready to Die was released in 1994. Interesting. In Lil Kims song, The Jumpoff, she has a lyric \\"Got a man in Japan and a dude in Tahiti--Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy.\\" Coincidence? I have no idea.

But rappers who can give their songs style and infectious hooks are the ones I really admire-such as Black Eyed Peas, Eve, Missy Elliott, etc. With \\"How Many Licks?,\\" \\"Lady Marmalade,\\" and one of the tracks here might just add Lil' Kim to that list. The aforementioned track is the irresistibly hooky \\"Magic Stick,\\" possibly the best track Queen B has ever recorded.

The cosmic rays gleaming from 20-inch rims and the Newtonian dynamics of Hummers are addressed in profound tales of bling blinging through the space-time continuum. Her collaboration with fellow theoretical physicist 50 Cent presents a powerful challenge to proponents of string theory -- dismissing the malleability of strings of quantized waves, the two suggest that the central theorem of the universe may be derived from stiff, elongated rods of energy. Overall, this effort is a leap forward for quantum physics. I highly recommend other brilliant treatises by her prestiged colleagues Lil Romeo, B2K, and the prolific P.

Though within this album La Bella Mafia she hasn't used it as much. But not the fret long time Lil' Kim fans! She still has it. Many were dissapointed with her last album Notorious K.I.M., but this does more than make up for it.She has nice soft peices like \\"Can't F**K With Queen Bee\\" and \\"Heavanly Father\\", but can also bust down some dance jams like \\"Jump Off\\" and \\"Magic Stick\\" while also bogging down with good old fashion RAP rap such as \\"Thug Love\\" and \\"Bee Hive\\".

The liner notes indicate the album version of \\"Magic Stick\\" contains samples and elements of a song called \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" performed by B.B. King. Anyway, the only other song on here worth anybody's time is that \\"The Jump Off\\" (featuring Mr. Cheeks). And even that track has gone out of style pretty fast.

But with this album she let me down in a major way!! While some of the songs are entertaining and others are even Lil Kim caliber, as a whole this album was a sad attempt at trying to be Queen Bee.

Anyways, this new album La Bella Mafia is back to the original days of her first album, HardCore, and will please many old fans.

There is also no latch to keep the lid on so that larger, softer toys, like the Whoozit, will simply pop the lid off.

Unfortunately, the quality goes down from there.This book is just incredibly naive about product development in the technology industry. Suggesting that the primary mantra of technologists is, \\"If we build it, they will come,\\" the author (a self-proclaimed change expert) uses a mixture of 20/20 hindsight and shifting definitions to explain why a variety of stupid ideas (Webvan, satellite phones) failed. As to the success stories--like flat-panel TVs--people buy them because they're \\"cool.\\" Thanks for the insight, Pip.I read this right after finishing \\"The Long Tail\\"; a book that I expected to be a stretched-out version of a magazine article, that was surprisingly interesting and full of reasearch-driven insights.

Pip Coburn's method is entirely different. The use of history and common sense as a method of understanding not only gee whiz engineering elements of technology but also the actual user experience and the social aspects that drive demand sounds simple but is actually quite rigorous.

The singing seems well-done though several of the main singers seem to sing in a style more appropriate for a later musical period with relatively pronounced vibrato. The real problem for me is Gluck's music. It is intended to be simple and unadorned as indeed the case. I find little merit or interest init. What is worse is that the stage action is very stylized and static. During an aria, it is possible that the singer will remain almost expressionless and perhaps raise his/her hand in two or three stages from waist to shoulder level. A background of stationary figues on the stage may remain almost unmoving for long periods. My wife calls this human hieroglyphics and she, justly, refuses to watch it even though the singing is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yee Gads What Is This?","review":"Okay, I'll admit to the fact that this period of music is not of great interest to me. But, I decided to get it a chance. While beautifully sung and played, this is the most boring thing I have ever seen in my life. For over 2 hours the principle singers moved in slow motion most of the time with the arms and hands in statuesque like positions -- it literally put me to sleep!

My other two favorites are \\"The Glitch\\" and \\"The Camp.\\" Both will rock even the most jaded viewers. \\"The Glitch\\" in particular raises some interesting moral questions about what it means to be human, and humane.Overall, like most Outer Limits collections, this is entertainment aimed at the viewer's intellect, unlike most TV entertainment.

In a way it is a little unusual (at least it seemed that way to me) in that the first half of the book appeared to be written for 8 to 11 year-olds whereas the second half of the book, as the boy Dobry grows older and wishes to be a sculptor, seems to be written for an older child.

I wore them daily in an office environment only. Most shoes I use for work last usually 2+ years and I replace them due to the soles becoming worn or losing shine, etc. Within a month of wearing these, the very fake leather began peeling off of the toe. I should have known buying a non leather upper shoe would cause wear faster, but for the light duty I put them through, this was absurd. The elastic on either sides of the tongue began unraveling within a week after that. Within 2 months, the sole had completely separated from the rest of the shoe starting from the front and going back about 3 inches.

I heard it on the radio one day, and was compelled to listen more and more just to hear that song.

I don't care for We Do What We Can, and No One Said It Would Be Easy because they get boring and are too slow. The rest bounce along.

Others with that distinction include Carole King's TAPESTRY,Mariah Carey's 1990 self-titled album,Whitney Houston's 1985 self-titled album and Alanis Morrissette's JAGGED LITTLE PILL. I think this album won a Grammy for 1994 Album of the Year. All the other aforementioned albums won Grammys also. Hits include LEAVING LAS VEGAS,STRONG ENOUGH,CAN'T CRY ANYMORE and the biggest,ALL I WANNA DO. Joanne Farrell covered that song in dance club form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just listen to the radio","review":"I never buy an album on the basis of one song. When I hear two I like, however, I consider it. I ended up with this album because I liked 'Leaving Las Vegas', and especially 'All I Wanna Do'. To my dismay, I found these two to be the only good songs on the album. The rest was either boring background music or just plain irritating. My interest in Sheryl Crow's music ended after listening to this album. On the basis of only two songs, I can't reccomend the album to anyone, but maybe the 'All I Wanna Do' single would be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"some of the best songs released under her name","review":"Once upon a time, there was an actual Tuesday Night Music Club.

There are only 2 songs that may be a little bit o.k. and they are \\"Can't Cry Anymore\\", and \\"We Do What We Can\\". I just feel that this was a pop album all the way even though it has a rock edge don't be decieved.

This is a really uplifting album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A woman who can rock","review":"This very impressive debut from Sheryl Crow is a greatly used c.d. in my very big collection. All the songs on this album are great> I do think \\"Strong Enough\\" is the best of the bunch. Here she shows great emotion and courage in her ability to perform.There are only a handful of women in rock, and Sheryl is a very welcome addition in my opinion. She has a very unique sound and voice, and she is an amazing performer live. Her songs don't all sound the same, she branches out into different types of music -- jazz, blues, country.While \\"All I wanna do\\" is the commericial hit of this album, I don't think it's the best. \\"Strong Enough\\" and \\"leaving las Vegas\\" are far superior lyrically and emotion. \\"ALL i wanna do\\" is just a fun song, and sends an interesting message that life shouldn't be taken too seriously.If you are into women rockers, you should appreciate Sheryl Crow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"Sheryl Crow is the best kind of musician. Not only does she sing well, but she also plays guitar and piano, and co-wrote every song on this album. A lot of so-called rock and pop stars could learn a lot from her. Anyhow, this is a terrific debut album. Maybe not quite as polished as her later stuff but that's ok. It is still worthy of 5 stars. The booklet includes all lyrics, a few photos and liner notes written by Sheryl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crow's Debut","review":"Tuesday Night Music Club is a solid debut effort by Sheryl Crow. Ms. Crow's greatest asset is her strong and expressive voice. She uses it to effectively convey the emotions from her songs. Her songwriting is solid, but sometimes she goes a bit over the top in trying to be deep or relevant. The album opens up with a bluesy \\"Run Baby Run\\" and then moves into the best song on the album \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\". The song has a chunky beat and the first person lyrics give the song a real personal sense. \\"Strong Enough\\" is another great song with Ms. Crow laying down a challenge to a man. \\"Can't Cry Anymore\\" has a good riff and \\"The Na-Na Song\\" is done in a Dylanesque style. \\"All I Wanna Do\\" was the song that made her a star. It has an instantly recognizable guitar riff and a day in the life lyrics that you can't get out of your head. The song went on to win the 1994 Grammy for Record of the Year and established the former Michael Jackson backup singer as a force on the music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It","review":"I remember this cd from many years back and with this new purchase I remember how much I like the entire group of songs. This was an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl's debut","review":"Sheryl Crow debuted with TUESDAY NIGHT MUSIC CLUB way back in '93 and no one took notice. It was only when the hit \\"all I wanna do\\" exploded a year later, that people started paying attention to Sheryl Crow. TUESDAY NIGHT MUSIC CLUB is an easy going rock album with country under tones. This is a great piece of rock music. Sheryl's lyrics are clever and she sings with slick but honest voice. Each song tells a story but it's not country. They're hooks and melodies to keep you interested. I was surprised at how Sheryl sings with ease. It's as if the songs come naturally to her and she's just sitting, playing her guitar. Songs like \\"strong enough\\", \\"no one said it would be easy\\", and \\"I shall believe\\" offer up some raw emotion. This is one of Sheryl's best albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gene Was Special","review":"He healed me twice. Both were nothing short of miraculous. Angels worked through him no doubt.

The Imation media is also easily recognized by my DVD players (Panasonic A120, Pioneer DV-353, and Apex 1100W).(But note, if you pay more than three and change for these disks, then you're paying too much.

That's how I felt after reading this book. Who is the book written for? If you are an academic, there is too little empirical data. If you are a destination marketing professsional, there is hardly anything you can gain from reading this book. If you are a student, its too shallow. Nearly all chapters start out with a definition of branding by some marketing authority. Very repetitive. Philip Kotler's contribution on chapter 5 is OK, but outdated. Not one of his best. Better to get a book about branding. Chapter 5 does provide some value, as does the case study on Western Australia Chapter 12. Hence the two stars.

Joe Travers plumbed the depths of the UMRK vaults for live recordings of the Petit Wazoo 10-piece band from '72. Somehow, FZ mixed and approved. Doesn't much matter how it happened, this is some beautiful music that definitely deserved to be published.Father Oblivion is not the piece from Apostrophe. It's actually a chunk of what would later become Gregary Peccary (the part where he's inventing his trend). Much of the rest is unique, semi-improvisational performances. It's all instrumentals. FZ's solos are wonderful. The band is tighter than a drum.Drummers be advised, there is an absolutely beautiful solo by Jim Gordon.

Como siempre le acompaña una magnifica banda y los arreglos son insuperables. Una joya y un descubrimiento para aquellos que piensen en un Zappa discursivo y mordiente.

To many others it will prove a challenging book to read. At times it is confusing and even the best reader's can only hope to drag themselves along the ragged plotline without any notes. Tieing in to the movie is not right - only about three pages of the book are even slightly similar to the movie. I was also disgusted to find that less than a half of the book was devoted to what I feel was the battle of Stalingrad, while the rest petered into the rather mundane account of the battle on the steppe both before and after the fact. I would only recommend this book to the worst of my enemies hoping that the drool from their bored eyeballs will damage the book and force them to pay for damages.

It focus's on main Russian, Italian, and German Genearls along with some Sergeants, Lieutenants, ect. It begins with the Russian retreat past Stalingrad to the Germans entering the town under fierce resistance. The Russians, with luck and good planning from Stalin and the high ranks, gradually begin to force the Germans back and begin to surround the Germans. Hitler won't pull back,and soon the Germans are surrounded. In no time, the German fighters (Italians, Germans, Hungarians), are caught and put in prison camps. This is an interesting part of the book. The Italians start to eat dead people. Overall the book was okay but i wouldnt buy it. You might read it twice. But save your money for something else.

That is, the author -thank God - is not interest in proving any historical theory or promoting an ideological agenda. He just was the reader to feel and vividly imaging the pandemonium that more than a million persons live in the battle of Stalingrad. This is done not just by means a perfect description of the tactical decision taken by the field commanders and headquarters of both armies, but also by using hundred of first hand accounts of the combatants, with an acute description of their fears, wounds, hate and delusions. No page in this book will left you unshaken.

However I'm a bit disappointed - the miltichannel version only reads 5.0 not 5.1 and the rear channels (ambient - mostly) are not that different from the stereo version, which plays surround because of othe difereence signal.if they wanted an 'accurate' multichannel version they should have stuck with a 3 channel one ,as it was recorded. The docmentary was interesting but because of the sound (5.0) it only rates 4 stars.Edd. iegolden@shaw.ca"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Intro to Jazz","review":"This album was recommended to me to satisfy my interest in Jazz. It certainly did that. I'm more into Rock than anything, but the music on this CD simply grabbed me and sucked me in. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing jazz album, an amazing man...","review":"This is one of the most influencial jazz albums ever, plain and simple. Brilliant songwriting, and technique. Though Most of the jazz I listen to is guitar oriented, this album truly caught my ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"The single greatest jazz album ever produced.","review":"This album will make you fall in love with Miles. His sublime solos, his mellow tone, and his creativity all contribute to the greatness of the album; not to mention Coltrane, Adderly, Chambers, Evans, et al. This is the only Miles album you need to have a collection. It's pure magic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This *is* jazz.","review":"This is CD I use to introduce friends to jazz -- and as such makes a great \\"ambassador\\" album. The superlatives are wholly justified: this is a frighteningly wonderful recording.Just after the bass/piano intro of So What, Philly Joe hits a spray of the cymbals -- this single moment is ecstasy enough. And the album has just begun."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best jazz cd out there!","review":"If you like jazz than you have to have the mother of all jazz cds, kind of blue by Miles Davis. This cd has some of his best stuff ever. Like his world famous track So What. Again, I really recomend this great cd to all of you jazz fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"So what is simply great with the melody and rhythm.","review":"I love the simple melody and the way Miles wrote the song.

I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT MORE SUPERIOR PACKAGING NEEDED TO BE THERE? IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO WHAT SOME REVIEWERS HAVE SAID. UNFORTUNATELY(AND MOST FORTUNATELY)* THERE IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER STUDIO OUTTAKES OF THE TRACKS, AS NEARLY ALL THE TRACKS WERE 'FIRST TAKES'WHICH MAKES THE FALSE STARTS AND OTHER SURVIVING SNIPPETS INTERESTING TO PONDER UPON. HARKING BACK TO *\\"THE MOST FORTUNATELY\\" STATEMENT FROM ABOVE, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE SPONTANEITY AND GREATNESS OF IT RESULTED IN THE LACK OF OTHER ALTERNATE TAKES WHICH IN THIS CASE WAS TRULY A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE... BUT WHICH WILL ALWAYS MAKE US BEG FOR MORE... IT IS TRULY HISTORIC AND PHENOMENAL THAT THE ALBUM WAS MADE WITH THE COLLECTIVE BRILLIANCE WITHOUT THE THOUGHT OF TRYING TO COGITATE OVER SPONTANEOUS CREATION AND CREATE MORE OUTTAKES!... KIND OF BLUE WILL LIVE ON AS LONG AS THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THIS EARTH... KAISER."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I not getting?","review":"I picked this up to try and expand my horizons in music and honestly this leaves me cold. The recording quality is stellar, the playing is great, yet the recordings themselves meander around with no direction... for 10 minutes, and then they end. I discern no cohesive melodies. I like jazz, or at least I thought I did, but aren't songs, even jazz songs, supposed to have some sort of patterns? I chalk the universal praise of this cd to mass hysteria and being too afraid to stand up and say, \\"You know what? This is boring.\\" There seems like there should be dialogue going on, because this seems like background music from a movie. If you're trying to round out a collection, this could pass, but if this is your first taste of jazz head straight for the desert."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is the best","review":"How can I only give this album 5 stars? Its worth 10 stars! I'm a High School Trumpeter and really dig Miles, this has been my favorite album since I was 4 or 5, I still listen to it almost daily. I can play Miles's solos on my horn, almost idenical. This album was made in heaven, and I'm sure god gave it thumbs up. Go out there and buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate jazz cd","review":"This is one of those rare cds which you can listen to over and over, and continue to love. If you're new to jazz, or uncertain where to begin with Miles Davis, this is the cd to start with. The instrumental tracks all flow, and share a mellow, soothing quality. While the songs are not simple, the melodies and countermelodies never overwhelm into some kind of baroque or cacophonous jazz exercise. Coltrane's saxophone is lovely, providing a stunning complement to the sheer genius of Davis' trumpet and composition.Whether listening to this cd to spend time listening to it, or whether playing it for ambient background music, this cd does not fail to please. \\"Kind of Blue\\" is classy and timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made of the same stuff as Beethoven symphonies","review":"This Miles Davis release was a defining moment in the history of 20th century American music. Pure in motivation, design, and execution, it is as close to perfection as artistic endeavors could ever hope to be. This CD joins the select works of Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington as the musical ideal often imitated but seldom equaled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyclic","review":"I know nothing at all about jazz, modal or otherwise, but somebody recommended this to me and I like it a lot. It's a bit like Philip Glass, or environmental ambient music, in that it's a series of cyclic rhythms overlaid with soloing from various trumpets and saxophones. The music shifts slowly over the course of the album, and although there are six different pieces they are essentially one long whole. It's very, very minimalist, and although the sleeve says that it was recorded in 1959 it's completely timeless. Best of all, you can play it over and over again - the mixture of simplicity and complexity remains fascinating, and it's not so much a complete whole as a tiny snapshot of an potentially-infinite, continually-generated performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Spare","review":"If you have never understood what Miles Davis was about, this album will explain it easily. Miles believed in the KISS rule. Keep It Simple Stupid! While many artists were trying to squeeze a million notes into a measure, Miles was trying to invest in his music more FEELING. For all its lack of up-tempos and drum fills, it still manages to come off as spontaneous AND cohesive. The sound of this recording is phenomenal. It was just a fluke that I bought it, but, Wow- what luck! You will wear this CD out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"(...) this is a album that truly belongs in any decent CD collection. I usually don't buy CDs claiming to be \\"remastered,\\" but in this case, it was well worth it--the sound is big, rich, on-key...just spectacular. Silly as it sounds, I could not imagine not having this album in my life and there are (...) few CDs I would say that about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed of the K2 format","review":"The CD has the sound that you used to hear on cassettes, this kind of shhshhshh.

This is one of the most influential record of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laid-back bliss!","review":"Absolutely perfect if you want something mellow and indescribably pretty.

But how many time can you repackage this \\"album\\" and resell it? I guess the answer is self evident. I think it's sad that this continues to happen and no one is held responsible for taking advantage of the music buyer. This is just getting stupid - people are being ripped off in my opinion.

I truly enjoy this album, and would highly recomment it to anyone with a love, or an inkling to love jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"A classic, and my favorite Miles album. If you are just getting into jazz this is a good album to start with. Although jazz can be hard for some people to wrap their minds around, this is a very listener-friendly album, while at the same time showcasing enough innovation to impress the most learned musicians...it is a very 'chill' album that is great for driving as well as relaxing around the house...or relaxing period...great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make a jazz noise here...","review":"I was really hung over one morning @ a friends house when I was in college and she put on what she called \\"hangover\\" music. \\"So What\\" faded into existence and the pounding in my head didn't feel so bad @ that moment. Sitting on a couch wrapped in a blanket hiding from sunlight and hearing those intro piano chords seemed almost magical. Coming from someone like myself who has always been in the rock camp this was the first jazz record I spent any real time with. To say this CD is a bomb and a half is an understatement. It introduced me into a whole New World of musicians and a language I never heard much of before. I mean it's a best selling CD 40 years later. The music on it has some endearing quality? Something about it sucks you in to its mellow world. This CD is just a brief look at Miles Davis the musician, songwriter and bandleader and only scratches the surface of this man's incredible talent. A must have for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"redefinition of jazz by the master","review":"By listening to the new Davis' album, my love for pure jazz was truly reconfirmed. What a great performance by the duke of jazz. Truly this is one of the best jazz albums I have ever bought.

Of all Jazz records I have listened to, I can honestly say it just doesn't get any better than this.

So this is supposed to be THE Miles classic, THE jazz bible for the masses, THE miles album of all time. I doubt it,mass popularity means very little. Competent,yes, but not the most creative Miles album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Blue","review":"Miles Davis' Kind Of Blue is a landmark album, introducing a style known as cool jazz. It is easy to see where the name comes from as the songs have an icy air of coolness to them. \\"So What\\" is an utter masterpiece and contains the amazing dual sax work of two legends in their own right, John Coltrane & Cannonball Adderly. As good as those two gentlemen are, it is Mr. Davis' album and he is in clear command on that track and on \\"Freddy The Freeloader\\" he has a laid back, yet forceful sound that shows why he is a true genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent. Buy this album","review":"I hear this album almost every day and I never get tired of it. I listen to it when I'm in the computer, working, web-surfing, whatever. This is one of those masterpieces that will be around for ever, no matter if the album is now more than 40 years old. Even in the year 2050 or 2500, this album will still be heard by many people around the world. Also if you are a newcomer to the music of Miles Davis, I think this is a good album to start with. I have showed Kind Of Blue to some friends who know nothing about Jazz or Miles Davis and they really liked it.BUY THIS ALBUM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for audiophiles","review":"If you are particular about what emanates from your speakers, don't bother. The standard re-mastered CD is as good and the original LP is markedly superior when played on a decent turntable with a better than average cartridge.Either this particular effort was poorly engineered or too much upfront quality was sacrificed to appease the gods of multi channel whiz bangs. The high end is over driven, the upper mid-range is muddy, and compared to the presence of the original LP, it sounds as if it were recorded in a cave. Al in all, a very poor example of super audio technology.Tone deaf"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ABSOLUTE NO BRAINER!","review":"If you enjoy music, and you have a pulse, then you should go out and buy this famous album right now. It is without a doubt one of the greatest achievements in music history. You don't even have to be a jazz fan to appreciate this amazing work of art. It is my favorite album of all-time! I have it on CD and vinyl and enjoy listening to both. This is the album that really made Miles a star and it's easy to see why. Coltrane, Cannonball, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, Wynton Kelly, and Jimmy Cobb along with Miles make up arguably the greatest line-up in Jazz history. Every second of this beautiful (and that's an understatement!) album is excellent and a pure joy. I can honestly say that I have listened to it more than any other record/CD and never tire of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"can you live without this?","review":"i hear that there are people who live without this album. i don't know how they do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of Heaven","review":"A (now) good friend of mine gave me this CD with only these words: \\"Listen. You will understand.\\" All the reviews we could write cannot even begin to tell the truth of this recording, so I will not try. You must listen to understand. When you do, you will know why all good jazz collections start with Kind of Blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"both discs from LP- done poorly","review":"Fairly poor vinyl transfer. The turntable/cartridge was not properly set up and you can hear lots of anomalies. There are several other versions of this that are much better. You won't get the mono verion but, for me, it was so distracting that I got rid of the CD since I wouldn't listen to it. The music is still classic but the rating of 2 stars reflects the quality of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Blue\\" LP is scratched & scuffed when you open the box","review":"Like other reviewers, I'm not focusing here on the music or the sound quality. I'm just adding my warning to the others. (I should have listened to them, but I thought \\"mine will be different.\\" Ha!)So putting aside the music and the sound quality, DO buy this set if you don't mind purchasing brand-new LPs and CDs that are pre-scratched and pre-scuffed for you. DON'T buy this if you expect new merchandise to be, well, new."},{"rating":"2","title":"I promised him I'd change his life","review":"I promised the man I sent this to as a gift that I would change his life. He kind of laughed it off because \\"...I don't know if Amazon has anything that can change my life.\\"I asked him to listen to track three, at night, with a glass of really good wine (An Argentine Malbec)- and drift.He did. Life is changed.Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a CD to Vinyl transfer","review":"After eagerly unwrapping this release I was thoroughly underwhelmed when I threw it on the turntable. Bill Evans' piano sounded slightly muffled while Chamber's bass boomed and resonated with little definition. When Coltrane's tenor came in on 'So What' it totally obscured and overpowered the rhythm section. What gives?Upon further research, it appears many people believe this to be a homespun 'remaster' of an existing CD release which was then transferred to vinyl and I have to agree. Since the recording is now in the public domain, this is entirely plausible (and also explains the absence of the original cover art). I've been unable to track down any info about \\"Jazz Wax Records\\", which should probably tell you something.While not unlistenable, I can only see buying this record as a curiosity. If you are looking to experience something close to the original record, this release will leave you disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that will open new doors","review":"The word \\"jazz\\" reminds many people of either a) elevator music or b) a series of fast, furious, unmelodic and forgettable solos. Well, this album shatters those perceptions. I can sing the majority of solos on this album from memory -- a testament to their melodic beauty and construction. (And to think most of the tracks were first takes!) Even more important, this music reaches into your soul. You can feel the emotion of each soloist running through your body, especially that of Miles: brooding, slightly melancholy, yet never compromising its beauty.But alas, music was never meant to be described in words. Do yourself a favour and get this record ASAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless treasure","review":"This always hits the lists of the best Jazz LP's of all time and that is no surprise...This latest re-issue of the classic has barely audible tape hiss at the beginning; however, the timeless beauty of this record more than makes up for it. A must for your collection of vinyl if you were not fortunate enough to get an earlier re-issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and Pretentious","review":"Ok, sports fans! After hearing so many glowing reviews of this album and hearing it referred to as possibly the greatest jazz album ever made, I felt compelled to write this. It was about 20 years ago that I first heard this album, and found it to be boring. Everything is about the same tempo. I found Mr. Davis' playing to be laughable at best. Finally, it's irritating; and confusing that so many people laud it. DO NOT buy this album as a primer for jazz. It is very misleading to hail this as the ultimate representation of an art form that has had far superior accounts of itself. If any musician showed up on a gig sounding the way Davis did on this album, they would be fired in a heartbeat! If you want to learn jazz, start with Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Duke Ellington. I give \\"Kind of Blue\\" one star for Cannonball Adderly's and Bill Evans' efforts. Otherwise, it is feces hailed as something good-and it is with great effort that I've edited myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon doesn't tell me what songs are on the album.

It's so perfect, so intimate, so full of spirit... and there are two qualities to it that make it even more impressing:-First, the musical framework to it was conceived by Davis (as explained by pianist Bill Evans in the inner-sleeve) barely hours before the recording took place. Based off this framework, the band that accompanied him played all except one of the five pieces in one 'take.'-Second, this album was recorded in 1959, and it still sounds as fresh and penetrating today as it did back then. This is a quality that only true masterpieces can achieve: stand the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but......","review":"Miles Davis' Kind of Blue is definatly a record that pioneered cool jazz. But, after listening to it many times over and over again, I didn't feel \\"enlightened\\" like everyone else does. Miles put many interesting things into that album, but it carried NO EMOTION!! I think that albums like Sketches of Spain and Relaxin' deserve the 5 Star ratings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Jazz album ever!!!!","review":"I have since bought other jazz cd's but this one is easily the greatest of all. It is in a class by itself. \\"Cannonball\\" and Coltrane are phenominal on this cd. The whole cd burns from the very opening notes of So What until the last track Flamenco Sketches. A must have for any jazz enthusiast or someone wanting to get into jazz and not sure where to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words simply can't do it justice...","review":"This is, quite simply, the best jazz album ever made. Bill Evans sets the mood with those first few famous notes, and the rest is history. The line-up of musicians is incomperable, both in terms of talent and empathy.

I don't know what kind of c**p you watch on MTV but let me tell you that you don't know the TRUE meaning of music. Miles Davis is one of the best jazzers out there and that's because he puts a lot of time and effort on his music. YES, HIS RECORDS SHOULD GO PLATNUM!!! But all the platnum goes to POSER POPSTERS like 50 Cent and Avril Lavigne which I believe they don't deserve it at all because they have the LEAST taste in music. They suck!

Having worn out two vinyl LPs, I now own two re-mastered versions (CBS & Sony)of the CD. Sony's SBM (Super-Bit Mapping, whatever that may be) version takes the cake and I think it should go directly to Audiophile Jazz.

The music is utterly sublime and the album historical with performances by Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley, Jimmy Cobb, John Coltrane, Paul Chambers, Wynton Kelly and, of course, Miles Davis. These names resonate with jazz aficionados, which along with its accessibility, is precisely the reason why this album is a perfect introduction to anyone interested in jazz and essential to one's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the SACD version!","review":"This is, of course, a classic recording. But if you REALLY want to hear this music at its best, you should definitely consider getting the SACD version (also available from amazon.com).

Of course, you'll need to get an SACD-compatible player, but there's currently no better way to enjoy this wonderful recording!And if you don't believe it, you probably haven't heard it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Century","review":"Those who scan through the 2oth Century for moments of supreme musical brilliance need look no further than this album. Guided by a man who defied musical convention for over four decades yet still found tremendous public acclaim, this is Miles Davis' finest hour. Ably supported by luminaries such as John Coltrane and Bill Evans, amongst others, \\"Kind Of Blue\\" sounds effortless yet complex, ever fresh yet firmly rooted in history and quintessentially jazz even though it has served as inspiration for musicians in all walks of life.

Picture a warm, rainy day where all you want to do is relax, think or indulge your introspective mood...this would be just the thing to listen to.\\"Kind of Blue\\" is complete in itself and needs no additions or explanations. It is spare, unembellished, having no need for gimick or pretension. It is beautiful in it's simplicity, and from start to finish it will astound you with it's artistic grace. When talent is coupled with skill and then fueled by expression, true art appears. Like a great painting, \\"Kind of Blue\\" will remain timeless.Also try out: Sarah Vaughan, Diane Krall, John Coltrane."},{"rating":"2","title":"still finding spaces after all these years","review":"over the years whether vinyl,tape,cd it has always been with me played it in different countries, times, and spaces; still has magic probably always will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad packaging.","review":"Had to return my box set cause three discs are in the same manner slipped half way into cardboard that leaves a scratch across which makes it impossible to play.

The performance is legendary and does not need further comment from me.I will address the sound quality. In a word - the BEST! As of 2010 at least, I don't know of a better digital transfer.I will leave vinyl evaluations elsewhere.If you have s stereo system that takes advantage of SACD sound quality, you will not be disappointed.This is a desert island recording that now has desert island digital sound.Enough said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Armand F. Baker","review":"I used to have this recording on a vinyl record and enjoyed it very much, but I hadn't heard it since that record got scratchy and was discarded many years ago. The stereo sound on this CD is excellent, and it includes a second version of Flamenco Sketches which was not on the record. I think these selections are some of the best Miles Davis had ever recorded. I enjoyed both Bill Evan's liner notes and his delicate touch on the piano. Cannonball Adderly is amazing, and Miles Davis playing is thoughtful and creative as usual. If you appreciate good jazz, you will love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it- sit back and relax!","review":"A blues fan, but haven't specifically listened to an entire miles davis album. After listening to this fantastic CD - a new fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Along with STEAMIN' and 'ROUND ABOUT MIDNIGHT, KIND OF BLUE, makes the argument that Miles Davis was the most influential Jazz men of the 20th century.KIND OF BLUE is the best of the three and, to my ears, one of the 2 or 3 best Jazz albums ever recorded. \\"So What\\" is perfection, slipping and sliding through subtle changes and flashing a band like nobody has ever heard before or since.A truly amazing record. Absolutely classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS Dual DIsc sucks","review":"This is a dual disc with a nearly standard resolution mix (16bit@48KHz) deliberately published by Sony (the creator with Philips of the SACD!) to infringe the Dual Disc reputation. Dual Disc itself is not good or bad: can have up to 24bit@192KHz in stereo mode and 24bit@96KHz in multichannel mode. The system is garbage in-garbage out: if you put garbage *in* (16 bit resolution) you get garbage *out* (16 bit resolution).If you wish to enjoy Dual Disc / DVD-A go elsewhere: PCM is superior to DSD (but you'll hardly listen the difference if the recording is well done, though).Miles Davis music is outstanding, of course - this is out of question!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue-tiful","review":"This is guaranteed to be one of the top sellers over the '08 holiday season, as all music lovers will appreciate the quality and content of this package. The book is gorgeous, and includes the original contact sheets from the recording sessions with Coltrane, Davis, and other players. Let's not forget the blue vinyl!

Hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musically paradigm-shattering","review":"What can be said that has not already been said? Kind of Blue was, for the most part, my first true adventure into good jazz, a sad choice, I might add, because nothing else since has lived up to its genius.

I'm sure that there has got to be lots of music lovers like me who just dont see the attraction here. I tried three times to get with this disc, but all it does is make my eyelids heavy. Not terrible music, but nothing to rave about either - simply this music is lullabye stuff that conjures up a serenity which is great for unwinding, but not so great if your impulse is to stay awake. Sorry if I offend, but this is my honest opinion of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rampant laundry of prune-like viritiousity","review":"After a smacking allocation of misty hornious spooky teeth like accords, the whole projects collapses in a devasted submarinistic garden of hollow and narrow blow outs. Instead of mystifiing and collapse oriented draw back it enters into the realism of a blossoming prune orchard. That the orchestra manages this garden promenade is more due to their rampant cleansing of this musically main laundry of the decade, than to Mr. Chief Prune of the century."},{"rating":"1","title":"School assignment","review":"I bought this CD for an assignment for a Music Appreciation class. And that tells you what I know about the elements of music that make it good (or bad).My biggest gripe is that I can hear hiss and other noises that could/should have been removed when this was remastered.As for the music itelself, this is what I think of when I hear people talk about Jazz. But it sounds like every small Jazz band I hear at formal events. maybe they're all coppying this? But it is pleasant to listen to.Now how do I expand that into 3+ typed pages?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Un clásico","review":"Una de las grabaciones más importantes del jazz.

You have Miles Davis at the height of cool, all-star musicians sitting in, great sound, great songs, and bonus material if you're interested.

Back to the SACD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you get it?","review":"If the fact that you are looking at this page means you do not yet own this recording, then do yourself a favor and get it, whoever you are. If you are a jazz fan and you somehow do not yet own Kind of Blue, get it. If you are not a jazz fan but are curious about the genre, get it. And even if you have never been interested in jazz, get it.This may not be the best jazz album ever, but it is easily the most accessible of any that can lay claim to that honor. I don't know anyone who knows Kind of Blue and doesn't like it.The album is the jazz equivalent of St. Pepper's or Beethoven's Fifth -- a recording that those who aren't enamored with the type of music appreciate and that true students of the genre admire. But don't take my word for it: look at Miles Davis' all-star cast that includes Bill Evans and John Coltrane, look at all the glowing reviews below from other Amazon users ... and get the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Miles -- Classic Jazz -- A MUST OWN!","review":"This was my very first jazz album, and it is still my favorite. After listening to many other recordings by many other artists (including a small amount of today's \\"smooth\\" jazz, which is really elevator music with another name), I still come back to Kind of Blue. This work, like all truly magnificent works in every genre of art, works on many levels. It is wonderful background music, and it is infinitely more amazing when one truly LISTENS to what the musicians are doing on the tracks.If you love jazz but for whatever reason have missed this album, BUY IT - you will not be disappointed. If you have never listened to jazz before (smooth jazz doesn't count), this cd is a perfect entry into the realm of jazz. Its recording artists all became famous on their own afterwards, and in Kind of Blue, the mastery of each is obvious. Its music achieves perfection and timelessness, and is a monument of jazz - a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miles Davis-Kind of Blue-50th Anniversary Edition","review":"Everyone who loves good jazz or music in general will know this album,so just a quick note on the quality of the discs. Perhaps I was lucky but my three discs were all right. The DVD had a slight mark in one spot,however it too was ok. The audio discs were fine. However I can't believe that the brains at Sony couldn't find a better way to package the three discs,instead of slipping them bare into a half cardboard sleeve. My 180 gram vinyl record was also in good shape. I have transferred the three discs into traditional plastic cases for protection. The book is very handsome and is well done. The poster is ok-nothing to get excited over. The photo reprints are nice as is the copy of the hand written album notes by Bill Evans. I still think this set is a bit on the expensive side,considering that this album has reaped a ton of profit. For Davis and jazz collectors it will be a \\"must buy\\".

After hearing so many glowing reviews of this album and hearing it referred to as possibly the greatest jazz album ever made, I felt compelled to write this. It was about 20 years ago that I first heard this album, and found it to be boring. Everything is about the same tempo. I found Mr. Davis' playing to be laughable at best. Finally, it's irritating; and confusing that so many people laud it. DO NOT buy this album as aprimer for jazz. It is very misleading to hail this as the ultimate representation of an art form that has had far superior accounts of itself. If any musician showed up on a gig sounding the way Davis did on this album, they would be fired in a heartbeat! If you want to learn jazz, start with Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, and Duke Ellington. I give \\"Kind of Blue\\" one star for Cannonball Adderly's and Bill Evans' efforts. Otherwise, it is [bad work] hailed as something good-and it is with great effort that I've edited myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miles Davis-KIND OF BLUE","review":"The reason for this album's eternal appeal lies in its emotional tone.Once its quietism was the perfect reflection of the spiritual Emptiness of the Eisenhower era.Now its boredom,nostalgia and scarcely concealed contempt make it the perfect background music for this narcissistic age of ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This Cd isn't as good as everyones says it is, the solo's are clear and easy to hear but the group never really play together, it's no better than 'Milestones and definately less good than 'Miles Smiles'."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless meandering","review":"This is what happens when you have complete control of your music making but don't actually have any musical ideas. Davis was the epitome of self absorbtion and should be most famous for his opinion that \\"white players can't play on the beat, they're always behind it.\\" And while apologists like Herbie Hancock might claim Davis didn't turn his back on the audience, \\"he was conducting the band.\\" It's kind of hard to conduct when you're simultaneously playing your trumpet with your eyes closed.

When you listen to Blue in Green, you will cry because of how beautiful the song is. All Blues is a nice 3-4 piece with a good melody.

It is a motivating book, that will help you \\"show up\\" for prayer. Hybels cuts to the heart of some important issues that keep us from being consistant in this imperitive and lifegiving discipline. He also gives lots of practical ideas and examples, and in his usual fashion adds some humor to make it an easy book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will change your prayer life","review":"It is Hybells thesis that prayer is unnatural for man whose life has been shaped by the rules of self-reliance. Yet, despite this dependence on self, most people pray. Prayer, Hybells states, is the most intimate form of communication we have with God and is essential to receiving His prevailing power in our lives.I like that his book is biblically based. Hybells develops his arguments from the actual text of Scripture, stating that a prayer warrior is someone who is convinced that God is omnipotent and is able to intervene in the lives of his people. This book is far more pragmatic, than theological. Hybells gentle humor is a refreshing change and a wonderful tool to capture the readers attention.Like most of Hybells earlier books, it was predictable-every chapter follows the same format. One gets the impression we are reading a sermon series; but despite this one failing, it is one of the most practical book on how to develop one's prayer life I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Down and Experience God","review":"This book is short, simple and straight forward. Follow the advice and experience a profound shift in your relationship with God. If you follow these prayer strategies it can change your life. Dynamite comes in small packages. When you pray correctly and consistently you release the Power within. I'll share an experience after prayer, (day 10 of applying what I learnt in Hybels book) I felt light, almost floaty and my eyes (closed) were vibrating. I felt such a sense of peace. I thought, is this what it feels like to be in the presence of God? Is this the anointing of God? I am grateful to Hybels for sharing his wisdom and step-by-step strategy to pray to God. For the first time I feel power and purpose in prayer. In a sense I have always known this, but never really experienced it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Start for Beginners","review":"This book would be useful for someone who is starting a prayer group or for people who are new to (protestant) Christianity and (protestant) Christian prayer. The chapters are short and this is a quick read - good thing because people who are too busy to pray are probably too busy to read a lengthy book about prayer. Religious scholars will find this book too elementary. The language is largely simple, conversational, and accessible to a wide audience. They support their material with stories from their personal experience. It reads like a long sermon. While Hybels and Neff loosely support their material with biblical passages, they do not demonstrate how these ideas are linked to Christian tradition and liturgy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful practical treatment of prayer","review":"This is a refreshing an honest look at an important topic from a person of sound theology, personable style and some hard won experience. He does a beautiful job of painting a scriptural portrait of the heart of God and how prayer is the lifeline to experiencing his heart.He also does a nice job in exploring the necessary components for realizing the full potential of this powerful spiritual activity. In addition to this he wrestles with some of the toughest prayer challenges like: The hurt of unanswered prayer, Prayer busters and Hearing God's leading. I felt he treated these subjects relatively well considering the immense implications of each topic. The book also includes some great questions arranged by chapter, as a means to reflect upon the aspects of prayer in your life. I am finding these particularly useful in my journaling and prayer time as I work at developing this area of my walk. A very good book on prayer...I recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I had purchased two other prayer books: Lord, Teach Me To Pray by Kay Arthur and Releasing the Prayer Anointing by Larry Lea (both of which are excellent books), but neither was giving me what I needed.Besides knowing HOW to pray I had to WANT to pray. I just couldn't figure out why I never made time for prayer. This book has changed the way I look at prayer and how I approach prayer. I'm excited to pray instead of burdened by the thought of having to pray.The most profound idea that stands out to me in this book is the idea of reflecting upon your day. How can you grow/be delivered or even know what to pray for when you haven't taken the time to really assess where you are in your walk with God and where you want to go.If you just can't get into prayer, but you really really want to, this book it for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening book on prayer and spending time with God","review":"Bill Hybels takes a hard look at prayer in this book. He is straight forward about spending time with God. He stresses making a regular habit of prayer and \\"custom\\" designing a time with God that it just for you. This book opened my eyes to my own spiritual life and relationship with God. \\"It's amazing how many coincidences occur when we pray.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity Lessons: A 12 step Guide to Living Simple","review":"Great workbook and should be used with a group of people if possible.Makes you think about living more fully, enjoyably, and calmly in this hectic have to have everything world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"Voluntary simplicity has some features to it that would benefit most people in the United States, and that I am actively trying to incorporate into my own life. These include less consumerism/materialism, financial \\"modesty\\" (for lack of a better term), less cluttered living, etc. When we speak of the priorities, however, we must not forget the \\"voluntary\\" aspect.I can sum up my problem with this book with a single quote from page 170, \\"Simplicity is not about imposing beliefs on others or judging their actions... except, of course, by enacting and enforcing laws that mandate...\\" Throughout the book, every topic ends up with a discussion of how to tax, fine, or otherwise manipulate and coerce people into adopting the practices that the author believes would be best for them.This sanctimonious, condescending attitude was so offensive that I found it difficult to draw anything positive from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality","review":"This keyed entry doorknob comes with a lifetime mechanical warranty.

A.W. Pink presents a well thought-out and executed book. Pink references many great theologians of the past (i.e. John Calvin, Jonathan Edwards, Charles Spurgeon) and presents sufficient Scripture to back up his claims. This book is a great resource and is one I am sure I will revert back to in future.I recommend this book without hesitation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the Baker edition, not the Banner of Truth","review":"Apparantly the Banner of Truth edition destroyed Pink's arguments about God's Sovereignty in salvation by removing entire chapters (Reprobation), and entire paragraphs where Pink even hints that God's love is not equally and universally extended to the entire fallen humanity.Banner of Truth then had the nerve to justify this by saying that Pink's views changed later in life. Very deceitful on Banner of Truth's part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resolving the paradox","review":"Every Christian must read this to understand how the paradoxical topics of the sovereignty of God and the free will of man - and his responsibility - is to be understood in light of the Bible. Why, I would recommend this book to non-believers as well, so that they understand the Christian worldview. I have come across few other books that address this most difficult of subjects. Would that we have more clear and Biblical thinkers like Pink in the church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"The teaching in this book has been an inspiration to me.

After reading the instructions and online FAQ, to no avail, I quickly decided to return it and look for a better quality, (ie probably more expensive) unit.

Scooby doo and shaggy actually start becoming zombies with a horrible picture associated with it! We read to my son once and immediately returned it. He got another scooby doo to add to his collection. This book should have never been written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined a good thing.","review":"My 4-year old loves Scooby Doo.

They have no real music talent. You can't go through life as a singer just because you have a cute, pretty voice. You have to learn how to use it right. Does the word harmony ring a bell? Okay, Okay, they have some, but not enough, and not good ones. My school chorus has better ones than their's.

Now, I am not against the people that like this CD, but my opinian is that it is totally rude of people to say that B Wicthed are the G Rated version of the Spice Girls. The Spice Girls are much better than B Wicthed. I personally have the CD, not knowing it was this bad, but I think that only one of the songs were 'OK' -but still 'OK' isn't good enough. C'est La Vie was the ok one I was talking about. Others like Rollercoaster and stuff were to light to hear. Let me give you some advice.

All the songs sound the same, they are all too artificial, Keavy throws her voice too much and everything is just too poppy - there is no variety whatsoever.

Don't ask me why.To You I Belong: 4.5/5 Sweet, but doesn't have that final zest to it.Rollercoaster: 5/5 Reminds me of DisneyWorld but I really like it. Second place.We Four Girls: 3/5 Just doesn't work out.Castles In the Air: 5/5 Ties for first. This is my favorite though, it has the zest that To You I Belong doesn't have. The solo: So softly like a sigh Sea where the white horses ride It all seemed so real A feeling deep inside So our time will go onFreak Out: 3/5 Not that good.Like The Rose: 4.5/5 Kinda like To You I Belong, but good.Never Giving Up: 4/5 The better version of Rev It Up.Oh Mr. Postman: 5/5 Good finale.

Overall, the pinched lead vocals get really annoying after awhile. \\"C'est La Vie\\" is down right unlistenable after hearing it about 3 times. Even my friend, whom I bought it for, stopped listening to it admitting she's glad she got it for a gift rather than to have bought it. However, the CD isn't totally horrible. \\"Blame It on the Weahterman\\" is actually quite nice. That song, plus about 1 or 2 others is the only reason I give this CD any stars.

I'm a 17 yr/old male and I think that they sing well and they're clean. IMAGINGE THAT! A group that doesn't scream instead of sing, who have pep, and doesn't have lewd and offensive lyrics; that is why I like this group.

They blend the Irish music with catchy tunes that can be enjooyed by many. And to those who say that they are Spice Girl Wannabes--when was the last time you heard Keavy, Edele, Lindsay, and Sinead say \\"I really really really wanna zig-a-zig-ah?\\" I mean come on!

And as far as the I'll show u mine lyric, I think it refers back to the house with windows, as in people with glass houses shouldn't throw stones! As a writer, I cannot believe that so many people take a song so literally. God, loosen up, have fun! That is what music is about FUN!!! ANd that is what this album is. It's about having a good time. It's so sad that so many people in this world seem to forget how to have a good old fashioned good time. There is not always a secret dirty meaning in lyrics, and why people seem to think that more about women's groups than men's I'll never understand.

I just bought the \\"C'est la vie\\" single and even though it may be power pop to the tenth degree, it's still really catchy and easy to dance to. They kind of have a Spice Girls flavor, and the song is hummable in the car and everywhere else.

This is not the Shadow...","review":"This book does have a decent story, even if the execution was pretty bad, but this story should have been told using a different character, not the Shadow. The Shadow should never be modernized because he fits so perfectly in that distinct and specific 1930's to 1940's period. This is more like the Sam Raimi creation, Darkman. Modernizing the Shadow and his world doesn't make sense because if he was to exist in 1985 (when this story was published) then he would be a feeble, old man. You don't modernize the pulps. You may be able to do it with Doc Savage, via a time machine, but the Shadow is considered sacred ground and just shouldn't be touched. Howard Chaykin admits that he wasn't much of a Shadow fan or pulp reader. Apparently that is true!I recommend the Shadow Strikes, In the Coils of Leviathan, Hell's Heat Wave and the Denny O'neil/Mike Kaluta run.

The unforgetable characters, Jem and Scout Finch let readers experience the thrill of their heart racing adventures.Jem and Scout experience the hatred and cruelty that the African Americans went through in the south after their father, Atticus Finch, is asked to defend a black man in a serious black vs. white court case. The urge to reveal the small town mystery man makes this novel a laugh-out-loud comedy. After Jem and Scout's Aunt Alexandra comes to straighten out the Finch children, and turn them into a gentleman and a lady, rebellion becomes even more fun.Adventurous, intriguing, and breathtaking, To Kill A Mockingbird won the Pulitzer prize soon after its 1960 release, and was later transformed into an Academy award winning film.

Is to be different, to suffer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Novel","review":"This story elequently tells the story of the progression of the life of an initially eight year old child by the nickname of scout finch. This allows for the perspective of an innocent eye initially in the novel, though as time progresses and matters become more serious this outlook it easily taken aback because of the increasing maturity of the child. Harper Lee takes her time in getting to the story, though this sort of writing, which first builds a familiarity with the characters before setting the personalities they contain into conflict, allows for a more rich experience in the climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel about prejudice and racism. The story is about a girl named Scout and her family. Scout has a lot of normal and interesting experiences which are fun to read. The story was a smooth read. Later in the story Scout's father, who is a lawyer, is put in a position where he is to defend an innocent black man. The tension builds in the story as the town almost lynches the innocent man because of prejudice and racism. The story is interesting and inspiring.

It's full of rasism, and takes place a Long time ago in a small town in Alabama. I would recommend it to people who are addicted to drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book was to bland","review":"In my opinion, this book suffered from various major problems. First of all, the plot line was weak, The characters did nothing but wonder around the town tring to coax Boo Radly out of his house. Second of all, the characters interaction seemed forced, they behaived like they could not stand each other. The Third and final deterant is the ending, for almost 200+ pages(out of 281)the almost unbearable wondering ends with the description of a boring trial and an obscure presentation of the final climax and resolution. Half way through the book I was just wishing a bunch of mockingbirds would fly in and end everyones misery (mine included)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Dull","review":"Buy it to cure your insomnia as it will certainly put you to sleep.

One predictable as most young-adult books and more degrading than harlequin romances? Well, To Kill a Mockingbird is your book. In this novel, all Harper Lee gives as a theme is \\"life isn't fair.\\" I think most of us couold have figured that out without a book that should have started where the first \\"part\\" ended. Ms. Lee merely portrays a terrible, biased, southern society that seemingly places its main goal on ruining everyone elses life. Her female characters are flat, simple-minded women. Wether or not this is due to its setting is irrelevant. Lee places guilt on a group of people instead of individuals (the Ewells) as it should be. Thank God Ms. Lee only wrote this book; surely her next would degrade society even further. I'm sure it too would be deemed a classic as long as it dealt with politically correct subjects that are far too worn out to remain interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk! I hate this book!

I thought I agreed with it until I realized, I would not have appreciated or been as moved by this wonderful book when I was a young person. I am glad I waited to read this classic in middle age.

It shows so many good, strong life lessons in it.I didn't really not like any part of it! The only thing i didn't think was right was the ending. I didn't like how Tom Robinson dies. I know that is the reality from those days, but all he wanted was to be a free man. An inistent man! Over all i love this book, and couldn't see why anyone would not want to read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Eh?","review":"As a teenager, I have read many classics. 'To Kill A Mockingbird' has to be one of my favorites. This book has many twists, however I found a few parts to be quite boring. I went through some of the book being anxious for it to be over, watching page by page go by thinking 'When is this going to get interesting? When is this going to end?' but once I hit the last 4 chapters, they flew by. The surprise ending was amazing, and at the end, I found myself thinking 'No, it can't be over yet!'.

What is your favorite part of the book? I would greatly appreciate it if you would respond to my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used too many complicated words","review":"I liked this book because it shows how life used to be. It shows you how racist those times were. Another reason I enjoyed this book was because it had a female that always stood up for what she believed in and didn't care what anyone thought about it. I don't think it was fair that Tom Robinson got convicted because he was black."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"There does not seem to be much to add to this book's numerous, and well-deserved, accolades--so all that I will say is that this is a novel that has withstood the test of time.TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD became a classic because of the stories that author Harper Lee intertwined, and the morals that she imparted. The tale itself is complex and Lee's telling of this tale is graceful.One cannot call oneself a student of American fiction if one has not read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD."},{"rating":"2","title":"You mean you haven't read it?","review":"I'd be surprised to hear of any American who hasn't opened the pages of this classic Harper Lee novel. Yes, we have Boo Radley, Atticus, Jem, Scout, and many more characters, but the truth behind this novel is sometimes doing what's right isn't about doing what's easy.This is a lesson we should all take to heart again and again.I have read this book again and again throughout my life. I shall continue to re-read it to my children and hope the cycle will continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"To be read over a lifetime...","review":"Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird was the second book that I ever read about a family in the South that encounters racism.

The book is rightfully a classic because it paints a picture of the race-embroiled South through the eyes of a child -- and in that Harper Lee gives us a view untainted by prejudice or stereotype. Buy this book, read it, and I promise you will want to return to it again over the years, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Story","review":"I read this book when I was in my teens and I was very affected by it. I identified with Scout and Jem, who were full of curiosity and innocence, and were coming to know right from wrong, not just in small matters, but in large social issues such as jurors voting against evidence and for their own personal prejudiced views (despite the evidence). It's difficult for children to understand why adults behave like this, and I think Harper Lee does an outstanding job of depicting children coming to grips with right and wrong. I also loved the character of Atticus, the children's father. Years went by and then I read this book again, as an adult, and was still struck by the power of the story. I can see why this book won all the awards it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I give it a million","review":"This is by far one of the greatest boks ever written. It teaches us so much. It teaches us that the only way to ever really understand someone, you must get into their shoes and walk around in them. It teaches us that a child can sometimes know more than the adults ever could. It teaches us that prejudice and racism will always be the downfall of our society, if we let it. And it teaches us that, hey, entailments are bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird","review":"It was about a little girl named Jean Lousie and her brother Jem. It was when people hated black people. One man got convicted of hurting a girl, and most people thought he didn't get a fair trail since he was black,and he couldn't have hurt her because he had a hurt arm. Why it is called \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is, you shouldn't kill something harmless and kind. And they found out that Boo Radley was kind and he saved their lives, but the kids of the town were frightened of him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Killing mockingbirds are a sin......","review":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" thoroughly deserves it's title as a \\"classic.\\" With the intriguing manner Lee used to explain the events over two years, as well as showing the maturity in Jem and Scout over those two years, this novel has deep meaning. The title Harper Lee even chose was ingenious. If more people lived by the saying \\"to kill a mockingbird would be a sin,\\" we would live in more peaceful times. The main plot of the story is good and evil, and how we let our grudges and prejudices blind us from the truth or what's right. A must read - I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"To Kill a Mocking BirdBeing recognized as one of the greatest pieces of American literature in the twentieth century, stating To Kill a Mocking Bird is fantastic, should go without saying. I recommend whoever is considering reading this doesn't try to figure everything they can about the book before they do so. It's better to into on a clean slate. Some references and lifestyles may be shocking but one must remember where, and when it takes place. Reading novels from today's biggest names in literature, its clear many are influenced by Harper Lee. Lacking clear violence, true love, and other huge themes seen in books and movie now a days, some may say its boring but reading thoroughly, one can see the painful conflict and romance in its pages. In summary, this piece may in some ways be offensive, but it reflects history, unjust prosecution, and the truth of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"my opinon about what I have read .","review":"I think that this was an interersting novel. When I first read this book I thought It was boring. It was like a true story because things like that happen. All the characters in the storywere described well. Throughout the story, I was really intocertain chapters. What really grabbed my attention was the movie.I saw the movie abut two months ago. I really enjoyed it even though it was different from the book. My favorite characters were Jem and Scout, they were brave childern. Besides that the conclusion was not so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK I EVER READ","review":"The only complaint I have is I waited so long to read it.

I'm having trouble trying to find something else to read now, it will be a hard book to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better to read late than never","review":"Reading many of the reviews; I find myself like many of them in that for one reason or another I did not read To Kill a Mockingbird or see themovie until now. I was inspired to do so now in my more advanced mature years by the highlighting of it's 50th anniversary by PBS news,NPR and by CBS Sunday Morning news. I read the book first. It is as good as any one can express with mere words and I would say that onecould owe it to himself to experience the feeling of experiencing life as if young again with all that wonderful mix of confused emotion thatmakes life so vivid when experiencing it young. I set about rereading it as soon as I finished it and I'll definitely be rereading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out standing book","review":"This book I believe all cultures should read, it is a very touching story. Harper Lee is a great writer, I can see why she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.The Story takes place in the State of Alabama. The Girl who narrates the story is very smart and also strong, I admired her capabilties along with her brother Jem. They take you on adventures throughout the whole book.The plot takes place during the Great Depression. Scout and Jem stand up for their dad Aticus who is a lawyer in the town called Maycomb. Their dad is defending a black man whose name is Tom Robinson, he was accused of raping a young white girl. There is alot of history in this book.This is a must read book it has alot of meaning throughout the whole story, you will not want to put it down, a must read !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Masterpiece","review":"There is a reason that this book is extremely popular, and now that I've finally had a chance to read it, I know why: I consider it to be one of the most well-written books I ever stumbled upon.Lee's writing is so precise and sharp that it makes me wonder exactly how long it took her to come up with the first idea of the story, and then finally to have turned in the final draft for publishing. A story with characters like this could take years to write.For those who have never had the privilege of reading this masterpiece, do not overestimate this book by its mass popularity; unlike the countless books out there that are popular, no matter how bad they really are, Lee's book continues to thrive in both classrooms and bookstores alike because of the universal lessons it has to teach.It can be enjoyed by both the young and the old, but I suggest that you wait till you're older to read it, as the mind may not be able to fully appreciate it until it is well seasoned."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird book review","review":"This book is called To Kill A Mockingbird by: Harper Lee. It is a realisticly fictional book. It didn't happen, but it could. TKAM takes place in Alabama in the 1930's, in a county called Maycomb. Maycomb is a very discriminated town, and the 'N' word is used throughout the book. The story is told through a 9 year old girl, Scout, growing up with people who hate blacks. Her father doesn't want her to grow up a racist, and he does everything he can to teach her right. If you are looking for an action or adventure book, this is NOT the book for you. This book is full of drama, though. Come join Scout, her brother Jem, Dill, Tom, Atticus, Miss Maudie, and a host of other characters in the ultament conflict between black and white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Review","review":"In the beginning the children had a big curiosity in the man who lived across the street. The man is Athur (boo) Radley. He had not been seen in many years the children wanted Boo to come out. He was nicknameed boo because, He lived in the shadows of his home. In the second half of the book the children's farther, Atticus Finch took on a case defending an african amrican named tom Robinson. this story takes place in the 1930's where there was a lot of racism. so the town was unhappy with atticus Finch. tom was accused of a supposed rape against a white girl.

The story follows the coming-of-age of Scout and Jim, a sister and brother who are raised by their father in the south. Their father, a lawyer, is given the task of defending a black man accused of raping a white girl. Through this trial and their own adventures, the children learn about prejudice and misunderstanding.Because the story is told from Scout's point-of-view, the reader can see the prejudice from a child's perspective. This very effective tactic makes the prejudices seem more apparent and less logical. Furthermore, Lee makes her point without being preachy. The numerous lessons in this book should make it required reading for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I have read this book four times. All I can say is this, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the finest, most detailed, truthful, and important piece of literature to date.

In fact, I tried to start reading it before school started, so I'd be ahead, I couldn't get past the 1st chapter. The fist chapter is very confusing but once you past it, the book is wonderful. In fact, after you're done reading, go back and read the first chapter again and you'll appreciate it a little more... I'm so glad they made me finish because otherwise I never would have.

YOU MUST READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"I just finished the book. The book was fiction even though it probably happened in real life. I think the theme is courage because Atticus really showed it when he defended Tom Robinsin. One of the problems was that a lot of descrimination was going on in the town. I think the book is interesting. When Scout, Dill, and Jem try to see Boo Radley is very interesting. I disagree with discrimination. I think it it cruel to to that to people. I think the book suggests to know people before you judge them. I learned so mant things from this book. Make shure you read the little details because they really count! I suggest this book to anyone who want to read about how people treated eachother in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"lEts ReView**","review":"The Book \\"To kill a Mockingbird\\" was a good book. at fist i was not in to the book because it stared out as a book taht really did not have any thing that was intresting or that grabed your attion.

Even thought it is said to be fiction to me it seamed to be so real when read it you will not belive it if fiction. along with th realness they had a lot of lessons that you could learn from it. Atticus ( Scout and Jems dad) to me is the one who taught very one ant thing and eveything.

I started to catch on and actually read the chapters carefully, taking in every detail. It was hard for me to put the book down, always wanting to read on to figure out and piece together all the pieces. Its one of those books that you like and would suggest it to others to read.

Lippencott Co.Setting: 1930's Maycomb, AlabamaThe theme of Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is treating people fairly. Atticus Finch is assigned to defend Tom Robinson, a Negro accused of raping a white girl, much to the community's disgust on both issues. This is a memorable novel that teaches that all men should be treated equally. This book is trying to show how unjust humans can be, and we ourselves are by no means excluded. It also proves that most people are actually good, underneath it all. This is a mesmerizing and unforgettable story that all people should have the privelege of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Andres Review on To Kill A Mockingbird","review":"To Kill A Mocking Bird by Harper Lee is not a bad book. I enjoyed the situations that took place and the events that happend in the book. I disagree though with the character choice, not necessarily the choices but who the narrator should have been. I dont believe that Scout would be able to remeber things like the problems that took place let alone being able to basically turn away a mob? At her age things like that are hard to beleive espceially her and jem and Dill sneaking around at night? Its hard to beleive children not even ten years of age could accomplish sneaking out like that and not getting caught is very hard to beleive im 16 and cant even sneak out like those characters. I'd like to see this book from an older adults view like Atticus or a black persons view like Calpurnia.

Like most people that hate it, I too was forced to read it for English class. I want to start by saying they shouldn't make us read books like this anyway. People can get the wrong idea about racism.

I read this book because I heard it was so good, a classic, etc. In fact, I was less than impressed. It was slow, and at certain parts I found myself wanting to skip ahead or even stop reading it. If you have any idea that this book is about racism and the unfairness of our courts, you will be dissapointed when you wait through half the book just to get to the five or six chapters dealing with the actual case.

People who like it don't get angry at me, just stating my opinion of the book. I'm not putting the book harshly down, nor burning it. Actually I've read a few parts over, but that doesn't mean I truely like the whole thing. But Harper Lee's pros were he excelent use of language, and discriptive words.

The Grapes of Wrath, and Of Mice and Men, can claim this. The other in my opinion is this book. It is one of the greatest novels I have ever read.

The people of the town are against what Atticus is doing and through this and the rest the story, you learn about racism, predjudice, and maturatiopn.

The characters are fun to get to know and the central message of the book is great. It is an easy book to read; thus, its prominence in high schools, and its a quick read too.Sometimes you read a novel and hope that there are some undertones present from which you can make some strong conclusions about what the author is trying to say.

Beyond the story, however, the true value of the book lies in its moral framework. Atticus Finch serves as a model for human decency and dignity in a world that far too often lacks these traits.

The semi-autobiographical by Miss Lee encapsulates just about every nuance of human nature and morality worth describing. No wonder she decided that she needn't write another book. The heroes: Scout, Jem, Boo and Addicus are like shining lights in the midst of a world gone morally dark. The morality is as apt today as it ever was; only the names and faces have changed.

I've never read a better book to date and don't ever expect to, and I suspect if you read it you'll feel the same way. I know Atticus Finch is a fictional character, but he has been a role model for me since the first time I read this masterpiece.

Throughout the story Scout Finch is the narrator, and in a nutshell,the story is basically about Scout going from a girl to a women and the problems she encounters and the things she learns. But on a higher level the book is about the Finch's ( Scout, Jim, Atticus)who live in a small town where everybody is poor,and everybody knows everybody and their business. There are certain people in the town who everyone is scared of such as the Eweulls, and most of all the Radly's. During the story Scout and Jim have many adventures and they learn many things. For example, they learn about education,prejudice, family values, and learing to be tolerant of people's differences. But their biggest lesson was learned through the trial of Tom Robinson.

After a few chapters, it got really good and I didn't want to put it down. The back of the book doesn't describe it well. It is not a love story (I don't know what that's about, there's no love), but about this guy Atticus who had to defend a black man who was obvously innocnet (if you want to know the end scroll to the bottom). the narrator figures out her views of life a rasism through the issues raised. It's a great book, a must read (esp. for me). I must admit though, once you take notes on it, it looses some charm.Off2mars2@aol.com The end of the book is belowThe end of the book: Atticus's client is guilty, and gets killed running away from jail.

While the core plot revolves around the trial of black man accused of assaulting a white woman, there are actually a host of themes: prejudice, isolation, fear, class struggle, education and race. The hero of the book is Atticus, a kind of Ward Cleaver of the South. Atticus is the soft-spoken lawyer, the father of the narrator, who maintains his composure while others are giving in to irrational impulses like revenge or murder. His self-control and ability to empathize with others are the shining lights of this book. In an age when boorish self-expression is the dominant cultural model, the gentle compassion and wisdom of Atticus Finch remind us of another way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tequila Mockingbird","review":"There isn't a person in this courtroom who hasn't done an immoral thing, no one who hasn't told a lie and no man who hasn't looked upon a woman without desire.

The story vividly describes race relations in the South in the 1930s. The novel describes how Atticus's decision to take on a controversial rape case affects the family's relationships with the townspeople in their hometown, fictional Maycomb, Alabama. The novel also describes Scout's struggles in growing up such as dealing with school and her curiosity about a mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley. One of the best parts of the novel was Atticus Finch giving the closing argument in the rape trial. Atticus states that, in the eyes of the law, everyone is equal. The novel was published in 1960 during the Civil Rights Movement. Harper Lee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the novel, and it was made into a 1962 motion picture starring Gregory Peck."},{"rating":"2","title":"The plot was good, but at the same time it was perverted","review":"I thought that the main idea of this was very good.

The dust jacket is made of glossy photo quality, heavy-duty cardstock paper, with the printing embossed; the actual cover itself is just a plain fabric cover.

It keeps you interested, while staying simple. It wil make you laugh and make you cry. It begins by introducing you to the Finches. The story is narrorated by the young girl Scout(Jean Louise Finch). Part one takes you through their summers, school years, and inumerable attempts to provoke Boo Radley out of his house. Part two takes you into the rape case between Tom Robinson(negro) and the Ewells(white). Much racism and discrimination is shown throughout the story, yet the Finch family potrays good morals nomatter what happens.

I was astonished at how enjoyable this book really is. After I started reading it again, I couldn't put it down. The author really accurately depicts how unfair the South treated the Negroes at that time period. I liked how Harper Lee uses Scout's perspective to tell the story. Children often see more things than adults do. The title fits the story very well; the comparison of an innocent mockingbird to an innocent black man. I would recommend this book to anyone!

Read Faulkner, particularly the short stories Dry Semptember, Barn Burning, and That Evening Sun Go Down and the novels Santuary, Light In August, and The Sound and The Fury.

It's not even good. The characters are black and white two-dimensional cardboard cutouts. The rednecks are evil, the blacks are victims, and the self-righteous Atticus is too good to be true. There is nothing here to examine or explore. Critical thinking skills need not be applied for understanding. Moreover, if the lack of complexity and verisimilitude doesn't stick in your craw, then the insipid narration of the androgynous Scout will. This novel is popular due, in part, to the fact that the reader can feel morally superior to white trailor trash as he identifies with the demigod, Atticus. Shakespeare, the consummate craftsmen of characterization, understood that even the evil (save Iago) have some redeeming qualities, and the good flaws.

I read this book, and it became apparent rather quickly that all the events in the book had no relation to one another. Nothing progressed the plot at all. It was essentially \\"this happened, and then this happened, this happened too.\\" None of it presented or built upon any one storyline, and quite frankly, most of it was very uninteresting.

To Kill a Mockingbird deliveers strong messages of conscience and the realization of how strongly racial prejudice is embedded in the hearts of some people. The book mainly tackled issues of discrimination , but you will be surprised at how NOT run-of-the-mill it is in comparison with other books of the same topic. The narration by Scout is perfect, the metaphors of Mr Raymond, Boo Radley and of course Tom Robinson as mockingbirds is pure genius.

One thing that ticked me off was how the white people treated the black people. Some thing I was proud of was when Atticus decided to defend a black man, Tom Robinson in his trial in the case of him rapeing a young women. Finally I give this book 4 stars. I give it 4 stars because it was great to read and I was intriqued by each character, chapter, and part in the book.

Although the book is extremely well-written, the last few chapters didn't really flow with the plot. Although exciting, I found that it was slightly out of sync.

I earned three English degrees and have spent a lifetime reading. And \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is the single best novel I've ever read. Not only does it capture a time and a place flawlessly, but it describes the most important actions we can ever make in life--how to do the right thing no matter how unpleasant the consequences. It's about how to be tolerant and open-minded and to think for oneself, in the midst of a society that is small and petty and selfish and mean.

Lots of good characters and a nice plot filled with the issues that we're all struggling with today (e.g. racism, flaws in justice, torn relationships, and judgmental people)...I liked how all the characters interacted with each other and stuck by each other except at the part where it came to the trial of Tom Robinson. You have people rooting for him and people wanting him to be punished for a crime he never committed, which divides the line of love and coming together in a realistic way as told by Harper Lee....do read this novel and I assure you you will like it and consider it a well-written classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"top-notch novel","review":"The first time I read this book, at the age of twelve, I really connected to the narrator's view on the novel's plotline, although I realize that I didn't particularly appreciate all of the plotline. Now, after having read it several times, it is one of my favorite books that brings the civil rights movement in a different light than one learns about in history classes or other books. The separate point of view, through the eyes of a little girl (although the language would make you think otherwise), demonstrates how unnecessary many of these stereotypes and predjudices were at the time the book was written (or at the present day). Now, years later, the book is still an important one for poeple to read--the themes are universal, and it is simply good literature that is interesting and a wonderful book all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, Excellent, Extraordinary","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is filled with moral lessons, adventure and humor. The children's growth and maturity thoughout this story is true to life. Their relationships with each other, their father, neighbors and other relatives engage the reader and keep you wanting more whether those relationships are positive or negative. The characters and the descriptions of the neighborhood and town are vivid. When reading this book, one becomes linked with the characters as if those townfolk were one's own. It can't be put down until it is finished. And the finish is worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time classic, a must-read for all!","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is definately a book you want to read. Although it was written long ago, the themes of the novel still have strong applications to the modern society. The issues are the same: race relations, family/single parent, education, customs/heritage, culture, legal system.Harper Lee's masterpiece gracefully tells the story of a young girl narrating her experiences growing up in the South. Reading the narrative allows for us to remember the kid in our own hearts, and the playfulness and innocence of such a childhood. Reading the book also puts a number of pressing social issues right into our faces, and subconsciously we find that we are influenced by the work of Harper Lee, in this respect.I have bought this book for many people, and strongly encouraged them to read it.

However it is kind of retarded. What kind of person call there dad by there first name. Also who knows if Boo and his family are \\"strange\\" because no one will ever talk to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reading","review":"I would have thought more people would be rating the actual reading of this book, rather than the content. I have loved this book since I read it in high school and have read it several times since then. I have listened to it read by Roses Pritchard and now by Sissy Spacek. Sissy does a terrible job reading: no expression and several mispronunciations. I was embarrassed for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This book was tremendouly slow, and most of the time boring. I mean no offence to the people who liked this book, but I personally thought it was a borig book. Maybe it's because I like to read books with more action. I did not like this book, it had too little action, and even the climax was not very exiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harper Lee is Incredible","review":"This book is amazingly apt at telling about Scout's (I hate to say \\"loss of innocence\\"; it's so clichéd)...I guess you could say \\"transformation to womanhood.\\" The courtroom scenes, the subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) racism, and the symbolism are exquisite."},{"rating":"1","title":"LadieAllure@hotmail.com","review":"Since I'm a 9th grader and had to read this book at school, I disliked it. I thought it was very boring and time consuming. I guess it's because I'm not old enough to appreciate the real quality and meaning of the book. Hence, I wouldn't recommend teens reading the book because there's barely any actions and the climax is basically at the last few chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic but...","review":"This book is a classic and does have a great moral and social story to tell. Its social commentary is relevant to this day. But unfortunately those facts do not save the book from wordiness and a slowly developed story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget edition","review":"This 'library edition' is quite cheezy. The book is small, light, and the paper is so thin, you see through to the print on the other side. Also, the paper is not really white, it is sort of a pale grey color. If i was to buy this again, I would pay more for a nicer edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was expecting more from Sissy Spacek","review":"I was really expecting the definintive reading of this fantastic classic but was disappointed in Sissy's reading. It is stiff, slow, and a bit forced. She reads like she's reading to a 2nd grader rather than reading about one, working too hard to be completely articulate. It is worse at the beginning of chapters and loosens up some in the middle but is disappointing from such a fine actress. If the Roses Pritchard version comes out on CDs, I'd rather have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ADEQUATE ENOUGH...","review":"This book is not very convincing, overlong, mellow, and inconsistent. The novel isn't direct towards the reader in terms of telling who it is for: adults or kids. The characters are overwhelming and the occasional flashbacks are not concrete. The novel didn't captivate myself from page #1 onto #284. Honestly, I don't see the big deal with this book or the movie with Gregory Peck. It had third rate acting and was told in a fairy tale form with the little girl as the narrator. And to just think that Peck beat out Peter O'Toole for Best Actor of 1962! Not a classic in my book by all means!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird","review":"Harper Lee is the author of the book To Kill a Mockingbird. This book is a historical fiction about courage and prejudice. The book is about two kids named Jem and Scout who live in Maycomb, Alabama. Eventually a white man blames a white man for a very serious crime. I personally thought that the book was boring because they talked about stuff going on in the town and sometimes the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish","review":"Sorry but I honestly couldn't finish this book. I had to read it for my 11th grade English class, and it was utter torture to try and get through the first half of it. So I skipped about 15 chapters of this classic. It was boring, the characters felt flat, I didn't care for the whole plot. It just felt like it lacked basic structure to me. Maybe it was the fact that I was forced to read it. Who knows, but this book had me falling asleep, or just gazing off into space. I couldn't do it, so I would normally leave it opened while I read something more enjoyable. Maybe in the far future I'll pick it up again, and try it out...but hell, I don't think I can. It was such a horror to read, and I don't think I could even spend my money's worth on it. Sorry but this book was just horrible in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, excellent climax and ending","review":"Last night I could not put the book down for anything--the end was sooooo good! The reason that I rated a book that blew me away a four was that the beggining was kind of slow. It wasn't boring, but it did take Harper Lee a while to get to the point of the story. It is a phenomenal book that anyone, and everyone, should read, don't let the slow beggining turn you away. It all comes together in the end. I thought that the way the relationships between the characters was explored was excellent. I really felt like I knew them, especially Atticus, and Scout, the protaganist. This shows racism and prejudice in its simplest, most hateful and truest form, and the way it turns nieghbors and friends so strongly against each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little slice of heaven","review":"one thing no one ever remembers to mention about this book: it's funny (if you have anything resembling a sense of humor, you will laugh out loud at least once, guaranteed...but be warned, you might just cry a little too...).There is much that one can learn in it's pages about ethics, the depression era south, parenting, respect, dignity, pride, and crafting a well written sentence (the subtler points of these tend to be universally lost on 14 year olds and high school english teachers alike).well worth the time and money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Seller","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is a thought provoking book.Through the eyes of a child, they could see the injustice of a black man being convicted for a crime he has not commited, but because of the colour of his skin he is GUILTY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another timeless American classic","review":"First read this one in High School as required reading for English, and with no regrets.

Brilliantly written in first person as only a master of her craft could possibly accomplish. This was Lee's only novel, and when you've done it right, one may just be enough.

All the book consists of is a middle-class family in the south with a few weird neighbors. I mean come on. Who really cares about a little girl that goes around the neighborhood doing things like spying on her albino neighbor. If that makes a book a classic, shame on you. Atticus against all odds is always fair and never makes anyone mad. He deals with all disputes perfectly. A wee bit too good to be true. Don't you think? Finishing this book felt like the equivalent of fighting in World War II with nothing but an army of G.I. Joes. If you have been given this book as a present I give you my deepest condolences."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books ever called a \\"Classic\\"","review":"\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" was without a doubt one of the worst novels I've ever read.

Half the book dose not appeal to the readers eye, but on the other hand the other half of the book is completely different from the first half. This is a story that may have touched the hearts of some, but for the many that don't understand it. We agree with them because it doesn't make any sence to us. Two of the only good parts are when Tom gets convicted of a crime he didn't commit and when Mr. Ewell tries to kill Jem and Scout. Granded, we do commend you for the winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and also winning Academy Award winning for the film which is also a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it and you'll regret it!!!!","review":"It is a very interesting and great book!!!!!

This ordinary child begins to learn the way of life through the hypocritical, the prejudice, the courageous, the insecure, and the hateful, violent angry actions of the people from within her own household to the center of town. With but a father and a brother to aid and answer her many question, her dive deepens to the unspoken darkened depths of all human hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best book ever written.","review":"Like many people, I first read this book in high school. I have since taught it three times to classes. This summer, I am rereading it as I tutor a student from India who will read TKAM this fall in her high school English class. What an amazing book! Seeing it through the eyes of someone for whom the idioms and cultural references are new is great. I wish it would become available for Kindle so that she could immediately look up some of the great vocabulary that Harper Lee used. While that \\"great vocabulary\\" doesn't necessarily include the \\"n word,\\" that word is necessary to embody the racism and attitudes of the times -- also an interesting concept to try to explain to a foreign student. Everyone should read To Kill a Mockingbird more than once in his or her lifetime and live its lessons.

The first part is about these kids wanting some guy named Boo Radley to come outside. The second part is about a case that Atticuss is doing. He's deffending a black a man.I think this book wasn't good because it was boring. This book needed something more because after a while you will stop reading and not pick the book back up. This book needs action and mystery to it. It could be in the end of part one and two. The only people who would like this book is the people who like books with no action and mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Guys Thumbs Down","review":"I am sorry.

Narrated by 6 year-old Scout, reading the book opens your mind to see things exactly as she sees it and feel things the way she feels it. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages.

The novel covers so many relevant themes: tolerance, justice, the title To Kill a Mockingbird. It made me weep for all the mockingbirds of the world, those who do no harm yet are punished anyway. It also made me angry at our society, and angry at human nature in general. It was a truly special book, and I loved the ending. It was perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"This would have to be my all time favorite book. The analysis of characters and of the community they live in was done wonderfully.

I read it again as an adolescent, and felt I had grown a bit more. I've read it several times more as an adult. I continue to reread it over time, I continue to grow, and I continue to marvel at the power of the elegant simplicity of this tale.

The book's most exiting part is extremely confusing, and don't tell me I'm stupid; I have an IQ of 140. I personally prefer books that have something called action, such as Michael Chricton or Stephen King novels.If you're in for what Harper Lee calls a love story (even though there is no romance), go ahead and buy this book. If, however, you are like me, and you prefer something exiting, skip this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book for all ages.","review":"To Kill A Mockingbird is a sensational book to read to others or just to yourself. Atticus Finch is a wonderful role model for all ages. He stands up for what he believes in without giving into pressures placed upon him during the story. Jean-louise Finch, also knowns as Scout to most people who know her, is a wonderful role model for all young and old children. She is placed in situations that many of us at one point are.

I know many will disagree, but how can you not put it in the top 10? My good friend Perry, who passed away last year, used to tell me to read Mockingbird every 10 years or so. As we age there is something new between those same old pages. He was right. Read it as a child in school, again in your twenties, then your thirties, and on. Lee tells an adult story through the eyes of a child and with every passing decade the story deepens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless classic for every generation","review":"Harper Lee has written one of the finest books to ever be printed. Mixing heartbreaking emotions with current issues of the time this book surpasses most others. The prose given to Atticus Finch could not be better. He is the everyman's hero who shines with simple wisdom and a good heart. Every person should strive to possess the dignity protrayed in the character of Finch. Lee also captures perfectly the innocence and wonder of children in her novel. Scout is the little girl who were all were at one time and wish that we could still be. I am honored that I was able to live in a time when a person could write such a magnificent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-Read!","review":"\\"You can shoot all the Bluebirds you want, but remember, it's a sin to kill a MockingBird\\" This is the most important phrase in the book. It explains the title and the main moral and lesson of the book. This novel is about a lawyer, Atticus Finch, who is to defend a black man accused of raping a white girl in the 1930's. The story is told by Scout, Atticus's daughter. She tells of the trials her and her brother Jem have to go through as this case goes on. As the trial winds down, Tom Robinson, the black man, is found guilty of a crime everyone knew he didn't commit. The quote relates to Tom. This book is a great addition to anyone's library. This novel will leave a mark on your soul! While I'm at it, let me mention two other lesser-known but worthy Amazon picks that I enjoyed: WILL@epicqwest.com by Tom Grimes, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez -- two lively, fun novels that were an interesting change of pace for me. :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird Review","review":"I rated To Kill a Mockingbird with four stars because I really liked it. It was a hard, long read, but I enjoyed it a lot because I love to read the classics - they are great books. I consider it a classic because it was complicated, but conveyed a great meaning. It was really hard to put down. Even though it was a little slow, it was hard to stop as the plot thickened. I definitely could relate to Scout (the protagonist). She was strong-willed and curious, similar to me. I, personally, was shocked on how some characters could be so prejudiced. This book shows how someone can influence peoples' opinions just by acting out. It also shows how discriminatory people can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I think I was suppsoed to read this book in High School and I either didn't or i watched the movie instead.

It is one that needs to be absorbed, and felt. It does NOT deserve to be one of those books students hate merely because it's required reading.The characters are as real as books get, the small town one that you might live in now, or your grandparents might have lived in decades ago. The issues - from racism, sibling relationships, and just plain growing up - touch your soul. And it's just plain fun to read.It's a bit of American culture that should be cherished... passed on as the valuable art it is - but to tear it apart with attempts to read into symbolism, or to over analyze it... that nearly denies Harper Lee the respect she deserves for writing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" A Book Of Reality Of The South\\"","review":"To kill a Mockingbird is a book based on the time period of the 1930's. It tells the truth behind the walls of lies. The characters are perfect for a child's view of racism, growing up, and the ways of life. The book is set in Maycomb, Alabama in the poor area for the whites. In this town blacks are treatd fairly by some and unrighteously by others who feel they have a overbearing superiority . White women had meetings in which they gossiped about blacks. The town in my opinion is too close and they tend to know people all to well. They pass so much judgement that some tell lies that are not intended to benefit them just so they can be left alone. In my closing statement I say, \\" This book is a great depiction of the unjustful ways of the 1930's.\\"- Jasmine Meriwether"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is an amazing piece of literature that should be read by everyone between the ages of 13 and 50. Even though the main characters are two children, the plot is intriguing and absorbing. The characters are very developed, and the events range from the children's childlike endeavors to a realistic trial involving an accusation of rape. The title also comes into the book a few times, with the mentioning of mockingbirds signifying important events, and the question of which of the characters have mockingbird personalities. As it says in the book, it is a sin to kill a mockingbird because it simply plays music for people to enjoy, and does not do any harm."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to read this book!","review":"The story is about a girl, Scout, growing up in a very small town.

Jem was an okay character but he got boring because he grew up and his sister grew up but she still acted like a boy.

There isn't a single insighful moment in this overrated piece of drek, and frankly it is an insult to intelligent readers everywhere...Filled with more stereotypes than an epidode of Good Times, this novel features the archetypal White hero with few flaws, his perfect children, the maid with just the right amount of \\"colored wisdom,\\" a black amn who is little more than a dullard, and the evil redneck who actually commited the crime! The problem with novels such as this is that instead of depicting reality, they present a world where minorities are at best well-meaning simpletons who need to be rescued by perfect white males from all those \\"unenlightened\\" white meanies!

To put a mockingbird or any other singing bird above all others is counter-intuitive. All living beings have the same value, all life is inherently unique. The author posits that the mockingbird does no harm, but the insects it eats would say otherwise. The mockingbird is just as base, just as feral as a tiger.The novel. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is certainly a regional tale and yet it is entirely transposed and made unique. The fundamental flaw of the work is patriarch, Atticus Finch. Behold the savior of the down trodden race, raise him high and everlasting, let his name be known across the dark land.The land is dark because Atticus overshadows it, his skills as a lawyer of more import than the man he defends. His family, friends and town are props conspicuously used to frame the towering moral height of the man.

The story is based in southern America and is portrayed through a young girl's eyes. Atticus is a widowed lawyer and has two children Jem and Scout (narrator). This book shows what it's like to grow up as a kid in 1930's Alambama and how they deal with racism as children.Harper Lee takes you into the world of racism and clearly gives you images on how life was back in the 1930's. She gives you a mixture of personalities in her characters and also a rollercoster of emotions.The book is one of it's kind and I highly recommend you buy it and have a read.I give this book 10 out of 10 and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Kill a Mockingbird","review":"One of the great classics. The movie version is extremely good but nothing beats reading a classic novel with prfound substance, written beautifully. Who wouldn't love Scout and her innocence to see things as they are and speak of it...nor her father Atticus...a tower of strength and moral courage in a time of great and open prejudice toward our fellow man. The humor is warm. The seriousness of predjudice is unsettling and real. The outcome though sad for Tom and his family, is tender and sweet for Bo. Read the book and be transformed back in time...when rolling about in an old rubber tire brought more simple fun than the overwhelming complexities of today's all absorbing electronic entertainment that our children are drawn into. Simple and less really is best."},{"rating":"2","title":"low cost, high reaction!","review":"I bought the 1st edition, 1st printing of Harper Perennial Modern Classics' \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" that was signed by Harper Lee.

I gave it to my sister for her 22nd birthday (it's her favorite book and she's never owned a copy) and the look on her face when she saw that signature was utter disbelief! she actually started shaking she was so amazed!

The story takes place in the Deep South and is told through the innocent eyes of an eight-year-old girl called Scout. Her father is a lawyer who is verbally harassed by an entire town because he decided to defend an innocent black man accused of raping a white young woman. To kill a Mockingbird moved me to both laughter and tears as I read how Scout learns about life from watching her own father stand up and fight for what is right, exposing and challenging an entire town in it's unfairness and ignorance. Harper Lee, the author, is luminous. It is no wonder that this book shook the standards of our nation for the time it was written.

Scout Finch, a eight year old girl narrates her experience of joy, sadness, grudges, racism and above all courage. Atticus Finch, her father and a lawyer is up trying to save a black man from being wrongly accused of rape of a white woman.As the events happen, one feels the ugly side of human beings. The narration from the eyes of a child adds to the questions that are being silently asked in the book. There were lots of plots in the book, being Jill Harris, scout's friend, Boo Radly and the child's obession to drag Boo out of his house.The interaction of Jem, scouts brother and scout herself deserves a lot of credit for the overall outcome of the book. This is one book nobody should miss. If you haven't read it, you has certainly missed something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pamela O' Hora","review":"To Kill A Mocking BirdSet in the small town of Maycomb Alabama, To Kill A Mocking bird explains 3 years in the life of 8-year old Scout Finch, her brother Jem and their father, Atticus.

Atticus defends Mr. Tom Robinson in the trial. It is a very exciting trial, and Tom Robinson's life depends on the jury's decision. In the end it all comes down to your race. Even though Mayella Ewells is \\"trailer trash\\" Tom Robinson is still black.I would say that this is one of the best novels to read and that any age group should sit down, take a read and enjoy the novel.

I think I purchased this book for between $2-3, and it came in near perfect condition. I saved a lot of money and was still able to add to my collection.

This book is a fictional story, but when I read it, it all felt so real. There were many themes in this story. One is to walk in someone else's shoes before you criticize them or negatively judge them, which means to see their point of view. Another theme is courage. This is one of the main ones. Throughout this book, courage was shown. This book was a pretty good book. It will and can teach the readers many important things.

That was a part of why I love the this book so much, Ive been reading cr*p for most of my school days. Most of the books are poorly written and have plots that are so saddening its no wonder that so many kids are anti reading. The favorite topics for these books is usually slavery/civil rights or WW2. They all fail to send thier intended message becouse the reader wants to forget them as so as possible, but not Mockingbird. THIS BOOK IS AS ENJOYABLE AS IT IS POWERFUL.

The plot is so simple a 5 year could figure it out after reading the first few pages. Does this mean every book written about racism should be put as great books? I don't think so.What book the schools should teach about is the book The Color Of Water now there's a book that can teach you something. Unlike this dreadful book it doesn't teach anything except for that back then if you accuse a black man for even looking at a female they're going to get accused of rape. Ha great book people!

I was skeptical when we found the audio book because so many times the reader gets in the way of the story. Happily, this wasn't the case with this audio book. Roses Pritchard perfectly captures Harper Lee's distinctive and straightforward voice, finding all the subtle nuances and bringing that small southern town to life.

The repetitious dialogue; unhindered meandering; endlessly and needlessly branching plotline and much dated speech and setting has probably frightened more sophomores out of ever reading for fun than the Great Gatsby and Watership Down combined. But just because forcing teenagers to read a detailed account of growing up in 1930s Alabama is borderline child abuse does not mean there is nothing students can learn about good literature from To Kill a Mocking Bird. The characterization is presented masterfully; the descriptions are vivid; the narration is well done and it truly reflects the trials and tribulations of the time in which was written.

Harper Lee uses very good symbolism and portrays the characters in a style that the characters seem to be really alive.Exciting and mysterious this book will take you down to the the south where you will experience racism and compromise. Each day for the two characters is an adventure and their wise father and many neighbors make life exciting, especially Arthur Radley. The two experience loss, hatred, love, and understanding and they soon realize their place in the world and why things happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manic Meditation","review":"From the title and cover image, this book looks like it might contain useful and enlightening tips on making room for meditation during an active work day. And it does--for about four pages in the middle of the book. Otherwise, it's chock-full of esoteric practices like the laughing meditation (Sit on the floor and force yourself to laugh for an hour--who has time for that?). Dove's introduction is more telling than she realizes. As a freelance consultant, she has plenty of time to roll on the floor in forced hysterics. While I appreciated the mid-day mindfulness exercises and the gently encouraging tone in which they're written, there's little else of value here for the on-the-go professionals that are the book's target."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not 13, but This is where I found to write review, boo !","review":"Lunchtime Enlightment is a terrfic source foranyone wanting to enhance their life.

From classics such as Irving Berlin's \\"I Got Lost in His Arms\\" to contemporary cabaret favorites, \\"What You'd Call a Dream\\" is an album well worth adding to your collection. My favorite track is \\"Miss Byrd\\" by David Shire and Richard Maltby, Jr., which is given a fun and zesty interpretation by Ms. Meyer. If you have a chance to catch this incredible singer in concert, you won't be disappointed. Until then, treat yourself to this recording!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful documents that prove Cortes started the \\"Cortes is","review":"This book is an excellent new translation of five letters to Charles V, the HRE, four written by Cortes. The first letter, not written by Cortes, seems to have been written with Cortes leaning over the writer's shoulder, for it fits in perfectly with the four Cortes letters, both in sequence and in theme.The running theme of all five letters seems to be this: Cortes is a great man who works to bring wealth and glory to Charles V, while overcoming amazing obsticles presented by both Indian and Spanish sources.What can be learned from these letters? Not much that can be trusted, other than Cortes is good at \\"selling\\" Cortes to the royal court.The letters are full of obvious exagerations and vast silences."},{"rating":"1","title":"weight training","review":"This product would be good for someone who did not know the basics about dryland, but for someone with a solid background in weight training, it offered nothing I did not already know. \\"Ultimate\\" is a misnomer, a better title would be \\"Basic Fundamentals of Weight Training\\".

I am a varsity swim coach with a weight traning background who bought this book hoping for new ideas. There were none. The book is rife with typos and the pictures are poor quality. The book also suggests overhead presses and behind the neck pull-downs; both of which are poor choices for anyone a good deal of yardage. Pictures show lifts like bent over barbell rows done with feet together when most people will suggest a wide base with feet shoulder-width apart for added stability. This book is not for a beginning swimmer. It is not for a coach or swimmer with moderate knowledge of weight lifting.

This group of singers really \\"get it\\" and really bring the emotions and meaning across in their performances.

I applaud the efforts and premise of this production by the producer and performers; but a concept does not a recording make.

I bought two Coleman jugs at once--1/2 gallon and 1/3 gallon and they both leak. In the car I have to make sure they don't lean over even slightly or the seat will be wet. And not just a little bit, but really wet. I put some juice in one and then put it in a plastic bag, which was lucky because most of it came out when the jug got jostled in travel. I really don't enjoy having the water dribble down my chest while I'm drinking out of the spout. It's surprising how very much it leaks, really. We're not talking a few drops here, but a steady stream.I bought them because they seemed like a bargain at the price, but they were definitely not worth it. The point of a jug with a screw-on lid is to keep the liquid in there until I open it. They don't do that and it's very frustrating. Do not buy this because you will only regret it.

The room was so dangerous to enter that I had to cut off the circuit breaker to my entire kitchen in order to stop the nightmare.

This makes a loose and dangerous connection likely to spark. The plug is easily knocked loose. I don't suppose that this would meet any safety standards. The cord is too short and if you put any tension on it trying to reach a wall plug, the magnetic plug comes loose. Since magnets are weakened by heat, as the unit is used more the connection will become looser.

I think the magnetic plug is brilliant, if you move it too far it won't tug or slosh, it just turns off, which isn't that big of a deal. The base does get hot, I've been sure to only move it by the handle which stays touchable. Make sure the plastic lid isn't on while it heats up and when you put food in that has juices that could leak, just back up a little because it will pop, that's just how fryers are! Chemistry, folks.

All you have to do is put in your oil, heat it up, and add the dough. The number of things you can fry is endless. My personal favorites are the funnel cake, chicken tenders, and french fries. Depending on what you are making, cooking time can vary from mere minutes to a half hour. Experiment, create your own recipes, it's easy.One word of advice is to make sure to clean the fryer and change the oil regularly. Nothing is worse than frying with old oil. Keep the fryer very clean! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small and broke down quickly","review":"The fryer is very small, so as you cook subsequent batches, the previous batches gets cold. It's very basic: no temperature control, no indicator light for when it has reached the correct temperature, no basket (just a wide slotted spoon) and no insulation, so you do have to be careful around it. That would have all been OK for the occasional deep fryer user like myself except for something so basic, you would think there wouldn't be much that could go wrong with it. However I only used it about 10 times before it stopped working completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new way to cook","review":"Since buying the FryDaddy Electric Deep Fryer my cooking has changed drasticly. Many meals are cooked completely in this deep fryer, without having the range, oven or other appliances turned on at all. The taste of frozen french-fries cooked in thia deep fryer, rather than having them dried out and hard from being cooked in the oven, is indescribable.

It heats up in 10 minutes from refrigerator cold oil to oil hot enough to fry in. The FryDaddy comes with a plastic lid that you can store the filled pot in the refrigerator for the next time which is very convenient for those of us who re-use the oil. Very little oil is necessary and there is no splattering of hot oil-it's very clean to use. The plug is magnetically connected to the pot and connects and disconnects very easily both for safety and storage.

The highest smoke point of readily available shortening is around 350-360F, Crisco recommends not to exceed 365F, only canola and peanut oils are above 400F.I would put the ideal temperature at no more than 350F, 50F less than this fryer.Presto Customer Service said I should only use canonla oil (contrary to the enclosed instructions) and if that was not satisfactory, I should return the unit.I was disappointed and surprised after good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"This is an excellent cooking device for two people.

I grant that he's pretty young here, but still...I'm going to chalk it up to a poor script, because I know he can do MUCH better than this stinker. Add to that the fact that he is awful at faking his piano playing, and there really isn't much that's believable about this film. As a history it's worthless, and as entertainment it's stilted & dry.

If a few went into the holes at all, it looked like an accident. Maybe if you picked up the ants individually and forced them into the holes (but you still wouldn't be able to make them eat the stuff!)Maybe it's made for some particular type of ant that we don't have. (We have small black ants.) Oh, but one day a squirrel got into our kitchen and happily took these baits (poor squirrel!) so maybe it's really meant for them instead.Look at the reviews on the Terro liquid instead.

Ants don't even enter these traps, let alone eat the poison.The carpet in my appartment was poorly laid (especially around the stairs) and as a result, ants began showing up in my room around early summer. Most traps that I used required a knowledge of where the ants were coming from, and I has no idea.I would suggest using the liquid ant killers (I think the one I got was from tera). All you do is put a small amount of liquid on a piece of cardboard and wait for the ants to eat.I found exactly where the ants were coming from by using this because all the bate was gone the next morning.

I couldn't figure out why they were in there until I found them swarming my mouthwash bottle. I went to the local Wal-Mart and looked at the products they had for killing ants. I picked up this one thinking it was the best. I set out all four baits. They didn't even act interested in them. They would walk up to them, but they would not enter the bait trap. I even tried another brand (Combat) and had the same results. Finally I resorted to making my own bait. I mixed 1 tablespoon of maple syrup and 1 tablespoon of borax. They were all over that maple syrup. There had to be at least 40 ants drinking all at the same time. It's been about 14 hours and I have not see one ant back.

It has been days now, I figured maybe I need to wait a few days before the nest wherever got peppered with poison, and still no success. You know I thought the bait looked like Peanut Butter Too? I'm so mean won't give them a good time with the jam or jelly. I'm so disgusted. Those fire ants, medium ones do sting awful, had a few bite me on my belly ;-(Think I have one up my pant leg now.

I followed up by purchasing the product, and I've used it before applying my makeup, both alone and under foundation. It definitely helps to reduce my shine and keep my skin feeling smooth, but on the other hand, it certainly did not \\"eliminate\\" my shine, and I still needed to use other products such as powder.

It is an interesting study of vengeance by the father of a murdered girl who comes to America to find and kill her murderers. There is an interesting subplot in which an older and unreleased film by Terence Stamp is used to show the backstory when he was a young man and his daughter was a child. This subplot finally explains what has happened in the modern story. It is similar and far superior to a recent film called \\"Taken.\\" In both cases, the father, who has near superhuman skills, takes off after a man who has kidnapped or ( in the Limey's case) murdered his daughter. This is a better film but both are enjoyable. I can watch this one over and over. I'm not sure about the newer film."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:With a riveting Terrence Stamp, a thoroughly retro neo-noir storyline, some great lines, an intriguing DEA agent and inspired direction all wrapped up in a 90-minute package, The Limey is an overlooked gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as OUT OF SIGHT, but few movies are.","review":"This is a brilliantly realized film. Anyone confused by the flashback structure used to GREAT effect here should go watch 'Armageddon' again or something.

Challenge yourself with this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"Pretentious, badly acted (Stamp), cringingly awful. The rhyming slang was laboured and unfunny.

I love Out of Sight, Ocean's 11 and of course, Traffic. However, Solaris and now, The Limey are misses for me. There are definite great parts about The Limey, such as Terence Stamp and even Fonda, but I just never really go into the story. I was convinced Stamp's character wanted revenge, but the scenes that were supposed to convince me of his love for his daughter fell flat.Soderbergh's signature style is definitely there though. As an early work of his, you can really see what he turned that style into later in his better works. The Limey is probably the first movie I didn't care for that I actually bought the soundtrack to, so there's something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turning pulp into art","review":"Almost all non-linear approaches of filmmaking have always been quite overated and some even deserved a cult following. Steven Soderbergh's \\"The Limey\\" is one of those unfortunate cases when a director is so eager of turning pulp into art that he becomes completely lost in his own pedantry, but the film has its moments and it's eloquent in its violence.

I am a fan of Soderburgh..Traffic was a great movie, Erin Brokovich, Out of Sight, etc...but this movie just didn't do a whole lot for me. Honestly the best thing about this movie was the always wonderful Terrence Stamp. Peter Fonda was a joke, and the very underrated Luis Guzman wasn't given enough to do.I wanted to like this film, but I couldn't. My husband rented this from Netflix after reading an article stating this was one of the top ten movies for guys...my husband is a man's man...and he didn't like this movie either.Nope, I think it tried to be too much, it wanted to be an action movie, why through in the convoluted storytelling.

Lots of fine actors, but this film is overrated..period.Watch Momento for a better story, better directing, and better acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some films should never be given brains.","review":"This film plowed on with the same boorish tenacity as its main character. Basically it is a pseudo action movie that the director, in Dr. Frankenstein fashion, attempted to infuse with a brain. It would have been better without. I can sum the whole plot up in a few words: cockney career criminal attempts to make good on bad parentage by killing all the bad guys in his dead daughter's past. The flashbacks are artsy and overdone, and the story is mindless. Definitely wait for the fire sale on this one, you will never watch it more than once, if even that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low-key revenge thriller","review":"\\"The Limey\\", directed bu Steven Soderberg, and featuring Terence Stamp in the title role of the Cockney gangster out for blood in L.A., is a revenge drama in a minor key. Stamp, whose dubious accent elicits the occasional snigger, plays a veteran London crook who arrives in America to avenge the mysterious death of his only daughter, which, he believes, occured at the hands of a wealthy entrepreneur. The plot is strictly production-line, with the odd ironic twist and risibly melodramatic performances. What partially redeems the film is the pace and skill of Soderberg's direction: each scene never exceeds the limit of a few minutes, thus giving the film the quality of abstraction. Overall, though, 2 and 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was horrible.","review":"Gee, let's see the same flashback scene 20 times! It is nice to see that Peter Fonda's acting is as bad as ever.

Terence Stamp seemedunable to maintain a cockney accent at the same time as putting anyexpression into his voice at all, Peter Fonda was effectively in cameo mode and the constant flashbacks, flash forwards and fantasy scenes were indecipherable from each other. Confused - you will be. The references to cockney rhyming slang were over played and simply unrealistic. When you start picking things like this up in a movie you know that it just isn't working. On the plus side some of the supporting cast turned in good performances and the key to events - revealed at the end - was sound. This however was not enough to save the film, just because a product is bad does not mean you can pretend it is artistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of old tat","review":"Cheap stereotyped revenge fantasy.

She got up to take a shower 45min. into it. I think I should have joined her because this movie is not worth watching. The acting was bad, It proves anyone can read a line and stand around trying to look like they are in deep thought. The Dialog is boaring and trying at times. I would expect more from a high school film student. Half the film is rehashing flashbacks and flashforwards. The charicters are boaring and lifeless. The only interesting person in the movie is the 2-bit poolhall killer, and he wasn't that interesting. In the end I'd like to say I had very little feeling for any of the people or what they were doing. Fonda and Stamp couldn't carry this film because they both can't act.

Lots of action, mixed in with some humor, and really cool flashback sequences, this one is a film in its own category. Terrance Stamp is really great as an elderly ex-con, and a fish out of water, who will stop at nothing to find out how his daughter died, and who her killer is. I have to admit, the film did have a disappointing ending, but, upon futher inspection, the ending does sense. Fans of \\"Traffic\\" should check this one out. A soon to be classic film noir. Great for a boring Saturday afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"This is an excellent DVD. The picture quality and sound is well above average. Interesting way of story telling with flashbacks and flashforwards. Difficult to understand the accent at times, but you can just click on the \\"Subtitles\\" button.

I did enjoy this DVD very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Psuedo-Intellectuals would love it","review":"This film is a classic example of a director peddling garbage and knowing that semi-intelligent people will see it as their obligation to love it. Like the painter who throws ink spots on a canvas, Sonderbergh hides his ineptitude behind incoherant styling. He must know that there are many low IQs who will rave simply to stroke their own egos. The morons who loved this film could not even begin to explain it and anyone who likes interesting movies will not even be able to sit through it all. A very detached, unemotional and uninteresting film. One that assumes the audience will pay to see a 2 hour MTV video (or high school student film) rather than a professionally made movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Acting - The Worst Directing - The Worst Movie","review":"Alright I am going to make this very quick. This movie is absolutly horrible. I normally dont take the time to write the reviews, but I had to let someone know. Although the actors and directors are both good they do not pull it off at all. The script is riduculus and the plot is a joke. Whatever you do never ever ever even think about this movie. I feel like the buck I spent renting it was the biggest waste of money ever. I would have had a much better time throwing the money in the trash. Oh yea the ending of this film horrible. Okay well there is one way someone could justify buying this movie - If they needed something to burn to keep warm at night. Actually as much as this movie bites I dont even think that would work!

The singing and conducting are excellent. Unfortunately, the staging, which consists of a number of panels showing various Swiss type scenes with what looks like choir stalls in front of the panels, simply doesn't work. At best, it adds nothing; at worst it is a distraction. I would rate the singing 5 stars and the staging 2 stars.

Golden voiced Merritt and Zancanaro take the singing honors, hence my 5 stars. Studer is always very good, but never my choice. I disliked much of the staging except for the male trio and previous duet which were very effective. The ballets I hate, but they are necessary for the French style of \\"Grand Opera.\\" Operas in 2 or 3 fast moving acts in Italian become ponderous in the French version (here sung in Italian). I can't take off stars for that because some people actually like the ballet interludes.

What is supposed to happen is when you press this button, it is supposed to activate some function, however it is nearly impossible to actually click. I am an avid fan of The Sims, and now The Sims 2. I like to rotate the camera, but you can hardly get the scrollwheel to click making the free rotate function nearly impossible to use.

It fits in the hand really well. There's a good weight to it so it flows quite smoothly on my corepad- Adjustible DPI on the fly. This is great in FPS games like BF2 when you want to switch really quickly- Interchangable battery system. It's nice to be able to switch out the battery when you're low so you're not stuck recharging your mouse in a dock when you forget to recharge- Cool little battery indicator on the mouse. Lets you view your charge level at a glance.CONS:- BATTERY LIFE!!! OMG, these last maybe 2 days at the best with light use. If you play some BF2, forget it, you're changing the batteries every day if not more often. Even my MX1000 would last almost a week even with heavy usage- Only one side button.

I used to hate swapping batteries on my old mouse (diNovo bluetooth) and the hot swap batteries on this are quick and easy - no batteries doors!The feel/accuracy are up to par as expected, and the one thing I really like which I did not think was going to be a feature I cared about is the sensitivity adjustment buttons on the mouse. I development software and occassionally get time to play games. So when I play games I turn up the sensitivity, when developing I turn it down a level. It's pretty cool.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mouse, little bit expensive.","review":"I bought this mouse to have a top of the line gaming mouse, and it delivered. The three sensitivity modes are quick and easy to switch through, and battery changing is quick and easy. The dual battery idea is a much better solution than the mx1000, which required docking and recharging when it ran out of power. Overall, an excellent mouse that will do pretty much anything you need it too, I'm just not sure it's worth that much money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Mouse","review":"This mouse is amazing for gaming. It is totally a must have. battery life is nice and you can recharge one battery while you game with the other. The feel is great and the DPI settings are amazing. This mouse is revolutionary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Great for the first few weeks, but it just shuts itself down after a while. Tried everything in the book. I'm pretty sure it was the receiver that got too hot. Not very reliable at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"best mouse i have ever bought. the price is a little steep but it is worth the money if your into computer gaming. i play css and i could feel the difference the second i started playing. i had an old microsoft intellmouse and i loved that thing to death but this blows it out of the water. i am a logitech believer now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible gaming mouse","review":"Do not buy if you have other wireless or cordless items. The mouse stops working because of interference and the battery life sucks. It can really get frustrating during the middle of a important situation and your battery dies/loses connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst POS I've ever bought","review":"this is the worst POS I've ever bought. It stops working randomly and might work for awhile, then the damn thing stops responding again. Over and over and over. I finally threw it at the floor as hard as I could. I feel better and I even think the mouse might work better...if I glued it back together. Spare yourself and DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP.It's so bad, I've gone back to a wired mouse....yes it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Batteries, if one lasts a day you are doing well.","review":"The batteries were completely over looked by Logitech. The mouse might function well but I can not get the batteries to last more then a day. I will not buy another G7."},{"rating":"2","title":"G7","review":"The G7 mouse is by far the best one I have ever used. Extremely fast and easy to use. No set up required, just put the disc in and in a minute you are ready to go. I had bought a Microsoft cordless mouse before this one and I had to take it back because it was horrible. Logitech did a great job on this mouse, I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros overweigh cons","review":"If only they can make the battery life a little bit longer, but I really like this mouse, you spent 30 seconds to replace the battery every day, and in stead you don't need to bother with lags and wires anymore. I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if it warn you before battery dies!","review":"Is a great mouse. Just would be nice if it had an extra alarm to warn you when battery is dying. The small red light alarm is covered by your hand.Couple times during a dungeon my mouse died and I didnt notice the red alarm light blinking.Just swap the extra bettery and rdy to go, but I was static for few seconds and close to die.Anyway enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than one G7 in a room","review":"My main question about this mouse was whether more than one G7 would work in close proximity to another G7. I could not find this info anywhere on the Logitech website or any product description. But yes it does work, having 2 G7's in the same room does work and does not interfere with each other. I am currently running 2 G7's on 2 different puters with the bases about 5 feet apart. I don't know how many channels it supports but I do plan to get a third and try it out.As far as setting up 2 G7's in the same room I did not have to do anything special, I just plugged in the 2nd G7 and it was up and running. There is a reconnect utility supplied in the software but I never had to use it, yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"responsive and accurate mouse with large size","review":"The mouse is easy to install and fits in my palm perfectly. Wireless operation is seamless. I don't play computer games so the speed settings is an unnecessary function for me. The only advantage for me over a regular wired optical mouse is the wireless function. You don't need a G7 if you don't care about mouse speed and you can get a cheaper wireless optical mouse. [...]). Two downsides of this mouse: 1) It is large and people with small hands might find it uncomfortable 2) The battery runs out after 3-4 days. There are two batteries in the retail package but it would be a better product if the battery lasts longer (say, about a week)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Mouse, Bad Support","review":"Awesome mouse. Use it with my laptop to both work and play a couple of MRPG's. However, during one of my extensive travels, I lost one of the batteries. When I called Logitech's store to buy a replacement battery, the rep said I had to call the tech support, since they have to be processed as warranty replacements. Upon calling the tech support I was unpleasantly surprised that there is no way to obtain a replacement battery anymore. I was offered a new mouse at half of MSRP price, but declined the offer. So while the product itself is great, the battery life is fantastic (for a rechargable battery), the support side... well, sux!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LogiTech's Rare Blunder","review":"I bought this controller because it was on sale for $45.00 and for THAT price it is an acceptable mouse. It is comfortable and does what I as a web surfer need for it to do. HOWEVER the freaking battery issue is B.S. Changing the battery at least once a day is pain especially if the dead battery doesn't get placed back in the charger correctly and leaves you hanging when it is needed. I saw all the complaints about this before I bought this mouse and thought to myself that changing the battery often would be no big deal. I'm here to tell you - IT GETS OLD IN A HURRY. Bottom line is LogiTech is capable of much better products than this and you would be better off avoiding this mouse at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"wast of money","review":"I bought this Laser mouse because I wanted to try and go the wireless mouse rout, what a big mistake, the mouse either (in a program) moves real fast or it moves real slow and the control buttons on the mouse are limited as to mouse speed, and the rechargeable batteries don't retain there charge very long about a day and a half and the recharge bay only works when the computer is on. I am going to wait a long time before I revisit the idea of a cordless mouse. Do your self a favor and stay with a corded mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse, poor instructions","review":"Another great logitech product. The swapable batteries are great. The only down side is the instructions don't give many details about the mouse itself. The software tells me I have another button but I can't find where the button is....Overall though, the mouse itself works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mouse but too expensive and poor battery","review":"I love this mouse but the surprising thing is that it has been the same price for the last year. My old wireless mouse had AA batteries and I changed them once every 3 months. I'm shocked at what pathetic batteries it comes with. I still would recommend it though as it is a great mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery life probs","review":"This is a great mouse when you first get it. Lightweight, super precise, customizable buttons, egronomic, good looking. But when used regularly for long periods, battery life suddenly goes into the toilet. That is, you end up swapping batts seriously every 10-20 minutes. This started after about 6 months. Super disappointing. Went back to the trusty MX700. G7 is now collecting dust, both batteries dead. Along with my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor battery life!","review":"I have been using a Microsoft mouse, that used standard AA batteries for years. I got sick of having to hunt down new batteries 2-3 times a YEAR. I purchased this mouse because of its rechargeable battery. However, I am very disappointed with its battery life. I have had the mouse for few months now, the first month, I had to swap the battery ONCE A DAY, annoying, but not too bad, I would have assumed that a Li-Ion battery would last longer than AA batteries, I cant believe it has to be swapped DAILY. The biggest problem is that every time you recharge a battery, it reduces its life, I knew this from the beginning and expected the batteries to last at least a year or two, however I am already am finding that I am swapping the batteries about twice a day. At this rate, I will probably be swapping the batteries hourly by the end of the year. I highly recommend going for a mouse that uses standard batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal quality, poor performance","review":"This was undoubtedly the worst money I've ever spent on any mouse. While the mouse started out performing decently, it quickly degenerate into disconnects and cursor locks ever 4 to 5 minutes. Effectively rendering the device useless for any game or professional application. The quality of the mouse was abysmal, the support from Logitech abysmal, and worse, after looking around, I found that regular disconnects are not at all uncommon for this mouse. I strongly recommend that anyone who is looking to purchase a mouse simply look elsewhere. The G7 is a poorly made product that guarantees little more than frustration and frequent interruptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse available","review":"This is the second Logitech G7 I've purchased. And, this time I only looked for this specific mouse. I have used many different types and styles, and have found this one to be the most reliable by far. It fits perfectly in the palm of my hand and is so comfortable. I don't get hand pain from trying to hold onto a mouse that doesn't fit properly. It comes with two batteries so you never have to wait. One battery is always being charged in the charger (also included) while you are using the other. The lights on the top of the mouse show at a glance how much battery time you have left. The batteries pop in and out in a matter of seconds. I use this one at work where I am always on my computer. I used the first one at work also and it lasted about two years before I literally wore the left button out from constant clicking. When my mouse at home (which is a different style Logitech) finally kicks the bucket, I plan on replacing it with this style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to bad wish it was cheaper for what it is","review":"I replaced a gaming MX518 for this G7. The g7 is a bit heaver and has a hair less fit on the backside of my palm. repose time for a wireless is amazing. install was less then 3 min. side rubber or grip on the mouse is not as comfortable as the mx518 but i think this new stuff is to prevent ware and tear like my 518 did. all in all i like the mouse its great just not worth 68 dollars to me. I if i had the chance again I would spend 44 dollars on the mx518 again it was a tank of a mouse with a bit nicer fit on the hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great... While it lasts","review":"I bought this mouse and used it for about a month. Then whenever I started up my computer, the cursor would not move...Cheaply made.I'd recommend the new wireless MX (if you don't mind paying a little extra)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're going to be changing batteries a lot","review":"The only complaint I have is that you are constantly changing batteries. Every two days. I cannot see the advantage over this mouse and an equivalent that takes AA batteries and lasts 9mo to a year. If someone can make a mouse run on two AA batteries for 9mo to a year, why do I have to swap and constantly charge batteries every two days??? This is the last mouse I buy that touts swappable battery packs. I thought the idea of a rechargeable battery was great till day two happened, followed by day 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,... you get the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent ... while it works.","review":"Same problem here. The mouse stop working after some months and Logitech support is useless.It was great while it worked though, maybe the best i tried after the apple trackpad.I've tried all kind of things to make it work again but i couldn't; now i'm considering buying a new set of batteries.... who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazer went out in 3 weeks","review":"The lazer went out within three weeks after purchasing the G7 but Logitech stood behind it and sent a G700 which is a much better wireless mouse as a replacement. WOOT! for Logitech and their customer support. I'm still a Logitech customer and fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 1 year","review":"Great precision. Great transmission range. Great transmission continuity... until now.I had this mouse for about one year. Then the batteries started to run out about once a day. I use it as my work mouse. So, it's used for about 6-8 hours a day. So, pretty good performance really. When I first bought it the batteries would last about 4-5 days.But, then the mouse just stopped transmitting for about 10 seconds every few minutes. Annoying to say the least. I tried moving the receiver 5 inches from the mouse. No good. I had to retire it.It's pretty expensive to replace every year. But, I think I might just because it works so much better than any other wireless mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving it.","review":"Works great! Have to change the battery every day, but that's the price you pay for cordless gaming. Fortunately it's very easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Mouse Rocks!!!","review":"If you are looking for a great wireless mouse for your PC or-MAC-, this is your mouse!! After much pondering and looking at the millions of mice available I decided on this and I am NOT at all disapointed. I own a MacBook Pro and I didn't even need to install usb overdrive, just plugged and played, and played. The batteries, which so many complain about are a snap to charge and use, and unless you are sitting in front of your computer for hours on end gaming they are great and convienient,...Oh it dies...just pop in the fresh battery. If you are sitting in front of your computer for hours gaming then get a wired mouse! As for performance it is extremely precise and comfortable, and looks...This is one HOT LOOKING MOUSE!! It really is a no brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Mouse","review":"5 Stars awesome mouse love it battery life is great gaming and great accurate moves no lag or skips this mouse is the IT for gamers.

Very clean feel, accurate, and a welcome upgrade from my previous Microsoft wired optical mouse.Only problems are the short battery life (only 2 days?) and the lack of being able to use the left/right middle button switch in multiplayer games. (it doesn't register as mouse4 or whatever)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Mouse but very poor battery life","review":"I agree with positive reviewers concerning the excellent precision and smooth performance of the G7, but if you spend a decent amount of time on the computer daily you will hate this mouse and Logitech. What will happen is that you will quickly tire of having to swap to the spare battery every day or every other day. What's worse is that you will soon realize that the G7's batteries are propriety and there's nothing you can do about it (i.e. buying more powerful batteries) short of returning the mouse. How Logitech can sell a premium mouse with no battery life is beyond me. I guess that's why they give you the spare battery that is always charged. That, however, is just a band aid covering a power hungry design that is a great annoyance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great mouse, when it works.","review":"I was really excited to get this mouse after reading some of the reviews. For the first couple of weeks it worked great...now all of a sudden the mouse stops working at random...sometimes upwards of 5-10 seconds.I have my mouse about 4ft from my wireless router, and only about 5 inches from the charging station...so any interference should be very minimal and I don't think that is the problem.Quite a few other people have had this problem as well(check the forums on the Logitech website)...and some have had to send back their mouse 3 TIMES before they got one that actually worked properly. If you are using this mouse for a lot of gaming like myself...get ready from some potential aggravation.This really seems to be a hardware issue that is still yet to be addressed. If I could do it all over again, I would get a different mouse, from a different company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressive!","review":"This is a great mouse in almost all respects! It performs well and the battery life is very good for a gaming mouse. It is also surprisingly light. I just wish there was a forward button. And if the batteries could be charged without having the computer on, it would be perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw results in a week!!!","review":"I don't trust in testimonials.

The film was made in 1978, in what was then East Germany, and makes a hash out of Pushkin's original story. This version is so heavily cut as to render the storyline almost incomprehensible. Even the best piece in the opera (the lovely tenor aria from Act III) is gone! With its Russian origins so obscured by conventionally schlocky costumes and makeup, one would hope the cinematography would compensate for it. Alas, this is not the case either - most of the camera work is truly hokey. The singers do a good job (they are identified only at the end); kudos must go to the wonderful Semper orchestra and conductor. This is a video that should interest only the serious student of Russian opera.

I choose this brand due to price. it was lower than V-Tech or Panasonic units. Maybe the others are better. Another complaint is that the headset buttons are very small and hard to read.

Well I guess her husband thinks she's the best artist to ever live, Mutt Lange. Songs like I'm gonna getcha good, I'm Jealous, and Forever and for Always are just immature and tripe. Her voice has no powerful in it, she's only famous because she was the first country artist to flash her belly button, so what! What's so groundbreaking about that!

UP! is a disaster waiting to happen first off there are way too many tracks on this album I say the limit is 10 to 12 songs on a album but no more then that. There is just two much material. here. The songs were just stupit and there just unreal. Country music is about being real and her latest video does not look very real at all and even if this is supposed to be pop it's pretty bad.

Filled with intelligent lyrics, good hooks, satire, encouragement, and love, but not overly produced, this album is what music is all about. The title track \\"Up!\\" is typical Shania, with it's usual tounge-in-cheek humor, and infectious hook. Stand out tracks include \\"Juanita\\", \\"Not Just A Pretty Face\\", \\"Jealous\\", \\"C'est La Vie\\" and \\"Ka-Ching!\\". \\"Ka-Ching!\\" is a completely new direction of music for Shania, which may cause some fans to have an adverse reaction. Every song on the album is solid. If you're looking for filler, you've come to the wrong place. Heading into new territory adventurously, \\"Up!\\" packs quite a punch!

Overall, I like it just as much if not more than the last album. I think it has sold like 5 million copies in the US so far, while \\"Come On Over\\" sold like 15 or so million, but selling 5 million of a single album is a miracle during these days when everyone downloads and burns.

Maybe it's because the \\"1-stars-critics\\" have heard the album about 1 time.All above 4-stars-critics have done it twice or more...Please listen to the album for some times...it will becomebetter and better with every listening...And it deserves 5 stars! :-)Greetings to the U.S. and Canada from Germany...ps.: Shania you're gorgeous!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania's back at her best","review":"This is Shania's best album ever, even better then \\"Come On Over\\". I just can't get enough of it. I'm listening to it now too. It was worth it waiting for 5 years, this is a really excellent album. The songs are catchy, breathtaking, funny, really good lyrics. The title song is amasing but too short like \\"Come On Over\\". Check out also \\"Ka-Ching\\", \\"Waiter bring me water\\", \\"I'm not in the mood\\", \\"I ain't going down\\", \\"I'm jealous\\". Great work by the queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed!","review":"I can't believe she put out an entire album of this junk. Almost every single song sounds the same. She needs to develop a new style of music, because all of her songs are beginning to blend together. She will not define herself as an artist until she can carve out her own niche. I do like her voice, so I hope that she can try something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"up!!set","review":"Not a good cd by any means. There isn't a song on this cd that is as good as the worst song on Come On Over. Its [bad]!! Did Shania lose her producer? Or did it take her 10 years to write the songs on Come On Over? The songs on this CD are not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This was a real disappointment. No quality to her voice and nothing unique about this CD. I would not recommend this CD, but do recommend that Shania find a day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am normally a big Shania fan but this album has been tough for me to get through, even when I try time and time again. Her voice seems very strained and unbelievably, sometimes is irriating to listen to. I was also disappointed with the quality of the songs - you can only rhyme words like kiss/miss, together/forever so many times and in so many songs. \\"Forever and Always\\" is a keeper. The others are passable at best, and I think the album would have flopped had it been a debut, instead of her 4th CD. I will give her credit for the issues and song topics, it's just the melodic qualities were very... overdone. Definitely a disappointing album, I feel like I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Album Of The Year!!","review":"First of all, let me just say that I have written two reviews for this album, only to have ...say I was attacking Shania. That's fair, I suppose. But I can't help it. This is the worst album of the year and it has sold 3 million copies in two months? As we all know, sales don't mean anything. The true test is longevity. The sign of a great or even a good artist is growth and risk taking, which Shania doesn't display on this album. Her voice sounds weak, her \\"songwriting\\" is lame, and the productions are really bad and 80's garbage. And is she country? NO!! Even with green version, its clear that she was making a pop album. Just because you throw in a banjo doesn't make it country. This album is another example why the music industry is in bad shape. I really feel sorry for the next generation who will never know the power of good music. Avoid this mess and pick up the latest Dolly Parton's cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, the same songs twice over!","review":"If your not yet tired of ms twain, get this cd. Not only do you get the songs in the twangy crap that is country music, but, you also get a pop version of the exact same songs. Where is the creativity?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Idea....","review":"Shania Has made it again. This time, she allows consumers to have an option to listen the pop and country version of her songs in her album \\"Up!\\" Two CDs in a regular price CD - Cheap price. Like her previous album \\"Come on Over,\\" Shania once again made a Catchy songs, and again, this album was indeed successful. I prefer her pop version, though I do like her country version as well...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania's UP!","review":"Shania's UP! CD is BRILLANT. She never has had a bad song. I loved it. It was brillant for a 2 disc cd. Leave it to Shania to come UP! with that!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why","review":"As a linedancer from england ( and a country music fan) I have to question the companies decision to release the red & blue versions in the uk. why was the green country version not made available to us ?it seems that the record lable has yet again failed to appreciate the impact of country music in the uk and have released a indian (wolrld music) version which may proove to be popular in London and the south but is of no interest to those of us living in the freezing north.there are some good tracks on the album in my car being just one but the vocal talents of shania are shown to their best advantage in country based and phrased songs.shania, dump the pop and world stuff and stick to what you are so good at.keep it countryandy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Check out the green (World mix) version!","review":"I like this new album, most of the songs are great, esp I'm Gonna Get You, Juanita, Nah, C'est La Vie, Waiter Bring Me Water.The World Mix (green cd) is my favorite: interesting, bit unusual, tinge of Asian/Indian arrangements - check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I like her idea of putting out a pop and a country album together because somedays I do feel like just acoutics and others I feel like rocking out but I wish she would have put all three cd's together and that is why I gave her a 4. I like the sound of the blue disc and if it ever goes on sale here I would buy it becuase I love the new sound of \\"When You Kiss Me\\". Peace and love to the fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"fan from Boston","review":"I'm not a country music fan, but I love both disks and can't wait to get my hands on the European version which as I understand substitutes the country disk with an \\"Indi\\" disk (Bollywood type music). Thank you Shania - this was worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up And Over","review":"There's been a lot of skepticism to this album, but all I can say is that it's pretty damned good! This is one album you'll want all three mixes (Red=Pop, Green=Country, Blue=World) from no matter 'what' you hear from people out there! If you thought Come On Over was good, this'll definitely send you for a loop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy songs but simple lyrics","review":"Appropriately titled \\"Up!\\", Shania's fourth cd offers a blend of rock, country and pop. Most of the songs on this album are instantly addictive. So if you're looking for a disc full of catchy, radio-friendly tracks, this is the one to get.Don't expect depth or true emotion, however. This is light sugary stuff made simply for your listening pleasure. At times, the words just serve for rhyming purposes. So don't expect any life-changing lyrics.Shania's goal is clear: make a 72-minute album with 19 songs and fans will bye it for the value alone. There's a downside to this, though. The cd plays like one long, 72-minute song. There are no pauses between the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania at her best...","review":"Shania's latest release is just what you would expect from one of the best performers around. Shania stays true to what she has produced in the past. Many of the songs are catchy, upbeat and filled with fun lyrics...Shania never claims to be deep or profound so its hard to fault her for being somewhat shallow. As a fan, I am thoroughly pleased with this work. I was surprised to find two CDs, as she says in her included insert, \\"I might put on the red CD to hear the songs with an electric, rockier-edged sound, and if I want to hear them with a more acoustic, down-home feel, I listen to the green CD.\\" The one criticism I have of Up! is that a few of the songs have the same sound and it's a little hard to differentiate them. But overall, I think that any fan of Shania would be more than pleased with Up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disappointment","review":"I became a Shania fan with her last album. This album was quite a disappointment. All the songs sounded the same. It was very boring .....I sold the CD after listening to it only once...don't wast your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST A PRETTY FACE","review":"Shania Twain? If you look up for the meaning in a dictionary, it would be 'Shania Twain means a female singer with pretty face and terrible voice. Sorry for all her admirers, sometimes the truth is so hard to swallow, isn't it? I admit that I've bought her CD just to get her picture in the booklet!!! Her voice is so...unbearable. Her latest DVD concert with Alison Krauss and the Union Station can prove all my judgement! Apart from her intolerable voice, her hand movement while singing is also annoying as well. This one star is totally coming from her 'just a pretty face'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected More From Shania","review":"Sorry to say but i am extremely disappointed with this album. With the sucess of The Woman in Me and Come on Over, I was really expecting something great from Shania. This album basically sucks. THere are really no good songs on this album and her voice is very annoying to listen to. THe only song i like is Up. It's catchy and upbeat but the rest is excruciating to listen. My advice is to avoid this album and wait for her next one to come out. Hopefully it will be a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating Painful","review":"Except for two really nice songs (\`Forever and for always' and \`When you kiss me') and two bearable songs (\`I'm Gonna Getcha Good' and Ka-Ching!) this CD consists of a cacophony of horrible melodies, (that is if you really want to call this music \`melodious'), and a mumble jumble of badly written lyrics and at the lack of that, winded Yeas and Oohs.It is hard to believe that this is the same lady who brought us \`The woman in me' and \`Come on over'. This CD should be added to the US military's physiological warfare arsenal. I'm sure they could have beaten the Iraq republican guard into submission by playing this CD to them twice in succession.Need I say more ...?"},{"rating":"1","title":"uh...","review":"im a shania fan but this was too pop....she tried waaaay to hard to be a pop artist....the only half decent song was \\"UP!\\"....and the country version [disc 2] of the cd was horribly fake! i like pop but this was terrible for her, she needs to go back to her cd \\"come on over\\" NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointment","review":"I'm a fan of Shania Twain but this CD was really dissapointing. It has only one good song (I'm gonna get you) and the rest have lyrics that either don't make sense or are just plain boring/stupid. I should have listened to the bad reviews and not bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as her other albums, expected it to be better","review":"This album is by far her worst album to date. I expected it to be so much better, especially since it took so long for it to come out. The Women in Me and Come On Over are full of hit songs that you can listen to over and over again. However, with this album most of the songs are just plain annoying and unbearable to listen to. Whats with the two discs? The country and Pop ones basically sound the same. It's pretty silly and lame that there are two different discs. ANyways, it Should have been better. I expect a lot more from Shania on her next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"She should have quit while she was ahead","review":"First of all, if you want true country music look elsewhere. The only reason I could see for Shania to release these CD's is for money making purposes because she has obviously already recorded her best material. Songs like \\"From This Moment On\\" are not about to be topped. As far as her other \\"catchy little tunes\\" from her other albums, they have just been rehashed on this album and it has become tiresome! She hasn't evolved one bit! I do find her lyrics a little hypocrital too when she relys so HEAVILY on her appearance to sell her cd's and concert tickets."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much going on here","review":"yeah She is a Babe&whatnot but that has nothing too do with the overall product which leaves me feeling kind of empty.Her voice just doesn't move me as much as some of Her Previous tracks.this Album feels like Nashville Shine.She is too young&early in her Music Making Career too be Rehashing Material so soon.not a track on this set really stands out for me.More Factory driven than anything else.and the Lyrics are as Bland as most of what is out nowadays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This album is full of dredge. Not only is it full of dredge, you get each song (?) in 2 styles. Country and pop. Wow! She has stamina and charisma, but not on this set. Pass on this one, it is boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Commerical","review":"This CD was kind of dissappointing.I could tell it was made to be a hit.It was way too commercial..I needed somethign with emotions.....feeling...and just...something was missing. Not a bad CD but I rather go with Mariah Carey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to get rid of \\"Mutt\\"","review":"Shania's album \\"Up\\" has \\"Mutt\\"'s 80's influence all over it and that's a bad thing. The processed \\"Cheez Whiz\\", synthesized 80's backbeat is found on every track, including the ones that are on the \\"country\\" CD. The only difference between the country and pop versions of these songs is that he adds gratuitous riffs of slide guitar and a little fiddle, while keeping the cheesy pop, drum machine beat for every song. Finally, the attempt to add other culture's musical influences to this album consists of \\"Mutt\\" pressing the flamenco guitar button on the synthesizer for one track and the sitar button on the synthesizer for another track.A word on Shania's voice. We all know she can actually sing and has some versatility, but it's nowhere to be found on this CD.This CD is a huge disappointment. Listening to Shania has always been a guilty pleasure, now it just leaves me feeling guilty that I spent the money on the CD in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The first two songs are great, but the rest of the CD is completely and totally forgettable. I was disappointed. Shania's lyrics get more and more mundane with each new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected Much More","review":"I am a huge Shania fan and must say, I was really let down with her new cd. There wasn't one song out of nineteen that was awesome or really caught my attention. It doesn't leave you wanting to hear it again. I know it is hard to compete with what she had on her last two cd releases, but this isn't even close at all. It sounds as if she didn't want to sing. Her voice sounds so nasaly and not her full range that was heard before. I have put it aside and hope that the next time I listen it will grow on me, but thus far, no such luck.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up! Falls Short","review":"After waiting five years for this album, my spirits were anything but \\"up\\" when I finally heard it. Expecting Shania to top \\"Come on Over\\" would be expecting the impossible, but her longtime fans deserve better than this teenpop-rock hybrid. The album lacks variety, lyrically and instrumentally. After the first two songs, which happen to be the only songs on the cd that I liked, the whole thing starts to sound the same. The lyrics are immature and at times, outright stupid.Her voice is still as lovely as ever, but it isn't enough to save this album. Sorry Shania, Up! is definately two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Shania Twain CD ever","review":"Over Thanksgiving my family bought this CD and listened to it in the van on the way home from a trip. The CD was awful, all of the songs sound almost the same and and don't live up to Shania's standard. Excercise caution when buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible- POP NOT Country","review":"Why are all these people calling this country? Everything about this woman is POP- down to the horrid aerobic instructor outfit. It is simply marketed to country MOR listeners.It is bad music, Super cheezy, and the arrangements are nothing more than Bad Pat Benatar riffs. Oooh this is so cheezy I cant even stand this. If you like this music, you are being led on by some NYC /LA A&R; guy rep with a pinstripe suit and a pony tail. It's pure filtered corporate cheeze. Put down your Value Meal, stop driving your Tahoe while on the cell phone and Stay Away from this kind of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"it has some good songs","review":"this CD actually has two CDs with different versions of the same songs.....believe it or not, i lean toward the country version....the pop version sounds a little too sleek......anyway, i really like the fast paced songs on \\"UP!\\".....\\"I'm Not In The Mood\\" and \\"In My Car\\" are two of my favorites"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Music Makes Me Jump UP!","review":"After being such a big fan of her last release \\"Come On Over\\", I thought that there was no way that Shania could EVER top that. That soon changed when she came out with 19 awesome tracks (Both pop and country versions on 2 different discs) on a suitably titled album. This is by far the best album Shania has assembled. Every single song has a catchy melody & beat. The lyrics are very energetic and are very well-written. Each song is about everyday life...subjects that no other song has. That's what makes this album very unique. The best songs on this album include:UP!I'm Gonna Getcha GoodShe's Not Just A Pretty FaceIt Only Hurts When I'm BreathingNah!Wanna Get To Know You (That Good!)C'est La Vie!I'm JealousKa-Ching!Waiter! Bring Me Water!What A Way To Wanna Be!I Ain't Goin' DownIn My Car (I'll Be The Driver)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Country","review":"I don't think Shania Twain should really even be considered a country artist anymore. With the exeception of one or two songs, I was VERY disappointed with this CD. Even the country CD isn't really country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can only go up from here. HOW TRUE!!","review":"I have endured listening to all 19 songs on the red disc and frankly i'm exhausted, and a bit offended. I enjoyed Shania's previous efforts and defended her against music \\"purists\\". Her music was fun, funny and very entertaining. After a promising start this CD turns south at around track five and never stops. I found myself longing for tracks like \\"Home Ain't Where His Heart is Anymore\\" or \\"Leaving is the Only Way Out\\". It's like we're babies and Shania has to keep waving colorful objects in our face or we'll start crying. I also find it a little insulting and ironic that she feels the need to lecture us on our greed (Ka-Ching) and vanity (What a Way To Wanna Be). This coming from the poster child for commercial and physical obsession. Give me a break! Wake up America and don't be fooled again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not the best Shania can do","review":"I'm from North Carolina, and I was raised on country music...as long as I can remember, I've been a big fan of Shania Twain. Her songs have always been catchy, with amusing lyrics and her beautiful, unique voice. I was greatly anticipating \\"Up!!\\", but I was extremely disappointed with what I found. I've always been told not to mess with success - or \\"fix what ain't broke.\\" With this album, Shania clearly tried to fix something that was working wonderfully for her - this CD is of a completely different style than any of her other music. The only songs that I even remotely like are \\"Up\\" and \\"I'm Gonna Getcha Good.\\" The other songs are irritating. If you liked \\"Come on Over,\\" you'll probably want to skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and uplifting listen","review":"Up is such a fun album. The album is reminiscent of 'Come On over', 19 tracks in all, plus the alternate disc, a good buy. Shania is just having fun, you go girl! Best songs: It Only Hurts When I Breathe, Up, Forever and Always, When You Kiss Me. Shania is now a full fledged pop star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I wasn't sure at first-it's so different (in some ways) from her other songs. But I love it-I really like the first track-Up! and In My Car I'll be the Driver, \\"Gonna Getcha\\" and Nah! and When I Breathe, etc., Juanita is really good too. And Love Has A Way, I'm Not in the Mood-Waiter, Bring Me Water!-And When you Kiss me. Her music just lifts me up. I really never listened to much country except for Hank Jr. and a few others, till Shania came along with \\"Any Man of Mine\\". I've been waiting for this new CD and it's worth it-I have the cd and the tape for when I go walking. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant marketing and songs","review":"Shania Twain is still country pop's reigning queen (Faith's last album puts her more in the country category than pop anymore). Her smooth, warm and soulful singing abilities are still in fine form on Up! and the songs (despite a five year hiatus) still sound as fresh and engaging as anything before she took that extended break in my opinion. The clever marketing to include both pop and country discs of the same song sets is brilliant since Twain is known for being able to pull off both genres. Highlights are title track \\"Up,\\" \\"I'm Gonna Getcha,\\" \\"It Only Hurts,\\" \\"C'est,\\" \\"Nah,\\" \\"KaChing,\\" \\"Thank You,\\" \\"Waiter\\" and \\"What a Way.\\" Impressive and likable. With this album Shania is only going up from here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy!!!!!","review":"If you like your pop highly digitalized, something like a female Def Leppard, this is your CD!! 38 songs, almost two-and-a-half hours long, with a separate CD for country and pop versions of the songs (not to mention an Eastern-influenced one for international markets), killer pop songs: Shania knows how to cater to her audience. Not only that, she loves the exclamation point!! 9 songs on this 19-track album use 10 exclamation points. That's a lot!! Good fun, you won't regret it tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Thumbs Up!","review":"Shania rocks on this album. I'm not a country fan nor do I care what the critics think. I love top 40 pop music. She always has the best catchy hooks to all her songs......and you know it ;) All the album songs are fun. The best ones are:-Forever and For Always-Nah!-(Wanna Get To Know You) That Good!-C'est La Vie-I'm JealousThe only annoying track is that Juinita (?) song, it's so damn annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shanias BEST work ever!","review":"This Cd give me inspiration and makes me want to play the whole cd over and over again just to hear the meaninful words come out of her lyrics! it has the best songs for excample the song \\"shes not just a pretty face\\" was the best song ever written and i play it over and over cause it tells a message to wowmen everywhere that beuty isnt everything streagth is a very big part of it. her songs still have that great beat that u cant help but dance all night to. usally in every cd there is a song that u have to change it everytime because it is such a boring song but this cd has not one. i got it for my birthday and it was the best present i have ever got!thank you shanialuvdeanna"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania rocks!","review":"I wasn't sure what I was going to think of this album. I had heard Shania's crossover hits, and they were very good. But a whole album? Let's see. Apparently the CD version of this album was a two-disc set, one disc with pop versions of the 19 songs, and the other with country versions. Since I bought the DVD-Audio version, which contains the pop versions, I couldn't compare the pop and country. But I didn't care. I got caught up in some great sounds. Shania can sing for me anytime. I was less blown away by the sonics. DVD-Audio is capable of a very wide dynamic range. (For you non-audiophiles out there, that's the ratio between the softest and loudest sounds.) While the surround mix, as done by Mike Shipley, was first-rate, the sound seemed constricted. This is definitely not the album to use to show off a great surround system."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star for being catchy...","review":"but catchy only because the same synthesized drum hooks are used in every song - i will give her kudos for including pop and country takes on each song, but what good does that really do? they all still sound the exact same! what happened to the pop/country tinged catchiness of *come on over*? for my money that is the better cd when discussing pop cross-over ability.i did miss shania - i think she puts out fun music - but this CD is a disappointment -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak beats","review":"Although most of the reviews I've read on this CD are overwhelmingly positive, I was really disappointed. Besides the first single \\"I'm gonna getcha good\\" and the ballad \\"it only hurts when I'm breathing\\", there is not much that could be expected to get airplay. I don't mind the fact that her lyrics lack substance, but they don't have the rhythms and arrangements to make up for it either. Some of the songs, especially \\"she's not just a pretty face\\" just plain hurt to listen to they're so bad. Whatever you do, don't expect anything close to her last CD, which had plenty of material to get stuck in your head for days. Go buy Faith Hill's Cry instead, which is one of the best CD's of the year out of the twenty something I've bought this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...just terrible","review":"Shania deserves respect for what she has brought to country music - making it accessible to so many who otherwise would have passed it over. She has had a profound effect on a segment of the music industry that is very resistant to change.Her talent is real, she's not just a babe who sings. Involved in all aspects of the music-making process from start to finish -writing, singing, playing, etc, she brings a unique quality to her work. To top it off, she is warm and friendly, and her down-to-earth demeanour doesn't appear to be put-on.But this album is c.r.a.p.Overproduced, whiny-voiced, badly arranged, no depth whatsoever.Sounds like a girl and a synthesizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Don't Impress Me Much","review":"This is a case of a beautiful,energetic,and talented performer with a very mediocre album. Some of the songs are very catchy and have a good beat but there is little substance here.

I only give 5 stars to albums that have all good songs. This is a unique album with lots of great music and originality. I got to admit that I had to listen to this album three times to finally and thoroughly enjoy it. Give it a chance and you too will agree. Get ready... because you'll be hearing more of this album in 2003 and it's only going to get bigger and bigger as it hits the airwaves, like her previous album Come on Over. My favorites are:I'm Gonna Getcha Good! - upbeat, great video (check it out on cmt.com)Forever And For Always - easy tempo, good flow, lyrics are catchy(Wanna Get To Know You) That Good! - my favorite (it's a must)I'm Jealous - sexy, sensualThank You Baby! - thank you shania/mutt for making this albumI'm Not In The Mood (To Say No!)- upbeat, funIt Only Hurts When I'm Breathing - mellow yet deepI Ain't Goin' Down - positive, easy"},{"rating":"1","title":"We waited 5 years for this","review":"I expected a lot more from Shania with her talents.

With 19 total tracks, Shania gives the listener plenty of music to listen to.This is album includes two disc, a red disc and a green disc. The red disc includes the more rock influenced versions of the album tracks. I think that this disc will probably appeal more to her Pop crowd. The Green disc is basically the country mixes of the album tracks. These mixes are more acostic sounding than those on the red disc. Also (not included) is a collection of blue mixes that can be downloaded for free on her website. Personally I don't like the Blue miexes but I'm sure they will appeal to others.All in all this disc is a must buy. There is something there for everyone. You won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Pop...More Fun...from the country Diva!","review":"Shania Twain's new album \\"Up\\" is a very satisfactory come-back after the incredible success of her previous album \\"Come on over\\". I think there are more catchy tracks other than the 1st single \\"I'm gonna getcha good\\".

That said, if it were a DVD there may be some redeeeming value to this music. However, with endless songs sounding the same in both the country and pop versions, this CD is an absolute bomb. Why the two stars?? My wife loves Shania Twain, and in deference to her taste I recognize this album must in some way be better than I think it is. However, 2 stars is twice the rating that I think it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up!

It's really a continuation of come on over. With l9 songs plus a second c.d of the same songs rerecorded.

A must have unique c.d."},{"rating":"1","title":"This babe is achingly HOT ..........","review":"but where would she be without her looks? Her previous music was hardly country, but only the lame country audiences could bear to listen to her music. The \\"country versions\\" here do sound more like country - pretty gross. At least it's more tolerable than some wimpy, whiney country dude bellowing in some hick voice. Don't people who sing in country accents realize they sound uneducated? The \\"pop\\" stuff is even more gross. Yes, I actually did listen to this album (as much as I could tolerate).What's the deal with the title \\"UP,\\" the third major album with that title in just a few years? R.E.M. got it first and that should've been the end of it. Peter Gabriel recently released his \\"Up,\\" (and it hardly fits the music) but he has some silly need to name his albums with two letter words and choices are limited.

Mutt just so happens to also be Shania's husband at the time and now x husband. I guess with high expectations to top themselves Mutt & Shania just didn't make UP! a winner. Instead it just seems like every song is trying so hard to be something and falls short. She tries so hard to create pop perfection and it just doesn't work. This album is nothing compared to \\"Come On Over\\" and i can see why she hasn't done an album since this mess fest. With her pending divorce i doubt Shania will ever be on top the way she was before. Her husband is beyond talented as a musical artist and without that marriage or union i doubt she will be able to find another hit maker to churn out the hits for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately Up!","review":"I had few expectations, especially when cds lately have two or three okay songs and the rest are fillers. Shania lives up to her title with both fast and slow songs which I've been listening over and over again since the cd purchase. I've even given it as a b-day gift lately. Love it. Love it. Love it. I wish more cds were as listenable and generous- 19 songs with remixes. How can you loose. Shania, you rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania surely gets you good!!!!","review":"It is very peculiar when an artist acquiers the awareness of people from every age. Shania Twain's music indesputably contains that little something, specifically this album \\"Up!\\", that encloses numerous songs that will persuade people of all ages. With it's beguiling melodies, brilliant lyrics, and excellent beats, this album undeniably it's her best. Shania Twain is an artist packed with such talent, and with the help of her husband, they both make what could be the best music in this generation, and in more than one style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmick City","review":"I asked for this album for Christmas last year and I am so dissapointed that I got it! There are a few good songs, yes, but, the whole 2 sets of every song is a crock! They are exactly the same vocals and arranged music with the exeption of the electric guitar on the red disc and the steel guitar on the green one. So much for spreading her wings. If you like Shania, buy come on over and burn a few songs off this one from a friend who got suckered into buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ever!!","review":"After COO I wondered if Shania and Mutt could pull off another winner and sure enough they have with UP!. 19 Awesome tracks, starting with the title track which is a great little number although would have been nice if it was a bit longer. The rest of the 18 songs all make you either want to get up and dance or sing (or both). The words maybe \\"simple\\" but that makes this album more enjoyable for all ages (and easier to learn) oh and not too mention FUN!!If your expecting to hear COO again well you wont (aside from IGGG).So if your 1 or 100 I highly recommend you check this album out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it time!","review":"I've got to say, this is a great album. Come on Over was huge, but I believe this album has everything that Come on over had, and more. The emotion in Shania's voice is moving, and far better than on \\"COO\\" Don't let the nay sayers put bad thoughts in your head...they'll come around sooner or later. The hype for this album was so huge that everyone was expecting something different than what they got. Which is normal when you wait this long for new music. The fact of the matter is, you have to give it time. You might be one of those who just pops it in and likes it from the first listen, or it might take you a few. Either way. Buy it, pop it in...and if you still don't like it, I suggest going to the doctor, there's something wrong with you. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it!","review":"I like Up much better than Come On Over. I thought Come On Over was very overrated. A Woman in Me was brilliant. Up is a cross between the two. It is a bit overdone at times but for the most part I have enjoyed it. It will definitely be a huge success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent new Twain album","review":"Though the lyrics are a little simple, Twain writes them along side of her husband Mutt. I have to give her credit for that, because knowing country music that is very unlikely for an artist to write their own words. The two CD package is a good touch, but the country one definetly shows more of Shania's talent, both vocally and musically. Having very little change from her last album, this one is still good. Well done, I rate 5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful album","review":"This was one of the best cd's todate. Shania Twain put a lot of time and effort into this cd and it shows!!

The two version of the CD packaged together are a good deal, but I wish the matial was stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD but...","review":"This CD was good, but I don't like it as well as Come On Over. This one if definitly more experimental in the flavor of the Music. Mutt Lange (her husband/producer) has stated he won't produce anyone but her anymore. I find that a waste. He is so talented and he can take talent, such as Shania's, and escalate it. He needs to work with other bands again and then come back to her and produce her next CD. Anyway, this CD is toned down a lot from Come on over, it's good, but it's not something you listen to in the car to keep you awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suzie's favorites","review":"When I put the cd in my cd player, I started to listen to the whole entire tracks on the cd. Hearing every song on the tracks is that they are very upbeat, energizing, and a best selection ofdifferent rhythms. This cd has two discs when you put it in your cd player the green one and the red one in the cd player you put it on random you get a best selective mix-I really do get a kick out of it all the time. There is one song on that cd I really get a kick out of that makes you get down on the floor to do abworkouts is \\"What A Way To Wanna Be\\"! I put that on repeat to play it over and over again when I do ab workouts. All the songson every track I give a score-35-I recommend this cd to everybody out there who are a big Shania Twain fan like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite disappointed","review":"There are about four songs that are good. The rest seem to sit there like a bump on a log. The songs seem to have no direction...Up certainly isn't one of them.

I just didn't think the material was very strong.SpidrVII"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun album, and you get 2 for 1!!","review":"You get the country version of all her new songs, as well as a separate CD with the pop version of each song. I like the pop versions better, more upbeat, etc. Some great, unexpected songs, especially if you listen to the whole album. My favorite songs so far are \\"She's Not Just A Pretty Face\\" and \\"Forever And For Always\\", but there are only a couple out of 19 (or 38 if you count both albums) that don't get ya listening or tapping your foot, that is if you're not singing along in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shania\`s Back !","review":"What a great cd and to offer two versions of the cd you get a country vibe and a pop vibe ( 2 cd set)she sounds great and so do her songs..i liked every song on this album the most catchy one i really liked was NAH.definetly worth getting to add to you collection, you cant go wrong with this cd.i highly recommend this cd for anyone you wont be dissapointed!it was worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is not good","review":"I used to be a huge fan of Shania, but this cd absolutely blows. I can't figure out why everyone seems to like it so much. Every song sounds the same, and her voice sounds much more nasal than it used to. The songs are all extremely annoying, and the lyrics are the worst lyrics I've ever heard. Why does her shirt that she wears for the cover and liner notes have holes all over it? And why are her hands behind her head in every photograph? Her music has gone way down hill. This is one of the worst cds i've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":".......","review":"What exactly is it that makes people like Shania Twain? Is it the anti-male lyrics('That Don't Impress Me Much'), the double standards ('Any Man of Mine') or the hypocrisy ('What a Way To Wanna Be')? I have listened to Shania's \\"music\\" since 1997(because her producer husband has enough money to get her gobs of radio airplay), and I have craved insulin shots ever since then. Well, Rolling Stone's cover had the heading 'Shania Knows What You Want', but it should have been titled: \\"Shania's Producer Husband Knows What You Want\\".

If you have not heard this early version of Miles' 1960's Quintet (with Sam Rivers on Saxophone instead of Wayne Shorter) this is a must have.Rivers attacks everything with a feverish intensity that borders on Avant Garde sound makers like Pharoah Sanders and Albert Ayler (while nowhere near that \\"out\\") and nearly steals the show. Miles, Hancock and especially Tony Williams are also in fiery form throughout. Even if you have \\"My Funny Valentine\\" or Plugged Nickel highlights, this comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple concept: Works great","review":"Like a mixer blade used in the kitchen this simple stirring rod beats hand mixing paint with the traditional wooden stick.

Her best songs limn the Hollywood ennui that's her lot in life as a product of the L.A. celebrity crash'n'burn. She came up through the ranks, triumphed, and has no intention of sliding back down. On C'mon, C'mon she trades the depth of The Globe Sessions for a sunny surface that's catchy yet ultimately empty. Let's give her credit though - going through a rough patch in her life, she refused to wallow in her misery, hoping to transform it by immersing in the uptempo. Rock and rollers have kept the blues away for years by confronting them with fierce music that, by its very nature, refuses to settle for depression. But forcing happiness usually leaves you with whimsy, leaden whimsy. And these 13 tracks fall straight from the top of the Hollywood sign with a thud."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Imitation","review":"Ms.Crowe is nothing more than an imitator and opportunist. She hitches a ride on any train that will offer her fame. Never has this been more obvious than on this CD. She stole the title from Mary Chapin Carpenter's far superior effort. Even this CD's artwork is nearly identical to k.d.lang's Invincible Summer, another far superior effort. And I am not even addressing the recycled pop hooks littered throughout. People may be buying into this, but it is time they saw her and her music for what it is and is not. Her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Summertime Rock/Pop","review":"Brilliant,just Brilliant.

Her true talent lay in folk & blues songwriting, for which her voice is uniquely suited.This album... this album was written by a completely different woman, and it sounds like it was written hurriedly to satisfy a contract obligation. There's no real soul in this album. Following up with that horrid Kid Rock duet didn't restore my faith in her any, either.If you want to know the real Sheryl Crow, get \\"Tuesday Night Music Club,\\" \\"Sheryl Crow,\\" or \\"The Globe Sessions.\\" They're infinitely better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crow's Best Yet","review":"Ever since I first heard \\"Tuesday Night Music Club\\", I've been a huge fan of Crow's. I have every single of her albums and they were worth every penny.\\"C'mon C'mon\\", her fifth album, is no exception. From the hard-hitting \\"You're An Original\\", to the wistful angst of \\"It's Only Love\\" to the catchy pop tune of \\"Soak Up the Sun\\", Crow has yet another winner.

Crow can't even perform these songs live--her incredibly lame appearance on \\"Late Night with Carson Daly\\" proved she can't even reach the notes on her own tunes (Crow sings flat live CONSTANTLY). Crow isn't much of an artist anymore, and she's desperately trying to cling on to her celebrity. What a shame...it's like watching your grandfather fall down a flight of stairs--you can't stop it, but you knew in your heart it was inevitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon C'mon","review":"The title says it all. A lousy album. Sheryl Crow is a poor songwriter and even a worse singer. She has no deph, no originality and her vocal range is bad. The songs on this album are so american ( No offense).

A weak album from a misguided person!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cd","review":"I have been a fan of Sheryl Crow's since Tuesday Night Music Club. I don't think \\"C'mon C'mon\\" is as strong lyrically or musically as previous records. On her previous cds, her lyrics were serious, smart, refreshing and heartbreaking. It seems with \\"C'mon C'mon\\" the approach was to a breezy and fun rock record. But what is wrong with that? I say nothing! There are some good songs on this cd. My favorite songs on the cd are: Steve McQueen, Soak up the Sun, C'mon, C'mon, It's Only Love, Safe and Sound and Diamond Road. The guest vocals are great because they mostly sing on the chorus with Sheryl. I don't like it when a cd is filled with guest vocalists and you don't get to hear the person that you bought the cd for. The only song I could have done without is the Don Henley colloboration - It's So Easy - a bad easy listening tune.She is one of the most talented singer-songwriters today. Keep rocking Sheryl! There aren't many of you out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter crap","review":"I've been a longtime fan of Sheryl Crow.....but this CD is much like her very first demo album (which was never released, but can be found in bootleg and online)---it is hackneyed mainstream pop. There's no lyrical or musical complexity here. It might be a little catchy in places, but it seems that Crow is just aching for a \\"hit\\".....not art. I was so happy to hear she had a new album out, and really bummed when I heard it. I think this will win her some fans that hated her last few albums (and maybe loved \\"All I Wanna Do.\\" But the truth is, this just doesn't seem like the \\"real\\" Sheryl Crow......it's just mainstream pandering. At least I hope that's all it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened after the first two tracks???","review":"I've always been a fan of Sheryl Crow's, so when I heard her new single, I just had to buy the CD. I was feeling rather happy with my choice when listening to the upbeat \\"Steve McQueen\\" and \\"Soak up the Sun\\" as the first two tracks... but after that I was left wondering what would make Sheryl record such a lethargic and depressing CD. I'm sorry, but not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What have you people been smoking?","review":"I don't know what most of these reviewers have been smoking, but this album is, by far, the least compelling of Sheryl Crow's studio albums. Just go back and listen to \\"Sheryl Crow\\" or \\"The Globe Sessions.\\" The differences are stark and obvious. I hope she snaps out of it with her next album. Hey Sheryl, lose all of the guest vocalists and get back to the gutsy writing of the previous two albums. As far as I am concerned, this album is fluff. Use it as a ninja frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly Disappointing","review":"This album has been referred to as the sunnier counterpart to Crow's moodier epynomous second album, but _C'mon C'mon_ falls so short that no comparision can even be made. Frankly, it would be difficult to call _C'mon C'mon_ an album at all; it is filled with episodic duets ( with Lenny Kravitz, Stevie Nicks, Don Henley, etc) that showcase more Crow's popularity among her peers than any of the musical gusto she projected on her previous albums. Indeed, Crow sounds like a guest musician on her own tribute album: her trademark irony has been replaced with inane and frustrating lyrics. Admittingly, Crow's albums have never been consummate masterpieces, this can be easily excused, but this album is beyond all condonation. I cannot warn more strongly against the purchase of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl Crow's Soothing songs...","review":"I think she is very talented in playing the guitar and adding her voice makes it great.Her songs lift you up and can relax you also.Since I'm a man I enjoy women singing like her.I like also being able to read the lyrics included in the CD for each song.With her being famous I'd like to be listed as a grateful fan.Hopefully I'll be able to see and hear her at a live concert.I've enjoyed her woman friend's voice and singing for many years(Stevie Nicks).Sheryl Crow has a special blend of music.Rock-n-roll with a country smoothness with a touch of Pop music.I'm very happy I bought this CD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crow rocks!!!!!!!","review":"Sheryl Crow's albums have always been good. With each title released it seems the music gets better and better. After the release of \\"The Globe Sessions\\", the seeming pinnacle of her career, an album nominated for \\"Album of the Year\\" at the Grammys, one could not possibly imagine how to follow that up. Along comes \\"C'mon C'mon\\". Starting the album off with the blazing \\"Steve McQueen\\" and the infectious \\"Soak Up the Sun\\", the album hooks listeners into a soundtrack for the perfect road trip through America. From the grinding hook of \\"You're an Original\\", and the blistering guitars of \\"Lucky Kid\\", Sheryl Crow proves she can still rock with the best of 'em after 40. On the lighter side, the touching \\"Safe and Sound\\", the tender ballad \\"It's So Easy\\", and the hook infested title track further heralds Sheryl's reputation as one of the most prolific singer-songwriters of rock-n-roll. All in all, Crow rocks!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This might not be Sheryl Crow's best album but it features some of her best tracks.Safe And Sound I think is her best song yet, the eeirly dark yet hopeful melody on top of her desperate vocals on that track is just flat out amazing.Soak up the sun, you can't get much more out of a feel good track then this.And the album closer, Weather Channel leaves you with another lo-fi sounding track.I think Sheryl Crow is at her best on the minor key, darker tracks, and there aren't a whole lot of them on this album, but the ones that are there are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon this thing is embarassing","review":"C'mon...C'mon... already. This album is too long, too slow, has too many ballads and too many dang string arrangements. I consider myself a Sheryl Crow fan and believe her previous albums are wonderful, even brilliant. But this thing has to be the smarmiest album I've bought/listened to in years. It's both rythmically and lyrically uninteresting. Too bad. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Sheryl Crow album with 1 or 2 good songs on it","review":"\\"Steve McQueen\\" rocks... the rest of the album? ... I'd buy that single and wait for her Greatest Hits album to come out. Or better yet download her best songs. Soak Up The Sun is okay but the lyrics are sophmoric, \\"I've got noone to blame and everytime I feel lame I'm looking up.\\" ... And give us some more exciting people to collaborate with- Stevie Nicks sounds like a billy goat and she has turned Kid Rock into a pansy. \\"Steve McQueen\\" however- is Crow at her best. ... At one point thugh she vocalizes her obsession with her fear of being 40 and having to compete with sexy sassy 21 year old singers, i.e. \\"We've got rock stars in the white house and all our pop stars look like porn\\". [...] But still thanks to that song I didn't feel like a total fool for buying this album- that one line kind of ruins it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid fad of the 90's Lives On","review":"The aqua net hair bands of the 80's died swiftly when the 90's hit; not so with the \\"anti-hair bands\\" of the 90's. The legions of un-glamorous lead singers strumming acoustic guitars are alive and well.Indeed, Sheryl Crowe is the embodiment of that 1990's stereotype; her music encourages people to enjoy the \\"simple life,\\" though she prefers the life of a multimillionaire.Yes, the classic hypocrosy that defined music of the 1990's is coming through loud and clear in Crowe's latest album. Crowe has a \\"communist friend\\" whose gas she can't afford. She sells millions of records but can't put gas in her car, see. She loves her impoverished way of life, and ecourages us to love it too.She preaches to us, saying \\"It's not getting what you want/ It's wanting what you've got.\\" Apparently Ms. Crowe thinks that complacency is the answer. Is that how you got your multimillion dollar record deal, Cheryl?"},{"rating":"1","title":"c'mon.........","review":"only one good song on this whole cd, dont waste your time with this one, sorry sheryl but u need some betta songs on it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawns Abound","review":"Sheryl Crow is one of the most renowned popular singer/songwriters around. I have never really enjoyed any of her previous work, but I gave this one an unbiased fair shot.It's cotton candy. There are some really catch tunes here: 'Soak Up the Sun,' 'Steve Mcqueen,' 'You're an Original.' The problem is that this very little musical or lyrical substance to any of it.Crow is indicative of what the mainstream music industry has become. She churns out an album every few years and feigns to know what it's like to be an ordinary joe on the street in her pseudo-confessional style. She may not be ordinary but this music sure is."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to her voice!","review":"There was a day when Sheryl Crow could belt out Rhiannon and Rock On Golden Woman real good or even that freedom song from the white album. I liked her when she recorded the Sunset song. something about being in california if i remember clearly. But now all of a sudden she's putting on ears and leaves her gravelly voice behind. Now she's pretending to be a pop singer, it's just not sounding good at all, in britney style. she used to sing out rock song now she's into Britney style song. and her voice change. i feel betrayed cuz she didn't keep it real. voices carry from til tuesday was her best album. but that's just my opinion. hope this helps :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"SOAK UP SOME RAYS","review":"WITH THE RELEASE OF THE SINGLE SOAK UP THE SUN CROW HAS INSUREDHERSELF A PLACE IN THE TOP TEN \\"SUMMER SONGS\\" OF ALL TIME.ITS MAYBE BECAUSE I LIVE IN KAUAI THAT I DIG THIS SONG SO MUCH,BUT HEY,GET THE MESSAGE!CROW IS ON A LEVEL AS #1 FEMALE ROCKERIN MY BOOK.SO ROCK ON CHERYL!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy!","review":"I have played this CD in my car continuously for weeks! I'm surprised I haven't worn it out yet. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best, but still what I'm looking for","review":"My favorite Sheryl Crow record, without question, is her eponymous title of a few years ago, wherein she indulged in Liz Phair-style whimsy like \\"Maybe Angels.\\"That sort of spirit -- as well as Phair herself -- shows up at times on this new album, but for the most part, \\"C'mon, C'mon\\" feels like a somewhat downbeat party to which Crow has invited her all-star friends. For the most part, they blend in invisibly with Crow and her back-up performers, and don't bring much to the party. It's nice to know Stevie Nicks is staying out of trouble, but she doesn't add much to the album, for instance.When Sheryl Crow one day assembles a greatest hits album, \\"Soak Up The Sun\\" and \\"Steve McQueen\\" will make it onto that album, but the rest of this work won't get a second look.This is a good album for ardent Crow fans, but those new to her music would be better advised to pick up her debut album or her aforementioned self-titled work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crow - C'mon C'mon","review":"Not being a Sheryl Crow fan, I was somewhat surprised when I found myself purchasing it, but I'd recently heard Steve McQueen so how could I resist? And I was pleasantly surprised - most of the album is quite good. Laden with guest vocalists, the album is a great listen. I only find fault in two areas. First, the production is such that its difficult to differentiate Crow's backing vocals from those of the many guests. Second, what's up with the Soak Up The Sun song? This has got to be one of the single dumbest, mind-numbing songs to come along in years. I'd heard it on the radio several times but never fully appreciated the depth of its stupidity. Lucky for us, the remainder of the album is much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Send It Back?","review":"If Amazon let customers return a CD merely because it stinks, I'd send this back in a New York minute. I absolutely LOVE Sheryl's other stuff, but this is like eating bubble gum for dinner compared with her earlier works. Gone are the dark songs with nothing but Sheryl's plaintive and contemplative voice. Gone is her wonderfully flippant creativity. They're replaced with overdone, overproduced made-for-radio pop. You'll love the songs the first time you hear them, and be sick of them by the third. How disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"C'MON Finds Crow Rocking Out","review":"With the exception of her sophomore effort, Sheryl Crow's records are more often that not distinguished by some strong singles('Leaving Las Vegas','My Favorite Mistake'), with the rest filled out by largely average material. C'MON C'MON finds her improving greatly on the vastly overrated THE GLOBE SESSIONS,padding the set with more hooks than any of her previous records,and rocking with abandon on many of its' tracks. First single 'Soak Up The Sun', though fairly catchy, offers up her most meaningless lyrics since 'All I Wanna Do'--Crow showcases herself to far better effect on such tracks as 'You're An Original','Hole In My Pocket', and the albums' best cut 'Lucky Kid'. Much like Stevie Nicks' recent album, Crow also brings in a ton of guest vocalists, with only Don Henley making any real mark on the sappy ballad 'It's So Easy'. Nevertheless, this stands as Crow's most consistent set next to her second effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you say \\"Album of the Year\\"?","review":"I'll leave the detailed reviews to others and just say:1. This is an Album of the Year finalist and a sure bet for winner.2. Sheryl Crow is one of the most talented and gifted musicians and songwriters on the face of the planet - period.This CD is terrific from beginning to end. Don't believe a word you read on some of these other reviews that call this album labored and uninspired. Those people are on something. Get this CD and formulate your own opinion. You will not be let down, and will in fact not take the CD out of your player for months..."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon C'mon, you can do better than this","review":"i've seen sheryl crow perform live before and she is a far more talented musician than is reflected in this record. the best track is the one you're hearing constantly on the radio, which is a catchy but far from excellent song. i had high expectations given some of the early reviews of the album and the collaborations with many artists i am fans of, but the much discussed duet with lenny falls short as do most of the other duets. i think two stars is actually generous. by way of comparison, this album pales in comparison to emmy lou harris' recent album, red dirt girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy Days...Lazy Work","review":"A true avid SC fan am I but what's this [stuff]? Sheryl has never been the most perceptive songwriter, depending more on cliches and formulas that have worked in the past, but I can't believe the mediocrity of these [stinky]songs! Safe and Sound alone is totally undecipherable \\"maybe this is forver/forever fades away like a rocket ascending into space.\\" Huh? I've read better words in high school literary magazines. This is mindless drivel and if it had been done by a lesser-known artist it would be in the dollar bins by now. The plethora of artists \\"helping out\\" is a gimmicky attempt to sell the album and make up for lack of originality; the overblown ballads are a big yawn; and she must have been pretty desperate for material to rehash \\"It's Only Love.\\" Some brigt spots - the glam rocker \\"Lucky Kid\\", the soulful \\"Weather Channel\\" and \\"You're an Original\\" the only song with a trace of Sheryl's \\"sweet sneer\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not her too!","review":"It seems like alot of bands are chaning their old styles and ways to compete for top 40 radio play and to sell more records. This album without a doubt is her most poppy yet and has taken the path so many have taken these past couple months- like No Doubt, the Cranberries, etc. the new single \\"Soak up the Sun\\" is a great example, as it is one of her most happy radio-friendly singles to come out, probably ever from her. The rest of the album is composed of simple lyrics and lack the depth of what we are used to, like from her greatest album \\"The Globe Sessions\\". The rest of the album just sounds like pop pap... overall i was waiting for this record because we have come to set the bar high for miss Sheryl Crow- and she just turned 40 but she isnt really acting her age in the music. This sounds like a debut record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soak up... a different album","review":"When I bought this CD, I was a big fan of \\"Soak Up the Sun\\". But after listening to it twice, it got boring. All of the songs on this CD are way too sugary. Sheryl is trying to get her popularity back by trying to become Britney Spears."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit album","review":"I bought this album due to the song \\"Soak up the sun\\".

She is obviously having fun with this one especially with last summer's anthem, \\"Soak Up The Sun\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Tha?","review":"That's what I said when I listened to the whole cd. Now, \\"Soak Up the Sun\\" is cute, granted. It's got the hit formula down. \\"Steve McQueen\\" hits the mark, but the rest - C'MON, Sheryl. I actually had to get out the old stuff and listen to remember why I like this girl. Yes, she is good, but this collection is not her best - it's formula pop and to me, that is the death knell. I owned this one - notice I say \\"owned.\\" I gave it away after I heard the line, \\"You're an original, Baby,\\" once too many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, Prevalent, Rhythmic Flows","review":"C'mon,C'mon is a well-paced, well-played release from Sheryl Crow. The tracks, for the most part, are strong and reveal that Ms. Crow still has what it takes to create and display top-notch showmanship. Steve McQueen, Soak Up the Sun, and Over You are arguably the dominant songs in this CD.An all-around, entertaining piece, C'mon,C'mon is, I have found, quite compatible with my workouts, especially if the upcoming task is several minutes on a treadmill or some cross-trainer machine. Along with the aforementioned songs, Lucky Kid is a bouncy number that creates a perk, and it fares quite well in comparison to those compiled exercise CD's.As a quick summary note, if you like the Corrs, then their imported Best Of collection pairs up quite nicely with this Sheryl Crow masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable","review":"Sheryl Crow is a truly reliable performer in today's music scene and C'mon C'mon i certainly no exception. The recording consists of energetic rockers and soothing ballads. The leadoff track Steve McQueen is probably the strongest track as it brims with energy and atittude. Soak Up The Sun was the first single and certainly has some catchy lyrics. However its overplay on the radio has certainly not made it one of my favorite tracks. I tend to prefer touching tracks like Diamond Road as well as Safe and Sound as well as the edgy Lucky Kid.Sherly Crow utilizes the talents of Lenny Kravitz, The Dixie Chicks, and Don Henley to optimum success on this puppy. I also appreciate the balance between rockers and ballads and even the little dynamics that exist on many of the tracks.Not quite on the same level as Sheryl's 2nd CD but still a good addition to most CD collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving into a new direction","review":"Sheryl Crow in her previous albums had moved in an acoustic and almost Dylan type mode.This CD she is moving into more of a commercial Rock mode.Steve McQueen is a Rocker that is high energy and gets you in a Rock mood.Soak up the Sun to date is in my opinion her most commercial effort ever. I almost get the feeling it is something Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys would write.She does a duet with Stevie Nicks that is the title song for the CD entitled, C'mon, C'mon.Abilene is a nice ballad, and shows her country side. Weather Channel is another song of note.This is a departure from her previous albums and is her most commercial. There are some good songs and it is worth the listen"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money!","review":"What a waste of money! sheryl has always been one of my favorate female singer, for many reasons. the main resaon is that she is a hot chick who plays gautar and does not sing fluffy pop hits. As for this cd in my mind its all fluffy pop hits geared to geting a younger people to buy it. only thing I liked was the video for \\"soak up the sun\\" but the song lyrics need work really bad. the other song people seem to like is \\"Steve Mcqueen\\" but it is very forgetable just like the song on the cd. dont buy this buy the 93 release \\"Tuesday Night Music Club\\" its a way better cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheryl Crow Does it Again!","review":"Sheryl Crow has had successes with Tuesday Night Music Club, her self-titled record, Sheryl Crow, and The Globe Sessions, but this time it is even better.

Most of the songs will leave you thinking \\"Haven't I heard this song before?\\" (especially \\"Diamond Road\\" and \\"It's So Easy\\") and there's a preponderance of \\"Love-hurts-so-get-drunk-and-cry-in-your-drink\\" kinda songs (ESPECIALLY \\"C'mon C'mon\\" , \\"It's So Easy\\" and \\"Over You\\") that lack both the edge and depth of Crow's previous work. NOW we understand why after this album she decided to take a break from making music. That said, there are still some tracks that are up to her usual standard. I recomend downloading \\"Safe and Sound\\", \\"Lucky Kid\\" and \\"Steve McQueen\\"... proof that while Sheryl may have missed the mark with this album, she's still got what it takes, somewhere in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunshine Lobotomy","review":"I LLLLLLLUUUUUUUUVVVVVV Sheryl Crow...I Detest this album.She seems to have completely relinquished her depth, articulation, irony, and artistry to release a mediocre collection of rushed fillers.

She can, and has altered mind-sets and points of view, raised politcal and social awareness, and asked the world to take a look in the proverbial pond reflection, smoke a cig and laugh. NOW it's a bunch of subjective self centered incoherent babble that is not worthy of a true Crow fan's hard earned duckets. This album is in short Dry, lazy, and flamboyantly uninspired. For once this lyrical genious has ABSOLUTELY NOTHIN' TO SAY! No wonder 3 of the only attempted songs are at the very beginning...This is a mid-life crisis set to music!...

The only songs I find good are (in order of \\"goodness\\") Steve Mcqueen, Soak Up The Sun, Diamond Road, and Safe And Sound. The rest of the album is so blah and mediocre it is painful to sit through. Her 2nd is definitely her best effort and this one is behind her first album which I thought could have been a little more crafted better. Anyway, there is always the future for Sheryl to redeem her music and talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for Me","review":"Sheryl gives us another really good work, it is worth having in your collection. She never seems to be far from the top with her fun, delightful hooks. I don't think it hurts that she is a great, captivating performer who just has a feel many artists cannot get close to. You can tell she works hard at her craft, and this fact shows up big time on all her albums, but this one more than most. I will be interested in what she does next, but for now Cmon, Cmon...

I honestly cannot find a single track that I care to listen to more than one time on this album withthe exception of the song \\"Soak in the Sun.\\" And this song is not at all representative of the musical style of the rest of thealbum. The songs are not catchy on this one nor are they memorable. Her new style is just not fun. Her mood and lyrics are melancholy. This album may be for you if you are into thesound of the classic rock and roll era. You might consider getting this album then. However, I think that you ought to listen to this album before you go out and buy it because it is very different in style than her previous work.

Musashi describes the five Ways of swordsmanship, as being essential to the good Samurai. It is both amusing and fascinating to realize, modern day business owners rely heavily on the wisdom of a man who wrote this over 400 years ago. But, I suppose that just proves it truly is wisdom, that will last. Though this book may seem strange to those, who haven't read it, you learn stuff from it, after a while. So, it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic of military theory","review":"Musashi's treatise on combat is, in many places, a rather dry recitation on footwork. But it is also, in many places, a thoughtful critique of traditions that serve no practical purpose in real life, and the need to experiment, to learn, and to embrace those ideas or skills that allow you to truly succeed in real life. Not the most engaging or accessible text, but very interesting and fairly short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nahhh!","review":"I studied martial arts when I was younger, karate to be exact, and at times you had to really reach to get into the Zen of the discipline. As a Christian American, you would need to study at length to fully grasp the nuances. This book is interesting on one level, however one dimentional. The most difficult aspect of this book is it's extremely vague and, at times, utterly bad translations that appear to make no sense at all. What's worse is that the author apparently expects you to except it anyway! Can I get a proofreader? Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evergreen Classic","review":"World around has changed but the way people think seems be very similar.

I decided to buy my own copy due to the excellent material presented within.This copy however is overall poorly translated, and very badly written.Many sentences make no grammatical sense, the translator chose a lot of English words that do not do justice to the piece, every page has at least one obvious spelling mistake.Overall a very poor job from whomever was entrusted with making an English version of this book. Had I not already read a far superior version I would have been stuck trying to piece words together and figure out what the h**l is going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep book","review":"This is a deep book - not one that you can sit down and read straight through and get right to the point -- each of the strategies deserves its own session and a great deal of thought. I've now gone through the book several times and feel like I'm just beginning to grasp the applicability of certain pieces. Even read out of context, such as with business in mind, it is useful. I also highly recommend 'Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom' by Taro Gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strategic Thoughts Applicable to Your Life","review":"As I read the first twenty pages, I couldn't help but to say,\\"Whooah?\\"And because martial arts principles are valuable to me, I expected something new about life principles.What I found is that this book requires a deep and unique level of thinking how ways of the sword can apply to all aspects of ones life.While this isn't a book that I'd advise someone to rush to buy, to enchance their life, it is a resource to guide the reader to slowly evolve in ways that become truly part of their subconscious being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but deep","review":"I found the book really useful. I am a CEO of a mid-sized company and have been able to use many of the concepts covered in the book in real life.It is not a book to read cover to cover in one sitting, you should read it a little bit at a time and reflect on the content.It is helpful if you have an understanding of eastern philosophy but not necessary.The book is written by Miyamoto Musashi perhaps the most well known Samurai leader in history and is a unique opportunity to read his thoughts and strategies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting historical read, poor commentary....","review":"This book is interesting to read for it's historical merits. I would also imagine practitioners of the sword arts would find this a highly prized text.The commentary, however, could have been a lot better.

There are better sources for inspiration in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, series of events without the emotion","review":"I am reading many books with full-figured heroines and stumbled across this book.It is a dull and dry telling of a series of events.

There was very little description, and what there was was fery perfunctory and dry. The conversations were formal, using no slang or idioms, in other words not the way people talk. You are never given a clear idea of what the heroine looks like. Since she's hung up on her weight, it's kind of germaine to the plot! Is she a size 12 or a size 20? I wanted to know! There is a pretty laughable drug smuggling plot point, and no one seems to have a cell phone, much less a computer. The story seems to have a contempory setting, so some technology would be expected. The hero loves the heroine, but why? Just because of the way she looks? This is a very simple, VERY chaste love story, and it would be suitable for those who don't want sex in their stories, young teens, or a more mature tween. I had hoped for more passion, and much more depth and character development. I doubt I'll read any more by this author.KesterGayle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Mine failed within 2 months. It failed open, but it failed.

I was unimpressed with this item. First, the screen is NOT backlit like the Cisco/Linksys manual states. I'm using it in a fairly dark area and really need the backlit display. However, the biggest problem was that I experienced one-way audio with all incoming calls. I've set up quite a few SIP phones and am quite familiar with the \\"one-way audio problem\\" as it relates to NAT (network address translation). However, all of my test calls were on a local network. No NAT was involved. I have several SIP hard phones and soft phones installed with no one-way audio problems at all.

Her lyrics are solid and the music is wonderful yet the union does not illuminate the soul as her previous work has done. Her pinnacle work was indeed Love Deluxe. That album exceeded all expecations. Her songs contained the same amount of sadness as her present work yet they stirred the listener and revealed a sense of hope.Lover's rock does have memorable cuts, All about our love, The king of sorrow, and The Sweetest Gift. However, some tracks are too drum and base heavy and drown out the lyrics.The live cd will illuminate the listener as to what the current songs lack. The fire and passion has fizzled and her heartache overwhelms the material. The songs lulled me yet they had no direction. Her voice is beautiful, the instrumentation is excellent but overall this cd is not is memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Disappointing","review":"I guess I should've known better than to think after 8 years, Sade would not change her sound, but....I found Lover's Rock quite disappointing. I've gotten used to the tunes after hearing the CD several times, and it is now tolerable. But comparing it to the unforgettable jazzy and seductive songs like in \\"Promise\\", this one fails to deliver. I found some of the guitar here to be somewhat \\"choppy\\" and \\"squeaky\\", and it was almost as if I'm hearing folk music instead of smooth jazz. Although, I'm giving it more than 1 star because her voice is still undeniably excellent and above the rest. Yet, some artists need to realize that change isn't always good, and trying to \\"update\\" your sound doesn't always mean success. Sade, it's your old sound that made you an icon in the first place, and is also the reason why fans still yearn for you after all these years...so bring it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this","review":"this cd is bad i cant beleive i got this cd all the songs are so bad why did she become a singer she sucks big time sade get a beter vocie this cd is the worst cd i ever got in my hoie life so do me a faver in dont buy this cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS REALLY BAD","review":"I like Sade. I don't like this disc. There are three songs I really love. You can throw the rest of this out. Sade sounds great. The songs are bad and the accompanying music is awful. This is Sade with a drum machine. The songs don't even have enough to allow her to put them over. The first song is Country and Western Sade. Not flattering to her at all. I can't really express how bad this is. I do not compare discs to other discs the performer puts out. This disc stands on its own. It is bad music by itself. If you like Sade, don't buy this. You won't like it. She is forcing herself to sing this stuff and is very uninterested in what she is singing. I don't blame her."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad, Sade","review":"Long awaited, but not surprising. With the growing numbers of artists that have tried to re-ignite the fire that drove them to fame and fortune in the late 80's and early 90's, this effort falls far short of what we've expected from Sade.Sadly, fans have waited 8 years for this release, and not doubt they will buy it, as I did. However, the album lacks all the depth, originality and feel that has defined Sade over the past albums that were so great.Drum machines, bland melodies, and rough production have created a sad, and probably last, effort from from our lady Helen. Too bad, so sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am picky about my stars(1-5)","review":"This album deserves 5 stars but I gave it four because more songs should have been added(I think).

If you've never heard Sade, I recommend you start with one of her older ones like Love Deluxe or Promise or Diamond Life.

SADE never disappoints especially here on LOVERS ROCK.The countryish opener of \\"by you side\\" which uses hope as its core, remember hope is an agent in this world of dismay and hunger for tenderness and truth;JUST as sure as the album opens with that sheer hope it closes with the same joy and openess. Each of SADE recordings shine and shift, but here there is a distinct sound. a change to a more cohesive nod to reggae gentle and perfect in delivery and content.

BEYOND WORDS.BRAVO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why are people disappointed with this album????","review":"I have heard and own previous Sade albums and while I agree that they were better, I do not think that Lover's Rock is a bad album. In fact, I was quite pleased with Sade's latest effort. She did not use any gimmicks to appeal to a wider audience. She stuck to her original formula.On the tracks By Your Side, King Or Sorrow(my personal favorite), Every Word, Slave Song and Lover's Rock, Sade proves that she is still worth checking for. If you are a TRUE Sade fan, you will enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovers Rock is suffused with emotion and heart","review":"Lovers Rock is a seductive, beautiful and elegant album. This album draws deeply on Sade past. From the lovely \\"Lovers Rock\\" to the tribute to friendship \\"By Your Side\\". Sade proves that she still has the elegance and grace to charm the birds out of the sky. Lovers Rock is adorned with many lovely epiphanic touches. This album has so much emotion and heart. Lovers Rock is one album that you will want \\"By Your Side\\". Welcome back Sade. You are like a old friend that is nice to see again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All About Sade","review":"The one thing that I love about Sade is that her music is just about that---the music and her soulful voice.

Still the best and the symbol of smooth soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovers Theme","review":"'Float' is what describes this compilation to me. Sade moves through each track with such fluidness.

It's the kind of song that people falling in love will call their song. It's a classic! Like Sade."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree \\"The Queen of Mellow\\"","review":"She is simply the best female vocalist of our time. With all the flash in the pan vocalist that are recording now Sade is the best. We have waited a long time for this diva to hit the scene again. She has tasted sorrow and joy.

Sade adapts without changing too much on every album she makes,to the trend of the day, and the milennium hardness does not compromise the elegant, sophisticated, ubiqituosly conscious of love and social issues on this CD. \\"King Of Sorrow\\" and \\"Lovers Rock\\" are classics, progressive classics especially for Sades fans.

Also, this is great entertaining music, perfect for the guests coming over for the Holidays - during drinks (champagne,'natch).The entire disc flows nicely and \\"the 1st Lady\\" is in fine voice...it's almost as if time has stood still for her. Dispite all of the \\"clutter\\" in her life, she has put out an excellent product. In fact, it will undoubtably withstand the same test of time that \\"Love Deluxe\\" and all of her older CDs have weathered. My only (minor) complaint is that the CD is a tad short. But, to want more of Sade isn't a bad thing.....is it???Buy this disc...you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rock you'll cling to.","review":"Cook it in a small spoon and savor it.

There is hardly any variation in the style, rhythm or sound and after eleven tracks of the same I was tearing my hair out.

This will not encourage me to buy her next one, despite having a collection of three of her previous CDs.Harry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Sade is back!","review":"I bought this album over the weekend and am thoroughly pleased at how each song flows to the next.

Unfortunately, after spending a week trying to get into the new CD its not done it for me. There isn't enough strong songs on this set to really grab your attention.

I look forward to hearing the next classic Sade album, whenever that may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not Sade's most passionate music ...","review":"but it's still a good investment. I have every CD Sade ever recorded and I was excited to hear this new CD, especially after an eight-year hiatus. In Lovers Rock, it seems that Sade is singing from life experience. The songs on here are a testament to some kind of personal and spiritual transformation. Some of the passion from her earlier music seems to have dissipated in this new CD. I was somewhat disappointed that this CD is shorter than Love Deluxe and her other previous recordings---this CD is only 42 minutes. Sade still sounds beautiful and soulful but there is something missing in this new release. It's something that I cannot put into words."},{"rating":"2","title":"gift","review":"It's wonderfull when some people get toghether and make so much beautifull things. I love them.

The lyrics and melodies are dull and inane and the stripped down production cheapens the whole effort.

I've tried hard to like this CD but to no avail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical evolution becomes musical devolution","review":"In a word, yuck. With the exception of \\"Flow,\\" there is no Sade of yesteryear present on this CD. It's all an exploration of a new musical style, with that trademark yearning voice the only clue that you are listening to Sade. \\"By Your Side\\" stunned me into open-mouthed silence with its country twang; for this to be the first release is nothing short of a travesty. Next time when the group is shopping for a new sound, they would be well advised to remember that there was nothing wrong with the old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Broken Heart CD","review":"In the past, I have not been enough of a fan of Sade until I heard the song \\"By Your Side\\" on a television show.

This CD is certain to be a life time favorite of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sade's new musical direction rocks!","review":"It's more than a bit unusual that an R & B torch song princess would choose to release an album of hard rock anthems backed by the likes of Sammy Hagar, Ace Frehley and Ronnie James Dio, but that's exactly what Sade has done on \\"Lovers Rock\\", her latest outing. From the fist-pumping adrenaline rush of \\"By Your Side\\" featuring a blistering guitar solo by ex-Guns and Roses axeman Slash, to the sonic heavy metal onslaught of \\"Slave Song\\", a duet with AC/DC's Brian Johnson, Sade takes no prisoners. A nice change of pace and a bold move artistically as Sade risks alienating her long-time fan base."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I waited 8 years for this?? This CD is so depressing --- everything sounds the same. I'm so so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long wait for a major disappointment","review":"The jazzy, mesmerizing quality of Sade's voice that made her a major force in the music world was sorely missing on her latest offering. Each new song sounded pretty much the same as one previous to it. Her back up band, Sweetback lacked its usual drive and the tunes were recorded with annoying scratchy sounds of fingers sliding over guitar strings. After having waited eagerly for years for some new material, I hope she goes back to the drawing board to recapture what made her so terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"THANKS SIENNA","review":"It was time to find someone with some honesty regarding this new Sade cd. I couldn't agree more with you Sienna, this album is a HUGE disappointment. After eight years of waiting we should have had at least a good record. This is trendy, soulless, self-indulgent. All this enthusiasm about a \\"romantic\\" record: all of Sade's releases were romantic, she IS a romantic singer, she sings love. What is missing here are SONGS. The single is simply awful, neither some remixing had helped it. I haven't found ONE simple song on 11 that really delivers. I think you better buy something of her past, maybe she had to remain some other time out of the spotlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"For some one who had this much time to put out a quality CD she realy missed the boat.

For 15 years before the release of 'Lovers Rock' in 2001, I've grasped onto an iota of desperation that she will at the very least equal her enjoyable-cum-guilty pleasure debut in 1985. But all that's manifested every few years - as well as on 'Lovers Rock' - is a DOA compendium of lethargic tunes whispered in a voice so consistent in its tone-deaf monotony it's actually soporific. As usual, the band's competence is in tact, grooving along to its fullest groove, brought way down by Ms. Adu's emotionless non-voice. You wake up from slumber unperturbed; you stretch your arms in new relaxation...only to feel conned all over again. My grade: C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Going to Keep it Really Real Here","review":"I'll never forget the day that \\"Lovers Rock\\" came out.

So I go back home, put the CD in the stereo, and, let me tell you, I lost my appetite. I love all of Sade's music, but \\"Lovers Rock\\" is her most awful work ever and wasn't worth the wait. Out of the 11 songs on the CD, I only like 2: \\"All About Our Love\\" and \\"Lovers Rock.\\" Everything else is slow, dull, and pretty much sucks. I mean, you can't even jam or get into a groovy mood. It's pretty much something the Geezer Boomers would listen to. Anyway, I sold \\"Lovers Rock\\" and I don't miss it one bit. To all of you Sade fanatics, \\"Lovers Rock\\" is one CD that you wouldn't even want to add to the collection. TRUST ME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh what a voice. So smooooooooth.","review":"Sade. What a voice . So smooth. The real hit song on this CD is Track 1 By your side. Sade has a voice which is very relaxable to listen to. That\`s for sure. To listen to here is a fine cure for depression. Here voice has a certain mood over it, that realy makes you shiver in a good way. Some other trax are a mixed bag, but anyway the Cd shines quality all trough. The best thing about Sade is that she knows here roots. There are no hiss,rumble, and creative blip blop that some call music on this Cd. There are not to much tempo up beat songs on this CD, but why ? Track 4 Somebody already broke my heart is also a winner track with hit potential, with a very effective synthesier sound in the background which realy lift the musical picture all trough. There also some light reggea rythm on Track 6 Slave Song, for a change. Great song. Anyway.

But as she sings,I wouldn't want to disappoint my future eitherAlthough she is #2 on my favorite list, she is #1 for keeping it Rock Solid Real.

Her last offering before this new selection is her greatest hits collection. All fingers point toward an end of a career or change of record label once that happens. Fortunately it was neither.It is worth the wait. A definite must have if you ever loved her music.By your side is just the sweetest song, too bad she hasn't released the Ben Watt remixes.Being a Fan I guess I am biased. But then again, Who doesn't love a little pleasure after the pain. Love the album!Its still Sade only with a different edge, a rather RnB edge on certain songs where she sounds a bit hiphoppish. I am not into hip-hop but she's way hip it gets me hoppin'. Aside from that it is a great recording"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like I like R&B","review":"So I heard this Sade CD at the Equator coffee house in Passadena. They just happened to be playing it, and I loved the sound. I've never been a fan of R&B/Urban style music, but I have liked groove style electronic musics, and I think that is what helped me relate to this music. Smooth guitars, synth's, and of course her voice complement a great rythem. I love music that feels like it belongs in the modern lounge, and this hit me that way. If you need something to sit back with your lover with, or just to groove to in your own lounge, pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sade--- Lovers Rock","review":"I love Sade!! I have all her music and videos. She tells a story in all her songs and she has something good to say all the time. Her new cd Lovers Rock is another master piece of Sade. All of her tracks on this cd are great. If you are a Sade fan I would tell you to go and buy the cd and you will love it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sade.....soothes the soul","review":"Sade if you're reading this, right on baby, this album is soooooo good. Please email if you're ever in need of a keyboardist or run short of new material. Sade is smmmokin! Put on this CD and leave it all behind (by your lonesome or with your lover)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human sounds","review":"I am in agreement with most of these reviews. Sade embodies femininity, soulful sensibilities, and most of a human softness that contradicts what is popular in music today. She is truly an artist of the highest caliber. She conyinues to add music that have politically conscious undertones. I recommend her music to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcomed return","review":"After an eight-year hiatus, Sade returns with a set of mellow tracks that make you want to light a candle, pour a glass of Merlot and relax. Not only is she a timeless vocalist, she has the uncanny ability to weave within her music timely messages that are truly thought provoking.Having been a Sade fan from \\"back in the day,\\" I must say I am truly impressed with EVERY track on the CD. Each speak to a facet of \\"being\\" that is truly rewarding to experience. While other reviewers may disagree, I must remind everyone \\"the only constant is consistent change.\\" With that, Sade's latest project speaks of a level of maturation that is to be expected of an artist of her caliber.Therefore, do yourself a favor, engage your mind and senses and pick up Lovers Rock, you will be glad you partook of the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill Music","review":"I've been a heavy metal guy for years. Recently I've been listening to chill music like 311, Sylvan, Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky, and now Sade. She is so talented and chill. I just started studying for a test and put this cd on. Didn't skip a single track. Usually music takes a while to grow on me. Not this cd! Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"she has lost it....boo","review":"Anyone who has heard any of Sade's previous albums has to see that she has simply lost it. The magic is gone and replication is not working. Evolution of sound here has turned sour, and it may have had an effect on her as well. I would say that she should leave hip/trip-hop beats alone, or hire some professionals to create them. Further, the \\"dub\\" like influences here are even worse. If this were Sade's first album, I would say that she has a Promising career ahead, but we all know that this is not the case.The engineer here has no business to be in the studio and should be fired. The CD is lacking in depth and soundstage, all to all, her previous discs are sonically much more pleasant.This just seems like some forced production, either to fulfill an obligation to the record label, or just to score some cash. I would give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Listening to Paint Dry","review":"What a bummer. Long after the subtle, brilliant \\"Love Deluxe,\\" Sade returns with this lukewarm snore-fest. The percussion is barely there, and the rhythm section seems fast asleep. Two, maybe three songs have a discernable pulse, but the overall album is drowsy and mediocre. She's capable of so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Uninspired Music","review":"After being away from the music scene for eight years I quess I expected the group to return in their big, but subtle way. This CD is by far the worst Sade music I have ever heard. I do not understand the rave reviews. I am a huge Sade fan and I was very disappointed by this release. It is very stale music. As one review said \\"time stands still\\". It does, but it appears to have passed Sade by. Do not by this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Great Sleeping Music\\"","review":"Like millions os Sade fans, I eagerly awaited the arrival of Lovers Rock. I expected something familiar. I've seen Sade in concert, and loved her and the band.. Lovers Rock seems to be missing something. With artists I like, I always look for the positive elements. This disc is a snoozer-bland, blah, no groove, no punch, no inspiration. I would have settled for a few tracks with \\"any\\" beat. It appears that this disc is not very radio friendly. Whenever I hear Sade on the radio, her more upbeat music is mostly played. Maybe it was just my expectation, but I'd prefer to take a nap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good news - it's Sade's latest. Bad news - it's nothing new.","review":"I have listened to this CD for a while now. There are several tried and true slow, smooth and dreamy Sade tracks that will grow on you. But there is also a lot about this CD that sounds like the weaker cuts of her last release - Love Deluxe. If you are looking for something to take a hot bath and relax to, this is likely it. Granted, with the right company, this could be just the CD for an incredibly memorable rainy night. But if you are looking for some cool, richly produced, imaginative jazz with a nice beat and some attitude, you'll want to pass on this one.Sade has been down this road before. If you have listened to her softer, introspective ballads, you already know right where she is going to take you. As long as that is your idea of a nice destination, you won't feel like you are being taken for a ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Wait, No Reward","review":"Wow, it has been forever since we have had new work by Sade. Unfortunately, this CD disappoints severly. From any other artist this work might be worth a listen as a promise of future potential, but from Sade, it is not up to speed. The material is unbelievably poor. The selections remind one of a B side, never meant for prime time. I have played it over and over hoping for a better impression. All in all a very disappointing effort by one of the best. If you are not familiar with her work, buy Diamond Life, if you are, perhaps a better effort waits further out on the horizon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sade Never Fails","review":"This is one of my all time favorites. She is simply amazing and even though this is one of her older works it has stood the test of time. I still love it as much as when I first heard her genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sade is Back","review":"I enjoyed the music and Sade is traditional and refreshing. The beat was toe stepping. It was better than expected. I look forward to hearing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovers rock: simple R&B","review":"After checking out THE BEST OF SADE I thought I'd give LOVERS ROCK a try. As I said before, I'm not a huge Sade fan but I enjoyed her best of collection. After listening to LOVERS ROCK I was impressed. Sade is an excellent R&B singer and LOVERS ROCK is a simple, relaxing, stripped down R&B album. It's loaded with soft acoustic guitar sounds and bass heavy beats. Sade's vocals are in top form here. Her voice is still smooth and romantic as ever. The songs are simple, both lyrically and overall production."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love her","review":"Always a smooth operator, Sade has rocked my world since the early days.Saw her sing \\"By your side\\" on the Chris Rock Show and bam, had to have that CD (Even though I already had the mp3's). She is a legend and deserves to be in your collection =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZzzzz-z-z-z","review":"As a long time fan of Sade, I expected to be impressed with her latest CD after the long wait. Unfortunately, it plays like hip hop would play if it were trying to be a lullaby. The hum-drum drum beats take away from the other instruments leaving the selections monochromatic. I couldn't tell when one song finished and another started. She could have produced a more varied album of her smooth sultry tones which have inspired so many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her heart is not in this","review":"As much as I love Sade and her elusive, seductive sound, her latest CD struck me as having delivered a CD for all reasons save the one that counts most-her heart an soul was in it. She obvioulsy waited 8 years to launch her latest-perhaps she should have waited several more years until she was really committed to delighting her fans. Unfortunately, this does not measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovers Rock Doesn't","review":"Talk about feeling disappointed! I listened to this album 5 times,and still ended up giving it away. I anticipated feeling mesmerized by this album as I have with Sade's previous works, but instead I felt depressed after listening to this monotonous and vacant droning! The groove is gone! Sade, what's happened to you?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Artificial beats weigh Sade down","review":"I just couldn't get into this album at all. Sade tends to cover the same ground over & over again, but this time it is hampered by tinny, artificial beats. Drum programming was expected in the 80s, but Sade bucked the trend at that time & in doing so was a breath of fresh air. Now it seems like she's giving in to it, 15 years later. Who knows why. It sounds both dated & trendy at once. If you want to hear Sade at her best, pick up \\"Diamond Life\\" or \\"Promise\\". This one rings false."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Delcine of Sade","review":"Sade went 8 years without a new studio album. You would think the resulting release would blow your socks off. Compare this album to Basia's new album and you'll see what I mean. Stuart Matthewman's great sax work (once a vital part of the band's sound) is nowhere to be found. What's that all about? He gets in a few long background long tones (not even a solo) on the album's first tune on tenor sax, but you can't hear it without headphones. The instrumental backing in mostly keyboard washes, synthesizer bass, distorted guitar chords and drum machines, making it sound more dated than the band's original albums released several years earlier.The album is mostly SLOW, SLOW, SLOW depressing songs about Sade Adu's broken heart. She's in fine voice, but so what? After one listen I wanted to throw this one in the garbage but opted for selling it instead. Sadly, the new album, \\"Soldier of Love,\\" is even worse. Stick to Sade's \\"Best Of,\\" or the material from the '80s/'90s instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice, but not so good songs","review":"I think she has a great voice. But I think she have a very monotonous CD. The songs are regular, not the singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I really didn't find one song that jumped out as a great song. Although her talent is obvious, none of the songs we upbeat and catchy. I'm sorry but in my opinion you have to be a REAL HARDCORE Sade fan to appreciate this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow effort","review":"I bought this CD after two people recommended it. I was very dissapointed. I own most of Sade's early works and really enjoy them. This CD is very down beat and not up to the usual high standards of Sade's other albums. This one lacks the soulful upbeat nature of previous work. While I feel her pain, it doesn't sound like her heart was really into this project. I listened to this CD start to finish twice, and honestly don't feel the need to listen to it again. This album is vague and unremarkable, which is too bad because Sade is a great artist. I can't recommend this album, I hope her next effort is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE RETURN!!!!!","review":"THIS IS A PRETTY NICE ALBUM ESPECIALLY FOR A RETURN CD. MY FAVORITES ARE : BY YOUR SIDE, LOVERS ROCK, AND KING OF SORROW. I LIKE THIS ALBUM AND I ENJOY IT. IF YOU LIKE SADE THEN I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS ALBUM IT IS PRETTY GOOD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a STINKER!","review":"Sorry, folks but this one is terrible. I am a big Sade fan buying her albums from day one and really loving them. I also love the fact that they kept getting better and better - up until this one unfortunately. When I first heard the single on the radio I thought it was ok but couldn't understand that horrible guitar squeek. Much to my amazement, the whole album has that annoying sound throughout. I could get used to that (unprofessional as it is) but the whole album (a mere 45 minutes) sounds like a practice session of all the songs that got rejected from the real album. It is annoying, repetitive, and not SADE at all. It sounds more like a contractual obligation album. This one is a stinker! If you want the real thing, start with LOVE DELUXE and work your way backwards. Try again SADE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been a Sade fan since her first album, Diamond Life, and what I have always loved is her sultry, international sound and soul filled rhythms. But Lover's Rock is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I like only two songs, It's All About Our Love and By Your Side. The rest are dispensible. This album feels rushed. Like the band didn't have enough time to finish the songs. There are no layers of rhythms or beats that we have come to expect from Sade. The lyrics just don't resonate with me and that is something I thought I would never say about a Sade album. It all feels like a first effort. Something thrown together to meet a deadline. With a dud like this, I seriously hope it's not another 8 years before they come out with another album. They need to redeem themselves quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album by the Lady of Elegance and Grace...","review":"Lovers Rock is one of the most greatest albums you'll ever come across. It hits a spot in your soul, and you can't help but feel the words, rhythm, and the beat. Sade is just that good. Whenever I listen to this album, it's always on repeat. I wish that she would bless us with another great CD because I've been hungry for more for quite some time now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely-men, take note.......","review":"I can't imagine a better gift for a spouse or lover. I waited too long for this CD. I overplayed \\"It's No Ordinary Love\\" and it now haunts me. As soon as this CD was released I bought it, and it is better than I ever imagined. A perfect mood for bathing, making love, driving in the rain, or telling someone, \\"I LOVE YOU\\". Women (and men) can somtimes be a pain to shop for, trying to find that perfect gift. Look no further. I walked into my candle-lit house and heard this playing on my CD player. It remains in my mind as one of the most romantic surprises I ever received. If you have never heard Sade's voice...it will sooth, calm, and seduce you. She has a jazzy quality that is classic and so pleasing to the senses you can easily fall asleep to her music. I feel relaxed just thinking about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slowburner of great soul release","review":"Well 8 years of absence wasnt so bad after all...as Sade has remerged with their brand new album Lovers Rock. The album never gets beyond mid-tempo, there's no sing-along chorus and the mood is mostly sombre. what makes the CD special is ultimately the alluring and soulful voice of Sade Adu which strings the songs together in perfection. Sade sings of love lost and love found in that perfect blend of pop/R&B-soulfulness... By Your Side, Immigrant, Every Word & Lovers Rock are some of the wonderful tracks from the Sade. Don't expect anything OTT or hip-hop, this is soul without the frills...even the entire CD packaging looks like an over-simplified accompliment. Lyrics and few pics adorn the sleeve. A proof that great music needs litle hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average","review":"i dig Sade i have all of her Albums plus Imports,etc....but this set doesn't really showcase her all that well.i was looking for horns&things but this set didn't move me.it felt like it was just there.good lyrics but the music goes nowhere.it is just there.considering She drops a Disc once every 5 plus years you would expect a little more overall depth&something different.still i listen to her older stuff.but this won't be getting much play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth","review":"Before there were the Erykah Badus , Macy Grays and Jill Scotts, there was Sade. The original neo-soul singer. 8 years since her last new album, she hasn't lost a step. She gives her audience everythin they would expect from her. Never does this album cross over into the trashy stuff that female \\"singers\\" sing about today."},{"rating":"1","title":"a review of this CD, not Sade","review":"Take a look at all the 4 and 5 star reviews... nearly every one praises Sade the artist, her voice, how we fell in love with her first album, etc. I'm sorry, I love most of Sade's work, but I don't rate a CD 4 or 5 stars simply because I like the artist as a whole. If you look for honest reviews of this CD, I agree with them- this is easily her weakest work. It's simply boring. And where's her band? I don't believe they're on here- and they're sorely missed- there's no sax, and the drum machine is VERY annoying. Anyway, I had to add this to balance all the 4 and 5 star reviews. Her other albums are 4 and 5 star, not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Sure Is A Crime...","review":"The drum and bass tracks on this album overwhelm any other sounds. These almost sound like unfinished tracks, awaiting the addition of horns and strings. Aside from rhythm, the only other sound is a guitar. Sade's vocals are buried in the mix. After sitting through 11 numbing tracks of beating and pounding, one longs for some of the sweet saxaphone solos on previous Sade hits such as \\"Your Love Is King\\" and \\"Is It A Crime\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank GOD Sade has returned!","review":"This album exceeds all expectations anyone might have for the Queen of Sadness and Salvation. In a time where much of the music we have to choose from has lyrics like \\"Baby can I lick this?\\" or \\"Honey can you suck that?\\", LOVERS ROCK brings an end to all the madness. While King of Sorrow, Slave Song, and the title track, Lovers Rock, are like religion, the whole album is clearly divine. Now if Anita Baker would just get in the studio..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost but not quite..........","review":"Like many, I'd thought perhaps Sade had decided not to return after her private life became somewhat public and her lovelife seemed to mirror her often downbeat lyrics. This album proved a surprise in its arrival but was a disappointment in its content. There are certainly good grooves and tunes that meet the expectations left from Love Deluxe. But unlike the editors comments I think there are the 'latest' beats. There is no doubt a drum machine on this record, the sax is gone, and overall it suffers from a more mechanized sound than previous pieces. Sade's voice, as ever, shines through. There are acoustic riffs, and the more stripped down tunes prove her abilities. But once the drum machine beats kick things turn less focused and the music becomes less involving. It is great for background tunes, but the grab you by the lapels intensity of some of Love Deluxe on back through her catalog is only occasionally seen here."},{"rating":"2","title":"An fun show for fans of classic TV","review":"The Ghost Busters is a fun and entertaining show, especially for those with an appreciation for classic TV. Besides stars Larry Storch & Forrest Tucker (F Troop), a bevy of classic TV actors make guest appearances on this show.

There are fewer games than in the other Jumpstart sets and they're not as challenging.

This book, written before the end of WWII, offers unique insights that aren't covered in most history books. I found this book on a bin of books that my college library was giving away. After a year on the shelf, my wife picked it up and brought it to my attention. It goes beyond the same cookie-cutter Hitler book that you might find in the history section. It offers a plausible narrative on the roots of the revolutions that replaced one tyrant with another.

I was disappointed in this book, though and here's a list of reasons why: (1) Neither of the main characters had the same kind of spark as the ones in her first book; (2) even the cat in this one (Macbeth) lacked the pizzazz of Sir Ambrose; (3) too many characters! I needed a score card to track the plot; (4) I thought the plot was less intersting (smugglers?), and (5)I just didn't find Tony or Sylvia very appealing people. At least with Jo and Sinclair, there was wit and humor. With these two, he seemed directionless until he stumbles upon this village (not exciting to me) and she seemed just like any other female victim of the era--impoverished lady trying to solve her problems in a man's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Syliva and Tony's story","review":"'Kiss From a Rogue' by Shirley Karr has smuggling, 'a want to be' Rake and widow who is trying to save her village.

Petty and the band are just getting the feel of being major rock stars. Their signature sound was perfected on this record. The album closes with \\"Louisiana Rain,\\" another excellent cut.

Great album, great bluray audio 5.1 DTS Master mix, a must buy! Additionally, this album also has a high bit rate 2.1 version, as well as a free mp3 and flac audio file download of the entire album.

There are several dozen employees using these break rooms and in about five weeks time there are still over three full cans left!

I can only describe this product as \\"flavored sugar\\". It wasn't creamy, could barely taste coffee in it, and is very watery. I even tried mixing it in milk instead of water (per package directions) and it's still very bland although it was way too sweet. The directions say to use \\"3 tsp\\" per cup. Even one tsp is already sweet. Again, this is just sugar with just a bit of cheap coffee flavoring and powdered milk. I ended up throwing away most of the product, didn't bother to finish it.

The DVD side is fun to watch and see the musicians off stage and behind the scenes. They are very impressively creative...even trying to record a babbling brook for effect despite it sounding like rubbish and being axed from the final mix. They are great song writers, and the pop mix of 80s rock, funk and rockabilly is refreshing in today's declining music scene. I love their first album so much that I had to give this album one less star, but this album is a very solid second album. You won't go wrong with it if you like the first record."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Really Could Have It So Much Better","review":"This album is appropriately named, because you honestly can do so much better than this album. Their prior album was very good, but with the exception of a few tracks, this one is bland. I listened to it maybe 10 times after buying it when it first came out and didn't listen to it again until today, hoping I would have a different opinion of it. But I haven't changed my mind. If you liked their first album, I would recommend the Arctic Monkeys, which is a fantastic band. Both of their albums are superior to anything Franz Ferdinand has done."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album is So Much Better...","review":"If you liked Franz Ferdinand's first album, you'll love this. It's a bit faster, and catchier, and you can listen to it about 4 times in a row, entirely, without it getting old. There really isn't any filler here in my opinion, in fact the only song that's not that good is the first single, \\"Do You Want To\\", it's just too simple and doesn't reflect the great music on this album. Franz Ferdinand has another classic with \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"All They Wanted","review":"All This fab four wanted to do was make an album and songs \\"that girls can dance to\\" well they acheived that and much much more. I love Franz Ferdinand, but not to be so biased I am saying that the songs are kind of repetetive, yet if you know every word to every song (like I do...sigh, I need a life) you can tell the difference. the best songs on the CD were, The Fallen (sweet guitars), Do You Want To? (Yes I do!) and many others. Much of their old stuff is great, but the new stuff is awesome!

This albums is a perfect example of why we even have terms like \\"Sophomore Slump\\" and \\"Sellout.\\"\\"Do You Want To\\" is the cheesiest song of the year with horrible lyrics and an irritating riff. Why anyone would listen to this more than once is beyond me. The title track is so horribly horrible and boring that I'm not even going to try and come up with something clever. It just sucks.The rest of the album isn't much different. They seem to have been reading the titles of too many Ramones songs. Their favourite word is \\"wanna\\" and they don't use it as well as Joey Ramone.I love their debut. Maybe the best album from last year. This album can't be their debut's toilet paper. If someone tells you this is a really great follow-up, don't listen to them.

Reading some reviews, they sounded interesting, and I enjoy some of their influences. However, after hearing both of the first two records, I can only conclude that the bank lacks both musicianship and strong songs. There's just not enough interesting material here to prop up an album, and even the obviously commercial \\"singles\\" are somewhat boring and derivative.

Theyve recently decided its a good idea to mix in Franz Ferdinkook, probably because they figure I dont have to deal with enough rotten horsesh*t from the Killers. Franz Ferdinand is horrible, unimaginative, radio friendly garbage designed for sheep. I guess your all sheep since you all seem to lap up Franz Ferdinand like a bunch of mindless idiots. This music is so void of talent, I tend to doubt anyone that enjoys Franz Ferdinand has ever seen a monkey with 4 asses."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"To me this is nothing like as good as their debut album. The songs are less interesting, less catchy, less memorable. I tried to like it, I've played it through many times now, but it just isnt growing on me at all.It's not as if they've changed their sound much either, although they have upped the tempo a bit and it's a bit more \\"in your face\\" but really I think they could have done with taking a bit more time making this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franz does it again with \\"You Could Have it So Much Better\\", but leaves room for improvement.","review":"For quite a while, i have been hearing the naysayers telling us all of a \\"sophomore slump\\". On the contrary, \\"You Could Have it So Much Better\\" shows us an even broader expression of Franz Ferdinand's artistic capabilities. This album blends a couple of ballads (Eleanor Put Your Boots On, Walk Away, Fade Together), some pure punk-rock songs (This Boy, Evil and a Heathen, Well That Was Easy, Outsiders, What you Meant, You're the Reason I'm Leaving), some just-plain-crazy-indescribeable songs such as Do You Want To, The Fallen, You Could Have it So Much Better. I was exceedingly pleased with Franz's eponymous debut and this album may very well surpass it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly fresh!","review":"Not really a fan of the Good Charlotte, Blink 182 genre, I had mistakenly categorized Franz Ferdinand as another TRL punk-rock band, without ever hearing any of their music. But after listening to \\"Do You Want to\\" on the radio, I couldn't resist picking up this CD. The thirteen uptempo/energetic rock tracks contained do not disappoint, and channel the Cure and the Beatles with memorable tracks like \\"This Boy\\", \\"Evil and a Heathen\\" and \\"Well that was Easy\\". But it is with the album opener, \\"Fallen\\" that Franz Ferdinand really shines, this is one of the most fun and crisp fast-paced rock song I've heard in a very long time.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes sequels are good","review":"\\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" sounds a lot like Franz Ferdinand's first album. There are the same dancey rhythms, overdriven vocals, and catchy songs. The formula have enough in it for two good albums. If anything, I think this one is a little better than the first.

I didnt think much of it. At first I liked it, and then it just got old. Sooner or later it was forgotten under my bed and it hasn't been touched since.The second album of theirs isnt better than the first. Usually artists experience some growth in their music, and their second or third album doesnt sound exactly like the first album. Franz Ferdinand however, is different. This is like the follow-up of the first album, and all of the songs sound the same. Jesus, even in the first album all of their songs sound alike. Its one, long, annoying 56 minute song.This band blows...so save your money and go and buy some real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing follow up.","review":"This is a let-down compared to their debut.

This is such a fun, rockin' CD. Gets off to a great start, really danceable music throughout with some exceptions. Some of the slower softer ones have beautiful, wistful melodies, like \\"Eleanor\\" and \\"Fade Together.\\" The piano is particularly wistful with it's waltz-time tempo, reminiscent of the turn of the last century.

Great 2nd album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Angry, Bitter, Frustrated, Rookies?","review":"Why, for the most part, do the rookie music reviewers on Amazon come off sounding like angry, bitter, frustrated musicians or rock critics without spellcheck if they don't like an album or artist? It's one thing to intelligently review an album, but it's another to resort to putting cruel words and gratuitous foul language in a public forum, usually behind some \\"cute\\" made-up name.In the specific case of Franz Ferdinand, if you (whomever you are) don't like a little bit of progressive pop-rock from the UK, then you have no sense of the history of this genre of music. There's no way you can properly judge this album or band without a solid foot in the 1960s era of The Kinks, The Beatles, The Who, The Moody Blues, Cream, The Yardbirds, Traffic, etc. Know \\"the family tree\\" before you attempt to cut it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost like they're playing live!","review":"I'm a big Franz Ferdinand fan and finally got to see them in concert, just before this album was released. I have to say, that this album absolutely captures the energy and excitement their concerts provide. The music is wonderful. Their songs range from exciting and fun like \\"Do You Want To?,\\" mellow and melodic like \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots Back On\\" and dark and sexy like \\"Evil and a Heathen.\\" I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoyed their last album and anyone who just wants music they can dance to.As for the Dual Disc issue, I enjoyed it, simply because I can watch the video for \\"Do You Want To?\\" over and over again. For me, that alone was worth paying for it. If you want something more than that, just buy the regular version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul and John the revelators","review":"a vivacious and infectious release that injects new blood into the world of pop music. One must, however, be willing once again to embrace the powerful Beatles' influences all over this work. Obviously, with bands like Travis and Keane (as well as all the others, including Tears For Fears on their latest) the listener has become used to hearing references and sounds straight out of the Liverpool pantheon. That's not always a bad thing. Just be prepared to accept it first before moving on to all the unique qualities of the latest wave of Brit rockers.For a cleaner and arguably better produced release, check out the new one by Depeche Mode, Playing The Angel. It's a nice counterpoint to FF."},{"rating":"1","title":"This disk is gargage","review":"Don't get me wrong, the music is fantastic. One of the best audio disc's I have bought all year.

You could probably say that they had a sophmore slump because they didn't churn out all of the those memorable songs like \\"This Fire\\" , \\"Come on home\\", \\"Dark of the Matinee\\" etc instead they made some great softer songs like \\"Walk Away\\" which is probably my favorite song on the album. This is less of a rock of an album and went in a slightly different direction which I didn't expect because I figured they would have felt pressure to make another \\"Take Me Out\\" and would take an entire trying to make a song that was just as hit worthy as that song was.

My favorite thing about this album which makes me want to give it 4 stars is that their first single was not the best song on the cd.. How many times does a band do that? Thats my biggest pet peeve.. The 2nd song they released as a single is my absolute favorite song by them.. Good beat, AWESOME lyrics, and different.. Difference is the reason I knocked it from being a 5-star album.. They didnt break away from the typical \\"Sophmore Sound\\" that traps many and most artists (including my favorite The Beatles) so for that lack of creativity i deduct a star!

Ms. Jhaveri's lovely voice is mesmerizing and at the end of the 3rd song, she adds a second track of her voice that provides a low-key murmuring (and non-gimmicky!) counterpoint to the melody.

Mannheim and Christmas-- they go together like holly and mistletoe. This CD and most of their others are staples in my car CD player during the Christmas season, while travelling around in town and on all of our long Christmas vacation trips. I've always loved the \\"live performance\\" aspect of this one. Thought it might be interesting to also have the DVD. The video isn't a spectacular \\"Celine\\" type of stage production, but it was very interesting as a musician to see exactly how some of those sounds and sound effects are made. Very nice video. Lots of variety in the programming. Enjoyed getting to \\"see\\" the players that I've been listening to for so many years. Would buy it again and would recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected it to be.","review":"Don't let the name of the group put you off.

We've been listening to their CDs for years so when searching their website, we saw the DVD and decided to get it. It is like being at the concert all over again. They do spend a little too much time (for my taste) on the individual musicians, but the videos that were part of the live concert and made it so special are all in the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Concert","review":"For any fan of their music, the DVD -- Mannheim Steamroller Christmas Live is a must buy. Given the price of concert tickets and the shortage of time around the holidays to attend a live event, it is great to be able to \\"attend\\" a performance in the comfort of home.This DVD was filmed in 1997 during a performance in Omaha Nebraska, the home of Mannheim Steamroller. Filmed twelve years ago, the DVD reflects the live concert experience. The visuals are lovely, but they are not flashy, so keep that in mind. That said, in no way is the concert experience diminished. The DVD print is crystal clear and the sound is rich and has plenty of depth. It is perfect to play while wrapping gifts or baking cookies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful...","review":"Bought this for my Dad, after bringing him to the live show.

If all of their past work was building up to something, this would be the culmination of their efforts. The visuals are amazing, and the music video/mini movie set to \\"Pat A Pan\\" even choked me up (very sad). The sound was incredibly well produced, and the video was stunningly mastered. Makes me wish I had a digital capable TV with component inputs. Even if you've only heard of Mannheim Steamroller, and you've got a DVD player, BUY THIS DVD. You'll be very glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"the second dvd","review":"The first dvd was corrupted. The sound was distored, as well as not even. It would get loud, then drop in volume, then get loud again and did not sound right at all.The replacement dvd was very good. Sound was even and consistent. However, I do not understand that why the second dvd is different from the first. The begining of the the first is different from the second.Either way, the second dvd is good and I will enjoy watching it durning the holidays.Victor Morales"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this DVD","review":"This is the worst DVD I have ever purchased.

I really don't think there's anything good about this song! The beat is irritating, there is no apparent melody, and the lyrics are just lame. Slim Thug doesn't do anything to improve the song. Sorry, Beyonce. This has got to be the worst song of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal, but caters to the mainstream","review":"I hated this song the first time I heard it. The instrumentation was thin, there was no apparent melody, and the lyrics were bland and easy to forget. Imagine my surprise when it turns out to be a hit! I guess it stands for what America really wants, something catchy, sexy, and thoughtless. I'm pretty disappointed, because Beyonce has such a lovely voice, and I know she can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love watching Beyonce,but Musically no thanks","review":"Beyonce can Sing,but alot of the material she elects to do is straight up stank. this song sounds like outtakes from her \\"Bills,Bills\\"Bills\\" Era with Destiny's Child. the Video is good for my eyeballs&this song stays on Mute. I hope One day She will truly challenge herself because she has that \\"IT\\" but has to have somebody to truly bring it out of her.a bounce cut is cool here&there but the bulk of her tracks just roll on the same wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check This Out: This Song Is Wack!","review":"I heard this song on radio several times before I realized that the song was by Beyonce. I've never admired Beyonce's music style because she's mainly pop with very little substance. \\"Check On It\\" has to be the worst song so far in 2006. The video is just as awful, showing Beyonce caked with make-up, scantily clad, and shaking her behind. I thought she looked ridiculous, especially with that matted cat fur on her head. Basically, the song is about shaking your booty at the club and giving some perverted scumbag permission to grind into the back of you. That's one of the reasons why I stopped going to the clubs a long time ago because that type of \\"dancing\\" is just plain vulgar. Anyway, the song sounds better without the guest rapper (Slim Thug), but it's still an awful song."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to you beyonce?","review":"its terrible don't buy it! :( not very impressed with her...I am done haveing my hopes high that her music would be a hit single I am done I think she should know that her music is not gaining popularity like it use to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst recording to date","review":"this is the worst R&B; song i've ever heard, seriously.i like the beyonce in \\"the closer i get to you\\", \\"dangerously in love\\" and \\"so amazing\\"guys don't you listen to this garbage"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit of a Disappointment","review":"The sticker on the front of this CD stated that it contained the Album Version of \\"Check On It\\" taken from Destiny's Child #1's and also contained remixes. After taking the wrapper off and to my surprise, that sticker covered over the bottom right corner where it states that this CD does not contain the Album Version. I just wanted to get the version of this song featured in the new THE PINK PANTHER film. However, that version is not on here. All the cuts on this CD are just remixes. The back of the CD states that that version is available on the soundtrack to THE PINK PANTHER. However, when I checked the soundtrack it states that Beyonce does not perform on that CD. I am totally confused and disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyonce back again!!","review":"this is a very nice single!! the original is very cathcy and funny. and FINALLY i found an issue that contanined mixes.

A prime example of a deep, emotional ballad is track 10 on her latest release, B'Day. However, when Beyonce wants to write a silly, playful tune, she can do that as well! She has said in several interviews that she didn't expect this song to be as popular as it was, and she released it just because she thought it was nice to dance to. So if you don't read too deeply into it, it's a very enjoyable tune from an extremely talented artist. It's true that she has done better, but Check On It is the perfect song for a night out with the girls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Most of the people who come and write those trashy reviews are just B bashers and should go deaf for the rest of their lives for not giving this girl the credit she deserves.

Bland, flavorless dance music at its worst.","review":"I fished this out of a discount record bin after being amused that any retailer would even bother selling a CD that they had marked down to $0.50. I still think I overpaid. Mass Hystereo is an exercise in the most banal, generic of all dance music. It sounds something like a watered down Crystal Method - a blend of big beat and acid house, but in a boring repetitive manner and without anything to set it apart from all the other material out there.It's totally flavorless music like this that gives dance music a bad name in some circles. God Lives Underwater is responsible for some interesting music, but this side project is so by-the-numbers and unremarkable, that I have to wonder what Jeff Turzo was thinking when he made this.Keep away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Window works now!","review":"My husband and I repaired the window motor in my '98 Olds Intrigue with this product.

After fully charging both handsets last for MAYBE 5 minutes before I start getting the beeps and \\"low battery\\" indicators. The sound quality is hideous, constantly fades in and out - even if you are standing next to the base!! The answering machine playback - even at top volume - is barely audible.

My only problem is that after about 2 years of use I now have to replace the battery in the handset because it doesn't seem to hold a charge- I don't know if that is normal wear- I've heard that rechargeable batteries lose their life after so many charges.

You can call with either the base or the phone. And there's an intercom so they can call each other.Cons:There always seems to be at least one blinking light on it, which gets on my nerves.You can't switch to this phone if there's another on the line. Like, if you call someone with the phone, you can't switch to the base speaker. You have to hang up and call them all over again (annoying when you have to wait for a long time or deal with a computer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Water Boiler","review":"The T-Fal 4-Cup Vitesse Electric Water Kettle is a great little kitchen device. Not only is it attractive, but very useful. My experience has found that it can bring one liter of water to boil is a matter of a few short minutes. I love my T-Fal Vitesse that I even bring it with me on vacation, because you never know how clean the coffee machine/water kettle is in the hotel you are staying in. The little kettle is holding up very well, with only a few scraches due to traveling. It has only failed me only once (hence the 4 star rating) when the kettle prematuredly shut off, but that maybe because of my power convertor, as I was in Hong Kong using the kettle.

Not only is it education (which is it's aim) but it is done in a way that it is easy to follow and do. You have many sexual positions explained as the couple perform them. The narration is easy to follow and does not deter from the overall quality and atmosphere of this DVD.This DVD is for couples who want to explore more of their own sexuality and who want more sexual positions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational for the newbie","review":"This product was received with great anticipation, hoping to find something new and exciting for a married couple of 19 years. Unfortunately, most of these sexual positions were minor variations of a few known (common) positions that are typical for any adventurous couple. The best portion was the guide to pleasurable anal sex, which was beneficial and even helpful with a few suggested pointers from the narrator.Overall, i (personally) did not find the product as exciting or as beneficial as I would have liked. I do believe they could have shown a little more variety in the number of positions rather than variation on a few positions. If this is the best the narrator/producer has to offer, perhaps she should have titled it 'The Complete Guide to the Few Sexual Positions I Know'... seriously...Best Target Audience: Newbies or the conservative who wants to 'gently' display something new to his missionary wife.Anyone want to buy a 'viewed ALMOST once' copy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't wast your money","review":"The actors in this dvd must come from the porn film business since they shave their pubic hair off.

It is well made, very easy to do a professional job of connecting to a cord.However, I needed a plug that I could lead a fairly heavy extension cord away from an outlet in a desired direction other than an angle simply lined up with an existing horizontal outlet. There are other plugs that do allow an adjustment to rotate and lock into one of several cord directions.While this plug does do a really good job of keeping the cord close to the mounting surface, it only allows one cord direction away from the outlet.These angle plugs are a bit hard to find so I will be keeping the plug for other applications because of the quality and ease of connecting to a cord. I do like the way that an angle plug carries the weight of a heavy cord without trying to twist itself out of an outlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy construction and easy to install","review":"This is my second purchase of the Leviton 515AN so I obviously like it. Anyway, I converted the original horizontal plug which stuck out too far from the outlet to this one which as you can see makes it vertical and out of the way. It's sturdy, fits snug in the outlet and easy to install. Can't go wrong with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incomplete set","review":"Amazon doesn't tell you that this book is Volume 1 of 2.

The thoughts presented reflect on all human relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting book full of ways to improve, restore, and maintain the important topic of Trust....","review":"I'm adding this book to my collection of titles that need to be read on a continuous basis. The Speed of Trust is full of profound statements and observations that people of all levels can apply to their life. The author clearly explains to us that trust is like air: we don't pay any attention to it until it's not there. Trust is by far one of the most critical aspects of our personal and professional lives that need to be examined and improved on a regular basis.I highly recommend this book for everyone to read more than once to be able to apply the tips and principles the author communicates to us. He can be a little long winded on some points but in this case I didn't mind because sometimes it took a little reiterating to understanding key points that he usually detailed with examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best busines books ever.","review":"This book is truely on of the best business books written. Many books are written to be skimmed, however each page of this book is worth reading.

Most of it is like common sense that you may have never heard anyone put words to before. The only shortcomings of this book are that it is severely anecdotal (some of the anecdotes are strong and useful, but many are too personal to the author and they therefore lose credibility or pertinence) and kind of long-winded - by the time you near the end, you are ready to not even look at it's cover for perhaps a year! Overall, though, a great book which appropriately emphasizes that the same qualities which make for good personal relationships make for good business relationships, as well - which is helpful if you are or you are dealing with a person who can see the importance from one angle but perhaps not the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Covey's point about the importance of trust is most worthwhile, but his behavioral suggestions on how to achieve it are mostly a rehash of ideas already out there, and on almost all of his points as the book goes along, he merely skims the surface of the possibilities rather than providing depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype, no protein","review":"Lots of anecdotes about the author's years in the business world.

Very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"I was very, very disappointed in \\"The Speed of Trust\\". All Covey did in this book was plagiarize other's previous works. No new ideas. There were many of Tom Peters ideas spread throughout. And Covey drags on and on. This book could have been 1/3 the size. If you have read management/leadership books in the past, this one will not cover any new ground for you. Better to invest your time with authors that offer original ideas in a concise format."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is High Time That More Leaders Understand These Principles","review":"Covey and Merrill done a careful well reasoned job in identifiying the only real basis for success in business, and life. My own observation is that genuine trust is the magic ingredient for bringing out the best of all human interaction. I agree with the authors' suggestion to stop after reading each chapter and go back and address those steps that will make the biggest difference to the reader's own situation. I am confident that application of these concepts can make a huge difference in all business.

How can one be seriously inspired by a book with a content this shallow? Maybe it's the same reason as why books like 'Help, the iceberg is melting' are so hugely popular: the illusion of control or influence is being sold well. As I found out through my work as a consultant, even readers with a masters degree, are fond of simplification and 'generic recipes'. Of course: reading this book won't make you a worse person and hopefully it will inspire some to really behave or act in a more ecological way...

I was impressed by the thought-provoking treatment he gives the business-relevance of the topic, shining a light on how 'trusted' leaders and organizations do things better, faster, and at lower costs. It's one of those books that shifts your perspective, and also gives you the tools. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Character Trait","review":"This breakthrough book shows how trust is much, much more than a character trait. Trust is a competency that can be taught, learned, and deliberately reinforced. Trust is the \\"operating system\\" of every relationship, every organization. Covey does a masterful job of making a strong business case for trust, then he expounds on 13 \\"trust behaviors\\" that enable people to earn and maintain the confidence of others. He also discusses the whys and wherefores of \\"smart trust\\" - how to extend trust to others. Follow the principles and practices outlined in this book and you'll be surprised how your relationships -- both personal and professional -- gain fresh traction."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Trust No Life","review":"Great book; lots of useful tools to use everyday.What is \\"trust\\" \\"Who is trustworthy?\\"\\"How to discover trust\\"\\"How to create trust\\"\\"How to become trustworthy\\"\\"What do you do when someone looses \\"trust\\"\\"What is \\"a little trust?\\" \\"What is a lot of trust?\\"\\"Are their different kinds of \\"trust\\"Trust plays a very important roll in our daily lives with out it; we would be very lonely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awareness Rejuvenation","review":"Decent book...easy to read with common sense information...Covey (the son) did a good job of categorizing the information to provide an awareness to the contributors of Trust...also, great point about that Low Trust slows things down and increases costs, while High Trust speeds things up and decreases costs...I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"We are using it for a Leadership Symposium.

He uses his typical methods to help you \\"self-programm\\" to enable you to speak and portray correct behavior to establish trust. With this skill you can become a leader who get others to produce the desired results by inspiring trust. (Can you hear the goose-stepping?)I know I am hard on the guy BUT he fuels the corporate propaganda machine. They get tools from the guy to manipulate (under the guise of a pseudo-moral philosophy) employees into making some more cash for the stockholders and management.

The best book ever written about war at sea. Nothing else come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"A splendid and moving masterpiece of naval fiction.","review":"This is no ordinary blood-and-glory sea story, with a ship full of heroes who can do no wrong. Here is real life - the misery of North Atlantic weather, in a small ship rolling constantly in the tremendous swell. An untried and amateur crew aboard a newly built ship are pitted against an omnipresent and invisible enemy below the waves, who is able to mark ships and sailors for death seemingly at will. In perhaps the most bitter fight of WW II, the crew adapt and learn, making Compass Rose a highly effective weapon against the German U-Boats.Written in 1951, Monsarrat bases his story on his own experience as first officer of a corvette on convoy escort duty. He clearly identifies with his primary character, Lockhart, who joins HMS Compass Rose in 1939 as a very junior Sub Lieutenant. The people and ships are fictional, but this is nevertheless a true and moving story. A brilliant story, totally unforgettable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love and war on the North-Atlantic during WW II","review":"It's a pity this book's out of print. I read it for the first time in a Dutch translation when I was 17 years old. It made a deep impression on me. When I read the English version, fifteen years on, this impression was even deepened. What the people on board of the cargo-vessels and warships that crossed the North-Atlantic during WW II had to endure is almost beyond description. Monserrat did a terrific job doing this. I was captured from the beginning to the end. I myself being a ship's captain was moved deeply by this story of the sea, the war and the movings of small human beings caught in between. Anything Alistair McLean might have written about this subject is put very much in the shadow by this terriffic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How it really was...","review":"If a one-word review were acceptable, it would just be: \\"Great!\\". You're living through the career of a moderately able submarine hunter in WWII. Like in real life, he was out there in a nutshell called a \\"Flower class\\" corvette, facing the stormy North Atlantic and loads of prowling German subs. Have you ever wondered how those heroes' lives really were like? You will live with the corvette's green crew through their hard training, through endless boring hours of seasickness, through personal problems like bad superiors or unfaithful wives, through mobbing and loneliness,... You will see ships around them explode and sink, till finally - oh, I shouldn't spoil the story, should I?A fascinating book, I couldn't stop reading day and night.

I heard the group in person, when they appeared in Seattle, and then listened to the album, and the album does represent them fairly. The group presents traditional Welsh music with a few modern twists that are innovative, but not intrusive. I strongly recommend this album to anyone who is interested in Welsh music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Circle","review":"This is a love story without imagery depictions of gnarly positions written beautifully by Mr. Mortimer. Lucy wants to do some good in this world so she volunteers to be a reformer to Terry who has just been released from prison. Terry is not that easy to change therefore Lucy faces a big challenge in front of her. When push comes to shove Lucy perseveres; she is the daughter of a bishop. A lot of eccentric characters make up Mr. Mortimer's tale. The dialogues are funny. Each chapter is told from Lucy's point of view or Terry's side of an experience. The language is particularly stunning and swift. With Mr. Mortimer's knowledge of British law and order, and its justice system, his narration is tremendously exciting especially that he adds an extraordinary sense of humor into looking at situations. From the first page to the last this book is wonderful to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite honestly","review":"i was very please with the condition of the book and the speedy delivery as this was a gift for my sister has she could not find the book in her locale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite honestly, I couldn't finish this book","review":"I hate books where the point of view jumps from chapter to chapter.

I had heard mixed reviews about this book before I read it. But, I was pleasently suprised by how good this book actually was. I liked it as much, of not more, than \\"The Firstborn\\" (The first book in this trilogy). This book brings about the end of a legacy.

Let me begin! These authors could have collaborated with the previous books or author for specific info. I would like to know what happened to some characters from the first two books, but instead we get new characters and those stories are not told and forgotton. A crime! On top of that, this book doesn't have an ending! It is like the last fifty pages are gone and several characters and missions and stories in the middle of this book are never addressed or finished! I was completely shocked at the amateur technique of these two authors. This whole three part series was a complete waste of my time!

The antics of Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall and the boys have a certain charm that deserves to be remembered in a better form than this! If you've never checked out or even heard of the East Side Kids before do yourself a favor and look them up, trashy teen exploitation from a time long ago, corny yet hip (I guess for it's day?!), the 30's and 40's equivalent of today's Road trip and American Pie type teen flix (minus the sex of course!).

I mean dont get me wrong id rather live in Austin, but if your going to these cities for fun, spend like two days in Austin, then make your way to San Antonio...fast,,,the riverwalk alone is worth spending several days. As for this guide, I like the way it's layed out and the ratings of sites is very accurate. The hotel and restaurant guides are pretty basic, but it gives you an general overview. If you have never visited this area...be sure to ride out into the Hill Country, all the German Heritage and scenic vista's is not to be missed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frommer's San Antonio","review":"We used this book a LOT during our week vacationing in San Antonio.

We'd already done our airline, rental car, and hotel reservations, so we didn't need the book for that. But we did their recommended downtown walking tour one day, and it was just like having our personal tour guide with us as we read about each stop. The first night we found our way to a Tex-Mex restaurant that they recommended, and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Other days we drove to outlying towns that were also recommendations, and we never would have discovered them on our own without that book.

I stayed at an apartment in Paris that came equipped with a 1-liter T-Fal kettle. It was such a snap to make tea that I bought the T-Fal Vitesse kettle on Amazon the minute I came back to New York.This version has a larger capacity at 1.7 liters, so it obviously takes longer to heat the total amout of water it can hold. One thing I did not like about the version I bought compared to the one I saw in France, is that the French version came with a light that turned on to indicate the kettle was working. In the American version, there is no light to indicate the status of the machine. You can only tell by checking if the button is pressed down.The kettle makes a pop sound when the water has boiled. It is inaudible if you are in a different room, so you have to stand close by.Otherwise, I liked the design of this kettle better than any other brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Kettle!!","review":"I make coffee or tea every day, and this kettle gets some hard use at my house.

First of all, it is very well designed. It looks fine in the kitchen and does not occupy much space. It boils the water within 1-2 minutes and shuts off automatically. This feature is particularly important early in the morning when you are rushing to work.

He didn't want to disappoint me. Well, I was so excited to get this baby and fire it up. It worked great the first couple of times but then it wouldn't shut off after I had poured out the water and sat it back down on the base. Then I noticed this nasty burning plastic smell everytime I used it. The smell and the taste stayed with the water to make a lousy cup of tea.

The videos are excellent for lay people and professionals who are interested in using the techniques. As a health care professional, I have contact with many \\"glossy-type\\" presentations who tout the practitioner and not the subject. Not so with these two. Phil has a background in teaching disabled children. They break down the steps to make it easy for the learner.

They are an all instrumental band of young rockers from Japan who blend elements of fusion, heavy rock, jazz and even a bit of metal into their mix of music. Their sound is really unique, at time very heavy with loud crashing guitars and drums, while at times the move into almost jazz territory with plenty of outstanding flute. The flute parts will undoubtedly remind the listener of Jethro Tull at times, with King Crimson and maybe even Tool being other comparisons. These guys are great live and if you ever get the chance to see them check them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wolff collection yet, and nearly as good as his memoirs","review":"These stories are far and away the best Wolff short stories to date. The breadth of subjects and points of view, the hilarious and touching situations they describe, the purity of his language and clarity of his imagery--all of it is unrivalled in his previous writing. Moreover, many of the stories pack the emotional wallop of his THIS BOY'S LIFE, a book that this reader thought would never be equaled in that department"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, charming and churning. Wolf gives us ourselves.","review":"Simply, THE NIGHT IN QUESTION, is filled with quick witted, short stories, that subtly asks and answers the small questions of all our lives. The actions of the characters are filled with a regularity that we all can be empathetic towards, and yet also be surprised in the turn of events that face those characters with the questions of mortality, fear, and solitude. This is an easy read, and yet thought provoking. I would recommend to anyone who truly enjoys short stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"[$$]?

In this book, the author rips apart the myths of the original sin, Sonship of Jesus, Jesus being God, and Atonement. When one truly looks at the Gospels under a microscope like this author has done, you will find that Jesus was nothing more than a prophet of God sent to the Jews and the doctrine of Christianity itself is nothing more than a far-fetched ideology that was put in his name by someone else. To the Christian who really want to know the truth about Jesus and Christianity, this is a book of enlightenment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russian Cooking","review":"This book was not complete. There was a small spiral cookbook that was a companion.

The photography is wonderful and the description of Russian regional cuisine is enlightening. The writer/editors were prescient in titling the book Russian cuisine instead of Soviet cuisine since the Soviet Union is no more. But the regional dishes and recipes given are part of today's Russian cooking even though many of the countries mentioned (Ukraine, Georgia, Latvia, Estonia, Uzbekistan, etc.) are now independent nations. In short, we have a cuisine of a cultural region and not of a political state. An interesting historical development.The recipes are good, very clearly written, and with excellent illustrative photography. For the most part the recipes are authentic (although one wonders how one can have a Ukrainian meat borsch without pork)and can be created by a resonably competent cook.Book is worth the historical photography, if for no other reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"Fist mistake Ukrainian Easter eggs on the cover.

This particular releases is an absolutely must-have for any and all true Madonna fans. Not only do you get 3 versions of Rain, but Bad Girl, Waiting, Up Down Suite and Fever gets thrown in for good measure. Remix-wise Rain gets a somewhat uplifting face-lift versus the more heavier album version. I did expect a little more remixes of this song but why tamper with perfection?Bad Girl is basically just a extended version as the title states, but if you're a fan of the song and the album version which clocks in just under 6 minutes didn't satisfy you-this is the mix for you. Fever on the other hand has some funky mixes and if you haven't got the Fever CD single, this is a great way of getting an all-in-one package.In all a great disc and absolutely value for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casting some Light on the Electricity Race","review":"Jill Jones has produced a wonderful book.

I opened the book knowing very little about the subject. I was seduced by the excellent voice in the writing. And I was left with an interest in the Electricity Race.

Even if your not a devoted existentialist you'll love the message of this book. This is the first of the trilogy--the \\"Roads to Freedom\\" series. The Age of Reason is the most novel-like of the three. One of Sartre's best. An entertaining and thought-provoking piece of literature.~Leann~"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the \\"Roads to Freedom\\" trilogy","review":"The best of the \\"Roads to Freedom\\" trilogy that meant to be a tetralogy, then petered out.

The characters in this novel are so obnoxious I'd feel more comfortable hanging out with Dick Cheney in a dungeon full of scorpions, and I feel sorry for anyone who identifies with them or knows people who are like them. Sartre intentionally makes the characters so hateable because he wants to show us the necessity of taking responsibility for one's freedom, but I'm not sure his point works; such people may decide that they willfully want to own up to their whimsically obnoxious ways. If you want to read novels that present existentialist issues, I would recommend Virginia Woolf, especially works like \\"To the Lighthouse.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Book Shipped by Amazon","review":"The first 3-5 lines of the following pages were poorly printed and the remainder of the pages were blank.

However, because of a broad streak of narcissism, they are unable or unwilling to do significant harm to themselves. As a consequence, they turn their destructive ambitions toward their unsuspecting, but nevertheless deserving, acquaintances. Each character is deluded in the belief that he or she is seeking some noble objective, for example Mathieu's quest for ultimate freedom, while in fact settling for cheap self-indulgence at others' expense. These characters are irredeemable and certainly not worthy of the several hours required to read Sartre's novel.

The game has the classic 2D look, with amazing special effects, and the gameplay is really cool. You can choose whether to use the SNK system (which is like a DBZ way of fighting, as you can gather power for your Special Combo), or you can use Capcom (which I really recommend using, since you have control over how strong your SC is). Also, you can unlock many different versions of characters, even Evil Ryu! The only problem is that the DC controller will destroy your thumb with all the thumb-sliding you have to do for the special attacks.

That's what the cover had me believe and that's what I wanted to read about. Instead I got poorly written babble - so poorly written that I didn't finish this book. Tehmina left a kind husband and her daughter for Mustafa - and she expects me to feel sympathetic when Mustafa forces her new family into excile in England! She turns her eldest daughter away THREE times - and then moans about travelling every day to visit her husband in prison. She had THREE chances to leave her abusive husband, and each time she returned. I wanted to shake some sense into this woman who, the 3rd time, returned to her husband because their 'political destinies were so closely linked'. I think her political aspirations and need to be associated with a powerful man overshadowed the physical damage her husband did to her. I won't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why cry?","review":"Yes, the \\"horrific\\" Mustafa Khar is indeed a scoundrel, as the book depicts him to be. But within her shallow attempt to galvanize reader support, Tehmina fails to convince us that she deserves anything more than a medal for B grade tabloid literature. Ms. Durrani screams for pity, forgetting that her reputation and conduct too, have been to date, questionable. To the western readers' delight, I can imagine how a \\"Pakistani woman's plight\\" might simultaneously incite and propel an anti-feudal mentality, however a few things have gone unaccounted for...such as any real message between the covers. The novel is nothing more than an account of a failed marriage, between a terrible husband and an ungifted author. In any case, it has done little to further destroy two already shatterred reputuation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"OK, considering my age, my opinion may be ignored, but I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good book. This story covers about 20 years of Tehmina's life, discusses her early childhood, her marriage to Mustafa Khar, and the torment she was put through during her marriage. It wasn't very good for the impression people had of Pakistan abroad, but her frankness is remarkable. A good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty nice","review":"I think this book is great.

Nevertheless, the connectors on the plug I got would not cinch tight on #10 stranded wire, which should be a very common wire type for this application (and apparently among the gauges the plug is designed for). I had to bend two ears on each terminal to get an improved fit when the terminal was screwed down tight. This took care of two of the three prongs, but it was still easy to pull the wire out of the terminal on the third prong. Unfortunately the third prong was the one that required some persuasion to force it into its proper position (the other two went in quite easily), and the wire kept slipping out.After enough fussing it all went together, looks good, and works fine; but I was surprised by the hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I loved this book.

There is a small amount of information dealing with sample editing which is the one saving grace of the book. The MIDI information is simply WRONG.

I read through it quickly in one sitting and am about to pass it along after spending a short time with it.I found Ms. Bernard's personal history boring and tedious and the tips that are contained in the last half of the book much better presented in other weight loss books.If you are serious about losing weight, I would suggest that one work through a program that combines a sensible diet, exercise, and mindfulness. The Beck Diet Solution: Train Your Brain to Think Like a Thin Person by Judith S. Beck is an invaluable book that integrates all critical components for weight loss success and healthy living."},{"rating":"1","title":"A litte bit of a let down....","review":"I had trouble finishing the book. I did not find the inspiration I was hoping for as I have with other books. Writing down one's journey through weight loss is a daring move yet not all are worthwhile for everyone to read. I am in my late twenties and feel maybe this book is better for someone in their 30s or so given the age of the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Progress, not perfection\\"","review":"This is the best book on weight loss I've ever read! I laughed all the way through it and could relate to almost every piece of it. I found myself smiling and nodding in agreement repeatedly...sometimes cheering! If you've stuggled with weight issues for a good part of your life do yourself a favor and buy this book. A week after I bought it I picked up a copy for a good friend and she finished it before me. I will go back for a second read through very soon. Jami gives sound advice and combines personal experience with research and facts. I can't say enough about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Book","review":"Jami is a General in the Fat Wars.

Some of the studies have been pretty basic (especially David), but this book really resonated with us right now.Many people in NYC (and across the world) have seen their faith challenged - why would God allow this? what should we pray for? are we safe? etc. This book isn't going to offer any solid answers, but it pulls on excellent scripture to set you in the right direction. The first study (Hebrews 11) jumps right into historical characters in the bible (Abraham, Noah, Enoch) and explores their faith. Following chapters focus on Christ's words, Paul's life, David's actions and Abraham's willingness to sacrifice. There is also a nice mix of OT and NT readings for a balanced approach.If you are looking to explore (or strengthen) your faith, this book will pair you up with good scripture and set you in the right direction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book.","review":"I have read many Judy Blume books, I grew up with them.

First her parents get divorced. Second her brother Jeff runs away. The kids try to get the parents back together but does it work? Does Jeff come back?This book is all about divorce between two parents and what the children go through while it happens. It is a sad upsetting story because of all the pain Karen, Jeff and Amy have to go through. It is downhearted the way the parents feel about each other.I would recommend this book to any one who has divorced parents. Its words can show you a different divorce story and how the characters feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!","review":"This book was wonderfull.You could almost feel like you were in the divorce with Karen.

Sometimes divorce is the BEST thing that can happen to a family. At the time, divorce might be upsetting & Karen's family goes through a \\"mourning period\\" as families need to when the parents' marriage ends. But what this book excellently illustrates & that Karen comes to realize, is that divorce does NOT mean the end of a family or a \\"broken home.\\" She realizes that her mother is much happier & more relaxed, even though her mom cries when she remembers the marriage. One good message I got from the book was that it is better for a kid to grow up in a peaceful single-parent home than a tense two-parent home filled with fighting. Parts of the book are sad, but without being depressing. This book is very uplifting & inspiring the way Karen & her family pick up the pieces, rebuild & by the end, you know they're still a family & will go on."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great!

Great if you like to be reminded how lame salespeople act in the office."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHO EVER TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD WORK WITH MEN?!?!","review":"In short, this movie is one of the greatest, most over-looked, under-appreciated films ever made. I have yet to see a movie since the release of \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" that presents a better ensamble. (not to mention the incredible chemistry, as each player seems to feed off one another) This movie is w/o question my favorite flick of all time. Yet, I can go to the store and find 12 copies of Mariah Carry's \\"Glitter\\" on DVD and not find this one. Hey studio people, what the hell are you guys waiting for?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative intensity","review":"Quite simply, the best sales movie ever made. I know this is a tall statement, taking into consideration, Death of A Salesman. Excellent performances put in by an all-star cast of who's who in Hollywood. If you haven't had the pleasure to see this hard hitting \\"in your face\\" movie, I suggest you let the kids moan about going the extra walking distance to the video store in the local mall, and buy it immediately. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're in sales, this movie will settle into your bones..","review":"The greatest sales movie ever.If you are in sales, settle into an uncomfortable chair when it's raining and watch - and get set to feel both the worst and the best of your sales career all over again.The drill-down by the sales manager, the euphoria of the deal that was won, the utter confusion and denial of the won deal that goes south - it's all here for the taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true acting gem","review":"I can still remember seeing this movie at the theater and being blown away by all of the performances. Alec Baldwin turns in his most intense performance to date (even though it is only eight minutes long) and it is our first real chance to see Spacey show off his acting chops. Al Pacino is great as the smug, successful member of the group and Ed Harris is awesome (and hilarious) as the hot-head. Even though there is little action and it is tough to define its appeal to someone who has not seen it, I still watch it on a regular basis and enjoy it every time. Watch it soon if you are in the mood to see some great performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilary and Blah Blah Nyborg","review":"I'm so happy this has finally been released on DVD - and what a transfer - fantastic widescreen format, clean, crisp, and the best way I've ever viewed this movie. Deserverdly so, seeing as GGR is such a great movie.Even though direcror Foley's commentary on Disc 1 (widescreen) is definitely worth listening to, it isn't particularly insightful. The commentaries on Disc 2 (full screen) are better... it's good to hear input from Baldwin and Arkin, but I'd have loved to have had the Jack Lemmon commentary from the original laser disc version included as well.The extras are good, in their way, but it would have been great to have heard from Mamet himself, and get more insight into the movie/play, even though the stuff about salesmen is most certainly interesting and a worthy addition.There's also a cool Easter Egg on the second disc, but that's for closers only."},{"rating":"2","title":"A - B - C.....","review":"Have been wanting to get this flick for a long time. Alec Baldwin's 10 min performance at the beginning is worthy of an Academy nomination....a must see if you're in sales.

Sound and picture don't sync!","review":"Great movie. The reason for the 2 star review was that the streaming playback on Amazon was so poor that the voices and action never synced up. We paid more attention to that after a while than the actual movie. Bummer...Do yourself a favor and buy a hard copy of this great movie or stream it on a less buggy platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seven great actors let loose on a modern classic play","review":"There's not a wasted moment in this film of David Mamet's classic modern American tragedy about capitalism at it's most rabid. Set, where else?, in a Real Estate office, it is one of the best filmed plays of modern American life. BOYS IN THE BAND is another drama that is worth looking up. The poetic music of Mr Mamet's writing is retained intact and continues to glow and resonate through the superb work of the great acting led by Mr Pacino and Mr Lemmon. A film to return to over and over. The superbly ironic rendition of Mr Jarreau's singing of Blue Skies as the credits run at the close of the film still echoes in my mind. Quite a moving and resonant work of art. A document worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie. Period.","review":"I rented this movie based on the Amazon recommendation because I liked the movie Boiler Room. I thought this movie would be good because it dealt with real estate. The whole movie revolves around struggling real estate investment salesman who work for a company that sells the real estate investments. About 80% of the movie takes place in the company office and they talk back and forth about how to sell to customers and making commissions. I would much rather watch Wall Street and Boiler Room than this boring movie...avoid. I wrote this review while the movie was streaming (via Amazon Video on Demand) because I was extremely bored and disappointed by this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The.......!???","review":"Quick synopsis: These 4 or 5 guys sit around their real estate office for 2 hours talking about not getting good leads....PERIOD.This is SO boriing!

I rented it and was severely disappointed. I have an MBA in finance and a PhD in psychology, so it's not a matter of a lack of qualifications to appreciate a fine film. With the exception of a few lines here and there, the movie is just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"two wasted hours and [$$$] bucks down the drain","review":"A complete waste of time - the point (if any) is made in 10 minutes and then rehashed over and over and over. So real estate sales people are lying cheating scum bags, which is nothing to make a whole movie about. Will the sequel be two hours of used car slalesmen swearing and lying to customers and each other?"},{"rating":"1","title":"my eyes \\"Always Be Closing\\"","review":"The play become move became boring after 20 seconds. David Mamet's Pulitzer winning play was a waste of a movie. It gathered a star cast of people and did abosolutely nothing with them. A group of caniving men stuck in the office using darwins' theory of natural selection to the fullest was thoughtless. the plot was clear to early. And the countinous use of profanity is really the only reason that i could not shut my eyes. but most of all we must not forget the cliffhanger of an ending which made no since. if it wasn't for the fact that i hadd to do this as a class project i would have thrown this ... dvd outta the window"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great? Wait a second...","review":"My friend and I read many reviews of this movie- rave reviews. We are wondering if we missed something, because it is honestly one of the least interesting movies each of us has seen. Riveting?... Possibly in its ability to lull one to sleep. Even as fans of the movie's actors, we were left extremely unsatiated. If you are older, possibly this is for you. If you are looking for action, this would be your last choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHINEY OLD MEN...","review":"I feel like I was the one who was scammed!

I am surprised so many others enjoyed it.This is the only Al Pacino film I did not enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWILIGHT ZONE-ISH...","review":"This is quite a remarkable film. Really it views like an extended \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode: on the razor's edge of reality and surreality.Someone has suggested the story is a metaphor for Regan era greed and the (de-)evolution of managerial hypercapitalism: this critique is doubly true in the Bush 2 era.Mamet's ellipitical dialogue is an Hemmingwayesque wonder. Excellent acting all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is the Glen Ross?","review":"I saw this movie and really like it, but I was curious about the title. Who is Glen Ross?"},{"rating":"2","title":"No chases...just exceptional acting from an all-star cast","review":"If you're looking for a smart, sharp dialogue-filled extravaganza, look no further. This film is brilliant, it's just that simple. Alec Baldwin, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Jack Lemmon, Ed Harris, and Alan Arkin, with that cast, how can you go wrong? The majority of this film takes place in and around a real-estate office. Yet the script and dialogue are so spectacular, that you really won't notice. Without giving the film away, it just shows the depths that some will stoop, to save their job, and the depths that companies will stoop to motivate their employees. One caution, this film has extremely harsh language. If you're easily offended by 'foul' language, you might need to pass. There is 'foul' language a plenty in this film, but if you can get through it, you'll really witness something special in film."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Acting Feast!","review":"The only movie I can think of with 3 Best Actor Oscar-winners (Lemmon, Pacino and Spacey) and it shows! In addition, you get two fine character actors in Harris and Arkin and a Hollywood star (Baldwin) slumming in a non-featured role. Add to that David Mamet's finest writing and you have a film that is endlessly compelling! This is, IMHO, Lemmon's finest work, and that is saying something! You can truly see in this film why he has earned the title \\"America's Olivier.\\" The movie also benefits from having someone other than Mamet direct his script. We avoid the monotone line readings that sometimes plague his films (which, however, are an oddly fascinating trademark nonetheless). This is a modern \\"Death Of A Salesman\\" and a movie you will find yourself watching again and again for the acting and the writing. Waiting on the DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glengarry Glen Ross","review":"Very poor sound quality. Difficult to hear. Fuzzyness & static throughout the entire movie. Very dissapointing. Normally do not have this issue with your movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"A singular motion picture. David Mamet and the cast absolutely rule.

The text is really sharp and well-executed and challenging to the viewer, and we get top-notch performances across the board, particularly from Jack Lemmon, superb as Levine, the character most resembling Miller's Willy. This is somewhere in between Mamet's own arty, leftfield tendencies and a mainstream gritty urban movie and the combination works well, popularising Mamet's sometimes alinenating work. Top stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEVER LOSES ITS 'ZING' NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU SEE IT !","review":"I first saw this on the big screen and again when it came out on the movie channels; I had the opportunity to recently view it again on video and still enjoyed every minute of it. The performances of Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino and Kevin Spacey alone, are enough to keep this film going. Top notch all the way. Great insight into how far someone would go when they are backed into a personal and professional corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life of a Salesman","review":"When I first saw this film. I winced.

Interesting characters and a simple plot, well acted... should be in the bag, just don't know where it went wrong... No wonder I had never heard of it. If you want to watch a better depiction of a pressurised, sales environment try Boiler Room, Swimming with Sharks or Wall Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I am giving this film 2 starts for the acting, which is good.The movie itself was a huge disappointment. It's obvious that the film is based on a play; the way the actors interrupt eachother and repeat certain phrases makes you feel like you're watching a theatre performance. I didn't care for a single character in the film, every line is screamed, every third word is a curse. I felt exhausted half way through and my mind began to wander. Real estate is just not that exciting and if you find it too stressful, get another job."},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not convince me....","review":"Unlike most of the reviewers here and on IMDB, I didn't like it. To me, the acting seemed contrived. I have been in places that operated like this (luckily I was a consultant, not actually working for the company) and I have seen what the actors here attempted to portray firsthand. I think they did their best but it did not 'feel' like the real thing to me. Baldwin's famous speech seemed so scripted to me, the words are right, but the way it was delivered seemed too fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glengarry Glen Ross","review":"Very disappointing!

It did rain and rain and rain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kill Me Now.","review":"Great casting, but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film. It's so aggravating. I want to chew my own leg off half way into it. I know part of it is everyone is a \\"talker\\" of a various sort. They're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell. I just don't think it works. Otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived. The best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves. It gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name. Mamet's an extraordinary genius-writer, but this did not belong on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated.","review":"The stars are for the superb acting of veteran actors, Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon, and Ed Harris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee's for closers!!!","review":"Glengarry Glen Ross is a sleeper film that brings a viewer into the often brutal world of sales. It is not solely a depressing film though, as it has so many hilarious moments. The all-star cast delivers a wonderful film for all who are interested not just in the life of a salesman, but in human motivation. After seeing the film, and specifically Alec Baldwin's performance, the following lines will become etched in your mind, \\"Put that coffee down! Coffee's for closers!!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Be Closing---Pure Genius","review":"Calling this a movie is an injustice.

Awful because, the \\"real thing,\\" the allegory for the Reagan Administration, the \\"evils of the free enterprise system,\\" wasn't real at all. There is no sales office on the planet where this type of \\"lead chaos,\\" language, mutinous and insubordinate talk, et al goes on - despite those who would like to ascribe the worst to business and business people. Baldwin's character is total BS; contests NEVER are Cadillac, then steak knives, then you're fired. Spacey's character is preposterous as it gets for a sales manager. The \\"second thoughts\\" buyer is a well-heeled idiot, and how many of those do you know? Using the \\"F Word\\" 500 times in a film does not make the dialog \\"gritty and real.\\" Yes, some of the performances were top notch, and yes, there ARE a great many abuses in business, we see that every day, unfortunately; but this is just nonsense on a big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Angry Film!","review":"Great cast right? That's why I bought it.Let me tell you, I've never seen a movie with so much yelling in my entire life. Now I can handle the f-bomb in most movies but this one went over the top, especially when it's being screamed at you for an hour and a half. This one ended up on my shortlist of films my wife and I simply couldn't sit through.

To add insult to injury, Amazon.com list this film as one of their \\"essential videos.\\" The reviewer is especially smitten with \\"(David) Mamet's scathingly rich dialogue.\\" What a joke! The interaction among the co-workers in this play, the foul, dirty, hate-filled language they constantly abuse each other with, SIMPLY DOES NOT, AND CAN NOT, EXIST THE REAL WORLD.

Very depressing. Good acting by the characters but Jack Lemmon's whining wore me out after about 10 minutes. Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice acting","review":"I wouldn't rate this a must see, but if you're a sucker for good acting, this is a great movie to watch. It epitomizes various employee attitudes(from around the world I would say) ranging from lazy detachment to desperation. If you're an employee, it is very likely that you see yourself in one of the characters and makes you think about whether it's something you like. In any case, the twists and turns of the movie make for great entertainment value for a weekend with a bowl of popcorn on your lap."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFULLY ACTED, BUT HARD TO ENJOY WATCHING THESE PARASITES!","review":"This is film is really hard to rate as I loved the cast and performances, but it's story of ruthless salespeople had me cringing in disgust! Pacino and Lemmon stand out in this insightful film of the pressures of salesmanship and what lengths these parasites will go through to close the deal. This film has a ridiculous amount of profanity, so if that bothers you....don't watch this movie! I usually don't mention anything about profanity, but even I found this excessive. It's a very good movie, but because of my total loathing of these people I will never watch it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemmon doing Lemmon and it's all great fun","review":"My, my--what a cast, including Lemmon and Pacino as desperate real estate agents. .

Good riffs, catchy verses and choruses make this album a good buy for a different taste of modern metal/rock.also,the temporary tattoo included is cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold-chilling and haunting","review":"Before I bought this cd, i had only ever hear 1 Cold tune-No One. I forgot about them until I saw that they were putting out a new album. I read some reviews on the album and finally decided to pick it up.... The melodies that Scooter puts together are amazing, the guitar riffs are awesome and Sam's hard, primal drum banging make this cd a great buy. Each song brings a different feel when you listen to it. They all are haunting, they stick in your head but they also are quite chilling. Their sound is a tribute to their name-Cold. Each song has its high points but not many low ones (ok, so some of the songs don't really do it for me like Whatever You Became and Black Sunday). If your a fan of Staind or other bands like them then you'll probably enjoy Cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album","review":"This Album is for everyone who loves rock music. one of my favorite songs on this album is \\"stupid girl\\".Also, the limited edition DVD is really cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure to be stuck in the CD player for awhile!","review":"I first saw the video for 'Stupid Girl' and decided to do some research into their music. I have to say I'm impressed and see them becoming big with their sound. Knowing a little more about what kind of place the lyrics are coming from based on the lead singer's personal tragedies, it's nice to hear music from the heart, not just metal-whining. All the tracks are powerful and I thought the track \\"Day Seattle Died' was very well done (about Layne Staley and Cobain). Overall great CD and happy to have it in the CD player!! These guys are a breath of fresh air in a sea of copy-cat bands/sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but this still rocks","review":"This album is definitely a Cold album. Even though they do seem to lessen the heavy metal sound for a more melodic one, it nonetheless is within the Cold range and is a great album. The opening track of the album, Remedy, is a great energetic track with its heavy guitar, getting the listener pumped for the rest of the songs. The album's single, Stupid Girl, is another great one. Although this track seems to be outside its musical range, it nevertheless sounds great. All in all, this album is great for the hard rock fan who is open-minded about trying something a little different."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very disappointing.","review":"I really love Cold. I thought their first two albums were excellent, and I've been looking forward to this for a long time, but I really can't begin to describe how let down I was upon receiving this. More than once, I thought I'd bought the new Staind album by mistake. It sounds like they're actually trying to sound like Staind on practically every song. Since I'm not a fan of Staind, and have always thought that Cold had a much more interesting sound, that is not a good thing.And one more thing: Where is \\"Gone Away\\"? They release this amazing song, put it on a freakin' WWF album, and then don't even put it on the new album, even though it's a fantastic song? I'm sorry, I don't know what's going on this band at the moment, but I think my respect for them has significantly dropped.Oh, and \\"Stupid Girl\\" is just awful. I think I'm going to go listen to \\"13 Ways to Bleed Onstage\\", to try to erase this atrocity from my memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely phenomenal rock album","review":"This is an absolutely phenomenal rock album that deserves nothing less than 5/5 stars. For me, this was the album of the year, one that I listened to all summer, and that I will surely listen to for years to come. Cold completely live up to their potential here; it is an album you can listen to \\"as an album,\\" as opposed to just skipping certain songs. Start to finish, it just completely rocks. If you enjoy hard, yet melodic rock that delivers, than this is an album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album of 2003","review":"If there's only one cd you get this year, get cold's \\"year of the spider\\". The first time I heard y.o.t.s it gave me chills up my spine; even the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. The powerful lyrics paired perfectly with Scooter's mysterious voice will make you want to listen this whole cd again and again. This album will definitely be at the top of the lists in no time. From the first time you pop it into your disc player, you will know you spent the best 15 bucks for a cd in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected","review":"When I first heard Cold's single \\"Stupid Girl\\" No matter what I knew I had to get it.At first I wasn't sure what to expect since I only listened to their LP. So when I purched it I only listened to Stupid Girl but after a while I heard songs like \\"Wasted Years\\",\\"Suffocate\\" and \\"Dont Belong\\". After that I decided to listen to the entire album which was absolutly estaunishing.All I'm trying to say is if you do not own this work of art go and buy it right now. Because if you don't you will be missing a great great CD.GO BUY IT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get cold again!","review":"Oh my god when i heard this album, I almost cried. This album is the best thing ever, they have out done themselves. Remedy, Cure my Tragedy, sad/happy, and gone away(bonus track) are my favorites. I was also expecting the same thing as the other 2 albums. I was stunned how emotional and sad this cd is. It is just so perfect, every song. I must have listen to it 30 times already! The dvd is kick buttocks too, with live stuff, making of album, making of stupid girl, the video ect. I use this cd as a tool to heal me when im sad lately, thats how much this album means to me. Just sit there and sing with it all day it will take it all away. So if you like cold, if you don't get this cd you must have something wrong with you. If your not, or didn't like the other 2 albums. Think of them as a new band, newer sound, some what heavy, but a lot more meaning. You will grow to love cold, you have my word! NOW GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this album ownz","review":"I never really listened to Cold much in the past but now I have a good reason to look forward to anything they put out in the future.

I still consider it one of my favorite albums. So of course when Year of the Spider was released I was anxious to get it. Unfortunately what I found I did not like. It's been said before in these reviews and I'll say it again...this is mainstream rock meant to bring in dollars from mass appeal. The transformation from the debut album (Cold) - which isn't anything to right home about - to this one is astounding. The production on \\"13 Ways\\" blows \\"Year of the...\\" away. So, I would recommend you listen to this first before purchasing. And if you are looking for something with more of an edge, than definitely look into their second album (13 Ways to Bleed Onstage). I would avoid the first album as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy this, or U mxxherfxxker","review":"Liste, this album absolutely kick axx.

Ha, that's like comparing a cathedral to a brick.This CD destroys more souls than 666 black metal bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I've owned in a while","review":"I am a huge Cold fan and must say that this is thier best album yet. My favorite song on here by far has to be the hidden track \\"Gone Away\\" which you have to skip about 10 minutes of dead air after \\"Kill The Music Industry.\\" The second half of the album lacks the power and emotion the first half has, but all of the songs are amazing. AWSOME buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold almost reaches peak again","review":"THis cold cd was probably the most anticipated cd i wanted to buy in a long time. there last 13 way to bleed was the album ever since pantera's Far Beyond Driven. Anyways at first i was torn. I was let down becasue it was not an instant classic. After listining to it a few times it had 5 stellar songs and the rest were just either radio friendly or fillir crap. It was more polished and comercialized unlike there previous 2 which were raw, harder, darker, and edger. DOnt get me wrong this cd is good, but not a must have. To me this cd was more for the younger masses. the best songs are Cure My Tragedy, Wasted Years, Remedy, dont belong, and like the rockin KIll the music industry. It is short but faster paced. I really loved this band it seemed when there were not so famous that they were better. Scooter is still amaazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing","review":"I'm an avid Cold fan, and of all the albums, I'd have to say that \\"Year of the Spider\\" is Cold's best album. Not only is the music great, but it catches you on an emotional level. Cold has really grown since \\"Cold\\" and \\"13 Ways to Bleed On Stage\\".I love all of the songs, but the once that reach me the most are \\"Remedy\\", \\"Stupid Girl\\", \\"Wasted Years\\" and \\"Black Sunday\\".I can't wait for their next album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd, Bush","review":"If you like the bands listed above in that order then you will like this album. For me, I can't listen to an album like this too long before getting bored. Many of the songs sound the same, especially the vocals. The vocals are good, but too much of the same sound gets me about three songs into the album before I'm looking for another CD. 13 Ways is a better album. It has more variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame...a not a good album at all.","review":"To sum it up, Cold started theier album career with a very good debut album that seemed to garner the band a bit of street cred as a band who were dangerous and dark, dude.They could have even been quoted in the same sentance as a band like TooL, they were that good.But this album is just what Nickleback and Creed fans have been waiting for, slow mid tempo riffs, detuned guitars, boring meaningless lyrics, basically everything that you've heard before, and perfect for the mindless mass American market.Which is a shame coz they could have been a good modern heavy metal band, but i guess they still have to pay off there label advance, and had to give thier sound mass appeal.If you dont have taste in good rock, you will love this, if you are a puritan and hard rock obbsessive, you wont even care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, mundane, psuedo-hard rock","review":"While the first single Stupid Girl caught my attention, the rest of this album made me sorry to have wasted my money on it. My previous experience with Cold had been the song Bleed (with Aaron Lewis, horray for cookie cutter hard rock...) which I liked, so I hoped for more from this cd.This album offers nothing new or imaginative. Lyrically its stereotypical i-feel-sorry-for-myself-and-want-everyone-else-to rock (Staind fans will like this one), and musically its the same formula repeated 13 times. I had a hard time finishing any of these songs, being sufficiently bored by the second verse most times.Stay away from this one. If you really want some angry music, listen to some Metallica or something with some creativity included."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Cold enters the mainstream...","review":"Cold had take the necessary step to become a more known band: make an album more accesible to all people. But they're not sold out, if you're wondering.In 'Year of the Spider' you can easily recognize Cold's particular style, but you also will notice the 'radio-friendly' touch in a couple of songs, specially in the first single, the catchy 'Stupid Girl'.This is a great album that will not disappoint old Cold fans and it surely will make a lot of new fans of this great band.My favourite songs are 'Remedy', 'Sad Happy', 'Rain song', 'Black Sunday' and 'Stupid Girl'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reeks of Fred Durst","review":"I really liked this group, when they were Stained, the CD sounds EXACTLY like Staind's. So, if you really like Stained and cannot wait two more weeks for their new CD, get this one. It's not a bad sound at all, but it's been done hense the two star raiting. These guys look really [good] in their video, but it is all just a show, they are soft all over, I'll be the first to coin the phrase \\"radio metal\\" because they are hard, harder than Phil Collins, Sting, Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, and the like, but they got nothing on Metallica, Megadeth, Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, Godsmack and other rarely played metal music. In fact, when I first saw these guys, Godsmack is what I thought, a Godsmack knock off, but i found they were nowhere near that caliber. Apparently the band has been together for 15 years, as Limp Bizkit and Stained.

This is another overrated band that lacks melody and I feel sorry for the fans who have been brainwashed by their record company and radio stations that have pushed this \\"melodic brilliance\\" (sarcastic of course) upon the tone deaf of America.

It was my faithful companion for more than 2 decades. In all that time, it was a great conundrum to me. I just didn't get it. When I heard Abbado with the CSO, the clouds cleared, the birds began to chirp, and the babbling brook began to babble.I came to see it as a powerful, universal pastoral symphony and NOT the lugubrious, soul-searching, bone-chilling music it was usually portrayed as by music critics who did not understand it any better than me.

It's more of a technical report bound in a cheesey plastic-faced report cover. I should look a little more closely -- this might not even be real offset printing, but a xerographic reproduction.

I CALLED THUMPER DIRECTLY AND I WAS INSTRUCTED TO SHIP IT BACK AND PAY THE OUTRAGEOUS $35+ FOR SHIPPING.

Result was multiple round to oval gouges in my skin (more than 18 in all) on low back, calf, thigh, and ankle. Sort of a cross between a gouge and a bruise, as there was no overt bleeding but rather sores developed everywhere the device 'thumped' me when off center which was often because it is heavy and has an extremely awkward center of gravity. Worst thing is that every sore became infected. Lesions were painful very discolored, and didn't heal on their own. Healing was slow even with daily applications of antibiotic ointment. After more than a month sores are still discolored and healing slowly.

I also purchased the professional model with 8 balls. I like that, but it is too much for them as they have low muscle mass.

The weight of the thumper allows you to guide the machine easily down your back, so that you reach those sore muscles, and the thumper is easy to use on your own body.At a glance, the product might seem expensive, but it's actually the price of one professional massage, and if used correctly, you will be able to enjoy the thumper for many years and get a high quality massage ona daily basis.This is a wonderful product, and you will certainly be happy you purchased it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumper Mini Pro2","review":"This massager is shaped like the Homedics I used to have.

When I contacted Pro Therapy Supplies to return this unit - because you have to contact them to get a return authorization number(sigh) - they informed me that there would be a 10% restocking fee. So I figure I'm out about $30-$35 total just for ordering this product even though I didn't keep it.

Repeat viewing of this timeless classic is necessary to garner further appreciation for the quality of acting of these two legends. The mysterious allure of Bogart is conveyed as well, if not better, in this film than any of his others and Bacall's sultry voice and slinky figure clearly serve as an origin upon which many contemporary (e.g.-Kathleen Turner) portrayals are based. This film has chemistry, timing and subtle wit but falls a bit short of a 5 star classic based on the less than epic script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality DVD - The Big Sleep","review":"The Big Sleep is one of my favorite films so I was very disappointed to discover that the DVD is a very poor quality transfer.

Harry Morgan (Humphrey Bogart), a tough and professional fisherman, arranges fishing trips for people and he currently has an American client who owes him a large amount of money. In addition, there are some Frenchmen who want to hire him for a night trip, but it is not for fishing. The atmosphere is getting more tense as the local police force kills Harry's American client and brings Harry in for questioning. The director creates a terrific film as he tells the story about Harry who tries to find a way to get back on his feet during a rough time, which leaves the audience with a good film experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bogie and Bacall","review":"This is a wonderful movie!

It arrived early, in perfect condition. I enjoyed watching the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bacalls first time","review":"Bogart and Bacal's sexual tension in this remake of Casablanca is so thick you can cut it with a knife. They had almost instant chemistry off screen and from the \\"you know how to whistle\\" scene on Bacal gets better. Even picking up comic business for the scene where Bogart is digging a bullet out of the French Resistence \\"leader\\". Walter Brenan also gives a good supporting prefomance as a drunk sidekick. Of course Bogart does not phone it in; he never does. In some ways the film is better than Casablanca because of the Bogart/Bacal relationship. And if you care about acting in films, this one lets you watch Bacal go from model to actress. One problem, they insisted on having Bacal sing. But the Hoggie Carmical at the piano is a treat beyond that song.But Bacal sings in the Big Sleep too with more success. If your a Hemingway fan, you will find that the screen writers used little beyond the title of his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful classic!","review":"I highly recommend this film.

It didn't really matter because I ended up getting what I didn't want in the first place. I would advise against buying this from amazon. Go to Wal-Mart or Best Buy where they most likely have the the same items except with the nice cases for the same price. The movies however are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Dialogue!","review":"For whatever reason, I was taken aback by how much I enjoyed To Have and Have Not the first time I saw it, and every subsequent viewing has left just as strong an impression. It's the dialogue that gets me each time. It's witty, smart, wry, and in the capable hands of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, it's a treat to hear. Bogart gives a relaxed, assured performance that ranks with his best, and Bacall is a lot of fun in her first film, mixing sexiness and humour with a quiet vulnerability. Walter Brennan, very good as Bogart's drunk sidekick, adds to the story. There's not a whole lot to the plot, but there is a lot of chemistry, and when mixed with the great dialogue, the viewer gets to sit back and just enjoy the show that Bogart and Bacall put on."},{"rating":"2","title":"maybe just whistle","review":"If only all movie couples had this much chemistry. The Big Sleep is an intricate film noir - so much so that it's easy to lose track of the plot if you blink during a piece of dialogue - while To Have And To Have Not is more Casablanca-esque complete with WWII setting and reluctant but always heroic Bogart.Key Largo and Dark Passage are the weaker of the four, but the former has some interesting characters and the latter picks up after they do away with the first-person camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"what more can be said","review":"Plenty of wonderful comments have been made, all of them well deserved for this amazing film. I'll only add that despite how wonderful the chemistry is between Bogart and Bacall for me the core of this film is Bogart's relationship with his drunken sidekick Eddie. His love for a man who is wholly unloveable and annoying speaks volumes about this character, and Bogart plays it perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bogie and Bacall","review":"What's not to like about the first time these two acted together? A great film for its time, showing Bogart at his best and Bacall at her sultriest. Nice and clear DVD, so it's is the best viewing of this film I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly my favorite Bogart","review":"The reason why I say that this film is \\"possibly\\" my favorite Bogart is that it is an excellent film, but one of many excellent Bogart films. The dialogue is wonderful as is the story and the acting, but what really makes this film shine is the relationship between Bogart and Bacall. They are perfect together, absolutely perfect. If you want to see one of the great love stories ever put on film, and one of the few films superior to the original novel, you must see _To Have and Have Not_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a beginner","review":"This book is not a good first text for a person trying to learn algebraic geometry.

He is not the most lyrical or heroic of pianists. Where this performance differs from others, as you'd expect, is Harnoncourt. He has ideas about Brahms that cana't be ignored. The strings play with no vibrato at times, the repeated accents in the Scherzo are clipped staccato bursts (I felt a little sea sick), and above all he inserts hairpin turns in sustained notes, a la Baroque and Rococco performance practice.You will find these quirks either interesting or irritating. They at least add an element of originality. Otehrwise, Harnoncourt chiefly feels that Brahms shouldn't be overblown--this is most evident in the modetly phrased slow movement. I liked that, and the sweet Concertgebouw accompaniment throughout, but I wouldn't say that conducting quirks make for greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"If built, I doubt this gun would last 1000 rounds, due to the soft materials used, but at least that's 1000 rounds more than most others (too complicated to make) would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expedient Homemade Firearms: The 9mm Submachine Gun","review":"A very interesting read, simple step by step instructions.If you can obtain the materials & trust the authors word-in no time at all you would probably have a neat little weapon on your hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"just hard to find materials","review":"I found out the book satisfactory.Gun easy to built & require a lot of patience to complete project.

To be frank, this is not Bunyan at his best. He's written better stuff (see Pilgrim's Progress). The material is pretty dry and half the time, he's battling high church Anglicanism. The few diamonds here are his descriptions of prayer being from the heart, not an formulistic external exercise.The backdrop of where the book was written (Bunyan was imprisioned for his Puritan beliefs after Cromwell died and England reverted back to monarchy) is very interesting and I suggest all to familiarize themselves with that interesting period."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Good\\" Ibsen","review":"Brand is the flip side of Peer Gynt. Ibsen may well have intended to write heroism into Brand, a charismatic dissenting priest, but could not breathe any life into his protagonist at all. Brand is cold, righteous, merciless, uncompromising. The play is dated, dull, static, but of historical interest to Ibsen scholars, since he may have learned plenty by writing Brand. The rather rigid Norwegian state/church of his time loved it, granted Henrik a permanent poet stipend for Brand. Modern gentle readers may roll their eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This single contains two remixes of \\"Dance Commander\\" and the original album version.

The music sounds nothing like the original \\"Dance Commander\\", and the words don't go well with the beat. The third and best track is the album version of \\"Dance Commander\\".

Next the mounting bracked fits into the existing fan housing but it is 3/4 inches offset from the correct position to align the fan blades with the housing. In a couple of hours I was able to build an adapter by using 3/4\\" X 3/8\\" spacers and using longer mounting bolts to make it work.If I had to do it over I would spring for the OEM motor even at 3X the price.

Music is all about evolution and the true artist is an always changing form...Perry is a musical shadow, never the same. Jane's it is not, but it is something new, give it a try. If you are like me, and have every album under the sun of his, it will add to your collection...if you have never heard of Perry before....buy an earlier album and listen to the genius. Hey also check out... the Janes Addicition fan site that has everything you could ever want to know about this mythical band.Bravo Perry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of talent","review":"I have been waiting a while for this album to come out, and this is the best he can come up with? It's all dated!!! There is nothing new or innovatve at all on this album. This coming from Perry is a huge dissapointment. He has lost it, and the only way to stay in the limelight is to re-unite Jane's...once again. Please give me a break! Either stay together or don't re-unite and keep Jane's as it is...a legend. Do not waste your cash on this piece of electronic crap. I would have goven it no stars but unfortunately, amazon doesn't give you that choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You'd Expect","review":"First of all, I was never a huge fan of Jane's Addiction, so if you are you might want to disregard this review. They were one of the most interesting bands from the early nineties, but I never enjoyed listening to them that much. Perhaps the best part of the band was Dave Navarro's excellent guitar work, not Farrell's high-pitched vocals. This album is not Jane's Addiction. It is techno-electronic trash that is only redeemed by some interesting song writing. Farrell's vocals don't even sound the way they did when he was with Jane's Addiction or Porno For Pyros. Not being a fan of Farrell's previous work, I found little to enjoy with this album. Jane's fans should definitely check out Dave Navarro's 'Trust No One'. It's a lot truer to the band's original music, and it's a lot more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man Of Mystery","review":"A very interestng and reative solo recording from Perry Farrell that one cannot categorize. It's full of eclectic music, middle eastern tones and just extremely avant-garde sounds. I like Perry becuase you never know what he is going to present you with. What ever it is....it is always original and grondbreaking. Could be all out thrash or a tender lullaby with 100 different meanings. That is the beauty of Perry. I bought this becuase I heard snipets of it and was really sold when I heard his middle eastern influenece. Somewhat experimental but not too risky. If you like Janes Addiction and you like Perry and his devoid of definitions, you will enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, But what the Hell Happened?","review":"If you are wondering that this album may be the continuation of Porno for Pyros and Jane's addiction, than you're dead wrong. Perry Farrell comes out with a experimental sound. Something that Moby and Beck would create. This album is not flop, But I would prefer sampling it before you buy it. I heard that Perry Farrell is coming out with a new band at lollapalooza called Sattelite Party, and I believe they sound similair to this. I also heard that a new Porno for Pyros album might be released. But I don't know when."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"The music on this release is every bit as lush, intriguing, mystifying, and flat out gorgeous as the cover art would lead you to believe.

This is absolutely his best work since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Janes or Pyros but very good","review":"Experimental release by Farrell is enjoyable and creative, the title song is one of my favorites by him. If you are a fan of Perry's music I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of talent","review":"I have been waiting a while for this album, or anything by Perry for that matter. This is what I waited for? This has got to be one of the, no THE WORST records of the year. Perry is usually ahead a few years of what is going on in music. This ... has already been done and already dated, I mean, this sounds more retro than what should really be the future. The first track is not thing more than your standard junlge beat, some trippy music and Perry's vocals-really origional. If this is the best he can do, then there is no hope-he has lost all credibilty for making music. He knew he made ... so He, once again brings out Jane's Addiciton. Either reunite for good, or let it be what it is, a legend. I would give this no stars, but unfortunately they have it from 1-5. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind blowing mix of Reggae and Reggaeton","review":"I highly recommend this album, especially to anyone unfamiliar to reggaeton music.

Her voice is the only redeeming quality here, but on her albums you know you're going to get that anyway. So, along with the 'Rainbow' album, it's the music that lets this one down. One to be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read!!","review":"For a Harry Potter and a Philosophy fan, I was pleased and excited to find this book. It took me less than a day to read and I was fully amazed.

I still get into conversations about Harry Potter based on that book, and it's amazing.This book has truly been the light shining over Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remedial Philosophy Gone Wrong","review":"I was pretty excited when I got this book on sale. I'm a huge Harry Potter nerd and I love applying different readings to my favorite texts. Not only is the text extremely basic, but the factual references, despite the over-quotation, are incorrect! Reading some of the essays, I questioned whether the authors ever read the Harry Potter books, much less any Philosophy.This isn't a discussion of philosophy in Harry Potter so much as a basic account of philosophy with some characters from the Harry Potter series thrown in for good measure.And the facts! One of the essays says that Winky is Dobby's sister. Since when? Another essay says that \\"Voldemort\\" means, and I quote: \\"...a horrifying name that means something like 'Will to Death.' This title itself is a lie, because he doesn't have a death wish\\" (140). Well of course it's a lie- that's not what \\"Voldemort\\" means. JK Rowling got it from the French \\"vol de mort\\" which means, literally, flight from/of death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potterverse taken to a whole new level","review":"This book was quite an interesting read.

I was pleasantly surprised. As a person that has read many of the older philosophical texts, I know how hard it is to sometimes understand the reasonings and logic presented. I think this book presents its ideas in a very clear way that even the youngest audiences of Harry Potter would be able to have a good introduction to philosophical thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough information","review":"this book does not go into enough depth to be of much use as you shop for dolls. you can use it to get some info on year produced, and to get a rough idea of where each doll fits into the larger scheme, but to do it right, you really need a book that includes much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much info lost","review":"Please, would someone step outside of their own personal collection and write a TRUE guide to Vintage Barbie and Friends plus fashion and structures?

I was desperate to find something to clean up the carpet spots.... this stuff is amazing!!! I bought a one gallon kit, whick had the black light and the large syringe (for injecting under the carpet) to start with, and it worked so well I bought the 4 gallon set, to have on hand for clean up. (Decided I wanted to be prepared.) It works fabulously on cat urine, which I think may be the worst smell on the planet. I have recommended this to several people. You may have to treat a spot a few times to completely eliminate the smell, but to date, I haven't found anything that works to remove that odor like this stuff.

I will say that the smell of urine disappears, but then again, i dont have the nose of a cat. lol Usually when a cat goes out of the litter box, there's a reason for it...something is stressing it out...a change in the house of some kind, litterbox not clean, has a cover, etc. When you find the stress, it usually solves the problem.

Except for Linda, I think the others hold their own vocally - Joe English (who isn't) in particular on \\"Must Do Something About It.\\" Also, Laine's \\"Time to Hide\\" is a great song, the best he's done since Go Now. \\"San Ferry Anne\\" and \\"Warm and Beautiful\\" are both mature, beautiful ballads. Imagine Joe Cocker covering Warm and Beautiful. Finally, add \\"Silly Love Songs\\" and \\"Let 'Em In,\\" the hits (both of which are really well produced), and you've got one Macca's better albums (sans Cook of the House).

Likewise, \\"Beware My Love\\" throughout the years has remained one of my personal favorite McCartney cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical McCartney Solo Album","review":"This is a typical McCartney/Wings solo album -- a few good songs and the rest filler (if not junk).

Criminally under-rated, the album has been criticized for its inclusion of songs by other members of the band. This misses the point - Wings (especially around the time of the '76 tour) were a working band. Time to Hide is the best non-Mccartney Wings' song and Joe English's contribution is lovely. She's my Baby has one of the most infectious melodies you're likely to hear and Beware My Love is THE lost Mccartney classic. Add to this the two hit singles (amazingly not the best tracks on the album) and you get what is, along with Band on the Run, Wings' finest moment.

Other than the Denny Lane tracks, it doesn't really work.Bottom Line: If you are interested in obtaining the song Beware My Love, go for it.

It dates from 1989 but there are only fourteen tracks, which was short order even then.The discography lacks essential details, but indicates the inclusion of three unissued takes (Hey! Young Fella\\"; \\"Wild Cat\\"; and \\"Jig Saw Puzzle Blues\\"). There's no mention of the fact that \\"\\"Satan's Holiday\\" was recorded in London, nor that \\"Hiawatha's Lullaby\\" was never issued in America.The music itself is delightful, not least for the inclusion on seven numbers of that giant of the bass sax Adrian Rollini, and if you just want a sampler of what Venuti (and Lang) were about then this will not disappoint.

And it looks pretty much the same, but it doesn't fit exactly the same as the original in my 6 year old toilet. It works, but had to put the chain from the flapper into a different hole and you now have to hold the handle down for a second.Since this is such a specialty toilet, I didn't want to go to the local Home Depot or Lowes and have trial and error to get something to fit. I did pay extra to have it shipped 2-3 days and it arrived before I was expecting it - great service. I ordered online after doing the math and figured I would spend almost as much in gas to go to a plumbing supply store that stocked TOTO parts as the shipping cost.By the way, love the toilet - and the guy who put it in hadn't seen one before and he was so impressed that he went out and bought his parents one as they were having issues with their low volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inexcusable piece of junk","review":"ZERO STARS. Yes, its from Toto. Yes it fits. Yes its pretty. BUT IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK. When you look at the other reviews do they say WHY their levers broke? I know why... the handle is cheap plastic that fatigues, cracks, bends and breaks on the inside (where it is hard to see). It can't handle the stress of pushing the trip lever up and down day in and day out. OF COURSE TOTO KNOWS the part won't hold up, but anything to save a buck. Thank you, Toto.Do you have another choice in getting a replacement part?? Metal parts exist, but are even more expensive!

Having grown up in and around Atlanta my whole life, it was fun to read the fictional events and actually picture where they were taking place. I could just see where the murder occured, where Callihan lived and ate, where her relatives lived. I guess that was the most appealing thing about this book. You may have to live in Atlanta to truly like it.That said, the story was quick and interesting. You know almost from the beginning 'whodunnit', but keep reading to see him get caught. I don't think this book was as close to the Tokars case as some may think, but there were some similarites. I picked this book up on Saturday morning and was done by the next day.

It's hard to pick the best Smiths tracks, but this one has most of the tracks from the two Best Of collections.The initial \\"reviewer\\" of this album really needs to get a music encyclopedia and read up on the Smiths, because the review was awful and completely missed the sound of the Smiths. FAR from grunge, the Smiths came out of the New Wave era and scoffed at the wasteland of pop and rock music in the eighties, blowing off trendy music and combining a rock/ska/pop sound with dark, hilarious lyrics.Smiths fans can appreciate this compilation, and if you're one of the rising number of new Smiths fans, this CD is a great starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul McCartney and Wings","review":"Tony Jasper gives us an overview of Wings from the band's inception in 1971 up until 1977.

Wood gives expression to the deepest feelings of empathy of any poet I have read, silently or aloud. His choice of words and images evokes the strong passions associated with sexual hunger and emotional loss. I not only see the characters in his poetry, but I feel what they feel and fall out of my world and into the world of the poem.Excerpt from \\"The Perils of Beauty:\\"\\"That beauty's peril lies beyondany skeptic's doubt, beyondthe conundrums of cool, inscrutable sages, .... . .she was still combing, and at ten o'clockwomen were talking to her, but she just combedand combed and stared at the sun, ...\\"My best effort to describe the poetry of John Wood is to say that it is deeply sensitive emotion captured in words.

I suspect the vocals were probably recorded in London, on top of the imported Jamaican riddims hence, very difficult to duplicate the amazing feel of the best authentic Jamaican I-Roy hits. I can just imagine it now - I-Roy freezing his ass off in London :) I'd even suggest that Virgin mixed it in London too because again, it sounds too clean and correct - unlike the rougher Jamaican mixes.

Still and all, it's a fun album to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After all the years of down time between record deals, this fan expected more than this generic offering that barely catches fire when it tries to rock and bores this listener when it slows down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Offensive","review":"I picked this up for free from a radio station otherwise I never would have spent good money on it. The songs John Eddie thinks are funny aren't. I just don't have any sympathy that he is 40. And even the song that gets airplay \\"Let Me Down Hard\\" is just plain boring. And is there any reason that John Eddie really has to put out an album that I can't play around my kids?"},{"rating":"2","title":"speaks to the heart","review":"Surprisingly creative; John's lyrics and melodies capture almost every emotion. Certainly it can be a bit raw at times; however, so can life. This album speaks to the essence of love, mortality and humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this one.","review":"I've listened to \\"If You're Here When I Get Back\\" a lot since I've downloaded it from itunes. Waaaaay back when I was a John Eddie fan, visiting dive bars at the Jersey Shore. (Some of the best times...) The lyrics & tunes gently breeze by. Bruce-esque, perhaps a bit, but John Eddie has his unique sound, and I enjoy it. It's really good -- give it a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really tried to love this novel. I enjoy historical murder mysteries, stories with a female sleuth, and the Elizabethan period. So I gave it many, many chances. And I just couldn't bring myself to like it. The heroine's marriage doesn't seem believable, her attitude towards life and the world rings wrong not only for the period but for a woman of any era, and her relationship with Queen Elizabeth I is contrived at best. The secondary characters seem stiff and uni-dimensional and the story felt like a modern tale with a few anachronistic phrases thrown in and the technology taken out.What I did enjoy, however, were the descriptions of places. In this the author excelled and that is what earned this book that second star from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and balanced","review":"This is the most complete commentary on this book I've seen. Collins' discussion covers both the Hebrew and Old Greek texts of Daniel as well as the apocryphal additions. Even though the book is quite extensive, the manner in which it is written and organized makes it readibly understandable, even to those just being to look at the book or the attendant areas of apocalypticism or post-exilic Judaism. Collins approaches the text with a balanced historical-critical approach which fairly discusses views upheld by both more conservative and more liberal scholars than himself. Any discussion or study of the Book of Daniel which ignores this work will be seriously lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book goes beyond romance toward the literary genre","review":"This book was seemlessly written. Kitt can write much better than most and I often felt while reading it that the book was reaching beyond the genre into something more literary and more interesting than just a run-of-the-mill romance. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I NEVER RCVD THIS BOOK!!!!!","review":"I HAVE NEVER RCVD THIS BOOK & I CAN'T GET A RESPONSE FROM THE SELLER! I TOTALLY FEEL RIPPED OFF!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"What I liked about the story was that it wasn't about color, but about a relationship between 2 people who just happen to be of different races. It was the circumstances that brought them together, not blind lust. This is one of my favorite books and Sandra is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biracial kid on Interracial love","review":"Jason and Leah are so incredible. When I read this book, I could actually see a real couple struggling in a world where the people they care about the most don't accept them. The best part is when Leah tries to end the relatioship with Jason. The scene shows how much Jason really does care for her and that he really,truly loves her despite what the world thinks of them. This book is incredible. It opens your eyes and gives you a real look @ how hard interracial love is. It's one of my favorites and one of the best books I've ever read. I think every interracial romance lover or a romance novel lover in general should read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved this book! i just got it the other day..and am about to go read it..for the second time! And the end was the best part! i hope that theres going to be a sequel...i'd love to see whats gonna happen to them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is too hard to put down!","review":"The first time I saw this book I knew that it would be a great book and I was right! This book explores interracial relationships from a black female/white male perspective. Sandra Kitt should contact a director and have this book made into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, thoughtful, genuine","review":"I truly loved this book and it held my suspense from the first chapter through the last. I thought it was lots better than The Bodyguard because I actually believed this relationship was true, unlike the romance in The Bodyguard. The way Ms. Kitt built up the characters and the friendship/romance between Leah and Jason was done wonderfully. The relationship was not rushed which made it all the more believeable! I couldn't help but root for Jason and Leah's relationship to work despite all the obstacles because I could feel the love between the two of them grow. She made you feel for each of them, their weaknesses and their strengths.I read the book in two days only because I had to go to sleep at night and work the next day; but I could not wait to start reading it again as soon as I got home from work. I will be reading this book again. It was very heartwarming and I can't wait for Ms. Kitt to write another just like this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A complex look at an interracial relationship...","review":"Here is a book that delves beneath the surface of an interracial relationship, and doesn't simply rely on the superficial titillation of the issue. You get in the character of Jason Horn a realistic figure, who has to confront his own racial demons and prejudices regarding Black people while at the same time slowly coming to realize that he is falling in love with Leah, a Black woman whom he had only thought to befriend. Leah, on the other hand, has to deal with the cultural stigmas and issues about dating a White man. She is presented as a sensitive, caring individual. Because neither of the main characters are flat (although I did have trouble believing the character of Leah's sister, Gail, who seemed a little bit stereotypical, i.e. \\"sassy, over-opinionated Black woman), you do care for their relationship and how it will turn out. I was not disappointed by the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the rest","review":"I was in my senior year of highschool when I bought this book and have read it many times since (now a junior in college). My book also is plain worn out!! I almost consider myself an expert in interracial dating books and this is the one I keep coming back to because it is devoid of stereotypes and is full REAL feelings, not just the jumping into bed part. In the end you realize that these are two distinct people, not THE BLACK WOMAN with the WHITE MAN scenario."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I had this book sitting on my self for about 4 years.One cold winter I picked it up to read, and read the entire book in one sitting(took me about 4 hour, for every year I didn't read it)I loved it.My only complaint is that the author didn't Epilogue, showing them married years later, with a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"I found this book to be predictable...but then again most novels are to any avid reader. Cute story..worth the money. Fast, easy read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rite, poorly written","review":"Ms Kitt cannot write, even in the less than literary field of romance novels. Her characters are caricatures, no depth beyond the obvious. The sister is so bitterly against the interracial romance, but sees nothing wrong with backstabbing her sister. If this was your sister, wouldn't that be about the time you stopped caring what she thought? Ms Kitt failed to get me to care about these characters and her stilted writing didn't alleviate the situation. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and stereotypical trite little novel","review":"I feel that overall Ms. Kitt has gone out her way to portray Black males as violent and aggressive and white men has heroic and valiant. All of the Black males in this awful novel are stereotypical. It is obvious by the language of the young Black male protagonist in this book that Ms. Kitt has had very little contact with Black males. What young Black male do you know uses the word \\"fox\\" to describe a female, give me a break! If Ms. Kitt wants to promote the white male/Black female relationships,I wish she would do so without castigating Black men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also in Norwegian!","review":"A young Norw. author called Erlend Loe found this book in New York, fell in love with it, translated it and made his publisher give it out in the matter of months. I do not know the figures, but it is selling really good here, along with the follow-up.I think this alone describes how great it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harold","review":"Many a late night spent I, trying to crack this nut. Three days, I wept to the heavens. Three days! Verily I say, much easier it would be to slog through a mire. Three days of three pages each. Who can conceive such thoughts as be penned on these mighty leaves?\\"Nay!\\", they cried, \\"\`tis poetry!\\". \\"Poetry\\", I pondered in the silence of my heart. Prosody, perhaps, with flowering words entwined about playful constructs. Still the struggle raged on. But then with bitterness heavy upon my spirit, I lay the tome down with defeat. Rest, and maybe another day to take up the valiant attempt, but for now, tis not for the likes such as I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard for non-native speakers","review":"Be advised that the language of the book is sort of archaic. I (as a non-native speaker) found it very hard to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My opinion on Harold the Last of the Saxon Kings","review":"I think the book was very well written. Most biographys are written promoting the subject as the hero of the piece, using selected source material to back them up. Here the author does neither. Harold is presented in a straight forward manner, and source material is presented that both backs up the English view of a hero as well as the Norman view of a lying oathbreaker. By the end of the book I was pulling for Harold to win!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harold the last of Saxon Kings","review":"It is a very long read, but kept my interest all the way thru. It is a story that keeps moving along all the time with never a dull moment. A true page turner. It is one I plan to read again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to digest","review":"I tried, I tried, I did. But I couldn't get past the dreadful archaic writing. Why the author wrote this in his version of old English I don't know. I didn't think they even spoke English in those days. I could not finish and don't think I could return to it. Shame. A good story not well told."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS FICTION","review":"There's nothing wrong with fiction, and I will grant that this book was written by a historian well acquainted with the historical subject matter at hand. But if you're looking for a history text (like I was) this likely isn't what you want to purchase. I'll be honest -- I didn't read beyond the first 20 pages so I can't speak to the quality of this book when considered in its historical fiction context.For non-fiction I would recommend1066: The Hidden History in the Bayeux Tapestryas an alternative, which covers the same events. Also available on Kindle.J."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I started this book. Very old English sounding. I read over 2 chapters and just couldn't get into this book. As far as I got, I consider it boring. I may try it again, but for now ... it was no page turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, heart-melting music","review":"I came across David Gray after his second album, \\"Flesh\\" was released, though I would have to say this first record is the one to start with. \\"Shine,\\" \\"Gathering Dust,\\" and \\"Birds Without Wings\\" are all incredible, slow building, expansive folk songs that speak to a wide audience. Without the proselytizing and awful slick production of some bigger name folkies out there, and a voice that is at once youthful and weary, the sound of this recording matches the songwriting, which is extraordinary. Especially considering this is his first release, David Gray has incredible talent. These songs still hold me in their thrall- not something to just put on, but something to really listen to, and feel. \\"Wisdom\\" kicks out the jams a little more, looking forward to the bigger electric sound he favored on \\"Sell, Sell, Sell.\\" I love this record, and there will always be a big spot in my heart for David Gray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trance through me!","review":"I bought this a few days ago while I was shopping at Tower records. Sometimes I buy things on a whim, and I usually do very good. Well, thatt is how I bought this CD-5 and I cannot stop listening to it! Engelina's vocals are so HYPNOTIC. Her voice carries the melody so beautifully. I just simply loved it. As far as mixeds go, I like them all, but the Double N Remix seems to be the main stay with me. It features the elements I like best, the vocals with a great trance beat. Some would say it is commercial trance, but you know what? It KICKS BOOTAIE!! If you like VOCAL TRANCE then you CANNOT go wrong with this. It states there will be a full ablum, I CANNOT WAIT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pull Chain Switch","review":"The exhaust fan in my bathroom comes on with the light.

The only time I saw a shine was when it was wet and then it dried to a matte finish. Now I have to strip my floor because it is actual wax and now won't take any other product. Thank goodness I noticed the dull finish before I did more than my hallway. Down the drain with this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"EZ Shine?","review":"Instead of sending dead flowers, give your ex a can of this stuff. J & J is doing Canadian consumers a favor by withholding this product from the market. Hoping I was getting a worthy successor to the Johnson's Beautiflor my mother used, I ordered a bottle of this stuff from the States. It is easy to apply and dries to a brilliant shine. But here's the rub (ha ha). As soon as I shifted some furniture on it, it scuffed. Unlike paste wax or Beautiflor you can't buff it back up. The dog leaves scratch marks all over it. I am waiting for spring in order to remove the mess with mineral spirits (the solvent)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cross and the Self","review":"This book is definately a must read for any Christian who wishes to understand the words of Jesus about taking up one's cross and following Him. It gives examples of the cross that Father God brings to each of His children's lives to reduce our \\"self\\" life and become more like Christ, and it gives helpful advice on how to embrace the cross that Father God places in our lives. It is such an encouragement because it gives not only the \\"what to do's,\\" as so many books do, but the \\"how to do,\\" as well. God used this book to answer so many questions I had about the Christian life and used it to give me personal revelation about dealings in my life. Excellent tool for the Christian in his/her walk with Christ in learning how to fellowship in the sufferings of Christ and being transformed into the image of God's Son, Jesus the Christ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly colored Split Enz album","review":"\\"True Colors\\" was where Split Enz hit both their commerical and creative stride. The follow up \\"Corroboree (aka \\"Waiata\\") was equally strong and but this is where the band began producing their string of masterpieces. Although some of the new wave arrangements don't quite gel now, the overall effect is still pretty powerful.Opening with the one-two punch of \\"I Got You\\" and \\"Shark Attack\\" the album never lets up. Neil Finn truly discovers his songwriting voice here and Tim continues to provide some of the richest ballads of his career with \\"I Hope I Never\\". Imagine if The Beatles stuck together and embraced new wave and you'll get an idea of this albums sound. Neil combines the melodicism of Paul McCartney with the the lyrical adeptness of Lennon.I do miss the colored vinyl that this first appeared. A pity they couldn't do something similar with the CD reissue. This album needs to be remastered to capture all the detail in the production."},{"rating":"1","title":"miles away from home","review":"absolutely terrible!!!!!! the worst i ever heard from buddy miles. i have most all his work this one honestly went out the window at 60 mph!!don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great upgrade from a desktop!","review":"After always owning a desktop since the beginning of time, I finally decided I wanted to trade in my computer desk, clunky CPU and everything else for a compact machine that can still meet all my needs.After much research I went with this HP and have not been disappointed. It has every feature and port needed to meet all your entertainment needs whether it's downloading music or playing videos and the widescreen HD monitor looks as good as my Samsung HDTV.The only negative is with getting a 17-inch widescreen you also are getting 8 pounds of weight. This is why I say this laptop should be a desktop upgrade. You're most likely not going to enjoy lugging this thing around but on your table or while lying in bed, using this HP will leave you delighted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Drinks Yet.","review":"Got turned on to this book after receiving a \\"Transfusion\\" (see shot section) at a private club in the west end.

Each of these six remixes can only be found on separate disks elsewhere, and one would likely experience difficulty in tracking some of them down in the U.S. \\"Squirt (Risotto Vox)\\" is the famous version performed live during the Risotto-era tours. The only must-have track which isn't on this CD is \\"V Six\\" from the Wipeout XL various artists compilation. If you're a fan but don't already have all of Fluke's remixes and import albums, then Progressive History X is worth purchasing. If you're new to Fluke, this is the best of the group's work and the place to begin.Update: \\"Thumper!\\" is actually from the 1994 Peel Sessions EP.

I must admit it was a little more graphic then I remembered it, but no matter my granddaughter just can't get enough of it. This DVD includes the song \\"who's afraid of the big bad wolf\\". She also loves Little Red Riding Hood which is also covered on this DVD. I myself like the Lambert segment which is a much more pleasant story no big bad wolf until the very end. So if your child is into the above and won't be scared by the angry wolves they will just love this. By the way great picture quality.However for the more faint a heart there is always \\"Dora and the Three Little Pigs\\" too. I bought them both and they are both enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"My 3 year old loves this movie. It keeps her attention, and there are multiple cartoons on this DVD. I would reccomend this to anyone with a young child."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bust!","review":"We bought this DVD recently and I have to agree with the other two one star reviewers. This DVD was disappointing in overall audio/visual reproduction.My biggest disappointment is that the DVD does not go from one story to the next without returning to the main menu. I have to choose to go to the next chapter/story. This is not the fault of my DVD player.

Cartoons today don't compare with Disney's works. They were beautifully executed and appropriate for the whole family, something that is sorely lacking in today's television. And the music created for them is unforgettable - you hum songs in your head all day long after watching a Disney movie. I'm so glad I was part of the generation in which most of Walt Disney's movies were produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feats done failed me now","review":"This CD was given a good review in Baggers magazine so I thought I would try it.

This multi-talented, multi-cultural, bi-racial,...band from somewhere in Dixie produces amazing music. Like a Global symphony of music and happiness, Little Feat finally received the acclaim they deserved with the release of Feats Don't Fail Me Now. Even the harshest critics gave it a big thumbs up. The high leader of Little Feat - Lowell George - maintains focus and consistency in a recording that culls it's rythym from all over the map. The final tune, The Triple Medely, provides perfect closure to this hallmark recording. Well worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the greatest rock'n'roll album ever made.","review":"The 10-minute medley with which it ends is the most intimidatingly exciting music you will ever hear in your life.Just buy the damn thing, hear me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and Roll Doctor","review":"Lowell George was the original Rock and Roll Doctor. When Little Feat started shufflin', Lowell's Craftsman* socket would make that Strat scream like a Peterbilt pulling a load over the Rockies.

If you don't have this album yet GET IT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"SYNCOPATED RHYTHMS BY ROCK ALLSTARS","review":"Little Feat is the kind of band that appeals on many levels. For the dancer it is the sort of boogie woogie funk-stomp and rollicking blues that keeps you on your feet and moving. For the road warrior it is some of the best car tunes you could hope for-Tripe Face Boogie helps eat those miles! For musicians it is overwhelmingly GOOD craftsmanship ...without seeming effort, but oh!Checkout the bass on Spanish Moon, the sly drumming on Skin It Back and the soulful piano chops on Oh Atlanta. Memphis-sounding horns, stellar bottleneck blues, and the sinuous vocals of George, et al. A classic, filled with hooks and attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feats best studio album","review":"Although \\"Dixie Chicken\\" is widely regarded as Little Feats finest hour, this album over time, came to be my favorite. the truth is, the best of the \\"Dixie Chicken\\" material sounds even better on the live album \\"Waiting for Columbus\\". but this album has a flow to it, slow and relaxed and very fun to listen to. \\"skin it back\\" oozes out of your stereo and \\"Rock n Roll Doctor\\" is great Feat rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"All parents should read this book!!!","review":"As a mother of 4, I wish this book would've been written years ago.

Heck Yah!","review":"Engineering an Empire is a snappy and slick series from the History Channel that discusses a multitude of past cultural contributions to the world from a variety of civilizations. In volume 1, The Aztecs episode in particular, it held my 7th grade students' interests (as well as adults' interests)as we experience the violence, beauty, awe, and mystery of a civilization's amazing creations for survival from a time long past. Peter Weller's acting chops fill in quite nicely as a dynamic host with an impressive historical educational resume to boot. It's a quick 45 minutes that manages to keep the pace high and trick the students into learning something along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this DVD release!!!","review":"The movie isn't half bad for a spaghetti western comedy, however the idea of East meets West was much better executed in Red Sun (1972) starring Charles Bronson & Toshiro Mifune. The one star rating is for the awful DVD transfer you are getting. The source material must have been a poor quality VHS copy complete with plenty of stretch marks (visible throughout movie),which in turn used a totally worn out 16 or 35mm print as its source. If you are a die hard Eli Wallach fan, and you want to see him in a fairly hard to find movie, then by all means, buy it. To everybody else,I recommend waiting for a better quality DVD release that will do this movie justice. Better yet, give \\"Red Sun\\" a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look Out America!","review":"Alright, I understand that David Kitt is relatively unheard of outide of Ireland at the moment, but it is only now that 'Small Moments' and 'The Big Romance' are becoming available as imports to the US.

I am lucky enough to have met David Kitt, and to have had his music enter my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"very drab.","review":"The first thing that disappointed me about this book was that fact that the blurb on the back gives away what seems to be the only thing that would even come close to a plot twist. That has nothing to do with the acutal writing itself, but it was rather a spoiler.Then I started to actually read the book, which was worse. Frame uses 40-word setences when being 'descriptive'. She ends up to near rambling, and using almost hackneyed descriptions of what the characters do.Her whole idea is very intriguing, but she goes nowhere with it. The end of the book is in the blurb, and even if it was not, it would still be a very boring read. No empathy or connection was made with any of the charachters, false or not.

He very lightly looks at the overall strategy of conflicts, so it is quite ironic that he focuses on the tactical brilliance of the Japanese and German troops during WWII, without realizing the sole purpose of warfare is to win wars. His chapters on the Japanese are probably the most troubling when he discusses their small unit abilities while failing to mention the inevitable devastation that their human wave tactics caused on their infantry units and war plan as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again","review":"This product absolutely does NOT fit a 1997 Honda EX.

I watched about 2 dvds burned a few movies and used the light scribe. about a week after purchasing I noticed the dvds I watched started skipping. also the burn speed was greatly reduced. I'm burning dvds at a stunning .5X and cds at a whopping 4x speed at max.

I do find some of the best films and books out there to be sci-fi, though, usually when the author tackles philosophical topics with twists that this genre allows so well. On that note, I thought the themes of the first book were a lot more interesting than this one. While the plot of the first one really mirrored the birth of modern western civilization with lots of clever plot twists and clear themes for each short story, this one seems more like a straight forward space opera adventure story, like a Star Wars flick (and yes, I know this came well before Star Wars). There are only two stories in this one and they're very similar and without a clear theme that I could pull out.So yeah, it's a less cerebral experience than the first book. If you're into hard sci-fi you may enjoy this more."},{"rating":"1","title":"~Classic Disappointment~","review":"I would like to make a couple of things clear before I begin my review.1.)

It's not wholly fair -- despite being far less anarchic, they're solid works, albeit a bit staid. It's the difference between the original Grimm fairy tales and the sanitized versions with all the scary and sexy bits taken out.

Many of his album cuts (not released as singles) were great songs. Many of his songs were re-issued by Rhino on LP in the early eighties. I have been a fan ever since. Now, what about sound quality? Del-Fi recorded the original songs, so it is assumed they would have the best access to the original master tapes. All songs on this CD have good sound quality.

You may consider me a little conservative, but for me, The Omen is damien and Damien is the Omen, period.Why did they have to repeat and use the soundtrack of the preceding Omens to make this one, was it because Jerry Goldsmith found the script a little more like a farce too?

The Omen 4 (1992) is the worst sequel in the history of horror film sequels and I'm including the worst of the Halloween and Friday the 13th sequels.The Omen 4 is about Damien's spawn and the next coming of the antichrist. The problem is the Damien's child who is set to be the next antichrist is a girl. The explanation of how a girl is the next antichrist doesn't work not to mention that she's an annoying spoiled brat. The original omen worked because you weren't sure what to believe about Damien since he was likable.

You can get this idea before you watch the movie beacuse it's 90s production and based on a story of the daughter of Damien.

Generally when the main character is killed off that means that the series is complete, when they try to start up the series with a new main character that almost always means failure, and in this movie that is exactly what happened.

Death scenes nearly the same with other Omens but this time they are too weak and not impressive. Also that black dog from the first episode appears suddenly and becomes a member of family which I find very unnecessary. Apparently Delia is luckier than her own father because Damien was 12 when he realized who he was indeed but Delia awares of herself since she was born. Maybe females of the Devil's family are more clever :)))) We hear less music in this movie therefore the important scenes turns out to be ordinary especially for the viewers who has seen the Real Omens .

This made for television misfire is actually the failed pilot of a proposed Omen spin-off television series for the Fox Network that would have followed the growth of an all new Anti-Christ, the clone of the deceased Damien Thorn.

Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a silly, silly thing to do.","review":"I thought The Omen and it's sequels were part of a trilogy? Well I was wrong. Omen 4, originally made for tv was released in 1991. This time the seed of Damien is apparent in a child, Delia who seems to appear as the demon child in this sequel. The death scenes are silly, the producers obviously trying to entertain the horror crowds with gore so they won't notice the thin plot of this film. Of course one thing is saved from this movie being a total flop, Jerry Goldsmith returns with his original movie score to give the film some credibility although it doesn't deserve any whatsoever.

If I have to hear one more time how kenders never feel fear, but in that instance Tasselhoff felt something that equates to fear, I swear I'm going to scream. Raistlin is so ambitious for power that he has to constantly remind everyone, including the reader, of this, and oh yeah, by the way, he's Fistandantilus. What? Could that have come from any farther out in left field?This series is a poor example of Fantasy writing. The only reason that this book rates two stars is that it may serve as a whirlwind introduction to the world of Dragonlance.

Excellent writing by Weis and Hickman make this book a real winner. There are a few spots that could've been better - an ending that is pretty much a plug for the next series of books, and the rushed write-out of two characters is disappointing to say the least.

No bumper titles, no production value at all. Sometimes it wasn't clear if the movie title on the screen was for the previous movie or the next.Another disappointment was that no classic horror movies are found here. It's unfortunate that the Karloff/Strange image of Frankenstein is used for this title when none of their movies are included. The closest thing to classic are some of the original Hammer films.One trailer was run twice and several non-horror titles are included like High Plains Drifter, Flower Drum Song, and Marine.

I was hell bent however at being a social worker or something of that nature at one point, and I ate this up. I read it all, and I cherish the emotional bent that keeps these women fighting for kids and loving when it's hard. This is essentially a beautiful story whether you buy it or not.

However, she was more than a teacher to Sheila; she was her surrogate mother. At the end of the book Torey included a poem that Sheila wrote at a later date. I believe the poem was written by a child who longed for her surrogate mother. Sheila may have thought that if she was good enough Torey might come back. She no doubt blamed herself when Torey left. This is a good book to read if you are looking for an example about a teacher crossing boundaries and re-traumatizing a student that has been abused.

There is no basic grammar section in the book even to conjugate the verb \\"to be\\" \\"hona\\" in Hindi. Verbs change in Hindi according to the gender of the person if I am speaking or a woman is speaking. The Hindi print is very small, so a magnifying glass is a tool you might need.

Enjoy it!","review":"To approach \\"The Red Tent\\" as a Bible story really does the book an injustice. It's really falls more into the category of a historical novel (though some might argue that the Bible is not \\"history\\").The author takes the basic elements from Genesis, throws in a bit of historical anthropology and a healthy dash of Lifetime Television for Women to create a story that is enjoyable, engaging and thought-provoking.To say that this book \\"misses the revolutionary nature of Abram's and Jacob's practice\\" is really missing the point. This is not a book about the roots of Judaism or any religion for that matter. And it's not about Abram or Jacob or Joseph. It's just a story -- more precisely, one based on the \\"what if\\" wonderings of an imaginative and learned author.Keep in mind that if they made this book into a TV show, it would be a mini-series not a documentary. Enjoy it for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must For All Women Who Love To Read!","review":"This book tells a fascinating tale, to be sure- but it is so much more than that!

I simply wasn't sure I was thinking of the same man she was writing about.I did not intend to read a book that had as its' main focus the monthly cycle of women. I found it simply boring. This is not a subject conducive to excellant fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Biblically correct","review":"This author attempts at deving into the Biblical story of Jacob, Leah and Rachel. The Author has Laban as an old bumbling inhospitable person BUT the Bible tells us in Gen 29:18 \\"he (Laban) ran to meet him (Jacob)\\". The author also says that Leah had eyes two different colors, the Bible says \\"she was tender-eyed\\" in Gen. 29:17. In the author's version Jacob only worked 7 months for Rachel and then Rachel convinced Leah to go first because she was afraid. Wrong! Jacob worked 7 years for Rachel and because Leah was the older, Laban her father, made a switch and gave Leah first to Jacob and he was NOT happy. He then worked 7 more years for Rachel. The account of this real story is in Genesis 29. This book is not appealing to me, because I know the Bible story, but unfortunately those who do not will believe this is the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Researched","review":"This book does not qualify as historical fiction; the author's research for this soap opera is practically non-existant. Ex: Dinah was not the only daughter of Jacob, Rebekah was not a witch, and the Valley of the Kings did not exist at the time of the Patriarchs. Her portrayal of Isaac, Jacob and Joseph as ignorant weaklings is offensive to Jew and Gentile. If popular Jewish taste in pseudo-midrash is as lacking in truth and respect for their own patriarchs as this author indicates, it's no wonder that they as a people have suffered diaspora for 4 millenia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Having read other excellent nonfiction works by Anita Diamant, I looked forward to this novel. Unfortunately, I found The Red Tent to be filled with cardboard characters many of whom appeared to have escaped from various romance novels. The male characters in particular were two-dimensional. It's one thing to dymythologize biblical heroes but shrinking them to cartoon size is overdoing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The true story is better than her fiction!","review":"I'm very disappointed how much of the Bible Anita Diamant changed to make up a fictional story. She would have been much better off not using any of the Biblical names and claimed the whole story fictional.It would have been a much more interesting story had Anita told the story how Jacob worked 7 years, not months, for Rachael - his favorite wife (not Leah as Anita claims!!!). Those are the first of many, many distortions throughout the entire book.Several of the critics noted on the cover stated that she did such an outstanding job writing about women that had very few words written about them. That's very true. It's just very sad that Anita didn't bother to use those few words to tell the real story. I've never seen such a secular version of Biblical truth.God warns His followers they are not to change one word of His bible. Evidently Anita must have missed those verses, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth twenty minutes of your time....","review":"I read this book for my book club - and I wish I didn't. It is written at about the fourth grade reading level. The liberties this author took with the bible is astonishing! Why don't we just all rewrite history to suit our feminist whims and be done with it!? This was hugely disappointing. I would have preferred she make this a fictional story about that period of time instead of insinuating it is a woman's version of the bible. What dribble, what gall!

It is FAR from historically accurate, and the author seems to be rather fixated on sex and variations of sex. I was really excited to read a book from Dinah's viewpoint, I thought that was a very original take, and I really enjoyed the prologue. After the prologue, the novel's redeeming value ended. I was hoping for something even remotely edifying, but ended up feeling a bit sick. Hopefully someone else will read this review and not bother reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did NOT like it!","review":"This book took a lot of liberty with their interpretaion of the life of Jacob in the Old Testement. I do not believe there was this type of sexual introduction to virgin women. I think the author has a large imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at first but.......","review":"Since I love the stories about the patriarchs in the Old Testament, I enjoyed the first part of this book. Reading about how the women lived, trying to visualize them as real people, was fascinating. However, as the book moved on, I was disappointed. The main character Dinah is a victum who needs to be constantly rescued. She never stands on her own two feet. Her life is sad until the end when she is again rescued by a man. She never makes an effort to have her own life until a man saves her. I also found the description of Joseph as a weak egotist who needed her to go with him to visit his father Jacob, hard to believe. Also, Jacob was described as illiterate. That may or may not have been true, but was she any better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblical Disappointment","review":"The Red Tent appears tells an interesting story about a family that could have lived in hte times of Jacob and Joseph. Unfortunately, there are discrepancies between the portrayal of this family and values that would be consistant with prophets of God. Instead of being uplifting and inspiring it was at times dark and discouraging. I would not recommend this read to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Bland","review":"The Red Tent lacks many things that would make it a good book. One of the most important is some sense of purpose. The story is long and, apart from a few incidents, incredibly boring. There are only so many ways any writer can describe labour and childbirth. The main character is colourless and bland. She has momentary flashes of personality but in general I did not care what happened to her. Her aunts are far better developed and although interest in them ends abruptly they hold the first half of the book together. The second half of the book is a convoluted plot to get Dinah to the right place and time to reunit with her once beloved Joseph. By the end of the book I had no interest in any of the characters and was annoyed with the insipidness of the book.As an attempt to flesh out the role of women in the Old Testament the book is a partial success. As a work of literature it falls far short of being a well written and a work of merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter rubbish","review":"Bears no relationship to any actual history of the time period. I just laughed out loud when the author had a Semitic tribeswoman from southern Syria calling on a non-Semitic Sumerian goddess, Ninhursag, for succor. To the author, one female goddess is just as good as another since all are \\"empowering\\" -- geography, culture, time frame, and social history be damned."},{"rating":"1","title":"First re-writing history - now the Bible!","review":"I got one-third through the book before I quit reading it. It was not because of the development and furtherance of the Bible story, but I got tired of reading about a woman's time of the month, birthing, adventures with sheep, and jerky men. If the author had taken the story and made it into an allegory or a separate story, but her re-writing of Bible bothered, plus the fact that she made so feminist. Nothing against feminism, but one must take into context the time when this story happened and not compare it to today's standards. There were bad times back then, but there were good times also. Basically, though, I just lost interest in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"historical???","review":"I loved the idea of the red tent when I first heard about it because it was a measure taken to protect the fellowship between women as well as give them a place to recover from childbirth and to rest during menstrual cycles.But what I found in this book was far from refreshing - in fact it pained me to read such a negative account of the events of the Tenakh. Though it is obvious that the voice of women is not often heard throughout the Tenakh, this book went overboard in terms of creating feminist, pagan, backbiting, spiteful characters who don't relate well at all with the men in their lives, nor with the G-d they are in submission to.It was a lewd and thoroughly disappointing read. Not biblical at all, this book should not even be considered close to any kind of a historical account - metaphorical or otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I've read the Red Tent twice! That's how good it was. I'm waiting with bated breath for another of Anita Diamants book's. Being named after such a heroic woman made me proud. She brought to light many unanswered questions, which I have used frequently. I now understand so much more of my heritage and am proud not only to be a jew, but to be named Dina. I highly recommend this book to woman and men of all ages and think that this book gives us an explanation of bible theories, without the difficult wording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed - highly inaccurate","review":"I picked up this book because I love reading stories about lesser known people in the Bible. I was disappointed when I finished this book. I was expecting a biblically accurate novel, instead I got what I believe to be a feminist, anti-Bible account. For example, Dinah was portrayed by the author as a woman who had premarital sex. In the Bible she was raped. In the book she was portrayed as more \\"enlightened\\" than her relatives when she chose a goddess over God. If you appreciate accuracy, then you will dislike this book. If accuracy doesn't bother you, then you will probably like this book. One thing this book teaches you (maybe the only thing) is that you must *always* check the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful story","review":"I am writing this in response to the woman who said she was dissapointed in how far the story deviated from the Bible's account. It is true that it is very different, but it is a novel based on about one paragraph in the Bible. You should read this book as an unique story about culture in biblical times not as an expansion on a Bible story. I loved reading about how women lived thousands of years ago though I agree that it was slightly irritating that Jacob is portrayed as kind of a jerk and his son's as demons."},{"rating":"2","title":"BREATHTAKING","review":"There are some books you simply want everyone to read because you know it will enhance them, change them or simply move them. That is why I decided to write this review. .... The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is simply breathtaking. I cried from beginning till end. It was like diving into a sea of poetry, a river of song. It became my story and I know it will become yours. I have never felt closer or more familiar with any other woman like I felt to Dinah. In her mothers I saw mine. Whether the story is true or not is simply irrelevant. The possibility of truth is enough. The alternative provided to the Book of Genesis where Dinah is simply a footnote is enough. I applaud Anita Diamant for writing something so brave and so very beautiful and I plead you all to read it, just to pick it up and try. So that Dinah will be a footnote no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ex-Witch Recognizes Pagan Lit","review":"I was involved in Wicca for over 20 years, read Mists of Avalon and many other similar literary works with pagan agendas during that time, and got the same distinctive (and unpalatable to me now) flavor when I read this novel.

The fashion now is to take history and make up your own facts and people. The problem is that there are lots of people out there who take these historical novels as the truth. But the Bible actually was written about people who actually existed and tells their stories and about the Chosen People, God, etc. I actually have a problem with making up people who didn't exist or have biblical figures do things that aren't in the Bible.

Even that wouldn't have been so bad, had the author not chosen to base this story on real people. I would've rather her have completely made up the story, including the characters, rather than trying to tie it in to anything that actually happened or anyone who actually lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Distortion","review":"This book was a disappointing distortion of the biblical facts of Jacob and his family. If you are Jewish or Christian this book can easily offend you. The idea of an historical fiction is meant to take the historical facts about a person and then embellish the details about their true historical story without changing the spirit of what we already know. This book did NOT do that. It took the biblical facts about Jacob and his family and changed them from a family who worshiped the God of the Bible, the God of Abraham in to a pagan family. The information about the customs and communities of Jewish women of that time period could have been very interesting if the facts of this story had not been butchered."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional book","review":"This is the story of the women in the biblical characater Jacob's life as told by his only daughter Dinah.

Being a lover of historical fiction, I thought I was in for a real treat. I guess I just don't get it because I had to force myself to finish this book. I got into the characters alright but halfway through the book they were gone. The part that had the most profound affect on me was when Dinah had to accept the fact that she would always be distant from her son. I think it is since their life and customs are so unfamiliar to me that I found it hard to follow. I'm not familiar with a lot of Bible stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of step","review":"Boy, am I in a tiny minority of the customer reviewers who gave this book a low rating. To me, Daiman's tale is nothing more than wordy hokum. I struggled through about a fourth of the story, and was so distracted by the stilted writing and the simplistic characters, I just gave up. Maybe it's something at this stage in my life that throws me into the negative camp. Could it be I'm getting old and cranky?(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Women of Bible Times.","review":"The portrayal of the women from this time period was insightful and seemed accurate, but the Biblically based story didn't follow Biblical facts too closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an inspirational story from biblical times. It is a captivating tale that grabs your attention and draws you in. The end of the book left me wishing there was more to it and hopes that there is a sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"It was the read for my book club and I was surprised of how much I enjoyed it. At the begining it was hard to keep track of all the characters and what was going on but if you stick with it you won't be able to put it down. I would have never picked a book inspired on the Bible not becuase I'm against it but It sounds boring. This is book was not boring at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"remarkable and inspiring","review":"Who says women in traditional societies were the property of their families and husbands? Meet Dinah, a strong-willed and intelligent daughter of Jacob who becomes both a functioning member of ancient Hebrew society and the ruler of her own existence. I had never read a work of historical fiction before, and I was immensely impressed by the cultural details, which when combined with a passionately written story of the rich, emotional lives of Dinah and her mother and aunts, make for a stunning, tragic, and ultimately inspiring book. I recommend this novel to any woman, and any man who cares about women's issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"Really enjoyed this book. It made me go back and the story in the Bible. I'm not big on historical fiction, but this book was an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read.","review":"This was such en enjoyable book. The female perspective was different from the portrayal of biblical characters as we unusually read. So much culture and traditions made the story an adventure to read. Great plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked in the bible, this story redeems her and all women, I hope Eve is next","review":"I know this book is a what if, or who knows so maybe this happened... But I think a lot of the bible is fill in the blanks, and left to interpretation, written by men and translated many times, editted and decided upon....Women were often cast out, looked down upon. I think Christianity is patriarchal like all popular religions. It's missing another perspective, this book fixes that.I never really thought about the story, the horror of it, in Sodom, it didn't make sense in anyway, this story makes some sense and it's beautiful, also redeeming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"One of my favorite books of all time. The characters, especially Dinah and her four mothers, are very rich. They draw you in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"I recommended The Red Tent for my book club, having read it a few years ago and looking for an excuse to read it again. It remains a favorite and I was enamored with the exceptional storytelling all over again. This novel undulates with rich detail and a wide range of emotions. Dinah's story is fraught with sadness and tragedy, but she also experiences so many uplifting and inspiring events. Diamant does a phenomenal job recreating the biblical setting and developing the characters (which could have been difficult considering the size of the cast). I love everything about this book and it remains the best example of biblical fiction I have read yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top five books","review":"I have read the Red Tent twice now, and am planning on reading it once again this summer. Anita Diamant infuses her jewish studies along with Dinah, who gets very little mention in the Bible. She then creates a masterpiece that is breath-taking and exquisite! Great love story, biblical historical fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY SPLENDID!!!","review":"Wow, Anita Diamant is one great writer. She got a bull's eye on this book. This is the second book that I have read which she authored. The other one is The Good Harbor which is also a good one. I recommend this to all female readers out there and to all men readers who like to understand and comprehend the ways of women. I just love this book-ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!I am not exaggerating when I capitalized on the 2 words but really, this is a MUST READ BOOK, aside from the Bible, of course. If you cannot buy the book; check it out from the library but I would still insist you buy the book from Amazon.You know why? Because after reading this book, you will want to read it again, and again, and again. I like to thank my good friend, KH for recommending this to me. She is one of my book reading mentors. Please guys, read this book. You will also thank me after reading this.PS- if there is a 6-star rating, I will rate it at 7 stars.Hope you got my point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written beautifully, very moving","review":"Let me begin with the fact that some people may not enjoy this book for the stark details about the female experience. If you can get past that, this is a wonderful book.I loved the stories interwoven in The Red Tent, especially in the first two parts. The last part is does drag a little, but it is still interesting.The reason I gave this 5 stars is because I truly enjoyed reading a book that took me back to the time when life was really like this. While I am sure their lives were much more difficult without the technology we have today, I found myself yearning for the simplicity of baking, sewing, medicine, and sense of community that was so well-described in Ms. Diamant's book. I recommend it for any woman of any age who wants to dive into a fantastic biblically-based novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a phenomenal story!","review":"Ms. Diamant has done a remarkable job in telling Dinah's story, a little known character from the early books of The Bible. She introduces us to another time, and a far away place. This book is especially interesting for those of us not so familiar with The Bible and it's story tellers.I was riveted throughout the book. The women and men in this story have their jealousies; fears; joys and sorrows, just like you and I. Diamant's ability to put you right there in the Red Tent along with the women of Jacob is an amazing feat. The stories they tell and the companionship they share makes for wonderful reading.Listen carefully, mind that you don't wander off into the dust. Dinah, the one with the musical name, has a grand story to tell. Enjoy every moment of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about women","review":"This is a book about the relationship among women. It begins with the relationship between four sisters and the connections between them. Throughout this book you will see relationships between a mother and a daughter, a daughter and a mother-in-law, and a daughter and a grandmother, you will even see the bonds between a women and her true friends. This book was so wonderful up until the very end. I gave it to my Mother and to my sisters who also could not put it down. This book will cause you to reflect on your relationships with the women in your life, from past to present. An EXELLENT READ"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reality of Women in the Old Testament","review":"This book breaks through the male dominated, written, and preached Old Testament and takes me back to the Red Tent. I would love to speak with Anita and ask here how she developed her characters, ones that were based on one or two line mentions in the Book of Genesis. This book is a celebration of women and womanhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful woman's story","review":"This was a great read! I could not put it down The stories in the Bible are somewhat thin, here the auther fleshes them out and takes you back in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Testament version of The Other Boleyn Girl!! A fabulous account of biblical times!!","review":"Don't hesitate - it really is as good as they say! I must admit that when someone recommended this book I was hesitant. Mainly, I didn't want an overdose of someone else's skewed/manipulated perspective on religion especially not on Christianity, Judaism etc. I have my own views, thanks. And honestly, I kick myself for waiting so long to read it - twas brilliant!! Basically, it read like a Phillipa Gregory novel - thing Old Testament version of The Other Boleyn Girl! She enthralls you from the first page and it never lets up! I finished it in 2 days :) and passed it on to my 48-year old mom, 20-year old sister, 25-year old cousin, and two friends - all whom loved the novel. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Felt like the author was THERE.","review":"In writing The Red Tent, Diamant seems to have actually lived the history of which she writes. Very well considered, historically accurate, thoughtful, interesting, and a great story (of course). Really gives food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening & Endearing","review":"The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is by far one of the finest books that I have read in some time. Diamant seems to have a way of drawing you into the circle of women allowed in the red tent. This book is told through the history of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah of the book of Genesis. In Dinah's story you are brought to the red tent as an eyewitness to exactly how women would have been treated by their men and by eachother. There is humor, mystery, anguish, entertainment, fear and the story of education during Biblical times. Very much like in the Bible itself! This book is definetly one for my personal top ten lists of \\"must reads\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Tent...I guess it's all in your viewpoint","review":"I was so excited to read this book, as I'd heard it was \\"really good.\\" I'm afraid I didn't get very far and I ended up dumping the book in the garbage. There are a lot of strange things going on in the Old Testament, I agree, but I thought the beginning of this novel was very crude. Laban's pictured as a sex-crazed fellow who is lusts after and chases the female goats, or whatever they had. Jacob is seen gratifying himself out in the open.I think Anita D. has really done her research. I would have loved to enjoy the book and the results of her hard work, but couldn't get past the portrayal of men and women \\"of the covenant\\" living such selfish, coarse lives. I'm sure I'll hear from everyone about what a prude I am, but reviews are based on personal reactions to literature, so I think I'm entitled to my opinion. Not everyone likes that kind of garbage. She dedicated this book to her daughter, and I wouldn't have MY daughter read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Imaginative Work","review":"Anita Diamant's \\"The Red Tent\\" is a story of one of the most mysterious women in the Bible. Dinah is mentioned only briefly in Genesis, but her life was full of turbulance and affected many. This book is not to be taken historically, it is clearly the work of the author's imagination. Diamant breathes life into the character of Dinah as she explores what life was like during Biblical times for a woman of Dinah's status.The story is told through the eyes of Dinah herself, giving an intriguing perspective. The story takes the focus off of the men that are so familiar in Jewish history and shows the life of the women. It shows the bonding that can be established between groups of women - love and competition all bundled into one.This is a very enjoyable book. I will stress again that it is a work of fiction. Do not expect to use this book as a historical resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read and enjoy!","review":"This book is worth the read! Lose yourself in a great story and learn about the old testament at the same time. As I read the book I yearned for the type of communion with other women that is spoken of in the book. In our fast-paced society it was healing to escape to a time when women were in tune with their bodies and their hearts and found comfort in eachother. I wanted to finish the book yet didn't want it to end. Just two warnings: the lineage and names are confusing at first and this book is not for the squeamish. Violence and childbirth graphically described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrating Womanhood","review":"I loved this story, not only because it was well written, but because of the concept around the \\"Red Tent\\" or menstrual tent. If women still celebrated their menses like this we wouldn't refer to that time of the month as \\"the curse\\". I wish I had read this book before my daughter started her menses. It would've helped me to celebrate this time with her in a more appropriate fashion. The comradery that existed between these women because of these few days they shared in solitude each month left a lasting impression on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work of Fiction","review":"I loved the first two sections of this book. We get in on all of the gossip beteween the sisters, and grow to love each one of them for there unique qualities. Dinah was born in the second section, then we learn of her everyday life in Canaan. I liked the third section of the book as well, but as some points it drug on for a while. It also bothered me how they spelled Rebekahs name incorrectly in the book, and I had to go back to my Bible several times to be able to distinguish the fiction from the real story. All in all a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Testament Comes to Life","review":"This was an excellent story. I really enjoyed Diamant's fictionalized account of a woman from the old testament. The details she includes of day-to-day life during this time period reflects a lot of research on the part of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I finished this book last night...I had to finish it so that I could get some sleep at night! This book was absolutely wonderful...and hard to put down. As mentioned in other reviews, I suppose it would be hard to read this book if you don't want to consider biblical stories as having other possible perspectives. To me, however, this book was more about growth and maturation...and a certain \\"centering\\" that happens when we know to do right (even if it means questioning that accepted authority of the time), know who we are, and where we stand. After having lived through some painful chapters in her life, Dinah learns to savor the sweetness of all things that are good, including her own abilities and contributions to her community. In the end, love is the only thing that really matters anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis, a Woman's Perspective","review":"My stars! Such a beautiful story. This is the story of Dinah. The daughter of Jacob mentioned in the Bible. There isn't much mentioned of Dinah in Genesis, but Diamant uses her brilliant talent and imagination to weave a story so heartwarming that you wish that it were actually in the Bible.This story is told in Dinah's voice. We get a look at how Dinah viewed her life as a child and young woman growing up in Canaanite society. I was connected to Dinah and the story of her mothers from page one. I was emotionally moved at practically every page. One page I was smiling or laughing. Another page, I was brought to tears.A magnificent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful -I couldn't put it down.","review":"I just loved this book. Most of my reading is fiction, the odd biography and a rare science fiction, so I'll read a wide range of books. The Red Tent was reccommended by a friend, and I'm so glad that I took her advice. The story was well written. Usually I enjoy books with more dialogue, but the author has such a way with words that you get a very clear picture without excessive description. The story seems very real as you read and it made me want to sit and read it cover to cover in one sitting. It certainly is on my top 10 book list."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely beautiful","review":"I can't find the words to descibe the connectedness I found with the main character of this book. If I had the funds I would buy it for everyone I know. This has been by far one of the best reading experiences I have ever had. So much was accomplished in it's three-hundred and some pages. I look forward to reading it again as well as this author's other writings. Full of female yayness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I found this book very interesting in many ways! The dynamics between sisters, mothers and daughters, daughters and elders - amazing tales! I also find Jacob's relationship with his wives intriguing! I am now on my second read and am starting to have questions which I may not find the answers for, but really appreciate the thoughts this book has started!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT READ","review":"I completely agree with Beutler on this book. I was very interested and excited to read this book and when I got into it, it just made me sick. I questioned if I should continue reading it to \\"give it a chance\\" but I find myself struggling. The story is not based on facts and she is fully aware of it. She feels that she has the liberty to change the facts and then tries to justify it. Something so clear in the bible of Jacob working 7 years for Rachel- she states they negotiated to 7 months then adds in the end of the book that time is irrelevant as they did not have a calendar back then...If the bible says 7 yeas, why change the facts? After this point I continued to find false statements about Rachel and her sister.It is a good read if you are not aware and have knowledge of the biblical text. But it is not even close to what the bible represents. DO NOT READ! She claims it is biblical when it is clearly not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christian review","review":"She (the author) is very good but what I did not like was to take the characters in the Bible and make up stories about them. I cherish the Word of God and take great offense to her liberality with the Word. She said that either people love what she does or hate it. I disliked what she did very much. She is a great story teller but not with characters in the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Such a great, wonderful tale based on a true Bible story. The author took a basic Bible story and turned it into a wonderful story by filling in the details. I could not put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like A Wrinkle In Time","review":"I enjoyed reading this book immensely. I approached it as I did \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" in that though it was historically based, the conversations and personality traits of the characters were not necessarily factual..however this in no way took away my interest in what was being said nor did it remove me from feeling I was a part of the experiences Dinah had. This book is a gift and I think Ms. Diamant for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN THIS BE HIGHER RANKED THAN \\"THE ENGLISH PATIENT\\"?","review":"It's enjoyable, and somewhat creative. But should Anita Diamont's book get more stars than Ondaatje's English Patient. One's a good read, the other should NOT BE MISSED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book I would recommend","review":"I purchased this book thinking it was a Christian based story. That is very far from what this book is. I found it to be a disgusting portrayal twisted with biblical references and most of them inaccurate. This book is a blasphemy againt God. I was so unsettled in my spirit reading this, I could go no further than the part one of it. There was positively no Christian basis to this book, and I will never again purchase a title from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another anti-Christian stealth book","review":"This book tries to pass itself off as biblical in nature while it is pure fiction. The author clearly blames God for not providing women with enough leading roles in Genisis and attempts to remake the bible in her own feminist image.There are a number of similar anti-Christian books on the market that employ the same strategy (The Davinci Code is a good example). The author cannot denounce the Christian reglion outright, so fabricating a blasphemous storyline to replace the original is the alternative goal.Anita Diamant is Jewish and not Christian. She has written books outlining how to reject the Christian religion and convert to Judaism. I would suggest \\"The Red Tent\\" only as a companion guide to someone who has such a goal. It is not a book written to help a Christian woman deepen her understanding of the role of women in the Old Testament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perverted Trash","review":"This book portrays the men of the Bible as sex perverts. It even describes a scene of bestiality and masturbation. I can't believe people like reading this kind of filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radical Departure from the Biblical Text","review":"When the author writes that her story is a readical departure from the Biblically text - she claims it is because she tells and unknown part of the story -- fleshes it out for us -- and that she tells it from a woman's perspective. It truly is a radically departure -- but that is mostly because she plays very fast and loose with the Biblical account. She doesn't just fill in missing details -- she changes whole facts. The God of the Bible gets very few mentions at all - and nearly all of them derogatory. If you're into idolatry and pagan religions -- and you like to see the God of the Bible mocked and made fun of -- then this might be your kind of book. As for me and my household -- we will serve the Lord."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy two books, one for you and one for a friend.","review":"I was captured as soon as I read the first page. I found this book fascinating and breathtaking. The description of women and their daily life and responsiblities in such ancient times was wonderful yet heartwrenching. And of course we always knew the relationship between Leah and Rachael had to be more complex than any childhood Bible stories ever expressed.I bought this book on a weekend away with my old college girlfriends. I contiuously recommend this book because of it's uniquely feminine point of view of an otherwise masculine world. It has wetted my appetite for more! The concept of the Red Tent continues today in my life by the yearly retreats with my college friends. Buy two books, then call a friend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A slap in the face ...","review":"It took me forever to get through this book. Why? I hated it. If it weren't on my reading group list I wouldn't even have finnished it. It wasn't the writting style or the topic (I love biblical historical fiction/nonfiction). I hated how Anita Diamant took the lives of these characters and portrayed them as complete hethens. She took a basic story found in the bible and exploited it, changing biblical fact to get her own agenda across and in the process making this book a slap in the face to every christian and jew that reads it. How sad. Don't waste your money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusted","review":"I agree with Caralen! This book was so infuriating and disgusting!!! Rather than fill in the Biblical story with a woman's perspective, the author chose to twist the story around to suit her feminist fantasies. She turned Laban into a vicious monster who had sex with sheep and beat women. She suggested that Rachel, instead of hiding Laban's idols under her saddle, menstruated all over them. Every other word in the first part of the book was \\"blood.\\" We read this book for my reading group, and in order to refute all the inaccuracies, I printed the Biblical account for us to read during our review. The Bible has such richly human characters, and the stories are extremely compelling. There's no reason to slander their lives in a fictitious account. Ms. Diamant should be ashamed of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This book was terrible! I really thought it would be a good Bible story but incredibly, it was a very poor one. It was good to learn that Jacob was a tender lover but a \\"sorry\\" father and leader. Oh, and Joseph had sex with men and was hated by all who worked with him. This was a book of fiction! There was no character development so when people died, I wasn't even sad. Remember, don't read this book if you want to read about God's chosen people; you'll end up wondering why they were chosen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"The author clearly betrays her lack of familiarity with the times and customs of places she describes. The characters are caricatures of the persons from the Bible. The prose is also awkward. The fact that some of the plot contradicts the biblical text is,I suppose, poetic license. Too bad Diamant is no poet. How can anybody like this book?If you want good and well written novels on biblical themes, try Paulo Cuelho's \\"Fifth Mountain\\" or Lion Feuchtwanger's \\"Jafteh and his daughter\\".Mann's \\"Joseph and his brothers\\" is a much better treatment of the Jacob's family saga than \\"the red tent\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate Christian reading","review":"I heard so many good reviews from my friends that I had to give this book a try. I was VERY disappointed and saddened by the sexual explicitness of the author. To be frank, she makes Labon a pervert, Jacob a masturbater, and Joseph a bisexual. Christians do not need to be reading this. Remember: Garbage in - garbage out! I am most saddened by the many readers who eat this stuff up, as if sexual sins a normal part of life. They are not supposed to be a normal part of life. And, yes, even the bible acknowleges that Dinah was raped, but the bible does not go into the details in order to teach us lessons. We do NOT need to read this kind of garbage as our entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT a Biblical account","review":"What I found actually disturbing was how the author twisted the facts of the Bible. I would encourage you to read Genesis 25 through the end of that book to learn the true story. It is obvious that she took great pains to rewrite history or else that she does not believe the Bible to be truth.What is most frustrating to me, is that she uses SOME truth and then twists other truths into blatant lies. Just to give one example, Joseph did NOT succumb to the temptations of Potiphar's wife and did NOT sleep with her. In the facts that the writer has twisted, she denies the power of God in the entire lineage of Jacob.She sums up her theme in the last couple of pages when she writes, \\"there is no magic in immortality\\". Well, there may not be magic in it, but what she is really saying is that immortality has nothing to do with God, which is a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"This book is shallow, glib, pandering, and, from what I have been able to find out, not historically accurate. Not interesting. Not well-written. If you are interested in re-tellings of Bible stories, check out Jim Crace's Quarantine. It's literate, intelligent, and a creative piece of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"How The Red Tent affected me...","review":"This book is an interesting read but is definetly a work of fiction. It adds much to the lives of these historical figures which is not based on biblical scriptures. If you know the Bible you may become offended about midpoint by the direction the author takes these historical characters. This book left me with a sense of sadness for all the people who read it and will believe it as truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read The Red Tent until you read this","review":"I enjoyed the time period in which this novel was set. However, I would have preferred it to be completely fictional and not based upon real people. Why? For the simple reason that there are several obvious contradictions to the biblical account of Dinah and her family. I would encourage any who wish to read this book to first read the following passages from the bible: Genesis 25:19-34, 27:1-28:9, 29:1-35:26, 37:1-36, 39:1-50:26. Not all of these are directly tied to the novel, but they give background and family history. Pay close attention to 29:22-30, 31:34&35, and 39:10&12. Even if you know the stories of Jacob and Joseph, it won't hurt to refresh your memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, powerful, lyrical","review":"This is, first of all, a richly drawn portrayal of tribal life in the ancient Near East -- a vastly different world, woven with such loving detail and lushness as to be wholly persuasive. The lives of the women of the red tent, all but neglected by history, are brought to life here. Their voices are rich and lyrical and perceptive of the nuances of life. Powerful and moving. After reviewing the relevant chapters of the Old Testament, I had even more appreciation for The Red Tent. Passing comments left unexplained in the biblical account are fleshed out with rich human emotion and personality. Seen within Diamant's tapestry, the scene of Jacob crying out upon kissing Rachel is deeply felt by the reader. Other passages so vital to the biblical account are, appropriately, completely peripheral to the story told here. Diamant's interpretations of biblical events and people are novel, controversial, and compellingly real and believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read!","review":"An intricate and intriguing tale of one family's history. Left me skeptical but left me in awe of human exsistence. The tale of this family's life could never sound more true. It was very fufilling more and I had tears rolling down my face as I was finishing the last pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of the Red Tent","review":"Disappointing. This book promises an exciting new perspective from the point of view of women of biblical times but I found it tedious and unengaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG WRONG WRONG","review":"I couldn't even finish this novel because of the incredible inaccuracies to the true Biblical account. I enjoy novels which use actual biblical stories as a backdrop and expand on actual accounts and characters, suggesting what \\"could have happened,\\" as long as they keep the facts straight, but the author of this novel changed so many of the facts that I could not enjoy the novel and finally got rid of it. The Biblical truth is so much more interesting that what she came up with anyway. I read the book because a friend of mine who does not know the Bible asked me to read it and tell her if it was true, because she assumed the author wouldn't have changed the actual story thus she believed everything the author wrote. After reading as much as I could endure, I told my friend the true story and pointed her to the actual account in the Bible, but I'm afraid she will always get the story wrong now that she has The Red Tent stuck in her head. The author had a chance, but she blew it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm","review":"I'm interested in Judaism and historical fiction, but I found The Red Tent rather dull and a bit too much of a bodice-ripper for my tastes. Gave up after a chapter or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivializing","review":"This book was highly recommended to me by friends I respect and given to me as a holiday gift by a priest. I was very disappointed. I think it is a cheapening of the human experience by focusing on the physical and reducing women to primarily \\"cow-like\\" experiences and men to \\"ram-like\\" behavior. In other words, I prefer my historical novels with more dimensions than bodily functions. I read it all with near-disgust at the lack of spirituality in a historically spiritual era and because of the reduction of women to a merely animal level. I found it a disappointing, one-dimensional book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Read it Twice!","review":"Yes, I have read it twice and could easily read it again. I liked to hear the stories from the Bible retold from a woman's perspective. After reading it I went back to the Bible to read the same story, albeit from a different perspective. This book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swept Away","review":"Anita Diamant...please write more of these!! I am a Presbyterian Minister who picked this book up (on recommendation from other clergy) about a week after giving birth to my first daughter, Magdalyn. The timing was incredible as I have connected, in a spiritual way, with the sisterhood of mothers and all who assist and nurture them. Yes, some creative license has been taken with the scriptural account...but most good preachers do the same thing every Sunday! The story is moving, grand, life-affirming... I will read it again and again for inspiration as a mother and wife, as well as a woman. How wonderful to have stories brought to vivid life such as this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book! Do not pass Go, Do not collect $200!","review":"I knew I was absolutely head over heels in love with this book while I was reading it on my lunch hour, in a cafe full of people, and was moved to weeping. Not just a few tears - full blown weeping. This book is one of the most beautifully written, heart-breakingly touching and poignant books I've ever read.In part because it paints such a vivid picture of the life of women in biblical times, and in part because it celebrates and makes the reader reflect on the timeless nature of relationships between mothers, daughters, sisters and aunts.I'm so glad I read this book, and I will definitely read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, beautiful and heartbreaking","review":"The descriptions of biblical life are wonderfully colorful with a story of a women who pulls at your heartstrings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, Emotional Story","review":"This book was Great!! It takes you \\"behind-the-scenes\\" of the Bible. While Dinah was only hinted at in the Bible, this book tells her tale of her four mothers and her life in the red tent. It grips you from the start, and you don't want to put it down until you are down. It was such a good story! Diamant didn't use language that the readers today wouldn't understand. It was very readable. While reading this story, you start to realize how life was then. You realize how good our lives are compared to the way people in those days lived. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing look at an overlooked voice","review":"I found this story to be completely fascinating. I've always enjoyed Biblical stories, and to see Anita Diamant to enrich these tales with her own version of Dinah's story was stunning to read. This novel is heartbreaking and amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Bible, women's literature, or anything in between. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't quite connect with the characters or the story.","review":"After so many glowing reviews of this book I found myself dissapointed at the end. I just never really cared about the story or the characters enough throughout the entire book. Granted, the second half is more interesting than then the first, but just barely enough to keep me reading through to the end.I was really hoping for some heartwarming story to connect me to my fellow women but that never happened. I don't think it was necessary for the author to deviate so much from the Biblical story, or at least the part that was described in the Bible. I also found the way she painted most of the men as despicable was distracting and unnecessary for portraying the hardships that women in those days no doubt suffered. If I had to describe this book in one word, the word that keeps coming to mind is disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It prompted me to reread Genisus","review":"20 minutes into the book the characters were well established and I was hooked. It was a wonderful story. And any book that can prompt an individual to read the Bible, in this case Genisus, is GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writer, but took too many liberties....","review":"First off, this writer is very good. Her descriptions of the characters and of what is happening is beautiful. It was an easy book to read although it is for more mature audiences.However, overall I was not pleased by the book. I didn't like how graphic the novel was. I just felt that some things could have been left out of the book. I also felt that the author took too many liberties while creating personalities for the people of the Bible. She tarnishes the names of people by making them into sexually perverted people and the Bible gives no indication that they were.Although the book is well written, I would have rather had the author stay more parallel to what the Bible says about the characters mentioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This story of Women was powerful. I read it in 1 day because I could not put it down. Do not be put off by the fact that it is \\"biblical\\" in nature (though for those of us who ourselves are grounded in faith it is that much more awesome). It is a truly wonderful book for everyone to read. I recommend it without hesitation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read!","review":"Dinah is an unforgettable character. This book grabbed me from the first chapter. I enjoyed the author's characterizations of Rachel, Jacob, Joseph and Rebecca. The prose is beautifully written and effortlessly evokes the world at that time. It is a riveting portrayal of the struggles and relationships of women's lives long ago, many of which still resonate in our lives today. I'd recommend this to any lover of historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Gem","review":"I work in a small bookstore so when one book starts selling unexpectedly well I take notice, and if I have the time and inclination, I read it. The Red Tent was once such book, and I'm profoundly grateful my customers brought it to my attention! It is well-crafted, compelling and thoroughly enjoyble reading, a fascinating insight, utterly believable, into a time gone by. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting new insights into Biblical stories","review":"This compares well with another work of historical fiction relative to the Bible, \\"Dear and Glorious Physician\\", which presents details about the life of St. Luke, the Evangelist. \\"The Red Tent\\" adds enrichment to the story of the lives of the sons of Jacob, about whom we know mostly Joseph and his travails. 'Deena' represents the strength and courage of all people of fiber, particularly when life is not the walk in the park that one hopes for. Her steadfastness in being victimized by her brothers, then her aloof mother-in-law removing her son from any sense of filial relationship, and her persistence in remaining true to herself, finally reconciling with her family through the eyes of a youngster-what a WOW wallop! Overall, it is a wonderful story of compassion and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok book. VERY loosely based on biblical characters","review":"The Red Tent was an Ok book. I had to pull/drag myself through it on occasions. I loved the bond between the women. PLEASE do not buy this book and expect it to follow the Bible. It appears that Ms. Diamant took a couple of names, their genealogy and some Jewish and \\"pagan\\" traditions and threw them together. I would not recommend it and will give it away to the first friend who is interested in reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both enlightening and heartwrenching","review":"The cycle of menstruation is a common theme within this book. This is an uncomfortable subject, yet The Red The Red Tent wipes away the notion of a woman's menses as disgusting, filthy and private. Menstruation is regarded by the four wives of Laban as a magical process that marks womanhood; a monthly reminder for all women that their bodies are beautiful temples of creation. Read this as a woman and you will take on a whole new perspective on your body and its capabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and disturbing","review":"I do not understand the glowing reviews for this book. The first half reads like a gynecology course for the ancients. (I must admit the second half improves, but not enough to carry the book.)It is clear that the author has a dim regard for the men of the bible, and she takes every opportunity to trash them while simultaneously elevating the women to priesthood. The women follow a goofy religion of gods and goddesses, worshiping mother earth, which culminates in a disturbing ritual at a girl's first menses.This is supposed to be historical fiction about the early Jews, yet the women don't even know about Abraham's God, and it doesn't seem that the men do much in this regard, either. I had hoped for a glimpse into early Judiasm, and was sadly disappointed.The basic story is interesting, but could be told in about three pages. The rest is tedious prose. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pagan dribble","review":"I bought this book thinking it would give me some insight into the lives of the women in the bible but was very disappointed as it focused too much on the idols and pagan ways of the women and wives of Jacob.It wasn't even scripturally sound .If you write a book based on truth then get your facts straight !The life of Jacob was centered on the God of Abraham and Isaac, the one and only true God but Diamant portrayed him as a pagan who compromised his faith for the love of women.In the true account of Jacob and his family's story his children would have been influenced by their father's faith.What a load of rubbish, I was looking forward to the historical accounts of eastern women in that time.There is nothing worse than reading historical novels which belie the truth and destroy and discredit actual characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not what I expected.","review":"The story was well written and pulled me into the pages quickly. I was expecting something completely different. While I was aware that the author was not a Christian, I was expecting a little more Old Testament history. The women of the story all worship many different gods and goddesses. I was expecting more. I was not disappointed with the entertainment of the story, but other than most of the characters names come from the Old Testament, and certain stories coming into play, there is very little to this story that could be classified as Biblical fiction. I love Egyptian history and fiction, and I think this would fall more into that category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Hogwash. Great opportunity to paint words about life for women in Biblical times but...once the author crossed the line from history to fiction she lost me. I now consider the entire book garbage and will strongly recommend against anyone I know reading. I feel sorry for those who read this and think the Biblical truth can be found. Read Genesis instead...just as exciting, same characters but the truth can be found."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"We purchased this book for a book club reading for Christian women. After reading just a short way into it, we realized it was not Biblical, had no Biblical facts in it, wasn't even a good fiction book, and was generally deplorable. Don't buy it; don't read it. It's trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A literary milestone: more boring and sanctimonious than the Old Testament!","review":"The Red Tent is to be avoided at all costs and though I haven't read any, I would urge the entire world not to buy Anita Diamant's other books. Please prove to her that women aren't stupid enough to be duped into buying a book by doing your market research, spending a few weeks in the Library of COngress and pressing all the right feminist, biblical and new-age buttons. Worthy, patronising totally lacking in historical credibility and just plain boring. This book just proves that taking an old, politically incorrect story and correcting it is far from a foolproof recipe for great literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Tent....ahhh...the smell of it...phew!","review":"I'm not familiar with the Old Testament, nor am I a mother. I have less than zero interest in the female bodily functions of others. I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies and I don't want to. That said, I found this book a chore. It was, in fact, an assignment for my book club. Had it not been, I would have steered clear of it. However, if these topics enthrall you, pick up the book and knock yourself out. None of the women portrayed were deeply drawn. Dinah (pronounced \\"dee nah\\") herself was not fully formed. The men were meer stick figures, less than two dimensional. It is, by far, the bloodiest book I've ever read. There is more blood and gore in this innocent novel than in any Steven King horror fest. At best, it's deeply superficial. And finally, I would not want to set foot in a red tent. Ohh...the smell of it. That's what I was left with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midwifery Miscarriage","review":"Sickeningly obcessed with one aspect which though important is not the be-all and end-all of womanhood. Its slant is so unifocal and simple/singlemided as to be truly an embarassment to women and demeaning to both sexes as portrayed. I read through this junk so I could criticize it having read through it entirely, although it was obvious to me after ten pages that the style and perspective were remarkably immature. The writing style is dumbed-down to a fourth grade level. If she could get off her gender obcession she might write nice books for young readers. God forbid a young female mind should read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"obsessed with sex","review":"I found the book to be teribbly obsessed with one thing, and one thing only - sex. While realizing that Biblical people were human and certainly procreated, this book seemed to be more about one woman's fictional sexual growth than about the truths that are in the Bible. The book jacket says that this book is the way the Bible would have been written if it had been written by a female. I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"This is a wonderful book and very well written. The characters are intriguing and the writing style is in conjunction with biblical times. Would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are interested in biblical times and experiencing how women lived in those days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Themes of the book concerning","review":"Although beautifully written, I cannot endorse this book in any way. To say that this book takes liberties with the Bible story is to understate the problem in the extreme.This book contains reincarnation, violence, graphic sex, and implied beastiality. This book in no way illuminates the real themes of the story of Jacob's family: Division and reconcilliation, jealousy and forgiveness, and the redeeming power of God's love."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Tent","review":"I also found this book disappointing. From a christian viewpoint it is disappointing and also inacccurate. It is earthy and vulgar and filled with descriptions that belong with private matters. I had hoped for something that reflected the daily lives of Bible women of the time period and I can't believe that all they did was this most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction","review":"This book is well written and definitely has a story to tell. However, it is a fiction and at time it becomes hard to remember that. Please, be advised it is inaccurate description of Biblical events."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real mess","review":"Tedious and ponderous. Very poorly written. Simplistic plot with no development of characters. The story was not well integrated into the historical time period, and in fact, seemed mostly unconnected to it. The characters were presented within a 21st century pychological context. It simply is not possible to understand the story or characters unless it was placed in the correct cultural context. Putting 21st century charaters in skins among livestock does not make them even remotely historically authentic. The only historical item I gleaned was that women sat on straw during their periods."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Tent","review":"A \\"biblical story\\" of birthing and bleeding. Very little description of landscape, home, geography. Lots on sexual activity. I quit reading after 90 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Biblically accurate","review":"This book portrays the women of the Bible as worshiping many other gods but not Abraham's God. I found this very disturbing as I have read other great books by Orson Scott Card (Sarah) (Rebekah) (Rachel) in the \\"Women of Genesis\\" series that are so inspiring and are faithful to the Bible account. I know this book has received good reviews but I believe it is because the readers have not read better, more accurate accounts. Another recommended writer is Lynn N. Austin's series called 'Chronicles of the King.' The first book in this series is \\"The Lord is my Strength.\\" There are 5 books in this series and you will feel yourself being pulled closer to God and prayer. All of Lynn Austin's books are wonderful and so good you will not want to put them down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought sentimentality","review":"While it was a great idea to write about a Biblical event from women's point of view, Diamant is obsessed with California-mystical sexuality. How many descriptions of oiled hair and bloody childbirth can you read?"},{"rating":"2","title":"777 stars...all those 'negative' reviews mean something positive!","review":"it's about time that orthodoxy in all its forms crumbles.here is part of the crumbling of the weak mortar.love it.the overly patriarchic impulse needs it's own tent to cower in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeking Biblical Based Fiction","review":"....then this is not the book for you. While the story was entertaining, I found that many of the events written about by the author were in direct contradiction to the Bible. For fictional books based on Biblical facts, read Francine Rivers' Lineage of Grace series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radical Feminist Claptrap","review":"For anyone looking to gain insight into the Biblical story of Jacob- well, skip The Red Tent. Other than the names of the characters, there is nothing remotely scriptural about this book.I found this book offensive in the extreme- a perversion; and particularly man-hating."},{"rating":"1","title":"lewd","review":"this book talks a lot about things of a sexual nature. not a book for people who have respect for the men in the bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something???","review":"I am amazed when searching through the recommended reads and find this book constantly on the lists. Our book club tried reading it and none of us could even get through it much less find anything worthwile to recommend it.Maybe because I didn't finish it there was something in the end that would have brought it all together for me???It just didn't hold my interest to get more than half way through and believe me, I tried.THUMBS DOWN to this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading \\"The Red Tent\\"","review":"As an American who has lived abroad for the last 7 years, I relish the few days each year I spend with childhood friends at our beach place in Massachusetts. Through the long summer afternoons, we discuss all the books we have read since the last time we have been together. The Red Tent was strongly recommended to me this past July and now I worry about what my friends think I like to read. The author of the Red Tent has taken an excellent idea, and probably has done research of a decent quality, and managed to turn out a book of remarkable pap-like quality. This is a good story exceptionally badly told. Save your pennies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing book of the year","review":"This book was suggested to me by a close friend who had read good reviews in the Atlanta paper. Because of the biblical nature, it was hoped to be our next bible study resource. I found this book to be high on emotion and low on content. Biblical reference is slight to nonexsistent. The idea for the story is wonderful but I was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but far from true","review":"My name is Dina. I did not rise from the dead to protect my name and that of my family, though I feel tied to my namesake, centuries away. This book was so very nicely written that it made me very sad to see how FAR FROM THE BIBLE it is, making our Mothers mere idol worshipers. The beauty of our Mothers is that in a time when idol worshipping was commonplace, they broke the consensus- often paying a heavy price- in order to worship one G-d. Maybe the next book of this genre will be better...."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's NOT what the bible says","review":"This book grieved me.The author portrays men as silly and arrogant. The fallout of their decisions cause the pain of innocent and wise women. The book is not intended to be history. Rather, it is to be fiction. But Diamont took real people from the bible and sullied their names."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mish mash","review":"Interesting story but trying to be historical fiction is wrong. Its a complete mish mash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-use of explicit sexual language (including bestiality)","review":"Definitely on the raunchy side. Only got through the first 30 pages, which included mention of masturbation, bestiality, and descriptions of genitalia. These are just not things I want to spend my time reading about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding!!!","review":"An absolutely amazing book!!! Why couldn't the bible have been written with such grace and captivation!? I am absolutely NOT religious, but found this to be a book that I could not put down. What a powerful book for all women. It made me see that the women in the book revered their womanhood and it's power!! There's definately a message to be learned from these incredible, strong women, by the women of today!! Hail to the Goddess Innana!! A wonderful find! Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexy Bible Story","review":"It is difficult to explain why I just did not like this book. Perhaps it is because as a reader of the Bible and a student of history, it just seemed off the mark....too much sex and unlikely events.I am not a fan of historical fiction and read this book only because a book group is going to discuss it at our next meeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction added to a story of heritage","review":"THE RED TENT gives some interesting insight to the lives of the women of Jacob's family. Unfortunately the fictional elements added to the true story of Jacob caused me distraction. The author's writing style is poetic and captivating but this book is not a good read for those who know and love the heritage and truth of the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fairy Tale","review":"The author made no attempt to follow the Biblical account of Jacob and Rachel. She took a Bible story and turned it into a bastardized version for sensationalism and the bucks. I was disappointed because I really wanted to like this novel. Had she created fictional characters for her story I'm sure I would have felt differently. As it is, the only use she made of the Bible was a source to name her characters, so it doesn't surprise me that the secular world gave her glowing reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you might think!","review":"If you are looking for authentic and biblically based christian fiction, this book IS NOT it. I began to read it with high hopes but could not even finish it. I was very disappointed that the author was not accurate in the portrayal of the Biblical characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible, Inaccurate Tripe","review":"I Love to read. When this book was recommended to me I looked forward to a fascinating book about the beginnings of Judiasm and a woman's look at the Bible. Instead I found it to be boring, inaccurate and disgusting. The lowest rating allowed was one star, otherwise I would have given it a zero. Anyone who tries to slant a rape as being a \\"she invited it\\" is sick. This is definitely the first and last book of Anita Diamant's that I ever intend to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Distortion of Biblical Fact","review":"The author certainly is at liberty to write almost anything about Dinah since the Bible says so little about her. It offends me, however, that she would take such liberties with Biblical characters such as Joseph. The Bible gives us a great deal of information on Joseph. For the author to trivialize Joseph in such a way is appalling and as I see it, a cheap way to sell books. The author wrote, for example, that Joseph had sex with not only Potiphar's wife (not Biblical) but with Potiphar as well. It's one thing to fictionalize characters we know little about, but to distort Joseph was completely unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bizarre","review":"With each chapter I debated whether to continue. Although it is mildly entertaining at moments, I am somewhat offended by the author's need to alter events from that which is recorded in the Bible. I am mystified as to the motivation behind such alterations. In some cases the truth is more dramatic than this retelling. Furthermore, I am at a loss to understand the author's need to portray her religious forefathers (and mothers) in such a poor light.The author's frequent use of misplaced modifiers kept me guessing - - disappointing from a journalist.Someone else's review said, \\"Don't believe the hype.\\" I say Amen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired work of fiction benefial to us today","review":"Red Tent has encouraged me in that even though the mysterious \\"El\\" was something the characters wanted to know more about (and seemed to revere), they struggled with their own historical beliefs and values. This book has inspired me as far as continuing my desire to help spread the Gospel to those who do not know Christ personally but have a knowledge of Him"},{"rating":"1","title":"bubblegum for brains","review":"would have enjoyed sneaking this book around to all my girlfriends--in SIXTH GRADE! I couldn't get over how sophomoric the writing was--it was funny. Sometimes, she just clobbers you over the head. I would cite some examples here, but I read it a few years ago, and can't remember any. If you just want to pass time, this book will fit the bill, as the overdose of sentimentality will make you forget how bad the writing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fanciful and Long","review":"Although this was an entertaining novel, I think that the third section could have been left out entirely. It dragged on far too long, and did not really accomplish anything. Overall it was too fictionalized to even be half believable, otherwise I might have enjoyed it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Most Overrated Book that took Ridiculuous Liberties","review":"The beginning of the books does indeed capture some very good images of female bonding. The storytelling is bland and general but does miraculously infuse life into the female characters. I was very disappointed and horrified at the extreme misguided liberties this book took. Why does the author feel she can blantantly rearrage history to fit the so-so story she told of Dinah? She could have atleast wrote a more interesting subplot to a story that was already half way written. The chapters pertaining to Jacob in the Bible are far more interesting then this narrative which loses steam halfway through.I wish I could get my money back on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than one star!","review":"I am very surprised to see good reviews for this book. There is not an ounce of depth to any given character....all surface garbage and sex that amounts to a loathesome soap opera with a pitiful ending. If you have an ounce of Jewish or Christian pride you will be disgraced by Diamant's portrayal of Biblical men and women of God. Her history is so skewed that she can't even manage to get the names or the lineage correct on the first page of the book (for example Jacob's son Simeon is \\"Simon\\" and some of his children are listed with the wrong mother, or made into twins when they weren't). I was shocked to see that she has written books on Judaism since she has no respect whatsoever for her true heritage. This book is nothing more than a garbage romance novel that is not worth the waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"I thought this book gave me insight into the lives of women of the Bible and the life of Jacob....you must read this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome insight into biblical times","review":"What a fascinating read. Not an arresting page-turner, but very compelling, and a great view into what life was like during Ruth's time.

An excellent read that I could not put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't put it down","review":"\\"The Red Tent\\" is one of the most captivating books I've read in quite awhile. I thoroughly enjoyed this story of the women of the Bible through one young girl's point of view. It's a side of the story I'd never heard before, and it was creative, beautiful and intelligent. The characters were so well developed and fascinating. I devoured this book in a couple of days because I just couldn't stop reading it! I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, magnificent story of women's lives","review":"This novel is clearly not for people who believe that the bible is factual and all the events in it literally happened the way they are written.If you are open to exploring the possibilities of what could have happened in biblical times (and yes, to biblical characters) and are dissatisifed with the paltry, shallow biblical accounts of women, I recommend this book.It is a wonderful story of sisterhood, friendship, loyalty, and love. Diamant is an excellent writer, and I was captivated by the book from start to finish (although I agree with other reviewers that the story was strongest before she left her mothers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - I couldn't put it down!","review":"This is a marvelous book. It takes you right into the life of women in ancient biblical times. Ms. Diamant wove a fascinating tale of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob. We are all familiar with the tale of Joseph, her brother, but I had never read anything on Dinah. The author's description of life in Canaan and Egypt was very vivid. You feel as if you are there. It is a very moving story, and one I would recommend to everyone with an interest in historical/biblical fiction. I look forward to other books by Anita Diamant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women and Judiasm...fascinating","review":"If you have a strong interest in the feminine side of Judiasm, or just feminism in general, this book is for you. This was the kind of book that I could not put down. I began it on the plane and read it straight through. It is definately on my top ten list. The author takes a small story from the Hebrew Bible and expands it into a novel from the women's point of view. The story includes characters such as Rebekah, Rachel, Leah. Some more conservative readers might find portions of the book blasphemous (especially the implied Asherah worship), but I think the book accurately reflects the practice of the times. A most compelling read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Archaeological evidence","review":"Excellent portrayal of the period. Having worked on archaeological sites in Israel for several years, I have been associated with sites where evidence of 'pagen' objects are commonly found right along side of objects associated with judaism...in the same households. This indicates that there was simultaneous worship of idols and \\"El\\" contrary to what one reviewer might think. I have also worked on sites rich in matriarchal 'goddess' evidence from pre-hebrew periods. The author did an excellent job of filling in the blanks left by the biblical tale and archaeological evidence. Good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge this book by its cover","review":"I was guilty of judging this book by its cover, it look like it would be too serious or \\"deep\\", not at all entertaining. Thank goodness I decided to give it a try because it was a really good book! Other reviewers have gone into great detail to give you the plot of the book, etc. so I won't repeat that. I'll just say that the characters in the book were very real and the story speaks to your heart in a way that you don't expect. Of course there's a lot of history thrown in, which thankfully comes along in any book in the historical fiction genre. I love books that make me constantly google things that the characters are doing or talking about so I can paint that picture in my mind. Of course the benefit of this is that I learn something new and obtain a whole new appreciation of a new culture.In short, this book is good, read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best books I've ever read.","review":"This is a terrific book. The insight into the life an time of the characters is amazing. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enoys historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look at women in biblical times","review":"Although this novel is a work of fiction, it truly has you think & believing that the events actually took place.

I was recommended this book by a colleague. I took her recommendation and read it, and I don't regret a thing. I'm not very religious, so I didn't understand the biblical references, but I enjoyed the book for the picture of women in biblical times it painted. This book had a very calming effect on me. This may sound cliche, but it reminded me of the things that really matter in life, like building strong relationships that stand the test of time, not only with the opposite sex, but with your own. Some people may not have liked the graphic descriptions of menstruation and childbirth, but I thought these descriptions only added to the earthy and natural feeling of the novel. I'm not going to spoil the end of it for you: you have to read it yourself.happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Tent","review":"This book offers a heartbreaking account of the silencing of the female narrative in the development of the Hebrew tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wouldn't Crash This Party","review":"The Red Tent is an area in Biblical times where women who were menstruating or who had recently given birth congregated. Diamant told us at least 100 times that the Red Tent is where they shared their stories, yet never once told us what stories were shared there. A basic lesson in writing 1.01 is to show, don't tell.Anyway, for the life of me, I can't imagine wanting to either be with menstruating women, or hearing what they have to say in that condition. Most of us, are not at our best during menses, nor do we just sit around and wax rhapsodic at those times.Several of my friends loved this book, several felt as I. There are many times when i've disagreed with people about writers, but in this case, I was not able to fathom what excited people about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a biblical story","review":"While I really did not care for this book, my biggest problem is how they sell it as biblical fiction when it has so little in common with the Bible. As the reviewers before have noted, there is alot of paganism among the women, the \\"goddess\\" cult and \\"girl power\\" type stuff. The men are generally shown as capable of a few good moments, but mostly as self-serving and uncaring men. Besides the mismarketing, I was just bored by the book. Perhaps because I was expecting something to motivate me spiritually or at least excite me with great storytelling, but this book failed on all accounts. The writing style itself is not so bad, simply done and not overly descriptive but the story is a flop. Pass this one by in favor of The Robe or Quo Vadis or anything with more depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this biblical fiction? Yes!","review":"Pardon me, I was heavily medicated when I wrote that review. Here is the sober, revised edition:This book is incredibly accurate. I trust an author who writes about Old Testament characters and history when she uses the Bible as one of her sources of research, along with mountains of other sources she spent three years of her life researching. Her book is so closely wed to the Biblical account that this book really can be classified as historical fiction or biblical fiction, in my opinion. She just did tons and tons of research and then developed her on story which complements and enriches our understanding of the Old Testament. The only purpose that I can find in trashing this book (as some have done here) is to promote a conservative agenda. If you are looking for great Biblical Fiction, I recommend The Red Tent because Diamant is a profound author who has done extensive research and consulted the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Club reading","review":"Some one in our book club recommend this for us to read.

It does make you see what women went thru back in that time but I wouldn't recommend it myself for someone else to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner","review":"A really interesting read.
