A cure for Insomnia!","review":"While any manual, or instruction on a protocol can't begin to compare to Space Mountain, this book does compare with Sominex. I attempted to study from this tome, and never was able to sit and read an entire chapter without dozing off.I found it to be incomplete, inaccurate, complex, and completely useless. The \\"Microsoft\\" solution is to memorize a bunch of graphs and tables, not to actually LEARN what is going on behind the scenes. For example, it is very easy to calculate a custom subnet mask, this ignores the process and tells you to memorize a chart. When you test, you can't use a crib-note. If you forget the numbers, you are lost.You might pass the test with this book, but you certainly won't know what to do in the real world.Save your money...look for a different title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Rated, Poor Editorial Control and Value","review":"I'm using this book now to study for my fourth MCSE exam, and find it very poor compared with other books. Here's why. 1. Many editorial mistakes make it hard to rely on. 2. The CD-ROM Multimedia materials do not illustrate the most important concepts, such as subnet masks. Instead, they illustrate fairl;y clear ideas. 3. The descriptions of subnet masks and addressing are far less clear than in other books. Examples are abitrary and not explained. The practices do not focus clearly on the themes of the chapter (try comparing the actual summaries with the actual exercises and you will see what I mean). 4. Answers to exercises are not explained in any detail. For this reason, I found the Microsoft Press material far less useful that materials such as Exam/Cram, on-line articles, and the comments of netizens. I cannot recommend this for anyone serious about self-study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright, but not the best MS Press Training Kit.","review":"Although this book was helpful in studying for the TCP/IP test, the Sybex TCP/IP Study Guide by Todd Lammle was much easier to read and more helpful in passing the exam.

However this book is written by Microsoft, the reason why these tests exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did Microsoft include the CD??","review":"The text was excellent, but including the CD is misleading.

One thing about MS training is that they seem to assume you know nothing and start with the basics, but several topics (DNS and subnetting, especially) are not explained thoroughly enough for a rookie to master. This book may be enough to pass the exam, but not ace. The New Rider's book is enough to ace the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watered down TCP/IP info","review":"I found this book good for giving a basic understanding of TCP/IP, but I can't see how anyone could pass the TCP/IP exam using this book... too watered down.

You can't ignore any areas so don't take the exam prematurely. When you think you've got it, go back and study until you thoroughly understand the material. Especially if you aren't very experienced. I gave it four stars because I'd like to see Microsoft handle the end of chapter questions/answers differently to help me resolve my incorrect responses. Hey Microsoft, Coriolis does a nice job on the questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book you need (as well as practical experience)","review":"I would say the book is sufficient for passing the exam.

Besides that the barn comes apart all the time. The stall dividers don't stay up, doors come off, and the roof gets loose all the time. It is meant to snap together, but you really need to glue it together to get it to stay. I say don't even bother with this. Do it right and get a wooden barn or don't do it at all.

I thought it would be nice to have a barn we could pack up and put away. Big Mistake! Putting it together the first time was OK and sort of a fun puzzle, but every attempt since has been horrible. I recommend getting it together (solidly) the first time and leaving it. (Perhaps instructing the children to play with it gently.) While I haven't thrown it out, I did bury it in a closet and am currently shopping for a new one...I didn't mind the plastic and cardboard so much, but it would be easy to make a similar product that kids could put together themselves, instead of a team of clever and patient adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the price its fine.....","review":"My daughter got this barn for Christmas from grandma. For the price she paid for this toy is fine. Yes its cardboard and plastic but what do you expect for a horse barn priced under twenty bucks with a Breyer brand name on it. My daughter is five and she likes it. Just dont try and move it around and make sure its on a solid surface because the floor is thin cardboard. And yes it was a monster to try and put together, the cardboard would not stay in the plastic grooves, but overall its a fine toy. I wouldnt expect it to last very long, and if water gets spilled on it the the cardboard will warp. But it serves its purpose. Although, just to let you know we have bought a wooden barn just recently to replace the cardboard plastic one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"As others have said, this is flimsy, hard to put together, and falls apart.

I've been away from comics for a long time but came back after seeing the Ultimate Avengers DVD with my kids. Naturally the first book I picked up was the Ultimates and I've been hooked ever since.Millar's work on the Ultimates was first rate. His work on the X-men was not. In the X-Men Millar completely blows off characterization in favor of action sequences. The problem is that the lack of effort in developing the characters makes the action superficial. Who cares if the Beast gets \\"killed\\"? The inconsistent artwork doesn't help. In the beginning the art was awesome but as the story progressed the art deteriorated.The hardcover format is awesome. The books look great and collecting a year's worth of comics helps hold the attention of an old guy like me. I bought Vol. 2 of the X-Men together with Vol. 1 so I'll give Millar another year's worth of stories to get his act together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this junk?","review":"While the plot is interesting, the dialogue is awful.

I was even able to reproduce a few acceptable, though not fantastic, images from 8mm film (yes, 8mm movie film!).

They told us once that the PC must have 85% performance or above for it to work, which led me to Dell since our performance was never above 82%. Dell want me to re-install the operating system.

When the middle is finally cooked, the outside overcooked, the juices run pink on the platter. The tall rack is too tall for cooking a big piece of meat, and it is necessary to cook it down in the pan. This involves turning over that chunk of meat several times to get it cooked.

Actually, it seemed like a couple of funny experiences stretched out to make a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A talented humorist","review":"Rob Ballister is a talented humorist in the tradition of Dave Barry. \\"God Does Have a Sense of Humor\\" is reminiscent of Barry's \\"Complete Guide to Guys.\\" First, Ballister effectively disarms the reader, coaxing laughter out of his battle with testicular cancer. Then he covers a myriad important subjects such as coaching little league, nickel beer night, and lingerie shopping. Each anecdotal tale, whether trying to understand the fairer sex or deconstructing family politics, is comprised of one part insight and two parts comedy. This is a must read for bachelors and cancer survivors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Pettigrew is absolutely charming!","review":"A quick review:I wanted to live in this movie. It is total eye-candy for the vintage-lover. Amazing costumes, thoughtful cinematography. Lighthearted with some hilarious scenes and good acting. A sentimental glance at love and what's worth having and losing, and amuse-bouche of the endangered virtue of personal integrity. Something about this movie reminded me of Down With Love, so if you liked that one, you'd probably like this one. I'm going to pre-order!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On My Favorite Movie List","review":"I have seen this so many times and enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it.

I must say that I was not disappointed. This is a hidden treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful. Frothy. Perfect in Every Way.","review":"This movie is fabulous. Not only is it just a great movie but it does such a good job of recreating the feel of the late 1930's. It actually feels like it was filmed back then. Frances McDormand and Amy Adam were woderful and charming. I've never heard of Frances before this movie but, she's certainly a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh! great movie!","review":"Great movie! I love it!

I tried it in both Firefox and Safari with no other programs running. It did not make a difference. The inability to buffer the movie is a real problem with this service.

Ms. Lafosse is in a relationship with three men and is confused which one of them should she dedicate her life to. With the help of Miss Pettigrew, she was able to make the right choice.I thought the plot of the movie was quite weak!The story is probably just too simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"There isn't much to this movie other than a great \\"look\\" to the sets. The various stories aren't the least bit new, and the actors really don't have much to reach for. It's the kind of movie that you should watch only if you are stuck in a hotel room for 90 minutes with nothing to do. Oh, one of the 1-star reviewers said that the \\"level of nudity\\" should have given it an R rating: that's absurd -- the only nudity is a very brief glimpse of a man's rear, and that was just as a not-very-surprising mistaken identity punchline."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful film","review":"I really liked this movie and found it to have some very interesting little twists that made it even better. First, Miss Pettigrew who was the center of the film had very few lines and actually didn't drive the action -- instead she was the catalyst for the action. Then when it came time to make her into a \\"butterfly\\" ala Pygmalion she really didn't change into Cinderella that you would expect but turned into a mature woman dressed appropriately. Yes -- the film takes place all in a 24 hour period and thus is filled with some very unlikely character intercessions but it was fun and really unlifting. There are some good lines but no belly laughs, the screen play is well written and the cting excellent. If you are looking for a fun film with no bad launguage, no explosions, no car crashes, no nudity, and no drugs -- this is the one. It is a thoroughly delightful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, very poorly acted directed and acted movie","review":"I am a big fan of the actors in this film.

A good movie for adult humor, not at all off color or silly but understated pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Amy Adams is on screen, 'Miss Pettigrew' is a wonderful movie","review":"This is two movies - one of slight remembrance when Amy Adams isn't on the screen; a delightful one whenever she appears. Starting with her breakout inJunebug, she's been among this country's finest actresses. As testament, I had thought she'd won the part inEnchanted (Widescreen Edition)based on Junebug. Nope. That hadn't come out yet when 'Enchanted' was being envisioned. She just went into an audition with 300 others and simply beat them out.Ms. Adams is a triple threat - acting, singing, dancing. She's a veteran of dinner theater and comes from a large, performing family. Her singing is on display in Miss Pettigrew. Her rendition of \\"If I Didn't Care\\" is a real eye-opener for anyone who was unaware of her vocal talents. I'm a Frances McDormand fan, no doubt, and she's in fine form here. But it's Amy Adams that makes this movie worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining","review":"Not a bad film, and it contains a good deal of enjoyable performances from all the cast. Yet, in the end, both my wife and I felt there was not quite enough there to make it stand out. Bet you Leonard Maltin gives it 2.5 stars, and I would too, but Amazon doesn't let you give half points!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many lovers, people, and soup kitchens?!","review":"Miss Pettigrew lives for a day was a cute film, but really had no plot. During the whole movie, I was just waiting for it to end, its pretty predictable and scrambled. How does Miss Pettigrew have so much insights into these people's lives? She is just kind of thrown into the commotion to find where she belongs. Its nice that she gets all prettied up and makes friends, but overall after they leave, where does that leave her? A lot of questions go unanswered in the movie. I found it doesnt rent well at work, the few people that have come in asking for it are getting it because there is nothing else to watch. I rented it because I saw the previews and thought it might be a worthwhile movie. I was in the mood for something cute and funny, what I got were very few funny moments and a bit of disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"fahgetaboutit","review":"Movie a must; quality of tape a bust - literally, it skipped and got jammed into my DVD player. Scratched up DVD anyone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A slick, empty film","review":"Miss Pettigrew serves up fluff instead of substance. It's romantic plotlines are weak, it's comedy driven by more by lust than humor, the best that can be said for it is that the sets were spectacular.I would not recommend this film to any woman seeking an inoffensive chick-flick. The level of nudity in this film should have earned it an R rating, and it's insincere drivel about the importance of love (without any of the responsibility, authenticity or commitment real love engenders) was offensive instead of sweet. I shudder to think of teenage girls watching this for fun. A very unsatisfying \\"romp\\" that went straight from my DVD player into the garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond boring","review":"I actually saw this in the movie theater and wanted my money back. The plot was totally unbelievable. The pretty woman in one of the leads was annoying and trying unsuccessfully to channel Marilyn Monroe and it was not at all convincing that the main character, Mrs. Perrigrew, a very plain and boring woman,would attract any male attention the way she did in the movie. It was just all silly and rediculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I watched only 40 minutes.

Several times as my wife, the beautiful AP and I were watching the movie I went: \\"Oh, my God, what a beautiful image.\\"I really enjoyed the interplay between Frances McDormand and Amy Adams. Just terrifc. Applause to everyone who had a hand in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"24-hours is not a good choice","review":"This is the first time I used a 24-hour rental. I got interrupted about a third of the way through the movie and was not able to get back to it within the 24-hour limit. The movie seemed to be good - cannot really evaluate that as I only saw part of it. 24-hours might work just fine for some folks - I personally will not do it again - it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"This little movie was a bit of nostalgic adult fun..Frances McDormand always does fine acting and Amy Adams is the perfect ditzy movie star."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY","review":"FRANCIS GAVE A WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE.

In desperation she knocks on Delysia Lafosse's (Amy Adams) door. In this madcap romantic comedy that takes place in one day, Pettigrew and Lafosse hit it off immediately with the older woman becoming Delysia's \\"social secretary.\\" The impulsive young singer/aspiring actress offers quite a challenge to straight-laced Pettigrew as Delysia is juggling two relationships with men who offer her career possibilities along with her relationship to her \\"true love.\\" The cast is excellent, the movie is funny, affecting, sweet, lighthearted, and poignant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"An entertaining and whimsical movie! What I liked most about this film is the light tone of a screwball comedy. Frances McDormand is fabulous at fast-paced repartee and Amy Adams simply shines. I also adored Lee Pace's performance as the man hopelessly in love with Delysia who doesn't try to hide his anguish. The art direction is fantastic and the clothes are divine. All in all, this movie is a great 90-minute escape from reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"I just finished watching this movie and I can tell you that there are several laugh-out-loud moments, and that the film overall is fantastic. You are drawn straight in to Miss Pettigrew's world and cannot help but sympathize with her lot in life, especially after the guy behind her bumps into her, throwing her food on the ground in the outdoor soup kitchen line. The poor girl thrusts herself unknowingly into a night of drama and fun in high society and is taken for a ride by the younger, more petty crowd around her. And of course, Ciaran Hinds saves the day with his dashing good looks and down-to-earth attitude about the impending war.A movie well worth watching, whether you like comedy, romance, or a little historical drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Goofers, All I hoped for & more","review":"I collect novelty songs and this collection provided some tracksunavailable from other sources.

This debut comes loaded with great tracks like Take This Torch, Death Race, and Hot Metal. Dave Carlo has some really cool riffs for 1985. Stace MacLaren doesn't have his best vocal showing, probably because the production wasn't the best on this album, however it all gets better the next album. The point is in the world of early speed/thrash metal this is a classic, right up there with Kill Em All and Killing Is My Business, if you ask me. This was an excellent starting point for a band that soon became one of the few thrash bands that continued to play metal into the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma's Wish","review":"This movie was so powerful to me that I have purchased 6 copies for family/friends.

My question: what happened to Jesus - WHY did He go to the Cross? What happened after that? What is the message of the Cross if being a nice, friendly, accessible, ordinary guy is all there is? Maybe Jim Henderson gets around to all that in his ministry, but he did not let me know anything about that in his book. Where is the rest of the story? I am still waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will change your view of \\"evangelism\\"","review":"One thing that religious folks and non-religious folks have in common is that they both hate evangelism.

What is the point of having a pouch perfectly fitted for the RAZR and then giving it a clip which is almost thicker than the phone itself! I simply cannot believe that Motorola designed this product.

There are no pads for the shin and the knee pads are to loose and bulky. The hip pads should be right over my hip bone and a smaller pad for the knee and front/side of the femur. I had another pair of padded long underwear for motocross from VTop, that are no longer available. I've long since worn those out and needed a new pair for downhill mountain bike rides.

I found this book to be lacking in content that I found interesting or moving to the reader. The author does express a deep love for his pets, however this isn't a book about veterinary medicine. I got the impression he doesn't enjoy being a veterinarian. Little is said about his life working as a vet and bonding with patients. As a veterinarian myself I was disappointed and would not give this to my clients. For anyone who has read this, veterinarians in general do not recommended letting FIV cats outside, nor purchasing pets from pet stores. The author also mentions some issues of anger management and for this reason my name has been altered a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service is Horrible","review":"While the product is decent.

Having a clear and understandable conversation is very important for me and my customers. I was very excited about bluetooth as being hands free is great when multi-tasking. This headset did allow me to hear conversations marginally well, but the person on the other end was unable to hear me. Regularly, I heard \\"are you on a headset, can you get off of it I can barely understand you\\". Apparently, I was cutting out an unacceptable amount on their end. Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset. Overall, my experience with this product was not a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose, bad voice pickup, good sound","review":"This was the first BT headset I ever bought and after only 2 days of use I realized that this headset was not for me.

But the charger was supposed to plug in & turn a blue light on that remains on until fully charged. The charger that came with it didn't fit in the hole.

I really wish these things had a power button, instead of just standby. I didn't plan to use this very often, maybe in my car or if on one of those long catchup calls, but let me tell you, it's even great while shopping. I like it a lot.

I can't seem to get it loud enough either. You'll forget about how cute it is when you're cursing at the lack of quality. I'm online now shopping for a new Motorola Bluetooth.

The bag was a very nice quality, just not what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small to be useful","review":"There were no dimensions stated. In reality it's 13x4 and only 6.5 inches deep. The photo is very misleading. Definitely returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not heavy duty","review":"It is a nice size bag. I was able to carry a bp cuff, drug book, stethoscope, thermometer, and pulse ox. However, I've had this for about a little over 3-4 months and the flap ripped apart...the flap is made up of flimsy cardboard and started slipping out. It didn't last very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent ruler with painted on numbers","review":"Seems good. The accuracy is as good as my best tape measures, and is made of durable aluminum. I wish both sides were sloped though. As it is, I bought this ruler with the same markings on both sides for sheet metal layout, but it's harder to measure to the side that's not sloped because of the parallax error.Time will tell of the durability of the markings. They aren't indented unfortunately.Overall, a good ruler. I'll update more later about the marking durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works","review":"For a cheap 24 inch ruler, it's straight and easy to read - Light weight. it works well for what it is and hard to beat at the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"What a wonderful treat to finally see the making of this groundbreaking album on film! The video entries of film and photo enhance the telling of the story.....and it is always wonderful to hear Yoko reflect, as well as having Ringo speak (he was there and in on the recording) and the late Klaus Voorman also. Great to have input from the technicians involved in the recording and mixing of the record.This was John's first solo studio album (he and Yoko had already released \\"Two Virgins\\" and \\"Life w/ the Lions\\" and \\"Live Peace in Toronto\\",......and was a stark, very telling reflection of their lives together at the time, the recent Primal Therapy with Arthur Janov, and a drastic unbundling of the type of music John had recorded thus far with the Beatles.Thoroughly unvarnished, raw, genuine,....and, in your face......for those who like their Lennon without cream and sugar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"all talking and no music","review":"Yes, I did a mistake by buying. This DVD discuss everything about Lennon and around Lennon trying make impression on me but no luck.The bottom line is he maybe was activist and political activist and community organizer but results are zero as we see from other community organizers and we remember him as musician not politician and this part missing in DVD.

I decided to get the digital HD copy to play via my Roku. I love this cartoon. I havent enjoyed a cartoon this much since I was a kid. Of coarse, NOTHING compares to the original Looney Tunes or original Scooby Doo series, but this cartoon is great, different and random which I actually enjoy. Its not insanely boring by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"This show is lost on me","review":"I started my experience with Adventure Time after repeated badgering from a friend who is a big fan of the show. Since then, I have attempted watching the series on three other occasions bringing up my total to four attempts. The first two times it was just random episodes, the last two were recommendations, one from my friend and another from the internet. While the art style is very unique and the setting interesting, I really couldn't get behind the most important aspect of any cartoon and that's the characters who really didn't stand out and were bland as well as the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ONE SEASON?!?","review":"THE REST!!

I love the Adventure Time series. I also love that finally we have a collated Season 1, instead of a smattering of various random episodes.However, the episodes featured in this pack are the censored versions. Cartoon Network found some of the humor too dark in the original episodes, and some of the adult themes in the subtext inappropriate, so they changed the writing and in some cases added or deleted scenes that completely ruined the humor of the show.The Tree Trunks episode, for example, is one of my favorite episodes of the show. However, its punchline is absolutely ruined by the addition of a single 2 second scene that offsets the dark humor of the punchline.As much as I like the show I can't in good conscience support this kind of censorship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mathmatical","review":"Adventure Time is a beautiful whismical journey of wonder and oh so clever adventures that I would watch a million times.

When I heard about this show from a couple of friends I though this show would suck, but after a couple of episodes I was hooked.I got this DVD for a christmas present today, and I really like the episodes along with the cover art and the art on the dvds. When you take Finn's hat off it shows his blond hair, and the dvds show his skull and brain, a really unique design, along with the episode guide being his skin.The DVDS contain all 26 episodes from season 1 with all the hilarity along with it.

I have to admit that I think they are pretty funny and quirky. So buying this complete first season was a great way to have all the episodes and finally remove them from our DVR.First of all, the packaging is really cool. The outer box is the white hat and blue body of Finn so when you pull it off, his face stays on the inner box. Then there are some really neat oddball 'extras' of the adults behind the series. There is also some commentary overlaid on some of the episodes. Those were really funny and a great way to get into the heads of the screwballs who have created this unique series.For any Adventure Time fans, this is a must have set."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO MUCH FOR SOOO LITTLE","review":"So much adventure time awesomeness in this slick collection.

Her lack of writing skills and connective thought process is evident through out the book.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat!","review":"I must have given this book half a dozen times as a gift to friends or family members who were in need of a little nurturing, or who needed an excuse to spend a little more time on themselves. This book has dozens of ideas for activities to help you through a day, and even a little categorized index to look for a project based on how you're feeling at the moment.A real treasure!

The game is fun and entertaining overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only game you need","review":"Since buying EQ, Iv'e necglected all my other favorite games because it fills all my gaming needs. It has lots of action, strategy, and even social interaction since you play w/ people from all over the world. The undrlying theme of advancing your character in level can consume a bit of your time but it makes leveling so much more rewarding. And no, there is no \\"end game\\", in EQ, but other than your family, who really wants it to end?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It just takes too long...","review":"The problem with this game is the same one you get with most other games like it. To make it fair for the people who invest a lot of time, they have to make leveling something that takes forever. I played it when it first came out and enjoyed it for about a month. That's a pretty long time for a game i was paying money for after i bought it. If you are looking for this type of game, try Dark Ages of Camelot, it's a better version of Everquest...basically, it has wars with other countries as well...things are handled better. The point is, this game is, nowadays, a waste of money. It was good when it came out...if you have friends to play it with...but now there are much better games out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A family ruining game","review":"Everquest is too hard and the search for experience is too timeconsuming and frustrating and when the right person starts playing it its very absorbing.It ruined my marriage.Be careful"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's addictive, not particularly fun","review":"The entire game is based on raising your characters level to meet the next goal, it's a neverending treadmill. Verant realized this of course and added in \\"Hell Levels\\" where it takes two or three times the work to get through. Aside from the ease of communicating with others, which can be done in any chatroom, the game is pointless. It actually gets harder as you increase in level. It's addictive because they always hold something just ahead of you, and you think \\"just another couple levels and I can have that spell!\\". Every time you gain abilities npcs gain two. It's infuriating, and time consuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this.. not because it's a bad game read on!","review":"Sure you CAN buy this seemingly cheaper version of Everquest for 9.99 and it might be a good deal... but later on you will realise you NEED the expansions to really be part of the game. Then you will end up paying 19.99 for Scars of Velious and another 29.99 for another original Everqeust and the Ruins of Kunark. You are MUCH MUCH better off buying the 29.99 Ruins of Kunark and then the Scars of Velious saving you 9.99. It's well worth it too because if you don't buy Ruins of Kunark you can't play the lizard man race. Sure it's 10 more of an investment to buy kunark now but you will save money in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"I might get yelled at by fellow gamers, but I hated Everquest.1) The graphics were horrbile compared to Asheron's Call2) I got motion sickness.

If you get the expantion, ruins of Kunark, it is even better. WIth everything it has, I am truly surprised it is only ... dollars a month. If you ask me, if it was ... a month, it would still be worth it, even though I would have to give up Food every other week to do that.

Sorry for everyone out there who likes this game, but I would give it a .5 if possible.*one thumb down*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say Pac-man?","review":"You may of seen my last review, that was kinda of an introduction to EQ. Now that I think about it makeing your own quest is a little off from what describes this game. I think Pac-man is what describes this game. Why do I say that? Pac-man was a game where you did the same thing over and over with no sign of changeing, this is what Everquest is. You run around and kill things and sell the loot. As you progress through the game you kill new things in new places with new ways to kil them. In this game thats al you do no story just the same thing over and over with no sign of change. If you ever get caought in this Everquest web you'll eventually notice your doing the same things over and over. The rewards for killing things are very slim, next to nothing. Then you'll eventually be able to kill other players and take their loot. Thats all that Everquest is, no matter how many quests their are for you the rewards are nothing to be noticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"EverQuest: The Game of Downloads","review":"EverQuest is a good game, but with the terrible download times and the added patches, and everything else, including ALL THE BUGS!!!!!!, it is a terriblegame. You spend 20 hours downloading the dumb thing, and then another 20 loading the thing. I think that sony should think of letting Verant work by itself. Sony doesn't care. The Tech Support for the game is AWFUL!! i can't believe they expect people to pay (price)!! per month! I could see if it was free, but (price)!! What a rip-off"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rocket","review":"I rented this movie a couple of years ago and wanted to own my own copy because I find it inspiring. Maurice Richard is the Gary Cooper of hockey, a man of few words, a man of action, and a man who keeps it simple. He loves hockey, he loves his wife and family. He works hard, practices long hours, suffers quietly through physical injuries and injustice, and yet the man of few words speaks out through a sportswriter, trying to protect his fellow French-Canadian players from unnecessary physical harm. Like Jackie Robinson, he suffered much, and mostly in silence. He is an inspiration to many, yet it took a physical and emotional toll on him and his family. I like this movie because none of this seemed heavy-handed but was woven into a story about a young man and an adult who, through perseverance and unfailing hope, is able to play a game that he loves to play and wins because he loves to win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hockey Rulz","review":"What a great movie.

I cannot believe Mattel makes such a pitiful Barbie and slaps such a huge price on it. I have been a lover of Barbie for many years and remember my first Christmas I received my first Skipper doll in 1969. I still have her. I don't know what happened with Mattel offering this piece of junk. I was ripped off. Check this doll out before you buy it. Open the box in the parking lot.

It has to be propped up or carefully stood on her feet and it doesn't sit down. The wings kept falling off and the outfit was very cheap. The slippers wouldn't stay on either. It's very sad that an item that costs so much is made so poorly and such a rip off. Shame on Mattel. They could do much better! These were on clearance at 70% off after Christmas.

Now who would throw away 109 maybe 110 dollars so that the child could play with something that will take up space. My friend had one of those.

The book is fine but the CDs are shoddy.The sound quality is poor - room noise, coughing, shuffling of feet - all clearly audible in the background. The track breaks on the CDs correspond to an entire chapter in the textbook. Because each chapter has 4-8 listening exercises, manually advancing to the exercise you want is a pain.The listening exercises on the CDs are not well timed - to follow along in the book, you MUST frequently pause the recording to keep up.Overall the CDs complement the textbook's solid content, but poor structure, sloppy production values and an expensive price tag make them feel like a rip-off.

However, this film was trying so hard to be gritty, it just ended up being boring for me. None of these usually talented actors showed any spirit - it was like they were being beaten down by the violent, depressing story amid a dark and gloomy setting. Most of the film is quite literally dark, and muddy looking. There are sporadic scenes of intense violence, but no real emotion. I think I needed someone to identify with, whether villain or hero, but instead I got several characters who all wanted to be put out of their misery. Overall, I found this to be a very slow movie with nowhere to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brooklyn's Finest DVD - 3 1/2 stars","review":"I enjoyed the suspense in this gritty story of Brooklyn's 65th precinct. Three cops, played by Richard Gere, Don Cheadle and Ethan Hawke, operate in the gray area between right and wrong. Wesley Snipes gives the film punch as the bad guy (or is he, really?) The stories are interwoven as the tension builds - who will live? Who will fall? Will any of them choose the high road? As their paths cross the lines between good and evil blur.

Cops that are worthless as cops and who don't follow SOP. Too much of the \\"it's not my area\\" mentality when they're a couple of blocks away. Just a hint. Cops are STATE certified.Some of the best actors in country, whose talents are wasted in this movie. One of few realisms is when Richard Gere's character retires and the department keeps his badge.

Not only was it excessively violent and dark, but there just didn't seem to be a real point to it. Even if it was just supposed to show the lives of three Brooklyn cops, there was no discernible story line. Richard Gere is counting down the days to retirement and patronizing a hooker. Don Cheadle is undercover and getting caught up in the lifestyle, and Ethan Hawke is a stressed father willing to kill for drug money.

I am a single female graduate student and I like to watch movies from time to time to escape the academic world. A few minutes into the movie I got up to start washing dishes; it did not catch my attention. The movie reminded me of a combination of Training Day and that TV show \\"The Shield\\". A lot of killing, lots of swearing, bad cops, drugs and money. I have always admired Don Cheadle so I'll watch anything that he's in, but I felt like I had seen this type of movie many times before. I wouldn't even classify it as mindless entertainment because it was a bit too gritty to be entertaining. I bet if I gave this movie to any of my male friends they would love it. There was lots of action and the movie moves along at a fast pace, but it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood's Worst","review":"What an awful boring movie! Hardly deserving the one star I'm giving it! How could a group of such professional actors produce such a lifeless crap? With the exception of Wesley Snipes who brings joy to every scene he's on, the other \\"great\\" actors are clueless and flat-out uninteresting. As if there's a competition amongst them: Let's see who could be more boring this time. Mr. Richard Gere: That scene with you and the hooker didn't help either other than trashing your long acting career. There's plenty of free porn available on the Internet to feed a sex-starved viewer. We didn't need that from you! And don't give us that BS about the movie trying to be realistic and reflect life in the inner city. This is just trash at its worst.Don't waste your money. This film is not entertaining, educational, funny, adventurous, or anything worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Cause","review":"In a misguided attempt to portray modern inner-city conflict, this pseudo-docudrama ends up unfolding as little more than a dysexic perspective of multi-spectral crooked-cop endeavors that can only end (and of course do) in a ridiculous dramatic outcome.This was an \\"action\\" movie that rambles on with the prospect of making very little sense. The different story lines are so disjointed from (and slow to embrace) the main theme that it makes the whole movie hard to understand.--- this was the type of movie that you have to put on pause when you go to the bathroom; and, even then, it is very hard to follow/figure out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"When I purchased this product, I really believed that I was purchasing the video and what I got was the trailer.

I did find it quite depressing and just not believable.The Director: I think Fuqua is Amazing. I enjoyed Training Day, Tears of the Sun and Shooter. I did not think this film was at all like Training Day...Actors: I like all but Snipes who has done so many low budget cheesy martial arts wannabe flicks I had completely forgotten about him.

I mean, how can you go wrong with the likes ofRichard Gere , Ethan Hawke and the great Don Cheadle? (not to mention Wesley Snipes who in an ironic twist is getting OUT of prison) The answer is: Ho-Hum seen-it-all-before writing. Instead of a solid satisfying story you get predictable and highly gratuitous violence. Just when things start to look like MAYBE the story is going somewhere, you get the tried and true (or not so true in this case)plot device of separate lives colliding. IN this case I found myself saying \\"So What\\" ? If pointless and depressing with a story that ultimately goes nowhere is what you are after, then this movie will be very satisfying. If not, look elsewhere to kill a few hours. Hitting yourself on the head with a hammer comes to mind.

Seriously, if nothing else just watch the movie for the acting. Script isn't half bad. I'd love to see Snipes and Cheadle in more movies together.

Shirley MacLaine has never been one of my favorite actresses, but in this film she really IS Mary Kay, one of the more complex personalities on the American business scene. The film does a good job of presenting those, often competing, complexities while at the same time remaining funny.The staging is also impressive. The story takes place in Dallas, and all of the interiors look like they came directly from the Horchow catalogue -- Where Too Much Is Not Enough.The actors and actresses do a superb job of affecting the Dallas accent, a wonderful combination of \\"Upstairs, Downstairs\\" (mostly Downstairs) and \\"Hee Haw.\\"All in all, this film is a hoot, especially for anyone familiar with Dallas.Suggested Additional Reading for Texas sorority girls (past and present):The Devil in the Junior League"},{"rating":"2","title":"A risk taker buying back a public company to stalwart her competition","review":"Shirley Maclaine gives a stella performance in her portrayal of Mary Kay.

I can't at all understand a review saying this is dull and dated. Perhaps the writer of that review didn't understand that these novellas are set in very specific places and times. The writing is so sharp and evocative, that one can become lost in the stories. Each of the three novellas is very different, so that there is something here for everyone. Although each is different, what all three have in common is deft use of detail, full characterization, and some very hot action!

What impressed me most was that the authors took into account the fact that not everyone has the ideal accomodations for a darkroom.

Everything is spelled out in detail allowing you to \\"opt out\\" of any part of the process that you feel may be \\"over your head\\" (call the plummer) and to deal with those that are within your reach.

This camera is small, cheap, and has... good enough image quality. It's touted as having great low-light capabilities, but the quality at ISO 1600 and ISO 2000 is crap. Other than that, it suffers from the same problems that just about every camera in this class does: very little manual control, no RAW, etc.Don't get me wrong: I really like this camera. I think I just have a chip on my shoulder about the state of the point and shoot market. If you want a point and shoot, this is a very good one.

Even if Fuji fixes it under warranty at no charge, I have no use of the camera while they do so, and I had to pay to ship it to them insured, with UPS. Adding that cost to the camera alone, I could have bought a more fully featured model from a competing manufacturer.Maybe I'm spoiled, but I've had a ton of digital cameras since the first floppy Sony Mavicas debuted back in the dark ages.

The best tracks are the subdued Fever, the romantic We're All Alone, the lovely Words and the poignant Bird On A Wire.

This is the first book I have read that provides a detailed, well referenced history of capoeira from pre-slave trade in Africa to the establishment of recognized schools for the art in Brazil. I highly recommend this book for those wanting to know the roots and history of capoeira.My only criticisms are:the book does not present the information in a definitive chronological order but jumps forward and backward in time within a presented era, making it a bit difficult to follow at times; andTaylor could have used a few (even one or two) maps to illustrate the locations he discusses. The reader can always use an atlas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"The book tried to introduce new \\"theories\\" in every paragraph.

It appears to be filled with technically accurate information, but not organized in a form amenable to learning. It is probably not even appropriate for an expert: an expert could probably verify its correctness, but it's not organized appropriately to be used as reference.I have a PhD in computer science and I'm used to working hard to master technical material without assistance. However, I found it extremely difficult to fight off the feeling that these authors' goal was to parade what they know without actually sharing it.There's no need to pay extra money for color photographs of the authors' car license plates and a half-breed cat.

Absurd.2) An equally two-dimensional plot. Steinbeck's unbearable heavy handedness in getting his all important \\"moral\\" across completely crushes out any vestige of meaningful charcterization or subtext.3) The ending. No, I'm not about to say \\"ew!\\" What i will say is that thats what he WANTS you to think. He wants you to put down this book and \\"realzie the impossibility the america dream, and the cutthroat nature of humans in general.\\" The problem with this conclusion is the entire book is completely contrived!

However, when you deal with remastered editions, you sometimes run into movies who have had their works of art remastered by lazy companies that cut corners. As some of the other reviews have mentioned, the corners and shadows do have some flaws. The largest flaws I mainly saw, which literally annoyed me, was the remastered work on the CGI shots. Some of the CGI shots, compared to the non-remastered editions, seem like they were drawn by a Japanese cartoon artist for the local newspaper. Other than that, the general shots of the characters and the motions between the characters is great. If you are not too concerned with the issue of the CGI, I encourage you to purchase this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word...AWESOME","review":"Even though I love watching movies in HD, it's always hard to make the decision to throw down the cash to replace movies I already own on DVD with their Blu-Ray counterparts. That being said, when I came across this Star Trek TNG movie collection set I took a chance and ordered them along with the Blu-Ray set of original cast movies (see my other reviews). All 10 movies for under $100, beautifully done in high definition with mind-blowing 7.1 channel sound? It was a no brainer. DVD set going on eBay; Blu-Ray sets with their attractive boxes and packaging going on display in my movie rack. If you think you've seen these movies before, watch them again in this set and think again.

Lots of fun facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set!","review":"I absolutely love this set. High def adds so much detail. The video and audio both are a huge improvement from the DVDs. My only complaint is that they didn't do anything special for the deleted scenes in Generations or Nemesis. Both movies would have been better if they had been recut with some of the shots put back in. Especially Nemesis. It was all about family and the end of the journey and the director cut out the character building moments. It's sad that a lot of the scenes are not remastered at all and have no effects. They should have cleaned them up before releasing them. I did think the bonus disc was a nice touch with the history of the Enterprise. Too bad they didn't have the rights to the video from Borg Invasion with Janeway, the Doctor, and the Queen. Anyway, I recommend this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMPRESSIVE","review":"I like the Piccard movies but I*ve only seen bits and pieces. My kids were too young to know Star Trek so I*m introducing it to them for the very first time.

I*ve never imagined the Captains themselves doing hand-to-hand combat, crashing the star fleet into another ship just to prove who has the real balls, it*s like watching Pirates of the Carribean. It defies logic and only proves that humans are an irrational bunch, it would shock and awe of other civilizations. I can*t wait to see the remaining discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic... but not perfect....","review":"This is something I've been waiting for since blu-ray was first announced. And while the main feature was exactly as I always envisioned(Sleek and visually stunning). Some of the extra features lacked the real depth that you would come to expect from a collectors edition boxset in blu-ray.The round-table discussions were mediocre at best. Apart from the host, I dont believe any of the panel even remotely feigned wanting to be there and their analysis left a lot to be desired; at times even misguided or misinformed. The Starfleet Academy extra feature was redundant at best, only explaining in no extra detail exactly what you just observed in the main feature; although noteworthy because its presented by a most attractive cadet :)Apart from that though the commentaries were highly entertaining as well as the homage to Data. All in all brilliant value for money and highly recommended addition to any sci-fi fans collection. Buy now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"These movies transferred to Blu-ray awesome!

The Packaging was great with 5 slimline cases in a sturdy box with a Halogram on it. The extra disc called Evolutions, really didn't have much to offer that we haven't already seen before. It's just an extra disc. The 4 movies were the icing on the Blu-ray cake. They are all nice and clear and well worth evey penny it cost me. Thanks Again, Amazon. You really Do Deliver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, good not great picture quality, non-bluray version","review":"I got the non Bluray version and have only started watching it today. I'm starting off with Star Trek First Contact and the quality is nice, but not the same as the Hulu version that appeared almost a year ago. It doesn't appear to be remastered and doesn't handle the stretch feature well...also some of the ship and planetary shots are not their best, but overall it's a great value audio and video and I recommend purchasing it.Star Trek Insurrection has been \\"remastered\\" with CGI that makes the Son'a ships look worse then in the theatrical release.Unfortunately, none of these DVD's have deleted/extra scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Some of you early adopters to CD in the mid 80's may remember that in the mad dash of record labels to get their catalogs to this new and exciting digital format, scant attention was paid to mastering quality. As a result, many titles sounded noticeably worse than their analog counterparts. While not an exact analogy, a similar complaint might be lodged at this release. Each title has a soft, almost standard definition DVD quality that does not do justice to the Blu-ray format. While there are scenes in each movie that excel in detail and color rendition, sadly they are few. This is especially disappointing given the excellent quality of the SD DVDs. If you own the SD versions, particularly if you have a player that upconverts, save your money until these titles are remastered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than vhs","review":"I hate the requirement of having to add words and quit doing reviews because of it.send, send, send send"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO QUALITY CONTROL","review":"ORDERED BLU RAY STARTREK 4 PACK.

These legs work as promised, however the product description on Amazon is a little light on measurements. The legs themselves are almost square at the base that attaches to your laptop, approximately 1.5\\"x2\\". The adhesive seems to be pretty strong. Be forewarned that if you cannot attach the legs to the very bottom rear of your laptop that you may need to order some rubber feet so that your laptop will not tilt backward when the legs are not in use. Other than that, I am satisfied so far.UPDATE, SEVERAL DAYS LATER: Still satisfied! Working great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works great, when it stays on","review":"These legs are great for ventilation and tilting the laptop for easier typing.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"I have hand problems that make it difficult to type on a laptop that is not tilted up. These legs do the job just fine. I only use the smaller legs to get the tilt I want. The legs feel strong and the opening/closing action is reliable. If I had to wish for anything, it would be for a soft or rubbery surface where the legs contact the table when they are extended; on a few surfaces (not many), it can slide a bit when you jostle the laptop.

For example, I would have taken my editor's red pen to filler like this: \\"There were lots of photographs of the Hindenberg as it started its descent in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, and quite a few of the charred rubble on the ground afterwards, but none of them made the cover of a Led Zeppelin album.\\" If you like this kind of commentary in a book on photographic techniques, then Busch's book will delight you.But if you're looking for basic information such as the aperture and shutter speed settings for the many sample photos in the book, forget it, you won't find them here. As well, the coverage is lean, spotty and uneven in key areas. Take lenses for example. There are small sections on lenses for architectural, macro, and scenic photography but nothing on portrait photography.

I learned a lot about photography and digital shooting from this book. I don't think professional photographers are out there buying books on how to take pictures. If they didn't already know how to use their cameras they couldn't call themselves professionals.

Basically if you looking for a professional photography book this in not the book for you, but if your using a point-and-shoot its worth buying. I hope this review was useful to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the Twilight Zone....","review":"If you like \\"the Twilight Zone\\" then you will probably like \\"the Ray Bradbury Theatre\\". This bargain priced DVD offers 13 episodes of the show that ran on HBO in the mid-80s. HBO did not skimp on production costs either. Great sets and effects for the era, HBO recruited the likes of Peter O'Toole, Jeff Goldblum, Drew Barrymore Leslie Neilsen, and even William Shatner to star in the episodes. All the shows are based on short stories written by Mr. Bradbury who we see in the opening credits typing away and telling us how he comes up with his ideas. Some of the shows are horror, some sci-fi, some just kind of fun. You cannot go wrong with this one. Some of the best stuff produced for TV in the 80s. \\"The Town where nobody got off\\" is a personal favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stories interesting/DVD quality lacking","review":"Most of the stories were interesting and entertaining, but the DVD was lacking in quality. The presentation was a bit amateurish, as if someone had copied it directly from the television program: many pixels and blurry scenes also."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ray bradbury theater episodes.","review":"These were meant for cable TV in the 1980's. So it's still so-so on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read !","review":"I enjoyed this book much more than City of Night. It's very readable and believable, and truly heartbreaking. The writing style is quite unique and takes a bit of getting used to, but the ending is tied together masterfully. (Similar to Picano's \\"Like People in History\\" with jumping plot lines.) My only criticism is that it is a bit too graphic, but then again, so were the early 80's. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Coming of the Night by John Rechy","review":"Ok what was the point of this book? It was nothing more than a study of oversexed, kinky, S&M-obsessed perverts throughout the course of a windy day in Los Angeles. Rechy's overused symbol of the \\"Sant'Anas\\" was eventually annoying and his pervasive sexual language and scenarios had no artistic merit whatsoever and no purpose other than thoroughly grossing out this reader. Save your time and read a true gay masterpiece- \\"Dancer From the Dance\\"- instead. I regret picking this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warmed Over Rechy!","review":"While Rechy retains his usual competence in portraying man-to-man action, his misperceptions on SM are still all too present. If you have read Rushes, you don't need this book. Up to the point of covering S&M activity, Rechy does a pretty good job with the gay male libido. However, here (as in rushes) he has no perceptions of the SM dynamic. His details of heavier-duty encounters emerge as ignorant diatribe. He sees a substitution of violence and symbol for sexuality, ignoring the actual perceptions of those engaged in heavier duty action.This tends to invalidate his whole work. Perhaps he should stick to the hustler scene and retire from descriptions of that which he obviously does not understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"man, what a disappointment","review":"i bought this book on the strength of his earlier works but i'd advise the rest of you to save your pennies. it's not a good book and it's far from his best work. yes, it is sex-filled but the characters are flat and you end up not caring about any of them, even if you can keep them straight [as it were]. there are dozens of books that chronicle this time period in a more engaging way. on top of that, it wasn't even hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"For such a plot driven novel, Rechy's heavy-handedness is its downfall. His characters are two-dimensional and wooden, his plot completely predictable. What does that leave us? Not much, other than graphic sex, which can be found anywhere. This was such a disappointment, as I loved \\"City of Night\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gay read for a long time","review":"John Rechy has written a superb novel full of memorable characters. The cross section of the gay community is strong and believable as are the other characters. A novel of people indulging on the brink of an unknown disaster at the time makes for a significant and perhaps historical account of gay life before the AIDS epidemic. As usual strong writing, great sex and a dash of humour. A must for any gay bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Age of Promiscuity","review":"On a hot night just before the dawn of AIDS 20 different men are cruising for sex in the streets of Los Angeles. Rechy explores the inner motives of the characters from lust to love, acceptance, transcendance, money, validation. The pacing is breakneck and the conclusion suitably ominous, but the inner dialog of the characters occasionally descends into preachiness. This exploration of the twilight of the golden age of promiscuity is disturbing, entertaining and thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I enjoyed this book much more than City of Night.

I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Rechy's Best","review":"The Coming of the Night is one of Rechy's best books to follow City of Night and Numbers. The writing is imaginative, and loaded with fantastic descriptions of the nonverbal aspects of communication, really capturing the emotional nuances of conversation. The complexity of the sexually complicated characters is developed in short recurring vignettes in a masterful use of suspense. Some of the archetypical characters types that reappear in various novels by Rechy are present, with believable life circumstances. Various recognizable gay male identities are portrayed, the men vulnerable in their humanity. The story's tension builds precipitously, resulting in a profound climx foreshadowing the historical events that follow in the next few decades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scripturally accurate","review":"The real story is found in the book of Exodus, the first 14 chapters. The story portrayed on this video/DVD has the same central human figure (Moses) and the same setting (Egypt) but the rest of it is quite imaginative and does not agree with the truth.While I always encourage students to use their imaginations, it is hard to understand how someone could write a story like this and still market it as the story of Moses. Although it's told well and is interesting, it's not simply adding creative material to the story as written.I will be joining those who are throwing away their copies. If you've already bought this, take a good look before letting your children watch it. If you're looking for a good Moses movie, the Prince of Egypt one is much more accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was AWFUL","review":"I bought this movie for my children, just to have a similar story told in a different way. Well, it was more than different - it was WAY off base. The story totally departs from the Biblical account of the life of Moses - some of the plagues are different, the Egyptian \\"brother\\" (named Amun?) joins him and becomes repentant, finally helping Moses to lead the Hebrew slaves out of Egypt. This is directly opposite of the Hebrew brother of Moses, named Aaron, joining Moses and working with him. The use of the \\"burning bush\\" becomes very \\"magical\\" instead of a once in a lifetime encounter with God, and is used repeatedly throughout the movie, including the bush coming to Moses while he and Amun are in prison.I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone else. My 3rd grader said, \\"Mom, we need to get rid of this movie.\\" I guess that sums up the review right there, as we will be getting rid of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"The story of Moses told on this DVD isn't the best of the best, but it is fair, and it does tell the story but in a different way. I would say buy this DVD is you're looking for a cheaper version of \\"Prince of Egypt\\" which anyways this is called \\"Prince of the Nile.\\" Otherwise, I don't recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price and Good Product","review":"I only gave this 4 stars because the lighter colors do not show up on black backgrounds. I had some black CDs that i wanted to burn albums to and I was hoping the lighter colors in this set would show up on those CDs but they didn't. Guess I will have to try more expensive gold or silver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Batch","review":"I am not sure who is to blame here. I have been using Sharpies forever, but this batch was not a good one. 3 of the pens came dry! I shook them, left them upside down, etc, nothing worked. So I would still get sharpies, but next time I will not buy them online. You never know how long they were sitting in storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does everything it advertises and more.","review":"These things are great for doing many things. For general use, signs and labeling things, these are usually a good choice because of their bright colors and long lasting tips. The only issue is that these things can have a tendency to dry out quickly.I bought these for a marker exercise for art. I was skeptical about using them for artistic purposes, but they turned out great. Solid, vivid colors and very little to non-existent self overlapping. They also blended into each other perfectly. The only issue would be that they dried out very quickly.Pros:-Great for signs and labels etc-Good choice for art markers-Bright and vivid colors-Long lasting if used for just signs and labelsCons:-Very short lifespan for art"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pens","review":"Eight Sharpie pens for under a buck each is a good deal only if you throw these pens in with other items and pay now shipping. But in that case, go for it. Sharpies are the best markets under the sun, and always come in handy. The ink lasts forever, and the pens take last and last. Seldom do the tips go dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Rancher's Wife\\" is a great read.","review":"A woman abandoned by her husband who lived in a mud hut was starving. She swallowed her pride and rode over the hill to the ranch she discovered and asked for food. When they made brief contact they both felt something between them. Although he is married to his ungrateful pregnant wife, he still feels something for his neighbor and offers her his home when his wife dies. He needs a mother for his child. Will she accept the offer? Or does she still think her errant husband will come back to her? Read the book! It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Oldie But a Great Album","review":"The reason for only 4 stars is pretty simple. This CD Should have 5 BIG Stars but the production value drops it to the point of \\"Where did you buy that Mr. Microphone Dude?\\" - HOWEVER, this is really worth buying just because Country Dick, Buddy Blue, Jerry Raney & Rolle Love do a great job - It's the production team that should have been taken behind the woodshed and beaten until they paid back every cent the band invested. The cut, Riverside has a unique quality and the lyrics are so unique to the S. CA mentality, mainly those souls familiar with the Inland Empire that for me, is and was special. Naturally Blue's Gunsale At The Church is a MUST HAVE song. Why this song has never become the Number ONE hit it should be, is a mystery. Country Dick shines in BIG UGLY WHEELS. We miss Country Dick, God bless him, he died with his boots on. Not the Beat Farmers best but compared to most of the hyped up junk out there, this album should be part of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Non Comp","review":"This is the best original album by THE BEAT FARMERS. Their albums tend to be uneven and even indifferent, although the Country Dick tracks are always good. This album is fairly consistent and contains the best non-Country Dick track \`Gun Sale At The Church'. The Beat Farmers are a pretty standard bar band, sound wise, stripped down rock and roll with a country flare, sort of like Cowboy Mouth or Credence. That being said, they are not nearly as interesting or lively as those bands, except when Country Dick sings. If you own one Beat Farmers disc (comps excepted) it should be this one.

It was insightful, but I lost all respect for Conan to see how he treats people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be more funny...!","review":"It is really a shame to see how Conan treats almost everyone around him (except for his family maybe). Just skip to minute 47 and check out how Jack McBrayer (aka Kenneth Parcell of 30 Rock) is warmly welcomed or should I rather say humiliated - maybe it is because 30 Rock is a NBC show??? I admit Conan acts funny in parts but his spoiled behavior really ruins the show here. When I watched this I felt like he is masking his egomaniac attributes and hunger for encouragement by alleged \\"jokes\\". He is complaining and fishing for compliments all the time instead of being creative, witty and charismatic. To me it just felt dumb. I am sure Conan O'Brien can do better than this. He did better in the past for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome behind the scenes look at Conan","review":"I expected things to be a bit censored or sugar-coated, but this was an excellent behind-the-scenes look at Conan and his staff, during the time after just leaving the Tonight Show and during his cross country live show tour.

If you're planning to install a remote starter yourself you will most likely have to take the cover off the steering column, so save yourself the cost of this product and take that spare key, place it next to your ignition where it won't interfere with moving parts, secure it with some insulated copper wire, and there you have it, you've just create your own bypass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible bypass module","review":"Not the greatest idea to leave a key inside the car.

Spare yourself the headache that comes with this product. Initially I could not get any installer who would use this bypass. I finally got one who explained to me why others would not want to use it, he gave it a try. Guess what? the very next day, the car we installed it on had its battery run down because of this. It is also not safe because you've to leave a spare (valet) key in the bypass. We bought a new one for $65 which has been working just fine.

After investigating the matter, his leads to a financial conspiracy involving one of the largest hedge funds, headed by a Soros-like Frenchman who is trying to manipulate the Global Markets by creating a crash in Eastern Europe.

This double cd contains a selection of jigs reels and polkas all with a variety of playing techniques, but to really get the bodhran sound you'll have to wind up the bass.

Maybe its just the time flying by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth waiting For!!","review":"Finally a CD of the bodhran that's great for players and lovers of Irish music. From the first ever recording of the instrument up to modern day greats like Ringo Mcdonagh and Robbie Harris. I love it!!

Lots of screechy whistles & fiddles, not so much drums, as you'd expect. This is more like somebody's \\"Irish Mix tape\\" than Pure Bodhran.Oddly, not a SINGLE drummer was honored with identification on the music credits inside the CD. This is also telling about the quality of the cuts. If you'd like to hear some superb Bodhran playing, this isn't the CD for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure bodhran","review":"I am a bodhran player and I ordered this title much to my disappointment. Although there are a few innovative pieces,on the whole it doesn't do much for the bodrahn's rep. I swear there is also a cut from the earliest recording in America of Irish music. This is not pure anything,just the same old hat with a few new feathers and electronic doodads.Celtic music is not Jazz and although it may feature one instrument as the lead voice the instumental support of the others gives it the cohesion that originated as the Ceili sound.Not a concert but a conversation. For those of us always wanting to improve, my greatest wish would be a recording that sounded like you were sitting next to the drummer at a session. Any brilliant music producers out there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Rewarded for Listening Carefully","review":"Though the rhythms and melodies on this CD are enough to catch ones attention on the first listen, the extraordinary level of detail and wide range of sounds gives it a depth that rewards repeated listenings. These thoughtful, talented and sophisticated musicians have crafted an innovative and satisfying set. Though this has fewer improvised flights of fancy than Memory is An Elephant, it too has a bright energy and shows ample imagination. The tunes are well-ordered and the final Helium Reprise featuring Tom Waits is a wonderful surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hint At Riot To Tint Hair = Ultimate Rhino Hit","review":"Accordion, violin & banjo (or sometimes dobro, harmonica and viola) make a bluegrass/Klezmer kind of sound, although the compositions tend toward a more cinematic sweep. Like Messiaen's \\"Quatuor pour la fin du temps\\" the instrumentation here feels accidental, circumstantial even. THT wanders between salon music and fractured dance band, never really deciding who, or what they are.Or maybe what they are is this fuzzy in-between, where nothing is what it seems?Helium is the second lightest element."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"The 1986 edition of the book starts out saying that it is not \\"a course in how to construct knowledge-based systems (page v preface)\\" and that is so true. As the book attempts to give an informative overview of various expert system techniques it fails to clearly communicate them due to its lack of clear \\"how to\\" instructions which are absolutely necessary to explain the complex principles covered. I have a Master's degree in Communications myself and find this book to be one of the types assigned to students due to its industry status rather than because it gets the job of education done."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Things Considered, Pretty Good!","review":"I received the Starhunter Vol. 1 DVD and I enjoyed it, notexperiencing any video problems that others have mention.Those problems are probably in their DVD players rather thanin the disks themselves.

I was also annoyed that one show, FamilyValues, was missing from this disk as it was only the thirdshow aired and it should have been here.But aside from that, I am pleased to have Starhunter on DVDfree and uncut since the local station that carried it on TVhad cut out so much just to allow for more commercials.

In debates with Darwinists, I always use the term evotheism and it is extremely effective. Hunter has given me more tools as an apologist.The strongest part of the book is his discussion of evil and the impact of sin. He forcefully points out that Evotheists use the problem of pain and evil to further their doctrine that no God would have created species that would die out or be subjected to imperfections. Most readers should find his point of view extremely compelling.My complaint about the book is that it is too short and I felt as if I were always waiting for just a little more information.

I love the idea of putting salad in glass canning jars.. very cleaver indeed! This is a cookbook you can read... as my best friend Jeannie and I have done for years.My all time favorite cookbook is Cooking From Quilt Country and this book reminds me of it. I don't think you can go wrong buying this book, and who knows.. maybe Jeannie will find a copy in her mailbox!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jewels of Miriam Haskell","review":"I had so much looked forward to reading this book that when it arrived I was disappointed. The text was rather disorganised in places and so it was hard to follow the points the author was making about the early life and various influences upon Miriam Haskell. Most of the book was focused on one designer and most of the pictures, although they are very nice pictures, came from the same few sources. I was hoping for a carefully researched piece which told me a lot more about Haskell and gave a much wider assortment of the pieces she designed. The book left you asking more questions than it answered and wanting more variety then it presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for Yoga","review":"This a thick, comfortable mat but it should not be billed as a yoga mat. It is too thick for balancing poses. It may work well for pilates but is not useful for yoga. I'm disappointed to have paid a lot of money for a mat that I cannot use for one of its primary purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some stories OK, but not really Lovecraftian","review":"This collection is an original anthology, in which a bunch of authors write stories specifically for the collection with a central theme in common. As often happens in such collections, the writing quality is uneven, and the \\"common theme\\" elements often seem like they've just been thrown in. This one is actually better than what I've come to expect from original anthologies, though.Writing stories based on H.P. Lovecraft's work is a perilous endeavor because HPL fans can be pretty demanding. If you go to www.dejanews.com and search for miskatonic anthology, you can find some discussion in the alt.horror.cthulhu newsgroup about why people did or didn't like the stories in this collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very in-depth and very intense","review":"Just a warning - don't plan to start this if you don't have some level of fitness to start. There are some minimum requirements for fitness or the program will be incredibly difficult. You also need to have or buy some other equipment including weights or resistance bands and a chin-up bar. That said, it is a very in-depth program that not only includes exercise but dietary plans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"Complete package from workouts to nutrition.

I'm sore most of the time since the workouts are tough, but they're addicting. DVDs came in perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"P90X DVD's only","review":"The product is great. If you want a tough workout this is the product for you. It's not for the beginner. If you follow the steps you will get into shape. It may take a little longer than the 90 days, some people need a little more time but you will see a significant difference. Overall I would recommend P90X; I give it 8 out of 10.P90X Extreme Home Fitness with Tony Horton - Set of 13 DVDs, Calendar, Fitness Guide, Nutrition Guide, & Workout Log"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, but some Trouble with the DVDs","review":"I love P90X. I'm 23 days into my first round, and have found the nutrition guide, the videos, and the community that surrounds P90X very helpful and supportive. If you eat the right foods and push yourself during the workouts, you WILL see results. My body composition has already changed significantly, and I can't wait to see the total yield after completing the program.With that being said, the one flaw I've found with this program is the quality of the DVDs. I have exercised care in handling the discs, but have found that a couple of them have picked up scratches that cause the workout to jump. When this happens, I have to search through the chapters and pick my workout back up as close to the damaged area as possible. This affects my overall flow, and is frustrating.I'd encourage you to try P90X, but be wary of the DVD quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Bod","review":"The P90x is great!!!

We sent them back and haven't gotten anything in return for 3 months! This is UNACCEPTABLE and we should receive a credit for this product. The item was not in usable condition therefore we should be receiving a complete refund of our money! The follow through has been terrible and I will never buy anything from this seller again.

I did the P90X LEAN routine, and \\"lost\\" the fat I was looking too, but stayed the same measurements as my muscles grew. This program really does work, but i didnt get the type of results I was looking for personally. I was hoping for losing inches, shedding fat and pounds, with some muscle toning. However, I felt that my fat literally turned into muscle, rather than melting off..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD","review":"Like others except I was only on day 2 and the cardio DVD is defective. Not only will it not play in any of my DVD players they look scratched. Like others Amazon will only refund and Beachbody won't send just one DVD because they say it wasn't purchased from them. So now I have to wait up to 4 weeks for a refund and wait and repurchase. Beachbody said had I purchased it from them they would have sent a replacement DVD no charge. Here I am looking at it say sold by Beachbody and fulfilled by Amazon. I'll be reordering from the P90X website that way I've got support for the product and it's pretty much the same cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"P90X Fitness Home with Tony Horton","review":"Not happy because add shows dvd's, calender, fitness guide, workout log, and nutrition guide. I only recevied dvd's and no explanation of why. I will not buy from that company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already feeling a little buyer's remorse","review":"After receiving the product and going through it in considerable detail, I realize that it is an awfully complicated program with a lot of up-sell.The books it comes with are cheaply produced with tiny type and terrible design - not to mention difficult to make sense of. The DVDs sound quality is poor.The pull-up bar came missing a nut and two washers.I have used the Body-For-Life system by Bill Phillips and love it. Much more simple, straightforward and easy to understand - and certainly no less effective. And all you need to do is buy a $25 book at any bookstore - or here at Amazon - and Boom! You're done. The BFL program is somewhat more weightlifting oriented, but a set of adjustable dumbells and a bench is all you really need. Same results. The tone is much more inspirational and humble than rambling Tony is. They also have a website that is FAR more easy to navigate AND it's FREE.Not very impressed with P90x."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stated as like new, but missing disc 7","review":"I was initially happy with the service and the package did seem to be in like new condition, when opened, I noticed the discs were each in a baggie which was strange. I also noticed that disc 7 was missing. That would not be like new and I guess that it was just resealed and then listed as like new. For that reason, I am giving this a less than stellar review. I would not have bought it in this condition had I known."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO THANK YOU","review":"I did not enjoy this one bit. I find Tony Horton to be a bit of a creep.

Which is good because pain means it's working, especially when you don't realize you had some of those muscles. The first disc I had to make some changes in the workout because I do not have access to a location to do chinups/pullups so I laid on the floor with 10 lb weights and did butterfly type exercises and switched it up a bit.You are going to see results if you stick with this program, I have seen friends do it and seen the amazing transformations myself..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I love this product, and look forward to starting this goal that I have set, it does look very advanced, which I am not yet, but I certainly look forward to the challenge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"p90x","review":"The p90x is an excellent product.

It was everything that was promised and delivered promptly and professionally. We appreciated the value of what we received compared to what others are charging for the exact same thing.THANKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent way to improve physical fitness","review":"This is definitely not a start-up exercise program, but if you are already in good to moderate physical fitness this program will take you to the next level. As with any workout routine, you need to put in substantial effort and need to focus on each exercise, but if you do and try your hardest (eating right too) you WILL get results.I have not even started using the videos as prescribed by the plan, but instead used them, one week off - one week on, in place of my regular weightlifting routine, for the past month or so (just to add some variety). The results are crazy and I feel a ton better, and I was in pretty good shape to begin with. Since I'm in school I don't have the time to devote 1.5 - 2 hours to exercise every day, but once summer hits...well, I'm really excited to see what happens when I have the time to do the program as recommended. Would recommend this to anyone who is serious about getting in the best shape they can."},{"rating":"2","title":"p90x is EXTREME!","review":"It's not definitely for beginners; I advice you to take the \\"Fit Test\\" before you get into such a challenging workout. On the other hand, if you are able to do 30-50 push-ups, 10-15 pull ups/chin ups, leap at least 5 inches off the ground (then land on your toes!), lift/carry weights for up to 15-25 pounds (each arm), then you should be able to do it!!!You have to put your heart and mind once you get started, but in the end, it has a very promising and rewarding result!"},{"rating":"1","title":"P90X","review":"Bought the set - 13 DVD's, one DVD will not play in my laptop, another one bounces around.

I purchsed the DVD's from amazon and some of them did not work so I responded to amazon who referred me to Beachbody. I contacted beachbody by email and live chat on numerous occassions and did not get any reply to an email except the automated replies. The live chat assured me they would be back to me within 3 business days. It is now over 1 months since I have been trying to resolve and amazon will no longer offer full refund and beachbody do not respond. The links to their contact page on the site are also broken. I have heard similar horror stories from friends who have purchased insanity. A great exercise program that is not backed up by any custmer service, frstrating and very dissappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Had bad knees, tired, felt like crap. After just one week of P90X I was running around with my kids, feeling great. I never hit that 2:30pm wall at work, or felt tired during the day. It has only been three weeks since I started and I am in the best shape I have been in 15 years. Just stick too it and you will feel the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent program with AN ANNOYING INSTRUCTOR","review":"Tony Horton needs to lay off the caffeine and supplements and calm down. I used P90X for about 2 months and decided to go back to the gym. He is extremely annoying and always seems to be trying to 'one up everyone'. His 'muscle confusion' idea is common sense, but the concept is good for those who don't have any fitnes background. The program may be more tolerable with a different instructor who was more practical and not trying to show off and make some stupid joke. To get a real strength workout from this, you also need to invest a couple hundred dollars for a set of dumbbells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful condition","review":"The condition of the P90X discs are horrible. I have asked via email twice for a refund and have received a reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more focus on workouts, less on Tony Horton","review":"The workouts were ok a couple times through them, but Tony Horton is very annoying to me and I get sick of watching him every day. He doesn't inspire me to work hard and he doesn't explain some stuff very well and he's always saying stupid stuff that is ok the first time you hear it but gets old hearing it every week. I tried doing the workouts with the sound off but that doesn't work very well. I wish someone would tell him to shut up and do the workouts. And then the ladies, the uglier they are the more he flirts with them. It always gave me bad mental images."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good workout, bad price","review":"I'm a grad student, and finding time to get to the gym has been getting difficult (read, impossible). I've been thinking about P90x for months, reading reviews, working out at a friends house because she's raved about it since early 2010, and have come \\"this\\" close to buying it numerous times. I just can't get past the price tag! Is it hype? While I've been debating, I've been losing weight, muscle, energy - which is the worst part because I intern at a psych hospital and need to be on alert. Finally, this month, I cancelled my gym membership and decided the next paycheck would go to finally ordering P90 and joining the multitudes. That's when I stumbled upon Bareweight.com, its free workout videos, meals, and advisors. In your face P90x, in your face Sarah (with love), and in your face hype beasts. I'll just put that $100-$150 dollars and put it right back into my pocket (read, Sallie Mae's pocket). Spread the word!Your next, Macbook Pro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid Full Price for a Used Product","review":"I bought this product and the first thing I noticed when I opened it, was that it was used.

Some as high as about $140 and some as cheap as $39. I noticed the $39 set only came with the dvds, not the manuals. This particular website states it comes complete with instructions, calendar etc. NOT SO. I received an email link to print out the information before I received my package so I thought something was up. The package arrived and just as I suspected, only the DVDs were there - missing the other required information. I emailed the seller and it didn't seem to missing at all and was referred to the website to review and print as I deemed necessary. Only after complaining again did I get a printed copy (not the actual book as ordered, but colored copy pages) mailed to me. It does work, but I could have got the same thing for $40 less if I did not want the actual instruction books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Company doesn't support product.","review":"Company sent bad disc.

The reason for only 2 stars is because the dvd's suck. I got the cardiox out and tried to use it for the first time and it was skipping bad. For as much as you pay for the program they should atleast make sure the material last the whole 90 days. so think about your pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the trainer","review":"This is an amazing program they only downfall is it does require a minimum of an hour 6 days a week. You can skip spending money on a trainer just use this and stick to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works as advertised","review":"I was in pretty good shape when I started this, but now I am in great shape. This has great variety so the workouts don't get stale, and in 90 days this did what 2 years at the gym couldn't. I'm not as ripped as some of the pictures, but I also didn't follow the diet plan (though I ate well). If you are looking for a workout to get you motivated and in shape this is it. Well worth the investment.This accommodates nearly all skill levels and has three different programs depending on what you are looking for (gaining muscle, losing fat, or both). With that said this is not an easy workout, it is all about pushing to your limit, but it is entertaining at the same time.The only thing I didn't like is the quality of the case and DVDs. We got this set new and by the end the DVDs were scratched and covered with the glue from the case, so I would watch out for this.The bottom line is I loved it, my wife loved it, and if you are thinking about investing in P90X the answer is YES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting me over my workout hump","review":"I workout most days and I have for many years.

Love that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking to get in shape quick?","review":"Tired of jogging, cardio machines, lack of motivation and no true weight loss plan? Then P90x is for you. Like most, I was skeptical at first but after a 34lb weight loss, I'm a believer. The program will challenge even the most hardcore gym rat and contains alternatives for the brand new beginners.

I suffered an injury that prevented me from beginning this workout for about 8 weeks after receipt of product. The first disk skips and pauses on its own, which was annoying but I thought I could deal with it. I tried to use the second disk today and it does not play at all in my DVD player.

The first disc is the worst because you need different size free weights or bands and a pull up bar! you may as well be at a gym. Instead of supplying the basics for $150 they give you a lame food program of expensive foods you can buy and cant stop mentioning how you need there fitness supplements, what a joke. The disc don't work on my laptop and has problems playing on the Bose system we have. I was gonna buy insanity workout instead but realized that there by the same beach body company that has no quality in there products. So since I have already paid for there crappy made burned DVDs once I'm gonna get someone to burned copies of insanity just to get my moneys worth. This program is not worth the money because you can find lots of people trying to get rid of there P90X mistake online for cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - P90X Logo causes burn in on plasma TV's","review":"I rated this product low because I have burn in on my TV because of this and I've only paused the program for several minutes at a time so I've never left it on a static image for more than 5-10 minutes. The problem is the timer on the workout video is on your screen for the entire workout of an hour. I'm running a anti image retention tool now and it will not remove. This is a brand new Panasonic 60 inch Plasma that was manufactured 9/2011 so it's one of the latest generations of plasma. I aslo did proper burn in on my TV of over 100 hours. The model is a Panasonic VIERA TC-P60GT30 60-Inch 1080p 600 Hz 3D Plasma HDTV. Other than that it's definately a great workout and I noticed results fairly quickly.

I decided to write this review because I got really annoyed at the people who repeatedly claimed that \\"If you are NOT in GREAT shape, you shouldn't do these exercises\\". THESE comments are a bunch of bull and the simply arrogant. The videos constantly remind you to do the best you can and take breaks. You don't have to do EVERYTHING they do or do them the same number of times. I am sure with time you will improve and can keep up. I am overweight but I have the drive to do it. I finish almost all the vidoes and use the pause button (that the DVD itself also recommends) to catch my breath. You just have to DO THE BEST YOU CAN. THAT's the important thing. I'll come back and comment on whether the program truely accomplished my goals but I just had to say something about the \\"no you can't\\" crowd.

It's mostly just a ton of movement and volume. Working out 60-90 minutes a day six days a week is quite a commitment and while I'm sure those who have devoted the time and effort to it have seen great results, you can train your body much more efficiently through a well-designed strength training program that takes 45-60 minutes three times a week. I highly recommend Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength over P90x. You'll build strength, reduce your body fat percentage, you'll be less exhausted and have more free time."},{"rating":"2","title":"P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program","review":"Very good.

I am a chiropractor. 3 of my patients are marines, and they train with this series. I turn 58 years old soon, so I don't usually do an entire workout. If you do the warm up and then 3o minutes of any of these workouts, it will be plenty for most people.

In six weeks of P90X I feel much stronger and have improved dramatically. I stongly recommend it IF you're ready.

I started the weekly workout routine and found myself loving P90X. During one of my workouts, the DVD stopped midway - it was pretty badly scratched and cannot be fixed. All I did was remove it from the case and put it in the player. This also happened earlier during a workout with a different DVD, but a good cleaning fixed it. It's apparent I recieved a USED product. The success of P90X is following the DVD's in sequence.

The one thing I regret is not seeing myself through to the end of it during my first run. Ninety days is a long time, and there WILL be times when you want to give up. Unfortunately, I allowed myself to, after five weeks. Yet, even after only five weeks, I have never felt so healthy and strong as I did when I was doing the program.

I had stayed active thru my pregnancy, working out several times a week. I tried this program to get back to pre-pregnancy shape & within 4 days had hurt my shoulder. (it does say at the beginning of the program if you have any shoulder issues NOT to use this) It is very heavy into the upper body work with the push-ups, pull-ups, etc. I can no longer do the workouts and am stuck with this expensive program now.

I'm only into week 6 of this and I've already lost 15 lbs (I started at 200 - @ 5'10\\") and the muscles are starting to show. Best part of the workouts is the enthusiasm of Tony Horton. He keeps pushing you, and that really helps to keep you motivated. Already I can do 5 chin ups, I never could do one before.

My son did the DVDs about 4 or 5 times a week and ran at the gym for 40 minutes everyday during the summer, and he lost 20 lbs and looked really good by the time he went back to school last week.

With a name like P90X, I expected a taut, futuristic, military techno-thriller; instead, it centered around a guy in a room encouraging people to dance like him -- not very interesting.Furthermore, the setting never changed: if you're going to confine the action to one set, next time consider doing it as a *play* instead of a TV mini series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Amazon P90X","review":"I am disappointed.

I did not purchase directly through them (Beach Body) but through Amazon. Beach Body will not replace any purchase through Amazon. Amazon will only replace the entire set for $ exchange. This creates a situation where you must ship back to get your money back and reorder. What if the defective disk is a common problem? Amazon will never be able to resolve only give money back.

I'm getting stronger too. The first week I could only do half of the individual workouts before I was completely exhauseted, now I'm finishing the workouts (still exhausted, but the stamina is better). For pushups and pullups my muscles are incredibly sore. I can't wait to see my results at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"P90x DVD's","review":"great love itIts hard don't get me wrong, but you feel great after such an exhausting workout.I never was the workout tape guy, but this is different. I havent hit the gym in 4 years and make this my year of change. Tony is great and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great workout","review":"I love the workout but had some issues with the package. It turns out I received booklets which were printed by a substandard printing company which P90X dropped and liquidated the merchandise which my seller bought. After explaining the problem of terribly misspelled words and grammar errors, the seller sent me new booklets which were great;however some of the DVD's were scratched when I opened them and freeze during play. Probably should have bought directly from the company; however I haven't contacted the seller about this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Authentic Copy?","review":"I question authenticity of the copy I received. The guide book is full of typos. I suspect it was transcribed by an non-english speaking person."},{"rating":"2","title":"stick with it!","review":"I have done several martial arts and weight lifting and basketball...thought i was in shape....nope. I was so sore for the first two weeks of this workout. After that it's just fun, if you like being tired and sore and know for a fact you are getting the very best workout possible! The diet is probably the hardest part. Stick with it if your just starting and good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"P90X ROCKS","review":"I've been using P90X for 3 weeks and already can see a difference. P90X will kick your butt, but it is fun and anyone can do it. Do what you can, always try your best and you will see improvement. The video's are great and keep you motivated."},{"rating":"1","title":"problem with some of the DVDs","review":"We enjoy the workouts when the DVDs work. There are a few of the DVDs (e.g. Core Synergistics & Chest Shoulder and Triceps) that seem to refuse to be played. We have tried PCs/laptops as well as stand alone players.From what has been read from some reviews and on other sites the DVDs sold on Amazon are of inferior quality to those sold directly through BeachBody. It makes one believe that BeachBody is willing to forgo quality in the hopes that you will purchase the set again at additional cost from them directly.Or the other possibility is that the Amazon DVDs are pirated versions. Be careful purchasing these."},{"rating":"1","title":"I you want to follow it be prepared to spend 1K or more...","review":"It is a good program, just the way it's advertised is very missleading. It's not for beginners, it assumes the level of endurance and strength. I consider it a rip off if I have to buy entire gym, additional diet books and special supplements. So if you want to follow it, be prepared to spend some cash..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE \\"USED\\" or \\"CHEAP\\" COPIES","review":"I am not writing about the actual P90X program or anything like that. There are illegal/bootleg copies of P90X floating around out there. The DVDs skip, the case is misprinted, and the Nutrition and Fitness guides are full of factual, spelling and grammatical errors.I suggest just buying a new copy from Amazon, or buying from the actual site (the price is the same).Do not make the same mistake I did, and don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the quality of the dvd's","review":"The P90X system is great.

I would recommend this program to any one, any age and at any weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"This program is worth the buy. I didn't think it was working at first buy I really feel it now. You will need to buy weights, bands, yoga blocks, and a pull-up bar if you really want to feel the burn. I received everything it said I would. One of the CDs skips but not sure if thats my fault or the manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"P90X Fitness DVD program","review":"Exceptionally pleased. The DVDs are excellent for someone in decent condition. Instruction is simple and to the point. Takes a couple times to follow the different exercises. The Yoga was a very challenging balance and stretching routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"P90x was all that I hoped it was and more. I started seeing results after the second week of the workout. It's part of my everyday routine and makes a stressful day much better. I love this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Workout Program","review":"I bought this program way back in 2004 when it first surfaced. If you want to get in shape this is NOT the program for you. If you are IN shape and want to take it to the next level, then you must purchase this program."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great exercise routine, if you can hack it","review":"Beware, this is not for the out of shape. If you are obese or havent been active in a long time you're in for a RUDE awakening. These workouts are rough, even when I was in decent shape. I couldnt even imagine using these DVD's before when I was 240lbs. I'd probably puke or pass out about 5min in.That being said, if you're willing to make it work by going lighter, or working your way up to the level expected you can make it work for you.Just remember exercise alone won't do it, you'll need to fix what you're eating if you're over or under indulging. This is definitely recommended within the system, but you must make it work as a whole.Although fancy programs like this arent necessary if you can build your own program, I have given this to people I know who may benefit but don't have the ability to build their own plan (and I don't have the time to do so for them). I found this to be motivating for them, and a good all-in-one to get them to the next level."},{"rating":"2","title":"P90X","review":"The set was in great condition. No problems with the DVDS or other items. Perfect condition as promised. Good service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of potential but don't stand behind faulty dvds","review":"This could be a great program IF they would stand behind their DVD's.The DVD's are cheap quality and they charge something like $40 to replace a defective one. If I get a defective DVD, and am willing to return it, they shoudl replace it for free. As someone else said the copy protection is really lousy. I like to travel with my IPAD and I can't burn the DVD's to my IPAD to use when travelling or use on my laptop. It means carrying my portable DVD player if I want to use them when on the road.This program has a lot of potential if the DVD's worked or they would replace them. I just can't give anything higher than 1 star to a company that doesn't replace a defective product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring It","review":"In my first recovery week.

However, I was disappointed with the instructions, which came in the form of bootleg .pdf files on an unlabeled CD. Maybe this is attributed to the seller, who took FOREVER to send the product, but at least I received it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth all the Hype","review":"I'm just starting the 2nd phase of this program and so far it has more than lived up to the hype. This isn't for sissies and the key is consistency - so if you start something only to lose interest, this isn't for you. I'm thrilled with the workouts and the changes I'm seeing in my physique. I don't really follow the nutrition plan as I already had a good diet, but I can see where it could be helpful to those who need more guidance. All in all, I'm a happy participant and can't wait to see how things continue to develop over the next 60 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"The workouts are great. They really challange you. And Tony isn't over the top obnoxious like most workout hosts. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the dvds aren't the best quality. I've never had a problem playing them in my xbox360 or any new dvd player, but sometimes it takes a few tries for older dvd players to read the discs. It gets kind of annoying because I have an older dvd player downstairs where I work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"P90X is not for the weak:","review":"For those of you that don't have time to go to the local health club after work but are serious about exercise; P90X could be just what you want. This home exercise series will challenge all but the most elite of athletes. Even they would find the program challenging if just a few modifications are made.If you are a self-motivated exercise person capable of challenging yourself at home, I would recommend P90X. I thought I was in decent shape before P90X but I was sadly mistaken. I have a long way to go to get where I want to be but p90X can take me there. The exercise options are almost limitless with a little bit of ingenuity. You can always make the program work for you by simply modifying the exercises to make them more challenging as you progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful - Damaged DVD's","review":"The package that holds the DVD discs is not suitable for storing the optical media. It is made out of papers and causes scratches on the discs, and the discs will become unreadable after some use.I purchased mine from Beachbody fulfilled by Amazon.com. Out of 13 DVD's that I received, one disc was failing from the beginning. Another disc soon became the same after using a couple of times in and out of the designated DVD holder.If you are going to purchase this product, first thing you will need to do is to check all DVD's are readable. And next thing you need to do is getting a safe CD binder and storing the DVD's there.Please take a look at other 1-star or 2-star reviews, and see what their complaints are about - Damaged DVD's!!!The workout itself looks great, but it requires extra equipments such as pull-up bar and workout bands. If you have them already it's great. Otherwise, you will need to spend just little more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme workout, great results!","review":"Great workout, but definetely for persons with stamina, and previous training. I have good physical condition, but had around 4 months without training, the first week was definetely hell. But great workout it's fun and the 45-60 min goes fast. I recommend this product very much, it has online forums for support, a detailed nutrition guide with vegetarian options (i loved that, cause i am veg). Great buy for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"P90X","review":"I had the old Power 90 dvds and got good results! Decided to try the P90X and it is awesome! Intense workouts and everything can be done at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, no-nonsense product","review":"This is not one of those infomercial \\"put-forth-no-effort-and-get-amazing-results\\" fitness gimmicks. This is no-nonsense, hard-core training that gets results if you force yourself to stick with it. The value of the product is in how it arranges the right variability (muscle-confusion) and timing adjustments on basic, meat-and-potatoes exercises. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"PX90","review":"Product is all that it claims to be. If you are generally in shape, the workouts are good and not too difficult.

The P90x Yoga is 1 1/2 hours long. Take small breaks and it's 2 hours long. I did so many up-dogs that I lost count and hurt my back in the process. I was out of work for 3 days. I never touched p90x after that. Find a program that is shorter and easier on the spine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in that good of condition","review":"The first one we ordered wouldn't play on the computer and the sound went in and out on the tv.

I will not order from the same person again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy from this seller","review":"This seller should be removed from your listings. I never received my merchandise nor could I get a response from my e-mails. I am now out nearly 60.00 with nothing to show for it. There have been many poor reviews that have shown up since my purchace. Unfortunately, they were not all there when I purchased (or thought I purchased, really just threw money away.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating lack of technical instruction","review":"As someone who lacks coordination (I can't dance and am not good at sports), I found the lack of technical instruction in the videos to be quite frustrating.Prior to starting P90x, I exercised by running and lifting free weights (about 30 to 40 minutes a day). Each day of P90x is around an hour (some days are more) and I found myself having to constantly pause the DVD and rewind to try to understand how to do the moves.If you're coordinated and catch on quickly, I don't think it will be problem for you. However, for those of us that are clumsy and have difficulty coordinating movement, P90x may be quite frustrating.I ended up returning the set. I'm sure the workouts are great, but it was just taking too long to figure out how to do the movements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very mad","review":"I ordered this product in feb..emailed them 3 days after I got it about the defective product thatI received and now its the end of april and I have yet to see them carry out there end nor have I gotten aRefund......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the complete set as advertised.","review":"There was no calender, fitness guide, nutrition guide, or workout log as advertised. All videos included though."},{"rating":"1","title":"P90X Great, but not here!","review":"The product arrived very quickly. At the time of ordering, I cannot say that I paid attention to whether or not it was supposed to come with the books and nutrition guide. I figured P90X was P90X and it would come with what it was known to be. The nutrition guideline and workout guidelines are a very important part of the program.Not only did the product arrive with ZERO literature, it arrived with inferior recorded DVDs. Half, if not most of the DVDs have some glitch in them, making them a pain to watch. Some have the screen go blank for several seconds, others have the image digitize and tweak for periods of time. The final DVD (ad ripper X) is almost unwatchable from beginning to end. It is constantly tweaking and going blank.I would recommend P90X. I WOULD NOT recommend buying it from this vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time consuming","review":"Anyone, who dedicate almost 2 (TWO HOURS!!) hrs a day to workout for 90 straight days, will be ripped, P90X or not. That is logical. This program is nothing special, it is good but not magical.I didn't need to lose weight, I bought this because I wanted to be more toned. As comparison, I had better result doing 30 Day Shred (25 min a day) for the whole month, than doing lengthy P90X Lean for the whole month. Unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Muscle building program","review":"These workouts are slow paced and take an average of an hour to complete, but you will definitely build strong lean muscles....if you have the time to do the program right"},{"rating":"2","title":"P90X","review":"I think this is a great program. I am a single mom who does not have time to go to the gym before or after work. So I am able to work out right in my own home with some flexibility.

I'm no athlete but this set gets me up and moving. My first goal was to just finish each set at the minimum level. I did ok with that. Now I'm expanding ever so slowly. It'll be a lot more than 90 days to a beach body but at least I'm exercising and this set of DVD's gives me enough of a range with each exercise to continue to grow my goals for years. It's a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Fitness DVD's","review":"I can't imagine anyone not getting results from this program unless you just don't push \\"play\\". There are a variety of DVD's so you never get bored. If you put any amount of effort into it, you are sweating up a storm in no time. I have bought many workout videos and these are the best so far. Easy to follow, basic to extreme moves, and it is over before you know it. Not for beginners, best for someone in good shape trying to loose 10-15 pounds and push yourself to the next level. I did not get the manual but was able to get the information I needed off the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"When you read these reveiws your like Jesus an hour to an hour-and-one-half that is crazy but the dvds are broken down into little sections. You do like 2 minutes of push-ups then 2 of pull-ups. I think it works you hard enough to get good results but not tax your body so hard you quit. You may have a long work-out but when its not doing push-up 20 minutes straight then 20 minutes of something else it makes it doable. Also, that legnth of work-out includes the warm-up usually around 10 minutes. Buy this and do this you will thank yourself after just a few weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"P90X","review":"The product is quite awesome. It really can do what it says it can do, it all depends on you and your level of commitment. If you stick to the simple diet included and work out every day, you get results, drastic results.

They waste alot of time, warminng up almost 15 ~ 20 min? each workout can be designed to 35 min easy. Too many breaks between workouts, I really dont' have time for all these.2. They are not doing anything special. All the routine are something you are familar with if you have done several type of workout routines to DVD or Exercise TV. \\"Muscle confusion?\\" My muscle has NOT been confused at all.3. The intensity of workout is not challeging enough unelss you add much more weight to your dumbells than you are used to, then again, with the added weight, any workout can be challening.Overall, it is pretty dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with it","review":"I brought it from a dealer on amazon and I did'nt get the nutrition guide or exercise planner.

I am currently doing the classic version and I find it challenging. The exercises are intense and you do need to keep track of your reps. Ab ripper is extreme and you do feel it within a few minutes of the workout. My favorite is workout is legs. It gets your blood pumping and you you actually do feel the soreness all over your muscle. This is a flexible workout that can be done at home and at anytime throughout the day. I do not follow the nutrition portion of the workout but I do what I can to eat healthy such as: portion control, include fruits and vegetables in my diet, stay away from chips, ice cream and fast food!

Highly recommend it, make the time and stay with the workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense, but effective","review":"P90X is certainly no joke, but it gets the job done. All of the workouts are challenging, although I would say Plyometrics is by far the hardest and most grueling. I started off pretty fit and trim, but I'm 1 and a half months into it now, and I definitely have seen changes, especially in my arms and legs. I have noted vast improvement in my ability to perform, especially on the yoga and ab sections.The workouts are all pretty good, although I find the yoga disc is simply too long (although I do enjoy most of it) and the ab disc is annoying because they seem to put all the movements that really work your quads back to back, such that it's hard to keep up simply because your legs are tired (abs are fine). Overall I'm very happy with the workouts and I've seen good results. It's definitely a big time commitment, but I feel much better on a day to day basis and I look forward to seeing the final results in 3 months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This works!","review":"If you commit to the program, you will see dramatic results in just 3 months.

Several of my coworkers had similar experiences where they had shoulder injuries that caused them to stop. It is problematic to do weight training alone with only a video. It is easy to have poor form that makes you prone to injury.Also the recipe book that comes with the program is next to useless. Even if you are super commited, it is very difficult to follow. Many of the recipes are very involved. For instance, there is a whole section on making your own sauces.I'm not a big foodie, and I don't particularly like cooking. I would have been willing to follow simple recipes, but the book didn't fit my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets you in great shape!","review":"I never thought I'd like P90X.

Everything was in the package and in great condition. I'm a happy customer :)A review on the product: p90x is really challenging and definately will take you out of your comfort zone to help you grow and become more strong and lean. Honestly, though, trying to break a sweat in your living room is really hard and not as Motivating as if the setting was in a gym. Also, not having some one to train with made me feel less driven.

Basically no graphic nudity here but some very good, realistic sex scenes and one with a brief portion of REALLY sizzling dialogue (Amazon probably won't let me get explicit so I won't give it away). Lots and lots of full-frontal (and full-rear) female nudity. Good stuff, although none of the women in this are particularly hot with the exception of the nurse who is on the cover.The storyline is fairly typical of these kinds of films and the settings are limited to the insides of two different houses, and a pool.

Perhaps Roth has written better novels, but just now I don't feel like trying to read another one. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Literary Stain","review":"I don't know what Roth was trying to get at in this long and pointless novel, but it's obvious that whatever it was, he missed it by a country mile.

Book that aspires for greatness, but is so disconnected it fails and takes the reader with it. The stories are put together slapdash, like the writings of an adolescent or perhaps a schizophrenic. This seems more like a compilation of notes than a story. Further, the subject matter is tedious. Who is interested, other than another academic, about the fall from grace of an academic elite?

The breathless ranting that substitutes for exposition accomplishes nothing new stylistically; in fact, the entire novel feels unedited and its jump-cut points of view unexamined. In other words, as Gertrude Stein said, there is no there there.Wish folks had the independence to lionize far better and less well-known writers instead: Patricia Henley, Will Self, Jim Crace, for starters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read This Book","review":"Written in the year 2000, this is a book about people at the latest turn of the century examined in the context of the political situation in America during their lifetimes. Focusing on character detail and development, Roth successfully paints portraits of complex beings, seemingly related to one another by the one trait that they cannot escape: they are all human.The examination of Coleman Silk's life: his beginnings and end, his triumph, his tragedy, his relationships, and most importantly, his secret enables the reader to relate to the protagonist. Silk's humanity (his faults, tendencies, patterns of behavior, etc.) contains the indelible aspects of what many will recognize to be similar to those within ourselves and the people around us. This book will draw you into its plot and individual character examinations and will leave you with a more complete and accurate understanding of the \\"core\\" that is present within many human beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"More schtick from Roth","review":"Philip Roth is the Woody Allen of American literature. He's found his public's hot buttons & pushes them incessantly with tiresome adolescent obsessiveness:...men recounting their erections, lusty bad-mouthed (usually angry) women, topical commentary (Clinton & Lewinsky here) & off-the-press contextuality (campus & race politics in this case). His characters seem totally manufactured to meet the ends of the book & his style is a thick brocade of almost total impenetrability. On the other hand, this is America & if your product sells, hey, you're a success!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roth's not so bad, when he's not talking about sex","review":"The same way that The Scarlet Letter and The Crucible help us understand witch-hunts, The Human Stain is Philip Roth's way of making sense of the absurdity of the Clinton impeachment. So that no one misses the point, he sets the novel in 1998. His story is one of a distinguished, soon-to-retire college professor who is unjustly accused of racism. A novel like this reminds us that the motivations and the life histories of the accused and the accusers are always more complicated than we want to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creaky plot","review":"A Human Stain is about racially sensitivity taken to absurds never seen in real life mixed up with a book about passing as white, spiced up with geriatric sex, Viagra, Monica Lewinsky, a crazy Vietnam vet, and two dead kids, mixed thoroughly with a heavy theme of the sacrifices caused by living a lie/trying to escape your past (not really the same thing, but maybe if you take a screwy look). I think Roth took every idea he had and threw them up against the wall, and lord amercy they all stuck. Good thing he writes a lot. We can go read his good stuff and try to forget this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters to remember","review":"The two main characters are people you'll remember. Fiction rarely manages to present people who are as real as these characters are, but still interesting, flawed of course, but that much more memorable because of it. Plot is weaved into characterization very well, and the settings work too. This is a rich novel that makes you think and sticks with you afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written","review":"I get lost sometimes in writing that is so artistic and powerful you feel swept up in an author's grasp. You feel like he can lead you anywhere. Roth is one of those writers who may not be the best story teller, but can he paint a word picture? Can you just get lost in his prose? Can he make you stare at a sentence for a minute or two after you read it, making you think somehow he's changed your life with one good swift kick in the groin? Yes to all of the above. I recommend this book if you like a great writer. If you love the power and energy in a well written paragraph even if it tries to do too much and even if it's point isn't really a point but it leaves you thinking none the less. It's a tragic look at a desperate life. But in the end, I found myself uplifted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the great American novel...","review":"I thought that the premise of the book was fascinating but I could not help feeling that Roth wrote this novel with the goal of writing THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL. Well, sadly, it falls short. The characters are unlikeable and with the exception of Coleman Silk, not well defined. There are two characters who are introduced right at the end of the book and it's not clear to me why they appear in the story at all. Many of the characters are too lightly drawn. All that said, the book did have some positive qualities. Roth's description of how Coleman's secret evolved was masterful and very credible. I would have enjoyed the book much more had Roth focused his energies there. I found the Faunia/Les Farley story much less interesting or engaging. After all of the glowing reviews I had read, I was disappointed in The Human Stain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reader","review":"I have to say this book plodded and plodded repetatively along. I was never able to identify with the characters and sincerely did not like this book. I'm sure to some, who could identify with the characters it was great - but I found it boring to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ingredients, bad result","review":"Sounds like a great mix, based on a novel by Philip Roth. Mixed race ex-boxer prof (Hopkins) marries out into white community. Pretends he is Jewish. In later life meets screwed up younger white woman (Kidman) with whom he vainly tries to expunge his past. It takes more than eggs to make an omelette, however, and Robert Benton's dreary direction ruins any prospect of a good film. Worst part, Nathan Zuckerman - what on earth was the point of this character - (Gary Sinise). The scene in which Hopkins and Sinise try to dance the slow foxtrot together is one of the daftest and most pointless I have seen in any movie. Best character Ed Harris (Lester Farley) though badly underwritten - why had his relationship with Kidman broken down ? Because he was nuts or she had driven him nuts. She would have me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book for me!","review":"Some people may like this book, but I couldn't get into it.The reviews were great, but I didn't get past the first 50 pages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A beater defends a cheater.","review":"After the second reference to the Clint-on s-e-x scandal, I put the book down.

Now I can be a rapper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it down after the first couple pages of whining","review":"I bought this book b/c it made the NYT Book Review list of top novels, but the author began the novel whining - that's the only way to describe it, whining - that slick willie was treated oh so unfairly by we churchgoing middle-America do-gooders (I am a Southern moderate atheist who despises the Clintons for what they are - common trash) But it isn't the politics, per se, that that turned me away from the novel, I just find it hard to believe that such temporal political commentary can be a prelude to a work of any depth, or even a mark of a serious novelist, for that matter. And so I don't want to waste my time with it. If he wants to sermonize he should get the NYT or someone else to publish a column and not insult me by injecting his whining into what can only dubiously be termed 'a novel'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Human Stain by Philip Roth","review":"This intense but difficult to read book is very pertinent to todays issues .We as a culture assume good behavior and distain any thing other than that but most people have dark sides This is a story about a man who crossed the color line so well that no one guessed except perhaps a young superior who in her attraction was at the same time out to destroy him and showed her own dark side.

An excellent \\"read\\" for a thoughtful person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lily White Eloquence","review":"The guy who used to write masturbation stories of jew boys grows up.This is a wonderful book about America, about the internal politics of the society and its workings and ultimately about the effects of the human spirit in twenty first century on the world it inhabits. The human stain is the ultimate corruptibility we bring to everything we touch, the reverse-midas of mankind.A brilliant book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner from Roth","review":"I was sad at the news that Roth retired alter-ego Nathan Zuckerman last year. This is one of my favorite Zuckerman novels because he doesn't just narrate he is also somewhat involved. I still have a couple left to read, so maybe it isn't always that way, but Nathan Zuckerman is someone I would like to be friends with. Coleman Silk gets to be friends with him and we get to eavesdrop into their friendship through this story. I don't need to recap the plot here as it is a disservice to readers to know everything before they just read the book for themselves. This book is a very satisfying read and like it says on the cover...\\"In American fiction there is Roth and then there is everyone else.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A minor achievement","review":"Nowhere near as good as Roth can be. Although it contains flashes of great writing the overall experience is pretty tedious. In addition to the Vietnam war vet cliche discussed in other reviews the attempt to intergrate the Monica Lewinsky scandal into the fabric of the narrative calls to mind Joe Eszterhaus' horrible \\"American Rhapsody.\\" The story itself is very disorganized and given the basic premise -- a light skinned black man passing for white accused of making racially loaded comments -- there is a surprising lack of irony. Needed to be revised, but when you're Philip Roth what editor is going to have the guts to send you back to the drawing board?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written book","review":"Interesting characters and a nicely woven plot. A little slow at times, but overall a nice read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disapointment","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, based on the polt description and word of mouth about the author. I couldn't even finish it! After the first 30 pages, I grew tired of plodding through dialog that no real person would ever utter, spoken by characters with whom I wouldn't want to spend five minutes! At times it seemed like the book was just a vehicle for the author to spew his extreme political views, and I did not appreciate the lecturing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserably Dull","review":"I found the rambling writing style of the book so hard to follow that I was well over half-way through the book before I had any concept of the plot of the book. It tried to be titillating but wasn't. It tried to be suspenseful but largely wasn't. It tried to investigate the sometimes tortured inner thoughts of other people's thoughts, and partially delivered.What exactly was the reader expected to learn from this book? It was a massive disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Loved early Roth (Goodbye Columbus etc.) but he has been going straight downhill for several years. This misshapen thing is terrible -- not least because of the cardboard cutout cliche Vietnam veteran character. A beginning writer would cringe at stooping so low; from one of America's previously better novelists it is appalling. Not many groups left to pick on and be PC -- Nam vets and rednecks are the only two that come to mind -- but this think is fatally flawed and ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"eternal conflicts presented as poor literature","review":"I keep hoping that Roth would write a better novel. His characters are potentially interesting people and his themes are universal. We don't get a developed picture of the protaginist Coleman, a retired university professor, with an interesting past and many conflicts. He is typically a Roth Characer whose ego has problems dealing with his libido and conscience. He is always angry not able to find any internal integration. This is also true of the other characters who are very two dinensional and always predictible. They incluse his lover, his lawyer, his frustrated female detractor and others. I'm sorry about this as I can remember laughing with Portnoy many years ago. For me Roth is prolific, tells complicated stories but is a middle of the road author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating account of Passing","review":"The Human Stain is a fascinating account of the psychological and emotional dangers in \\"Passing.\\" My book group chose this and another very different book because both deal with this profoundly interesting theme. Seducitve Poison, a memoir of a Jonestown survivor whose mother's passing as white and not a German Jew (and keeping it a secret from her children) pushed both mother and daughter into another deceitful world. Although seemingly at odds both reveal the perils in persuing such a scam and all its tragic ramifications. Both are riveting and well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone seen Phil?","review":"I've spent more than a few whole days blissfully detained by Roth novels, but his last few offerings, especially this one, have left me slightly embarrassed for him. What happened to the guy who once so masterfully coiled the absurd in electric prose? Gone. Reading contemporary Roth is like watching Brian Boitano skate professionally. He just kind of glides around his story, making a show of grace without doing anthing interesting at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to read...","review":"To my understanding this book is a key story to dig into the existential issue of shame and its consequences.

I found the tone condescending to women and the almost stream-of-consciousness writing style not conducive to making his points. I would have liked it better if the author cut out about 100 pages.

In his last three books he covered evey politcal touchstone of importance from the Red Scare to the radical scare to the Black Scare. To understand our world you must read Roth's world and there is none better than The Human Stain."},{"rating":"1","title":"For indie lovers only","review":"This movie is fine for indie lovers.

The ending was so horrible that it ruined what I felt for the entire movie.I hate movies that spring a bad ending for shock value. I felt cheated because here I was going through Daly's journey with him, soaking up this fascinating love affair he's having with Nicole only to be pimp slapped at the end.The ending was horrible, stupid, made no sense and the writers fell short if they were trying to impress.Skip it because it builds you up, makes you root for Daly and Nicole only to be shot in the heart.

For example the original word in the KJV was \\"black\\" in Solomon 1-5, they changed it to \\"dark\\" and state that it means suntanned. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE WORD TO DISCRIBE A BLACK PERSON CAN BE SUNTAN INSTEAD OF BLACK? King James used the best word there and it was Black. Likewise in the book of the Songs of Solomon 5:11 the Bible states that \\"Solomon was bushy headed\\", but this book changes the word \\"bushy\\", to wavy.

My 12 year old son was hooked, he read the book, then I finished it. It was amazing to have that 'secret book conversation' with my son. I/we both loved the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I first saw this book and thought, okay, well, it's about some little Canadian hockey players in the eighties, that's weird. But having never played hockey nor lived in Canada or the eighties, I thought, well, I'll give it a try. And I loved it. Stephen Galloway's first novel is a remarkable story of two boys growing up together with a common love. The characters were wonderfully quirky. I've read this book about 3 or 4 times and I cry every time. It would make a beautiful movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Becoming a WebSphere Administrator is a daunting task. The product is complex and IBM documentation is often abstract, theoretical, and incomplete. I struggled for a couple of months until I got this book.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of screenshots, but very little in the way of explanation. I need a book that addesses the tasks I most need to do as a WebSphere Admin, with explanations as to why and how to do them. I have found that IBM's online Infocenter for WebSphere is the best resource for this. Bottom line: As a WAS admin you should have this book, but Infocenter may be more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"Reading this biography, I can understand why this is a classic in its field. It reads like water. It's effortless. It's a look into, of course, the life and times of another person, but also a look at another time and world. For not being a \\"thriller\\", I think it's a real page turner. I have read some of Strachey's books which are beautifully crafted and very evocative and this biography is a real tribute to that writer. The preface is also quite interesting as the author tells us about the history of his writing the book. While it is a long book it doesn't feel long in the reading. For anyone interested in the Bloomsbury group this is a not to be missed read. Just terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrical Inspection Notes","review":"McGraw Hill has really dropped the ball on this one.

The biggest problem is that it's not really a widescreen transfer. It's not even letterboxed. Unless you consider the eighteenth of an inch at the top and bottom of the picture a widescreen/letterboxed edition. The poor transfer really makes some of the decent fight scenes difficult to watch.

It's not Donnie's best, but it's not his worse either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Poor subtitling and odd camera work made this movie much less enjoyable that I had anticipated.

This movie is comical in it's story and by the end we were making fun of the movie rather than engaged. There was only 1 fight scenes that was exciting to watch.The Once Upon a time In china series, Iron Monkey, Fung Sai Yuck, Croaching Tiger, Tai chi master, Swords Men, Bride w/white hair, Jackie chan series, chow yun fat..etc... are the classics...this movie does not belong w/these greats."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never by any martial arts movie filmed in the 80's again.","review":"I will never buy any martial arts movie shot in the 80's again.

It is much more useful in a school setting than the Adolescent Treatment Planner as it is organized by presenting problem rather than DSM diagnosis (e.g. attention-seeking behavior, self-esteem building, sexual responsibility). However,DSM diagnostic suggestions are also included for each presenting problem. Treatment goals and interventions are clearly outlined and practical. Yes, some interventions are obvious, but there are dozens of additional interventions as well. In a school setting where time is limited, this book helps me quickly outline my treatment plan and stay focused so that I am working in a more efficient manner. This book has saved me a lot of time and helped me conceptualize school-based therapy in a more practical way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for school social workers!","review":"I use this workbook with kids in my practice because number one referral source for kids in therapy is the school! Therefore, I use this often to help out with interventions to stop or reduce problematic behaviors at school (angry out bursts, truancy, not following rules, etc). More importantly, because school social workers are often busy with IEPs, case management, etc., kids are usually getting minimal therapy there.

With about 5 pages of full color stills from his films, as well as a chapter on each of his major films, this is the perfect way to get an impression of his entire body of work. Particularly good for the new fan who just stumbled upon \\"Princess Mononoke\\" or \\"Spirited Away\\" and wants an idea of what else this genious has done.I am, however in agreement with these other reviewers about the content. This isn't for the hardcore fan who wants every detail about the \\"master at work\\" so to speak. It isn't a book about Miyazaki so much as a book about his films.

The cockpit won't snap shut with the rest of the plane, it just opens again.

My 7 year old daughter loves Polly Pocket. The clothes are rubbery so it's easier to change her clothes, though sometimes the shoulder straps break from the tugging. But since they are rubbery, the clothes still stay on the dolls. The plane is just one more great idea by Polly's makers. It's a good size for the dolls to actually sit in, unlike some other popular brand of dolls. Polly Pocket is a perfect gift for any young girl. She is inexpensive, comes tastefully dressed, has a variety of accessories and numerous friends to add to the collection. Plus, because of Polly's small size, she's great for your child to play with on trips. Polly, friends and accessories fit nicely into a child's backpack and there's even room for snacks! ;) I highly recommend starting any child on the Polly Pocket collection and the plane is a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was mattel thinkig???","review":"my mom got me this toy and i do NOT care for it. polly is really cute and i like her hair and dress but ..... first of all the seats fall off and sometimes the bed on top comes undone. also the door allways falls off and when you put polly's in the seats you cant get the seatbelts on but when you finally get them on the polly's slip out!! talk about frustrating!!!! the island is really cute but someties it falls out. the only things that won't break is the polly and her dog but when i put on her dress it broke!! i really don't think you should buy this.p.s i collect polly pockets [i have a huge box of them!!!]and this is not 1 of my favorites.

I'm sure this assists in keeping the heat in, but when I run with it, it does make breathing more difficult than without. I'm not saying you can't run, far from it, its just a slight annoyance.

This product just doesn't work well in the conditions you want to use it in. The hood has a very short neck so if you you pull it up over your nose you need another neck warmer to cover your neck. Most troublesome, the weave is very tight so it's hard to breath through and warm air is forced up along the sides of your nose and fogs up your glasses up.

I originally bought some other balaclava but wasn't satisfied with the material (felt really light and wouldn't do anything against the wind/chill). This UA Hood feels comfortable and fits snugly against your head.Due to the modular design (gaiter, full face, half, or relaxed), you're able to adjust the hole where your eyes/nose would stick out from - if that makes any sense. The only reason it's getting 4 stars is because of the fact that I was hoping the neck portion would be longer to ensure a good tuck underneath your jacket, etc. For two days riding in the cold with a full face helmet, it does its job well. Haven't tried with a half helmet but I'm sure you'll feel the chill slightly more in that case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work right!","review":"I tried contacting the seller to return and was told that the film is probably in wrong. 3 of us have looked at it and looked at it.

It's flavor is really indistinguishable from regular Chai tea blends, but it still gives you the extra smooth caffeine boost that yerba mate offers.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adore This!","review":"Discovered the amazing calming power of mate thru my work with immigrants. Mate culture is kind of like chai culture in South Asia, hookah culture in Arab areas, or British tea culture: a social lubricant that is taken in social settings; By contrast, coffee drinking in the U.S. is less of a social act, and more a compulsion.My hubby found this Pixie Mate Mate Chai at the local market. Unlike Guayaki's Chai Mate, Pixie Mate contains both black tea and yerba mate, plus the chai spices.

As other reviewers have stated, this is a real tearjerker for it reveals the trials and tribulations of a single parent trying to cope in a society that is filled with bureaucracy red tape that ultimately works against her.Grace Johnston is also a triumph as Winningham's young daughter, Hillary. It is hard to imagine that she is an actress playing a part; so realistic is her portrayal. Dorian Harewood makes a small but pivotal appearance as the social worker assigned Winningham's case.The film ends on a less-than-cheerful note that only reinforces the desperation of Winningham's situation.A truly powerful film is \\"God Bless the Child.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie!","review":"I watched this movie as a young teen and really liked the story behind it.

There is not much help or organized content for companion gardening in this book. Whatever useful info there is it is randomly scattered through the book. For example, if you like to know what goes well with tomatoes you have to go to six different pages from the index and hope to glean something.There is a whole lot of content about the history and use of some vegetables and herbs. Though might interesting info it is not why I bought this book.In short, the book is nor organized well and any material content is thin. I've also purchased \\"The Vegetable Gardener's Bible (10th Anniversary Edition)\\" and found that to be a tremendous help for companion planting because there is rich content that is organized and easy to find. So my recommendation is for you to skip this and buy the Vegetable Gardener's Bible instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is folklore, not fact","review":"I was looking for a book that would tell me what kinds of plants went well together (i.e. acid loving, alkaline loving, etc.). I bought this book but sadly, this was totally not what I was looking for. It's essentially folklore in that there is little to no fact presented - no sources, no references, no science, no hows and whys.

We do not have problems with pests in our garden nor do we have blights or funguses in our garden. Love this method. It is fun to plan a garden around this method each year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrots hate tomatoes","review":"There is almost no science to back up the author's claims about the benefits of companion plants. Most of her book is based on folk tales, myths and assumptions.A gentleman named Craig Dremann actually studied the effects of companion plants and concluded that carrots detest tomatoes. Carrots do grow well with garlic and radishes but they grow very poorly with tomatoes. Carrots only grew to 6% of normal when interplanted with tomatoes. Tomatoes grew better with carrots so clearly the tomatoes were robbing nutrients from the carrots. Tomatoes also grow better with garlic but the garlic suffers, only growing 35% of normal.The Craig Dremann booklet with his findings is called \\"Companion Plants: Carrots Really Detest Tomaotes\\" and is available from Redwood City Seed Company in Redwood City, CA."},{"rating":"1","title":"most of the book is not on companion planting","review":"I expected the book to be mostly about companion planting, and it wasn't.

For an experienced gardener, I thought this was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Information","review":"Overall, this was a good reference book on companion plantings and had a lot of useful gardening information.

Read this book cover-to-cover and you will feel (in comparison to the author), absolutely BRILLIANT. To digest the painstaking detail taken to prove that God is exactly 2312 years old using radiometric dating is phenomenal. The author (and too, surely his followers) prove there is a link between lesser beings and humans; and they is it. If you're as aged as I, you can take this book, skim through its one-liners, and get a daily chuckle - albeit at the expense of the beloved United States of America. But, hey, understand that, \\"All good things must...\\" My only concern is for the those too young to truly appreciate this \\"work\\" and to whom the skeletal remains of this nation will be bequeathed.To those elderly foolish enough to have littered this country with offspring, my only comment is: Sorry, you should have seen this coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're not a rocket scientist...look elsewhere.","review":"I couldn't believe how much time it took me to set up a clock radio!

If you're going to do a show about Sonic in a BAND and hire only one voice actor, why not hire one who can actually sing? They do exist.Painful to listen to, with an animation quality that's equally painful to watch.Possibly the worst drivel the Sonic series has ever produced, and considering some of the lemons they've been willing to slap Sonic's name on, that is saying something.Too bad I will probably have to buy the rest of the series for a young family member, since for some reason, kids too young to have developed taste beyond 'it's animated' love the bad singing and washed out, pathetic excuses for a plot. It barely fits into the rest of the Sonic shows- was probably developed to have other main characters and they slapped Sonic into it just so someone would actually watch it. It'd never have sold without a major character glued on.If your kids haven't seen it, don't let them get started on it. Your ears will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This set is a ripoff!","review":"I found out this is only volume one of the series and if the set doesn't sell well they won't put the rest out like Adventures of Sonic The Hedgehog why don't they advertise. these guys are amateurs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"series","review":"My son had us dvr this every day They came and havebeen watched everyday over and over again by the boys"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sztos","review":"This is a movie of two guys starting to conduct a business in a Communist Poland in an unlawful way.They get cheated by another cheater and want revenge.They way to take the revenge is surprising to the viewer and full of humor.It's a must see movie.2 Thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"CUBAN MUSIC WITH DIGNITY!","review":"Marlene Urbay and her collaborators, fronting the Florida Chamber Orchestra, have come up with a real Cuban classic...

The only thing that comes close is the magnificent \\"In A Cuban Garden\\" recorded by the immortal Gonzalo Roig back in the 1950's. It is a great fortune that with the current recording technologies Urbay & Orchestra can deliver this beautiful music in all its richness and uniqueness.

The authors describe each ride or show, but don't necessarily tell how to save money.Since some of the information is now outdated, if you are looking for a guidebook, you would be much better off getting one of the \\"unofficial\\" guides (The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2007 (Unofficial Guides)) or the Passporter guide (PassPorter Walt Disney World 2007: The Unique Travel Guide, Planner, Organizer, Journal, and Keepsake!

Raymond Briggs and Posy Simmonds sections are my favourite, and show what this book could have been.Regardless of my little nitpicking there - the illustrations are nice, varied, and beautifully reproduced. The intro is a nice walk through of the genre, and includes many small reprints of classic paintings.It's a nice book, especially if you're American.

As an expatriate with kids, I was looking forward to enjoying this \\"What is...?\\" lift-the-flap book, after enjoying What is Easter and What is Christmas. However, this book concentrates on shopping, cooking, and eating. These days Thankgiving is a secular holiday which Americans of all sorts celebrate, so it is not the religious omission I object too, but the oversimplification and glossing over of historical events about which even the youngest of American preschoolers usually hear. Pilgrims are mentioned on only two pages, one of which states that they invited the Indians for dinner, but does not go on to say WHY the Native Americans were part of the first Thanksgiving feast. If it were not for the help the Pilgrims received from the Native Americans, they might not have survived to celebrate.

The graphics are great, and the commentary is entertaining. The problem with this game is the computer AI. Often the opposing team can't seem to drive in runs unless they jack one out of the park. Also it is far too easy to hit. I constantly end games with 20+ hits and that takes away from the authenticity of the game. Another problem is that There are not enough options. After you're done with a season there really isn't much else to do. The game could definately use a franchise mode similar to the Madden football . series.

Technotes and workarounds that are not always clear (yeah, I know, what else is new) or that fail to give key bits of info due emphasis ( like telling users that Copy Drive requires source and destination drives to be the same size BEFORE they try it).So you really need to do your homework on this package before buying it, let alone using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It crashes and you can't delete the program.","review":"GHOST when it works is great but it's like living with a tiger: there's no telling when it will turn on you.

Twice I removed all the partial backups and started from scratch, but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup.Now, the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image, but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use Ghost to backup on disc","review":"If I could give this product negative stars I would.Have spent three days trying to get a single file offthe backup.

It's much easier to use, copies about 2x faster than Ghost, and best of all it works. I cloned and replaced C drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost 2003 was better/different","review":"Ghost 10 is a very different product than the old version of Ghost and should be called by a different name. Symantec is so paranoid of pirates that they have taken away basic functionality of the product. The ability of booting off a CD and making a backup of your drive is gone. You need to install the software in windows, and register the product, to backup a drive. Installing means another thing in your system tray taking up memory. If you want to back up the system drive you need to boot to windows, run ghost, reboot and continue. Lots of extra steps.I bought this product because the old Ghost doesn't support SATA drives. I wound up replacing my SATA drives with IDE drives so I could use the 2003 version.It has added some sort of ability to do periodic backups of your system. I wasn't interested in this feature and can't tell you much about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I bought this and Norton Systemworks 6 and I'm extremely disappointed. There have been numerous installation errors and Ghost won't actually run, although it does still use resources. Systemworks is almost as bad. Until I removed most of it, it hogged resources. It still adds quite a bit to the start up times. One of the features told me that it can't run because it can't find System.Dat in my windows directory, which, as far as I can tell, isn't actually a part of XP (which, obviously is what I'm running).

However, I'm quite unsatisfied with its overall quality. The display is hard to see (background is too dark) and the buttons are unresponsive. When you set the settings, the digit to be set flashes too fast and is thus almost impossible to see. The buttons often have to be pressed several times until the clock finally registers the press. Also, the clock is not very accurate. Programming the clock is also non-trivial, and requires reading the manual every time you want to do something. So, overall, I think it is a poor product. It is also kinda obsolete as it is almost ten years old now. If you have a smartphone, you will be much better off using an application for that. At least you get a readable display then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most reviewers got this right.","review":"I came to post a review expecting to be the only one who had come to the obvious conclusion that Lori was guilty. Is the Peruvian justice system bad? Of course it it. The same is true with respect to the majority of countries in the world. Has she been mistreated? It seems likely. But after following this case since the beginning and reading everything I saw about it, including all of the information on Lori's website (most included in the book), there is NO doubt in my mind of her guilt. If an upper-class, liberal activist wants to be a martyr that's fine. But to insult our intelligence with this plee for help is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"Lori went to Peru to join a terrorist group, planned a plot to assault the congress of Peru. In her new trial, a due process and lead by a civil prosecutor, the Peruvian Supreme Court probed that she participated actively in the design of the frustrated Congress' assault.Moreover, Lori lived togheter with the top leaders of the terrorist group for more than a year. In fact, MRTA was a terrorist group that claimed the USA as an imperialist and evil power.Although Lori decided to walk a path that did not recognized democratic values and human rights, supporting an armed and communist revolution in Peru, when she was indicted she decided to claim that her human rights were not respected.The book is fully biased, aimed to attack the Peruvian Judicial System and, at the same time, to avoid the most important, what is the facts about Lori's plans in Peru. Obviously, a book wrotte by a mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"American \\"Do-Gooder\\" Lands In Peruvian Prison","review":"Rhoda Berenson's relentless defense of a daughter with revolutionary aspirations seems to confirm all of the unfavorable stereotypes about upper-middle income liberal New Yorkers. From my reading of this book, the Berensons are stuck---flying to Peru; lobbying for Lori's parole; and defending her odd approach to human rights---an approach that landed her in prison."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is guilty as charged","review":"I suppose the parents of Timothy McVeigh might write a book pleading that their son is only a freedoom fighter or a romantic but I dont think they will get the same simpathy that the Berensons claims for their daugther. After all who cares about the thousands of \\"peruvian indians\\" killed for the guerrillas that she evidently help and supported? Please admit your responsability and ask for forgiveness first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lori was naive at best, most likely guilty","review":"If you look at Lori's past, and the evidence, it is clear that the Peruvian government did its job and that she was guilty. Peruvian politics are not for dabbling, and for all her mother's wailing, she might at least look at reality a bit more clearly. I felt there was an incredible bias in the writing and unfair portrayal of Peru. At least Peruvian justice put away that Dutch serial killer, vn der Sloot, whereas the US did not.I love Peru, even with all its troubles, but this book is just an example of what can happen when an arrogant American goes to fight injustice in a faraway land and not at home. I think Camille Paglia's theories about protected middle class girls shocked when life gets rough outside of their environment apply here. Maybe someone can mail Lori some Camille Paglia."},{"rating":"1","title":"guilty guilty guilty","review":"I hate to be a party pooper but someone has to toss a dart at this agitprop book. Lori is a terrorist and no amount of mom's apologizing and covering up is going to change that. She's where she belongs and mommy can't help her and that is the way it should be. Mom Berenson does a clever job os disguising the truth in her book but the holes in her reasoning are deep and obvious. Pop Berenson is obvious by his presence. Figure it this way a commie activist gets busted and the whole world is supposed to care? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Disappointed","review":"I found this book to be overall pretty disappointing. First off, the illustrations are horrible. They look like children's cartoon drawings. Why don't the editors of mammal-books hire the same artists who do bird guides? The latter are generally really good.Secondly, there is a lot of important information lacking. For example the book states that it describes \\"almost all the species that can be identified in the field easily\\". I was hoping for a book to 'the mammals of the indian subcontinent' (ALL of them) not a book of 'the mammals of the indian subcontinent that can be easily identified'. The whole section at the end on 'Where to Watch mammals' is pretty useless. I'll get that info from the 'Lonely Planet', thanks. That space should have been spent instead on descriptions (and better illustrations) of more species."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great impression this book has made","review":"This is a very thorough complilation of works by many well known or slightly known painters of mostly Eastern PA.

And ,oh yes, the pictures were very nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"not excellent...","review":"The original movie songs such as \\"Don't Forget The Rules\\" cannot be found in this That's why I don't like it much.

Great for pre-k kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many flaws","review":"After only a few days the mats started to curl up. We kept using them for awhile anyway, but it wasn't long before we had to pitch them. No mats = no game. I guess I could try to make my own to replace them.The command voice is way too quiet. He's also much too quick to jump to the next command, which makes playing nearly impossibly for littler kids, and it will be too boring/easy for most older kids. It doesn't give them enough time to process the command before it's off to the next thing. If they don't know it pat, they miss out on that command.I did find that it got repetitive awfully quickly. Every once in awhile I'd hear an unusual command that we hadn't heard before (like \\"spin to a vegetable\\") which mixed it up a little and made it more fun, but not often. Overall not worth a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most boring version of \\"simon says\\"...","review":"Honestly, my kids (2.5 and 6.5 years) loved this the first two times they played it. After that, the thrill was gone. My daughter kept asking \\"what else can we do?\\" because it's the same directions over and over. And, even with just two kids, the voice isn't loud enough that we could hear it. I can't imagine tryin gto hear it over a group of children. This game is SO not worth $25. A game of \\"simon says\\" is free and a whole lot more fun and creative. The educational value of this game is pretty low. I don't think a parent needs to pay $25 for a child to learn basic shapes and colors and to recognize a handful of animals, instruments, and food. For the life of me, I can't see why this game got so many great reviews. I will say that the construction of the game is decent and the marketig/packaging are top notch. The game itself, however, is quite dull even to a toddler. Simon says:\\"Save your money!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Cranium Hullaboo","review":"Cranium Hullaboo is great fun for lots of ages. My grandchildren, ages 2 through 11 all love it. It helps the younger ones learn colors and shapes, and the best part is that it really doesn't matter who wins (lands on the winning shape). They just love moving around to the different places, and the older ones like helping the younger ones find the correct place to go. I highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's boys (3 & 5) \\"Just love it!\\"","review":"The boys can't go to bed without one last session with Hullabaloo. Mom enjoys it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game for playdates and parties","review":"The game is an excellent activity game for our 3 and 5 year old sons. They play this together and also at play dates and all kids have a blast.- The activity cards made from a soft synthetic material (somewhat like thin rubber but very flexible, not plastic). They are durable and doesn't look like they will tear very easily.- Boombox construction is like say Leapfrog toys. Good solid plastic that is well constructed and looks durable.- Boombox requires 3 AAA batteries that drain quick. Highly recommend using the Sanyo Eneloop rechargeables that last longer and are well, rechargeable.- Smaller kids can learn all about shapes, colors, and animals. Older kids (4+) can sharpen their reaction times and have a great time with the upbeat music. Love the tempo of the music, puts everyone in the mood to play.Just a well made game with educational benefits to it. Highly recommended, and makes a terrific birthday present as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids really enjoy this game!","review":"We got this as a gift for my 5 yr old and he and his 3 yr old sister really enjoy this game. It is highly entertaining and keeps them occupied for long. Very upbeat and cheerful, more so than any board game. Would highly recommend this game to anyone. As someone else said it is a combination of Twister and Simon Says. The kids just love this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"family fun","review":"I have two boys (2 and 4 yrs) they both love this game. However I wish you could skip the intro instead of listening to it every game. Also it needs to be able to be louder, when the boys get excited we sometimes can't hear the directions. It is still a lot of indoor fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to learn, Awesome, Active, FUN!!!","review":"My daughter received this for her 5th birthday & she absolutely loves it. When she wanted to play it, I didn't have any time to explain how it worked so I just showed her how to put out the mats & turn the machine on & her & her friend jumped right in & figured it out. Within minutes they were 'swimming', dancing like a monkey, eating spaghetti, etc...& having tons of fun doing it! I enjoyed watching them play it & reminescing about playing twister & Simon says as a kid. I can see this will be a favorite for both our kids & their friends. It does take up a large safe place to play because there is a lot of jumping & dashing to the pads/mats. So, if you have kids & have some room to play, you gotta get this game!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest game on my daughter's shelf","review":"My five year old daughter LOVES this game. She enjoys hopping around the room and racing to get to the right place the fastest. It is helping her with color, shape, and word recognition. And for me, the best part is that she can play alone (a BIG plus for an only child) giving me a few minutes to get dinner started or whatever while she is distracted and having a good time while being active and not plopping in front of the TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this game!","review":"My children, ages 6 and 3, got this for Christmas and are still playing it regularly. As a mom, I really love it, too, because it's one of very few games they can set up, play and put away all by themselves (great for them, and even better if I need to get something done!).The battery-operated box was very easy for them to learn, and they get a kick out of the silly things it instructs them to do. Many, many thumbs up from our family! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring game!","review":"Our family found this game to be very boring. I was excited to give it to my almost 4 year old son based on the reviews but was very upset with how bored my son and the rest of our family were after a few rounds of playing. I thought this would be a great game for all of us to have some silly fun, but it was just simply not that great. On top of that there was no challenge so I can't imagine how a child over my sons age would like it. The announcers voice was also quiet and hard to hear. I returned our copy and two others that I had bought as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME MUST HAVE FOR AGES 3 AND UP DONT MISS IT","review":"This is the best fun for all players even just one child can enjoy playing this alone.

All directions all called out by the taking audio console."},{"rating":"2","title":"Therapists: GRAB this Toy!!","review":"I'm a speech therapist and love this toy. I played it at a client's house and decided to buy one for myself. It is great for auditory direction following and also provides an incentive after doing stuffy drills for awhile!!

Would make a great Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cranium product, of course","review":"It was most fun watching the under-six set play this game. Great way to wear them out.

I made a mistake for buying it for my 8yr old brother.The toy says 4+ and has a advanced button on it but again the product was great but not age appropriate for my brother so I guess I saying look at the age on crainum products and the age it states only go like a year up.It's still a great educational product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This toy is a blast!","review":"My seven and five year olds love this. It is so much fun for them. Be sure you have a lot of room to spread out the peices and for the kids to move around. They have to follow directions, and it also involves them being physically active. I highly recommend it for kids and parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's so much fun for the whole family","review":"We bought this game for Christmas for my son who just turned five years old. He absolutely loves it. It's great because it's so easy to play and he can play it with his friends without parental involvement or help. It also burns energy because you're always jumping around from space to space. Each time you play, the game is always different, and you never know when the narrator is going to tell you to \\"freeze\\". It a bit educational because you have to know your shapes, colors, musical instruments, and some food. I highly recommend it for any child four and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful fun on a rainy day!!","review":"My son got this game for his 4th birthday, he is now 5.5 and plays with it all the time. It's great for a rainy day, because it gets the kids active and moving in a small space. It's also great to take on a trip because it doesn't take up much space and can be played anywhere. The directions are always different, we are still hearing new directions that we've never heard before. The only complaint I have, like many other reviewers is that it does not get loud enough, often we miss the directions if we are playing with a lot of children. The pads are made of an easy to clean, rubbery material, and we have never had to replace the batteries in a year and a half. Overall, a wonderful toy for little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great active fun!","review":"My 4-year old and 2 1/2 love this game!

I have three kids aged 2,4 &6 and they found it very boring and tired of it in about 3 minutes. There really is no point to it other than following directions and although the voice prompt is clear, it is not loud enough to hear over a a few kids so we couldn't even make out what the prompt was saying. I ended up returning it. You could easily make your own version of this at home with some colored paper and save $25!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game! Lots of FUN!","review":"This game is active and fun! Great to help with colors and shapes as well.

Since \\"winning\\" is based completely on luck and the games are very short everyone gets a chance to win without it really being a big deal.Probably the only down side would be for those who have limited mobility and couldn't play this fun game which is kind of a mix of Simon says, Set and Twister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game for a party or several kids.","review":"We purchased Hullabuloo for our kids (ages 6&3)last Christmas. They absolutely love this game, especially my youngest because you don't have to read, take turns or sit still. This game is definitely more fun with more than 2 people though.

Other than that it is tons of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational and fun","review":"I purchased this game for my four year old son.

The game includes shape, color, and category (food, animal, etc.) recognition, and my daughter started playing before she was two years old. My 5 yr old son is *very* competitive so I usually worry about board games, but this one has random winner selection and funny \\"congratulations\\" for the winner.... so he's happy no matter who \\"wins\\". I would agree that it needs better volume control, and it would be nice if it had one more level of difficulty (there are only two), but I am SO glad that I spent the money on our game that I buy this game for all our little friends' birthdays. We have taken it on several trips with us... it's even fun in a cramped hotel room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family Game","review":"I just wanted to say that our family absolutely loves this game and we play it 2-3 times a week.

My older son can understand the directions in both levels, but since he usually plays with his brother, we have been sticking to level 1. It teaches kids to think fast in identifying colors, shapes, categories (musical instrument, food, animal), and to follow directions in identifying them (sit, spin, crawl, jump). It's a good game to get their energy out before bedtime, or when cooped up because of the rain. And, the voice is not obnoxious like some talking toys. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Active fun for 3-6 year olds","review":"This game has been played now for several years.

Nevertheless it could still be a worthwhile reference for many men, particularly if they fit that mould. My biggest gripe is the authors try to misrepresent themselves as experts in these matters, and grandstand over men who are even lower down the social scale than themselves. How do I know they're not experts?

It has so many features I never got around to using them all. The speaker in the cordless receiver is the best thing about it. It makes sharing my attention while addressing other tasks easier. The extended range is discernable while walking about the building. Sound and automatic dialing are well designed. Why a second KX-TG5050W? I killed the first one with a static electricity shock one day.

I still recommend this DVD, for the professional in the restaurant business. I do feel, however, that this documentary may be the weakest in the series.

This is an excellent, underappreciated film noir error flynn classic. The reason I give this release 2 stars is for the fast that WB took no attempt in remastering this classic. There are several parts throughout the film where the film becomes faded on half the screen, particles throughout, and in a few places major film scratches. Maybe I'm too use to buying Criterion films for this price, knowing they'll do their damndest to clean up the film before they transfer it. I was also very disappointed that there were no special features. WB has done a decent job with several other Errol Flynn films, this is the first one I've had an issue with.

It must have been a massive undertaking for her to write and I admire the throuroughness that she has achieved.

The only song I really don't care for is Wait. The best songs are the ones that feature Tedashii. However there are two standouts that Creezie does by himself: Crossover and Who U Wit. This is Lecrae's rookie album, but you would never know it! Real Talk Interlude is basically his statement of faith. This album, in my mind, should be classified under electronic rap.

Her rendition of \\"Bailero\\" on the \\"Beautiful Voice\\" disk is the musical equivalent of pouring hot fudge sauce on a garden salad. But on this disk Fleming sings grand opera lollipops that really cry out for a gorgeous voice that can fill a huge space, especially in the hits from La Wally, Puccini, and the French operas.

But since then, I have found that she uses the same breathy \\"emotional\\" attacks, swooping, and over-chested low notes way too many times to be considered either stylistic or sincere.

Renée Fleming is my favourite soprano, and she is one of the greatest without a doubt. Her Italian diction is beautiful, with the Puccini arias all being sung gloriously. It should also be noted that Fleming has a gorgeous, sexy and silken instrument that does not let her down anywhere in her range or in terms of portraying the character.Fleming also exerts a level of dynamic control, technical skill and upmost control that does not come easy...I do believe that Renée Fleming has become one of the greatest sopranos of her generation. I have no doubt that people will be listening to her 100 years from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caballé didn't have the middle notes???","review":"To say that Caballé, whose strongest register was her middle, didn't have the middle notes to sing Norma is ridiculous. Caballé's legati in \\"Casta diva\\" are seamless. Check out her \\"Casta diva\\" on her \\"Montserrat Caballé Sings Bellini and Donizetti\\" CD. Fleming could learn a thing or two! She sounds afraid of the moon goddess instead of praying to her. Her Italian has badly rolled r's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mannered, unidiomatic singing","review":"Fleming is light years behind her great soprano predecessors. Fleming here sings a \\"Casta diva\\" that far pales in comparison to those of Caballé and Sutherland. It is far too studied. Instead of sounding like she is praying to the moon goddess, she sounds like she is afraid of her. Her \\"Ne andrò lontana\\" is unidiomatic. Her high E-natural at the end of the \\"I vespri siciliani\\" bolero is a tasteless interpolation. Her \\"Un bel dì\\" lacks girlish charm and happiness. When Butterfly sings of seeing Pinkerton coming up the hill, she is supposed to sound happy with anticipation. Fleming makes her sound like she would want to take a machete to Pinkerton or at least give him a good beat-down. She is clumsy at rolling the r's in the Italian arias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious Renee","review":"I just love Renee Fleming's voice. It reminds me so much of the fabulous Anna Moffo - my personal favorite since childhood. My mother played Anna Moffo records for me while I was a tiny bit in my crib. So try to reprogram oneself after hearing such loveliness in the universe. Both ladies have a creamy voice, elegant phrasing and classical beauty. I agree with the prior reviewer that every soprano should record \\"O mio babbino caro\\". And if Renee did not record it, well then we'd be missing her version.The more that I listen to Renee's music or see her in recitals, the more I adore the lady. The standouts on this disc are \\"Casta diva\\", \\"Lo son l'umile ancella\\", \\"Je suis encor tout etourdie\\", and \\"Ah! Je veux vivre\\", \\"Signore ascolta\\", etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Miss Fleming's absolute bests!","review":"This is definitely one of my all-time favorite Renee Fleming albums if not THE favorite! Her voice totally shines in every single aria on here, and she seems can totally drag you into the world of each of the characters. What can I say? Ms. Fleming just never fails to impress me. Everything that she sings she seems to be able to bring something unique to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice content, horrible pictures","review":"This book is very nice in content but poor picture quality, would be nice if the new edition or next volume of this title comes with more equipment and arquitectural photos and diagrams as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is an excellent book for those that just want to look at some incredible marine aquariums or those looking for information on starting their own masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is a wonderful book of reef aquaria. It is a survey of 50 different aquariums which all show various approaches to captive reefing. Most of these systems vary from algae turf scrubbing to higher end refugums. One reviewer made a note that most of these systems are in the USA. Most are, which is somewhat unfair. I hope there will be another like this but from various other countries. Let's hope the publisher will pay for the author to go abroad and make a continuation on outstanding reef aquariums.

I would recommend this because it is a thriller. I could not put this book down. It leaves you in suspense after every chapter. I would also recommend this book because it is almost like a heart stopper. There are unseen events that happen, and you cannot see them coming. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to think hard all the time because this book has twist and turns in it and some are hard to understand at first but, they unravel as you read on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killer's Cousin","review":"I thought this book was great. Although, it was slow in the beginning, it quickly started to heat up. If you are into mysteries and exciting books, this book is for you. This book is also a great page-turner.

If you like stories that keep you guessing and in suspense, The Killer's Cousin is a book that I recommend for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This suspenseful drama will keep you on guessing......","review":"The Killer's Cousin by Nancy Werlin is a dramatic page turner that will keep you guessing right up to the end. Seventeen-year-old David Yaffe, recently aquitted of killing his girlfriend, moves to Massachusetts to live with his estranged aunt, uncle, and cousin to escape the media and questioning glances from his family and friends. Because of his aunt's cold stares, his cousin's downright hostile behavior, and the ghostly shadows he sees in his attic apartment,David finds it difficult to feel at home. David wonders what secrets his family is hiding, but what he doesn't know is how close he is to the deadly truth. We recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a good psychologic thriller. We couldn't put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killer's Cousin","review":"This book is very exceptional and I believe that is one of the best's books that I have read. I feel, as thought book was right on the target it didn't go from one story to another. I really liked this book I would recommend this book to anyone that asked me.

The thing I like best is the characters. David was so real to me, afraid of himself, lonely, guilty. Frank was probably my favorite character in the book. He reminds me of certain friends of mine. At first I really disliked Lily -- she seemed like a demon-child -- but after I realized what had happened I felt sorry for her. The only part of the book that I didn't like was Kathy's ghost. I didn't think that belonged in an otherwise realistic story, though it was through Kathy that David realized what Lily had done. All in all, a great book which I'd recommend to anyone who likes suspense novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killer's Cousin","review":"If you prefer books about mysteries and a book that will keep you reading, The Killer's Cousin, by Nancy Werlin, would be perfect for you. I rated it a 5. This book keeps you reading until the very end. There is usually a cliffhanger at the end of every chapter. ...The characters in this book didn't always get along, and you keep guessing till the end when they all got along. For example, the aunt and uncle David went to go live with thought he was crazy and his cousin, Lily, and he hated each other till the end. Those are the reasons you should read this book.

I don't think it was very well written at all, and the plot made no sense to me. Maybe that is because I am in 7th Grade. Much of the book was not needed, and there were many parts that should have been there. This book really needs a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Killer's Cousin","review":"I don't have very much to say about this book. I think it was probably the weakest of Werlin's books that I've read so far. The story moved along slowly, annoyingly so, with more filler than necessary. The writing was choppy, in contrast to the beautiful, evocative writing Werlin was so incredibly capable of in Impossible and Extraordinary. On one hand, it almost seems like it was written by an entirely different author, but on the other hand, it truly goes to show how much an author's writing develops as time passes. The book picked up in speed and interest toward the end, and did come to a satisfying conclusion, but by that point, I was honestly sick of reading the book and didn't care.Rating: 2/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"i think its an amazing game of speed and skill","review":"this game is good because i think its got a good choice of characters and vierchals"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad game.... yet somewhat addictive","review":"There is one thing wrong with this game.... it takes all of about 10 seconds to win a match.

I am yet to play the UFC games (which was what I wanted in the first place), but I'm sure they have this game beat by a long shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, similar to Tapout and Throwdown","review":"Its not as easy to knock your opponent out as it is in Throwdown. When your stamina is down you won't get knocked out, you will just be more likely to tap out. The game is pretty [darn] realistic, when you get on the ground with Royce Gracie and your stamina is low, your pretty much [out of luck]. When Gracie is on the ground top or bottom his health speeds up about 2x of the regular fighter. Gracie is also one of the few who uses kicks on the ground if you see a hay maker coming, kick em in the side it stops the punch very quick and makes your opponents stop throwin those heavy punches. If their a weak puncher they will punch weak.. you get the idea. I still play my UFC Throwdown but I think I'm going to be hooked on one this for a while (not big Gracie fan just great example). I recommend this game to any fans of Tapout or Throwdown because its basically the same thing with better ring entrances and a little bit better graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super TV","review":"This is a great TV.

Well, it didn't even cover the sides of the mattress, let alone 2\\" underneath. We have a standard size crib mattress so it obviously shrank even though it says it is preshrunk.

We haven't had any problems with shrinkage. We have a Simmons mattress. I also bought the cheaper Quilted Crib Mattress Pad by Babies 'R Us, and it is just not as comfortable feeling as this one, and the quality on that one really seems to be lacking.

We have regular Sealy crib mattresses, but the pockets on this pad were only large enough to fit down the sides of the mattress, not wrap around underneath.

It's not very good quality. Every time I go to put it on the mattress it feels like my fingers are going to poke through the cheap stretchy sides. And it only barely covers the mattress; it's pretty much holding on for dear life at the corners. I have a Sealy mattress from Babies R Us and it's not extra thick, so there's no reason this shouldn't fit. For the same price, you're much better off going with the UltraSoft Quilted Mattress Pad by Continental Quilting. I have one of those and it is *great*. It fits the mattress really well, with no chance of it popping off.

The weakness was in the story. It didn't go anywhere. The characters didn't learn anything. They were no different at the end than the beginning accept one of them was pregnant. The character of Jeffrey was contradictory and hard to believe. He was one minute frigid and almost robotic, then the next sex-crazed over an older woman. He admits to himself that he loves his wife and yet goes out of his way to say something especially cutting to her simply because she wants a baby.

You have to pick up a card, say any question out loud, and then you put in your answer. Your friends have to try to guess what YOU put in. IT ALWAYS SAYS ITS RIGHT IF ITS RIGHT AND IT ALWAYS SAYS ITS WRONG IF ITS WRONG. I am saying this because another review said that if you put in the wrong answer it comes right. That is not the case. Also, you do NOT have to change the batteries every week, like someother games.

It was very hard to keep the game balanced to get all the pieces on. It took 2 adults. I could not have set this up alone (and I consider myself having good motor skills). My 6 year old had alot of trouble with this game, a hard time getting the \\"fork tool\\" under the pieces. After playing the game twice it was not a game that made family fun night fun.

So yes, it is NOT a fluke, this is a defective product, if you get hold of one and it isn't broken yet, it will be eventually.However, I still use it as a surround sound system, and must admit it sounds pretty good, but I have to plug a cheapo DVD player into an AV input (it only has 2..) to watch DVDs with surround... which is absurd, but I can thank Sony for making this ripoff.And for what it's worth: leaving the system off when not using it seems to improve its longevity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone posting reviews is correct: this product is junk.","review":"I'm having the *exact* same problems everyone else is: mainly that the unit will not power off (just bliks \\"Standby\\" repeatedly) and I have 2 DVDs stuck in the machine that are unretrievable.

I haven't had any substantial problems with it. My only complaint is that inserting and ejecting discs take some time to get used to and its kinda slow. But I usually have my top 4 CDs/DVDs in there and and keep the 5th slot ready for quick access.So yeah, for the amount of money that I bought it for, it's definitely a steal. But most of you probably also bought it retail. Well, the reason I got it is because I saw it in my brother-in-law's condo and I loved it.

There is no way to tell what disks are loaded in the machine, and you cannot change one disk while it is playing another. These seem like minor things, but when you walk in to the room and turn on the stereo to listen to some music they add up to a 5 minute delay before you are actually listening to anything. Bleh.

It is interesting because it doesn't focus soley on her art, but more directly emphasizes her emotional strength as a woman. A large portion of the book is exerpts from private conversations with Frida, as well as diary entries, medical records, and personal letters. Her life is filled with tragedy, but the book shows the incredible spirit of Kahlo as she faces near death and struggles as a female artist in a male dominated world. This book also gives the reader insight into the famed relationship of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Frida Kahlo: An Open Life, is written by Raquel Tibol who befriended Rivera in the 1950's and subsequently met and lived with Kahlo a year before her death. This book provides an unique perspective on the personal life of the very strong willed Kahlo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frida Kahlo: An Open Life","review":"It's an interesting subject, but I found the book to be quite confusing.

Fortnum and the local chief of police, Colonel Perez (Hoskins), introduce him to the realities of life in the border town, which is under military occupation due to the high incidence of Paraguayan terrorism in the area. Eduardo starts having a passionless affair with Fortnum's 19 year old ex-prostitute wife and gets involved with terrorists who kidnap Charlie instead of the American Ambassador. It ends badly.Despite the excellent cast, the performances in this film are disappointing across the board: Gere's trying to hard, Caine's trying only as hard as he has to and the usually reliable Hoskins has a worse Spanish accent than Gere's English one. The characters are one-dimensional and unsympathetic and Mackenzie directs at a snail's pace, which adds to the general feeling that nothing interesting is happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just barely OK....","review":"I like Joseph Mazzello a lot (he's a great young actor!), but I have to say that this movie stunk!

I mean, it's not the WORST movie I've ever seen, but definitely not the BEST or even close to it. The acting is pretty OK, but most of it is a little cheesy. Star Kid is more for our younger audiences than older audiences. I rented this video and I can say that renting it once was enough for me! I've seen all of Joseph Mazzello's movies, and I have to say that his other ones are better. If you're a Joseph Mazzello fan, skip this one and pick up The Cure, Jurassic Park, Simon Birch, or The River Wild. Watching this movie once should be enough! Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"star kid is a star!","review":"i like star kid. i want a star kid suit myself to play with. he can fight bullies and look scary but star kid is really just a boy. my best part of the show was star kids special effects. it looked much realer than power rangers. they are grown ups, and star kid is a kid. the suit makes him look bigger and feel happier. if i get lonesome i ask to watch star kid and i pretend to be star kid after the movie. i like star kid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*A Great Family Movie*","review":"This is a great movie for the whole family.Some funny parts to make you laugh.Just a nice movie to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad...","review":"Joseph Mazzello is a great young actor, but this movie was WAY below par for his filmography.

I have had it for 2 years almost and i havent had any problems so far. Plus, many people complain that the step on the metal balls or lose them. That has never happened to me. They do bounce away from the game, but not far. I highly recommend this game. Very addicting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the balls?!","review":"The game is fun at first but gets VERY boaring VERY fast. I agree with everything M.Borous wrote about Bulls Eye Ball. One thing that I really got frustrated with is the tiny silver balls. Problem #1: when you score the balls are sopposed to roll down a slope and into this little area to hold them, but they always get stuck. Probem #2: The balls are about the size of the end of a push pin (the non-pointy end) and EASILY get lost. I only have one ball left! If I could I would give this toy -5 stars. HORRIBLE TOY!!!

I have since purchased three more of these, not for my nieces and nephews, but for my brothers!! Of course it didn't take long for my brother to learn you can stick your finger in the hole and trigger the score... but that is just part of the fun. The batteries are long lasting.The only downsides are the announcer guy is a little annoying, but it does mute and its annoying that once opened and constructed it does not fit back into the box. I found this uped the probability of those little balls going missing. We cram it back in the box. Foutunately it has a self shut off so even if the on button gets hit in the cramming, it still shuts off. We own just about every game there is, and this one is truely an ageless toy. I plan to bust it out this Christmas for another bulls eye show down with my brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I dont know why this toy got such good reviews.

(MUCH BETTER AND CHEAPER!!!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Scores","review":"OK, so I'm really 33 years old, and I am addicted to this game. My 25+ year old friends like it too. They will play all night until I kick them out of the house.A person playing for the first time is usually horrible, and the balls bounce too high. If they play a few more games, they get way better, and have more fun. (And start to get competitive.)It would be interesting to see everyone's shooting style. I started with one hand, grabbing one ball, shooting, repeat. I eventually evolved to using both hands (for the speed games) picking up 2 or 3 balls at a time, shooting them individually from that hand while the other hand grabs for more balls, and switch. I'm sure it looks pretty frantic.I've had the game for 4+ years, and it is still going strong. I don't think I've changed the batteries yet.

Well, we are all in luck now, aren't we? Released a long while ago, Bull's-Eye Ball is just as fun as the average Skee Ball game. Heck, I think it might be even better.You must score as much points as possible by bouncing the balls onto the little built-in trampoline (Twist on the ol' formula!) as they fall into 3 holes. Of course, like regular Skee Ball, the higher the hole is, the more points you get. I think the result is much more addicting than Skee Ball ever really was.I mean, come on! It's Skee Ball in your house. And with a small trampoline built-in! To top it all off, you get to carry this thing wherever you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to get the hang of...","review":"I got this game for Christmas, 2006 and it took me almost a whole week to get the hang of it!

Even when it is compleatly turned down, it is still loud.But i'm finding myself additcted to this game just as much as everyone else! It is really fun to try to beat scores, and I find my competive side come out when i'm playing!All in all, Bullseye ball my have a few bad things about it, but the fun deffinentally makes up for all of that.

I played it 4 hours straight once. The concept seems easy on TV but it's an art when you get into it. It's crazy how easy it is to obsses over ten metal balls and a bulls eye. Enough about my obsesion. This is a great game for both kids and parents. It will keep you occupied for more than a day like most games.It is a great two player game because it's really fun to go back and fourth for high scores. It becomes increasingly more fun as you get better too. Plus there are three fun game modes. Bulls Eye Ball is definetly worth the money.

This is too large a difference to accept, and like another reviewer said, returning it to the manufacturer is not pratical due to shipping cost. Also, you can't read it when it's dark outside, even if you shine a light on it from inside of house. I like to see the early morning temperature during winter when it is still dark outside.

D'oh! It's totally inaccurate on single-pane glazing, very inaccurate on dual-pane glazing, and still slightly inaccurate when mounted on a jerri-rigged 6\\" extender from dual-pane glass.

The LM 140 is more powerful than the LM 150, but the LM 150 gets more control and feels lighter than LM 140. You can swing faster and pick up some shots that you can't before. Overall, it is a light, quick racquet.For 2006 Head has a new technology - Flexpoint come out. But 2 of my friends broke their Flexpoint 130 & 140 in 2 weeks. For 2007 they have a new design call Flexpoint Metallix. It only has one racquet for 150 gram. They say you will get power, control & everything from this racquet.

As such, it has a few clumsy moments. I won't pretend this is one of his finer works.But it's honest and personal and inspired by Alexander's real wife, Janine. \\"Janine is French\\" is a comedy title (again, something not seen often in his later career) that follows the exploits of a soldier returning home from post World War II France with his young bride who, shortly after arriving, learns she desperately hates the States.

I have just visited the Zoo and was thoroughly disapointed and often horrified at the lack of realism and any real sense of theTropics. It is this complete difference of opinion that makes me question Mr. Nyhuis criteria of what a good exhibit is. He must base his opinion on size and grandeur. Tropic World is surely immense! However, it's size is it's biggest problem because of it's lack of quality on such a grand scale. Jungle World at NY's Bronx Zoo so far surpasses Tropic World in every way that it is an abomination to even compare the two.

However, the design on this item is very poor. The problem is the way that the paddle is attached to the holster. Since a revolver is a lot thicker in the front than in the rear, attaching the paddle to the holster with a flat piece of leather (rather that a wedge piece) causes the front of the revolver to point outward and the grip to jam into your side.

The heroes do not know which villain is being played, and their object is to discover this. Each villain needs a different set of 10 items, so by arresting the minions carrying the items the heroes can eventually determine who is the mastermind behind the crime wave. A handy \\"Bat-computer\\" is provided which shows you who the possible villains are when the item cards are inserted.The game play involves rolling a die and moving your character (or multiple minions for the villain player) around the streets of Gotham, entering buildings to steal things or arresting people, depending on which side you're on.

She sings with such raw honest emotion when she sings \\"when my fears get the better of me...you can't take on the world when you're down on your knees...and I'm wearing the worries of a less-traveled road....\\" I feel I can identify. Her music is so personal, yet she sings of universal human experiences. And her voice is so strong and so passionate that it serves to empower me and leaves me feeling very capable in my own journey. Another of my favorites is \\"I Used to Think I Knew You.\\" Her voice is sultry, and this song is reminiscent of blues songs from another era. It evokes such emotion that it leaves you feeling weak. Other favorites are \\"I Believe\\" and the title track \\"Bet on the Wind.\\" This is a polished, well-produced cd that is intimate and beautiful...it hasn't left my cd player since I've gotten it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"It's been out for a while now, and my taste has changed since I originally wrote a glowing review for it.

Debi's closeness to her family comes through with songs like, \\"Niagara Falls.\\" \\"Chevy Impala\\" and \\"If You Don't Listen\\" are catchy, uptempo, and fun.

Comparing the writing of Ray Carney to ice cream and the writing of Kouvaros to ground glass is cheap-shot sloganeering and advertising, not criticism of any kind.

It lacked the charm and draw that the first film had. The lead actress seemed to lack the charisma that she had in the first Azumi and it just seemed every character was just doing their part and phoning in their performances rather then drawing your attention to the screen. If you are a fan of the first, I recommend you check it out, but lower expectations and don't expect to find it as enjoyable as the first Azumi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad It made me sad....","review":"I watched the orignal Azumi and fell in love. The feel of the movie was very anime-eske without being anime, it wraped me up into it with many great points. The shots that were taken were great, the story and plot, and lastly i the swordplay and fight scenes were amazing they were long enough but not to long.For me Azumi 2 was a serious disappointment i had set time out of my extremely busy schedule to watch and i ended up turning it off about 1/3 to half way through and finishing it another day. It became way to anime the char i had fell in love with (Azumi) didnt even feel the same to me anymore. The villians were seriously out of anime i can mark and name them. The whole reason i enjoyed Azumi was it had a anime feel while still being a story about a the trials and tribulations emotionally and physically, a true Samurai flick. Azumi 2 lacked all that to me"},{"rating":"2","title":"The other size of Azumi","review":"Azumi 2 emphasizes the other side of Azumi... not the assassin, but the girl as a human who can be vulnerable like everyone else. As such, the movie's main focus is not the blood and killings (although it still has plenty of them), but the personality of the main character. It shows her emotions and sadness as she deals with her past and the deaths of the people she cares about.I love this movie because I learn everything about the character. To me, it's not just a mindless action flick. It actually has a story that complements the first movie.So, if you're looking for pure action movie, you may not like this one as much as the first one. However, if you want to understand Azumi better, you will love it as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overstated in reviews","review":"I was very disappointed with this cartridge after reading the reviews.I found the cartridge flat and not musical at all, there were no dynamics in the music.

I then thought it needed sometime to break in, so I let it play over about 20 records in two days, still with no improvement.Maybe my hopes were too high for a sub $100 cartridge, but I would say avoid this cartridge and save up for a Grado Gold or a Statement, I am going back to a Dynavector 10x5."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good Cd","review":"Was pleased with the promptneess and quality of CD.

(\\"A Bigger City\\" is a nice song... if you're a self-deluded-in-love lonely indie twenty-something.) And that's it! The rest is trite, self-important twee. Sorry.

These strings simply could not handle anything at or above a forte dynamic."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark, but not edgy","review":"I personally really enjoy these strings, but they're not for every instrument. If you've always thought your instrument was a bit too bright and sharp, these strings will probably be perfect. They can really soften up and add depth to your tone. If your instrument is already fairly deep sounding, they might just muddy up the waters.On another note, they're also not the most powerful strings out there, so take that into consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds realy nice","review":"I realy like the soulful rich sound that these strings provide in my instrument.

In this story, yet another beautiful white woman is kidnapped by yet another chief. The dialogue is again stilted and awkward in some parts, and ellipses are abused. There are also a few awkward descriptions in the sex scenes, and since there's so many of them across the Savage books, they get so repetitive that I actually find myself skimming across them because the same thing always happens, they experience great passion, etc etc.The ending was rather unrealistic with Rebecca Veach's mother. It was just basically a deux es machina to wrap up the story. At the back of the book is a picture of Snow Deer, Ms. Edwards' great-grandmother. In the picture, Snow Deer is fat and rather unhappy-looking. This book is a prequel to Savage Longings which features Snow Deer as the main character. Overall I can;t really recommend this book or its sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The Thumb?!","review":"For some reason my old boss thought THIS would be an appropriate Secret Santa gift for me a few years ago...

Not only is it the dumbest toy on earth it also resembles something you'd find in an ADULT toy store and not the local K B Toys which happened to be going out of business (with inventory like this, no wonder).

It was as frustrating to read about an FBI agent who was just trying to do his job as it is to read about an independent council & an Iraqi inspection team who are just trying to do their job today. Aldrich is very sincere and keeps the reader interested with such issues which include file tampering, Clinton's association w/ convicted felons, poor treatment of the permanent staff at the White house, and Hillary Clinton's own vindictive nature. This book is a must read for everybody who wants to know the truth about the Clinton White House."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a shame the Media didn't believe him","review":"Now that the revelations about Chinese Communist penetration of the White House are being discovered and taken seriously my the Mainstream Media, the obvious conclusion they should reach is that it was all completely predictable.

The reconstructed \\"dialogue\\" rings false--people simply don't speak the way Mr. Aldrich writes, which left me wondering how much was invented. The most objectionable, however, was the ego-driven nature of this biased report of the White House. Rarely have I read such self-important drivel.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a true Clinton hater could enjoy this book","review":"For republicans concerned about real issues, like myself, it completely fails to live up to the teasers on the dust jacket. The dust jacket tells you the First Lady's \\"direction\\" turned the White House Christmas tree into \\"sneering, pornographic sacrilege\\". It turns out the only \\"direction\\" from the First Lady was to use unscreened decorations sent by high school students. The First Lady's only mistake was to leave tree-decorating volunteers in charge of selecting which ornaments went on the tree. The author of the book, who is clearly far more concerned with creating scandal that furthered his own book writing career than in preserving the dignity of the White House, selects the pornographic decoration and hangs them on the tree as his volunteer service to the White House. All true republicans will be far more disgusted by the author's behavior than that of the Clintons after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, time and paper","review":"First of all im not pro or against Clinton.

It was facinating reading, however.Some of his claims have already been proven to be false. Futermore, not all FBI agents are repectable. Look at J.

I have recommended it to many people"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all people concerned with our future","review":"I believe a FBI agent who has actually served his country for 30 years over someone who has just taken advantage of what the government has given him. This book blows the lid off of the White House and also shows that Mr. Clinton does deserve everything that is happening to him right now. Impeachment is too good for the co-presidents.

At every opportunity possible, the author says \\"it was never liked this with Bush or Reagan,\\" or \\"She ain't no Barbara Bush.\\" He didn't make one comparison to a Democratic President because he only wrote this trash to lie about the President, and make foolish conservatives think worse about him.

It is a shame that this person ever became an FBI Agent. He is as bad as the current director. He is using his position for political reasons. He offers no proof but his word. He should have wrote this book like he was preparing a case. Produce hard facts. Why is Clinton in the Whitehouse today.

Upon reading, I felt it needed a better editor to tighten up the truth from editorial griping.He repeatedly states that his job was to issue a background check/report, without conclusions or judgement, for others to evaluate. Then he gives sample reports at the end on the Clintons; full of petty commentary.

I picked this book up as a sale item thinking there maybe be something fun and interesting in it. What I got was about 50% petty complaining, 40% personal hatred and 10% pure fantasy. I mean the biggest gripe this guy has is that the Clinton administration was not that good at turning paper work around, this was not the national crisis issue the author tried to make it out to be. And the lies, they must have been the only way he thought he could sell the books.I am glad that I read this book after the Clinton presidency when there was a lot of other material to counter balance this diatribe that would have made the best Nazi propaganda writers stand up and take notice.

In a wallnutshell, Little Rick Coleman offers a look at my man Fats \\"Nique\\" Domino from 30,000 feet. This brother made a book that serves more as a reference than a study into the life and time of a musical legend. Yes, everything is well researched and yes, it is well documented but you never get to see the real dilly. If you really want to find out more about Niques personal life than you'll have to hunt him down and axe him yourself cause that type of information ain't in this book.

HOWEVER, my read was brought to a screaming halt by a De Capo Press manufacturing defect: 25 MISSING PAGES (jumps from 180 to 205). Unacceptable, and completely undetectable until rudely encountered while reading.Anyway, my advice is look immediately for missing pages in this paperback edition - if you are like me and buy ahead in your reading materials, you might just find yourself past the Amazon \\"return window\\" with no recourse.

Needless to say, I was anxious to pick up this book and live in his world for a while.It is inevitable that a book like this would address the world of hostile racism that guys like Fats Domino had to live in. They all do. But his book is 1/3 about Fats Domino and 2/3 really creepy sniffling about The Plight Of The Negro.

I was also disappointed that almost every source that the author quotes is a minority, catholic, exile, political elite, European or mixed Chinese.

I looked high and low for a cute travel lite crib and on a whim bought this one because it had a nice look to it. When I set it up (very standard pack n play set up) I was initially quite shocked at the boldness of the pattern and darkness of the brown. I think the pattern is a bit obnoxious in person, though it looks nice the photos. The brown is also quite dark. Now that I have had it set it for a few days, I am getting used to it. The toys are beyond lame (a stuffed star and moon?) and I have simply replaced the toys with bears from the Graco winsdor PNP.

The sheets for the pack and play are the most rough and scratchy sheets you have ever seen. After my daughter was almost two months and began to move more in her sleep I would often wake to find her head up against the meshed sides. She stayed uncomfortable and therefore could never get a good nights rest in this thing. The toys are pretty pointless too, they aren't much to look at.

A standard pack n play they could fit in until 2 1/2 years.If you only intend to use it for the first few months it works great, but beyond that taller children are not very comfortable.My younger son tends to drool in his sleep, sometimes creating an uncomfortable wet spot on the sheets. In a standard pack n play we have the room to move him around and can just change the sheets in the morning.

In fact I played this with my two children last night for 6 months and we ran out of 10,000 bills. It is fine if you play for 3 or 4 months. Only other difference is some of the squares are not the same but none the less we enjoy it. We have played it 10 times in just the 3 days we have had it so far. It has been a great addition to our family games. You can't go wrong if you want a fast paced easy game to play with your children. Some may say 'Children shouldn't experience receiving bills etc (as in the mail cards)' but unfortunately bills is a fact of life. Can't shelter your children from that fact forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME GAME","review":"This is a great game to teach about money but still short enough for someone with a short tension span.

I regret it. Despite good editorials, their products break down with astonishing regularity. My first WPNT511 was bad out of the box, the next one broke down in under a year. If that isn't bad enough, their scripted, plastic technical support seems to be designed more to deliver infuriating platitudes and block the customer from getting any meaningful resolution to their problem (that might cost Netgear an extra penny) than to be sincerely helpful.Consider this a \\"danger sign.\\" You may choose to ignore it, but be ready for the consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA - dead on arrival","review":"The adapter was dead on arrival.

I did have some rough spots on the card installer and wizard, but with a little fiddling I was able to work it out. For the price (you can get the card and router together for a song on either Amazon or Tiger), I couldn't be happier. But given the number of people who have had problems w/ the wizard, I'd suggest it's best for people w/ medium to high knowledge of networking. For those folks, it's really hard to beat this deal.

We were disappointed and will likely only buy direct from Starbuck now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rock is cooking with gas in this one!","review":"Imagine being completely devastated (mind, body, and soul) and then having the ultimate opportunity to step up to the plate and start avenging. Well, this movie takes that step and does so while still expanding on the story and creating a few additional interesting characters to keep the film very interesting. I do not want to spoil any of it, except to say that once the main character is let loose and decides on a direction, he literally starts running and that's what I like to see happen - someone who takes charge of the situation and obliterates his enemies. That makes for some great movie time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the \\"Rock\\"","review":"Love Dwayne Johnson and action films of all kinds and he's done some great movies--but this isn't one of them. He has so much more to offer than the monosyllabic--executioner presentation he's given to work with here. And the other \\"stock\\" characters Billy Bob Thorton as the drug using, dirty cop & Carla Giano as his too tough to be believable partner, don't make the movie any better.

It's unfortunate that he chose to work this movie. It stunk. Obvious plot. Completely unrealistic concepts.

I purchased the blu-ray and have been able to enjoy it more and more with each viewing. This, in my opinion, is Duane's best work thus far. A great story of revenge, redemption, and ultimately forgiveness (just the real bad guys get taken out), the clues keep presenting until most viewers are able to form the correct conclusion at the time it is presented.

Car chase scenes, violence, villians, beautiful women, and general mayhem abound in this actioner.An impressive supporting cast, including Billy Bob Thornton and Carla Gugino round out the characters. Billy Bob and Carla play detectives trying to stop \\"Driver\\" from killing any more, and at the same time discover his motivation for doing so. (I must add that Carla Gugino is an incredibly beautiful woman and that I am a big fan of her films).don't want to give away the plot, but the movie does have a moral message at the end somewhat when \\"Driver\\" learns that getting even with others will now leave its own scars on his psyche, and that he'll have to carry those scars with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Rock\\" is out for revenge","review":"\\"Faster\\" reminded me of some of the old Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns. Lighting, cinematography, the fact that Dwayne Johnson hardly speaks in the movie. Is that bad? Depends on whether you liked the Sergio Leone films. I liked \\"Faster\\" a lot.Fast-paced vigilante action, a drugged-up cop played very well by Billy Bob Thornton, a laundry list of people that are being killed to avenge the death of a brother, car chases, a very quirky hit man and his girlfriend, good cop/bad cop - this all ties together in an exciting movie about revenge and killing and the effects and aftereffects of both.I also enjoyed the alternate ending with the director's explanation. Both endings work - I enjoyed the alternate the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Dissapointed in this movie.I was expecting it to be way better since I like most of Dwayne Johnson's movies.Unfortunatly this is one of his worst.The movie was boring and I didn't like Dwayne's character.I guess it's not his fault but I do hope he get's better scripts in the future and get back to playing more likeable characters.The only good thing about this movie was the cool car.Only for hard core Dwayne Johnson fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've Been \\"Faster\\" Than What It Was","review":"Going into \\"Faster\\", I expected an 80's style action movie. What I got was a pretty boring crime drama, which is a genre I'm not a big fan of. There's a twist at the end that I found surprising, but that was the only surprise I got from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring-er!","review":"This movie was well below what I expected it to be. Big, buff, great actor like the Roc...his talent and physicality were totally wasted on this film. I've made it through about 40 minutes of the film and just had to turn it off. I may finish watching it today. Much of the beginning of the film covers the Roc walking around, with little to no dialog, shooting people then walking away. From the starting scene to about 30 minutes in, I think he says less than 10 words.The action sequences are all over the place. The storyline jumps around alot, and the movie just didn't flow like a typical action movie. Worst movie ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No menu or language list","review":"I rented it from Redbox and Family Video a couple of times and received both same results. No menu. No language menu I can access to for captioning or subtitle. And pix was freezing at times. Makes me wonder if the company made bad job on dubbing DVDs for this movie.

But I give the DVD makings a zero!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FASTER Does Not Mean Better","review":"**** Spoiler ahead ****- The action is the same as any other average action movies. It's neither better nor worse.- The acting is not engaging.- There are a couple of twists that keep me watching until the end.- There are some big logical holes that make this movie laughable. The worst is the shooting scene at the end. This was when Driver was shot in the head but he survived because of the metal sheet in his skull. He then stood up and killed the bad guy. Yeah!- In short, it's below average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I sent an E-mail two weeks ago telling you of my problems the tape didnt work they said they will send one out two weeks ago still havent got it.

The battery wouldn't hold a charge; the sound would cut in and out; static would drown out any sound for five seconds, even if I was standing right next to the base! On recommendation of a friend, I bought this Panasonic, and love it. Maybe its not 900 megahertz digital whatever, but the quality is there.

I'm sure it will be even more helpful when we are potty training her. My only complaint is that I find that it does slip around on the sheets and I have to keep tucking it in underneath the mattress. Other than that, it is great! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not wash/dry well, already torn","review":"I would not recommend this product. I have 2 of them as I have 3 year old twins. The sides you tuck in are EXTREMELY THIN and so unless you really get the sides tucked in tight under your mattress they slide around and you will need to reposition them every morning. The absorbency is okay to pretty good which is why I gave the product 2 stars. The worst is they do NOT wash well. Both of mine have tears where the pad portion meets the tuck in sides. The tuck ins are made of such a poor/thin material that I realized you could actually tear the stitching if you were trying to tuck them under the mattress! But this occurred in washing and drying. I wash and dry on permanent press as well. I would not buy these again. I bought them approx. 3 months ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting for my 5 year old","review":"My 5 year old can not read this yet, but loves it when I read it to him.

I was excited to read about what the parents learned in their training courses, but instead I read nothing but how long each session lasted, where they took place, and what the parents' remarks where.

Instead, they chose to keep their day jobs and make the music that they wanted to at their own pace, rather than on some schedule.Well, after waiting for quite some time, the fans are given this. Needless to say, it's good thing they didn't quit their day jobs, as they have proven to be substantially more lucrative than any music that they are currently putting out as a band (if that's what you call The Genuine Article, or anything with Weston singing on it).It's almost as if Shellac is SOOoooo uber-cool, that they're thumbing their noses at their fans now, knowing that we'll still buy it.

Steve Albini, with Shellac, has become parallel to just what he abhors most, a mainstream big label music group, who gives you an album with just one good song on it!

It's written by a guy who knows what he's talking about, given his education, years and years of living and working in Japan, and his involvement in foreign language enducation politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe the book lives up to its title","review":"I was assigned to read this several years ago as part of a Japanese culture class. Although the title looks promising, I did not find very much useful information in the book. Any of the insight into Japanese culture or language given in the book could was easily surpassed by the course's other reading requirements, including \\"Learning to Bow\\" and \\"The Accidental Office Lady,\\" which were also far more entertaining.I feel that the sub-title sums up the author's frequently arrogant tone of writing, inferring that this book will help one \\"Walk and Talk Like a Native Speaker.\\" After reading the book I felt that that title was nothing more than a marketing strategy to entice students and others seeking an understanding of Japan into buying the book.Unless this book is assigned as a reading requirement, I do not recommend getting it, especially for those considering the book because of its proud title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for true seekers","review":"This book is weak stuff.

I have yet to receive this refund. The delivery was also a major problem. There was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go. There was no way I could get this furniture in my house alone, so I tipped him to bring it in for me.

When I saw Phantom of the Opera was available, I jumped at the chance to add it to my collection. I was very disappointed when I put it in the DVD player. The quality was terrible! It was very dark, almost impossible to pick out any figures and filled with flashing white spots. As if that wasn't enough, IT WAS A SILENT FILM! No where in the discription of the movie did it mention it was silent. A very big disappointment!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad is an Understatement","review":"Caviat: The author does say that this book is to be used in conjunction with an instructor; a supplement. After I opened the box, I carefully took a sweep through the book, repackaged it and sent it back. The quality is poor in every aspect: layout, text, narration, printing and binding. It is a total waste for anyone even if you want to have one of everything in your library. This book CANNOT be used without an instructor....so why purchase it? It does nothing on its own. It is without merit. Get Kang Uk Lee's book on Tang Soo Do. It is as good as it gets for commonly available texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only way to learn...","review":"I have tried looking at tabs and sheet music (I am a 30+ year trained pianist and musicologist) and I have never been able to get from what's on the page to the sound of these old blues. This DVD works - you can sit there and watch Ernie's fingers as he takes apart the songs, you can rewind and look at each lick as much as you want, and get all the questions that the tab doesn't answer answered. (What chord are you fretting there? Which finger takes that note? How do you pick that?)Hawkins is very calm and mellow on the DVD. The songs are all the ones you want to play. Only one caveat: Hawkins plays the songs authentically, on a 12-string tuned down 4 half-steps (low bass note = C), so you can't play along with him on a regular 6-string guitar, unless you get all tuned-down and floppy. But that's OK - I just watch a section about 25 times, and then try to do it myself.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ernie Hawkins -Blind Willie McTell","review":"Ernie Hawkins presents and instructs well as well as being a v. fine guitar player himself. Perhaps its not strictly necessary to go into all the 12 string detail and retuning - which is difficult to follow anyway as he assumes a lot of the learner who is used to playing six srings - but it illustrates his reverence to the original and one can easily adapt. Not that interested in the bottle neck pieces, but first tunes are great, and as always, one benefits by being able not only to learn these McTell pieces but adapt bits and pieces and techniques to other tunes by MCtell and other artists, which I'm sure Hawkins would expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Pollard Fan, see the film","review":"I happen to be a huge Pollard fan and was watching this film, really enjoying the acoustic music and finding it oddly familiar, but couldn't put my finger on it until the bar scene where Pollard's voice is obviously singing in the background. This is a lovely soundtrack of short acoustic chord-based songs to accompany a great film, you need to see. The premise is a group of boring factory workers in a small town in Ohio where a murder takes place. The film is predictable, but well acted and thoroughly realistic in every meaningless dialogue. The music just takes it a step further. I will definitely buy the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"In-depth actor performance","review":"I first saw Xtro 2:The Second Encounter when looking for my favorite actor(Nicholas Lea who plays Baines).My first impression was Aliens ripoff, but as I watched it for the first time I saw a storyline which was different from aliens and had potential but sadly was neglected by second rate director Harry Bromley Davenport.

In view of all of the above, I sat down before my 32\\" tv, put the taped movie into the vcr, and prepared to watch a decent action movie -- I thought. I saw Jan-Michael Vincent in a couple of other movies since his character in \\"airwolf\\" and I think he should have quit after the series ended.

When I first ordered it I really didn't think the magnetic tip would be that big of a help but I was wrong. It really comes in handy at times. I also love the fact that it has print on both sides of the tape and how smooth the tape glides. Plus it is typical Milwaukee Tool ruggedness at it's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more from Milwaukee","review":"Very disappointed with this tape measure. The scale on the tape is inches/ feet on one side, and metric on the other. While it may seem a simple matter of moving the tape above or below the mark to measure in your preferred scale, it becomes a pain in practice; it would be far easier if both sides of the tape were in inches. The stop button on the tape is also not ergonomically placed. It is too high, causing me to juggle the tape a bit to get at it. The magnetic tip seems a good idea, but it is uncanny how many unwanted places it will attach itself to. It can be useful, but I found it annoying overall. I used a Big Johnson tape measure previously, which I managed to break, and it was miles ahead of this item both in the clarity of the scale on it, and the stop button. I would buy another Johnson tape measure but oddly, Amazon has dropped them from their availability list."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"This is an interesting video soundtrack and has been listened to a lot by me, Dave, Brinda's husband.

Carnival of the Animals is more joyful and energetic than ever, and the Firebird Suite is touching and soothing up untill the big \\"boom\\" which is bound to make you jump in your seat.

He discusses NOTHING about the origin of Seichim, and can't even decide whether to spell it Seichim or Seichem. (It varies from chapter to chapter). So, no origins, no discussion except a disdainful wave about the well accepted symbols of Seichim, and his invocations really only float if part of you is still tied to the Judeo Christian tradition--he invokes God the Father repeatedly.

Its characters were two-dimensional anduninvolving, and the mystery itself wasn't at all engaging. In fact,the resolution reminds me of a classic by recently deceased author, which I better not mention in case I might spoil it for those inclined to read Caudwell's book.One of the problems with this mystery is the series of letters from the young barrister, who behaves pretty idiotically throughout, and so engendered no sympathy or empathy from me. I find that the letters distance the reader from the crime itself, and lessen any suspense that might have been there to begin with.As for the writing style and dialog, I found it pretentious and almost Victorian in tone, which doesn't match very well with the modern setting.

The effect is one of eavesdropping on a table of people who are terribly, terribly pleased with themselves, and who are for some reason confident of their own wittiness. The book is detached, icy, passive, and infuriating.The mystery itself is ludicrous, one of those plots which could never occur in real life. Fortunately, if you make it to the end, as I did, you won't care enough about any of the characters to be upset.

I do not agree that the heavy use of synths makes the record sterile. Instead I think the synths and Cohens magic and magnificient blend and create a sound that is filled with sollace. The book-let is really nice. The cover is a little strange, but artistic without being annoying. The font sellected is easy on the eye and the font is easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"slip into your masterpiece","review":"Aside from a couple really cool songs like \\"Waiting on a miracle\\" I never knew much of this artist. For me, the rush of excitement came after renting the DVD \\"Leonard Cohen: I'm your man\\". Although the DVD was mostly full of musical fans doing horrendous covers, the glimpses gleamed of the monk-like Cohen were enrapturing.The music on this CD is lovely, strengthened immensely by Sharon Robinson. The lyrics deeply (yet simply) encompass the silence for those of us without a personal god.\\"You live your life as if it's real, A Thousand Kisses Deep.\\"\\"So come, my friends, be not afraid.We are so lightly here.It is in love that we are made;In love we disappear.Though all the maps of blood and fleshAre posted on the door,There's no one who has told us yetWhat Boogie Street is for.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was disappointed--felt like every song sounded the same & the cd is a bit depressing overall.

He is home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leonard Cohen Continues To Blow My Mind","review":"This is the best CD Leonard Cohen has ever done. All the songsare terrific, carefully selected, skillfully performed. I lovethis CD! Cohen just keeps getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back on Boogie Street","review":"Buy this album for track #1 and #9. It is essential Cohen, as in \\"Blue Raincoat\\" \\"Suzanne\\" etc. He has moved away from sex to chronicle the struggling chemical dependent. The rest of the CD is smooth listening with the addition of female voices making this one of the most mellow Cohen works to date. Nothing schitzophrentic here or in your face. Some of the songs blend together as just too damn similar, as if Cohen was trying to be too commercial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conspiratorial Confessions","review":"When the apocalypse finally comes, it won't sound like bombs bursting in air or any of those hoary old cliches. It's going to sound a lot like the conspiratorial confessions of Leonard Cohen: creamy smooth whisperings that soothe and attack in equal measure. On Ten New Songs, Cohen, recently back from a monastery, contemplates birth/school/work/death with eerie calm. On his 60's work, when he was in his 30's, he sounded weary. He's beyond that now, a voice reporting from the grave. His old folk settings have been replaced by cocktail electronica. The tinkling faux-jazz and r&b lite never distract from the grit of the songs. When he talks about \\"cardboard and piss\\" on \\"Here It Is\\", you can smell it. When \\"Love Itself\\" visits him, and deserts him then in \\"Alexandra Leaving\\", you first feel the warmth of new love and then, as he describes that eternal moment of parting, you feel a chill like never before."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun experiment","review":"Did you ever wonder what it would sound like if you took the great voice and lyrics of Leonard Cohen, hired a karaoke band to play the music, then time-traveled back to the early 80s to produce it?

I couldn't believe it was Cohen. My children, who love Cohen, had the same reaction. Each of the ten new songs sounds the same to me and it's not a fun kind of same. I should have previewed more of the tracks. Hopefully he will return to his normal self because his music is usually wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Romantic seed","review":"The man with the Romantic seed decided that he would release some more music, unoriginally titled Ten New Songs (buy hey look at his other titles as well). First thing that struck me was how backward looking, how dated, almost, this sounds - along the same lines as I'm Your Man - mainly because of the 80s style electronic drums. Of course Cohen's music has mainly been about old style singing and once again the master of the low does not disappoint. Ten New Songs is as good a record as he has released bar Love and Hate and Songs Of, the lyrics and mood growing with every listen. His best writing and voice was always likely to be in his early musical career but his style is becoming more and more original as people gradually start to look backward. It's a night record...is there a Zen element?But hey listen to it sinking down - observe and marvel at the way Cohen spent so much time on the words..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Number #10","review":"Some of the worst songs ever.Its not even worth a one.I listened to it twice ..this is dull, boring and depressing.I have been a fan since 1968.I would not recommend this for new fans .

I know that might sound pretentious, but how else to convey my experience of listening to songs like\\"Alexandra Leaving\\" (so deeply noble and heart-rending)and\\"Love Itself\\" (surely recounting an actual episode of transcendence, the language has the directness and mystery demanded by the ineffable).No other album has so caused me to hold my breath, figuratively and almost literally, as I quiet myself to allow the power of these whispered-sung intimacies to saturate my heart.Well, I've fallen into quite a bit of poetic reverie describing \\"Ten\\", but that's okay. My suggestion: If you areopen to art that gently but intensely touches deep emotional and metaphysical truths, or if you love Cohen or Zen, or if you conceive of yourself as on a Path, this album is--to use a cliche--a \\"must have\\".(And by the way, the melodies and arrangements are concise and wonderful)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not his best ever, but still something you need to own","review":"The old curmudgeon is mellowing, but he has not lost his edge. These songs are stripped down and elegant. Not as raw as The Future or as nicely orchestrated as the Live CD, but omg, who else sings with such soul? or writes lyrics with such intelligence? Any serious Cohen fan gotta own this. Anyone who is not a serious Cohen fan is missing something. Buy this one just for the beautiful vocal duet on Alexandra Leaving. The whole album will grow on you in a slow, insidious way, like the depression following a bad drunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soul Of Leonard Cohen","review":"I suspect if you are reading this review that you like Leonard Cohen and his type of music since he never has had a hit, and when I ask people if they know who he is I get the typical confused look. Since 1968, Cohen has been writing exceptional poetry and setting them to music. \\"Ten New Song\\" is his first studio cd since 1992's \\"The Future\\". In general, Cohen does not push the musical envelope more than he has on previous albums, but he does offer up what I think is a soulful sound. If Cohen can actually be soulful with his one note singing style. Yet, he pulls of the r&b nicely here with songs like \\"In My Secret Life\\", \\"That Don't Make It Junk\\", \\"Alexandra Leaving\\" and \\"Boogie Street\\". All ten songs are very well written, especially if you compare them to, say, Aerosmith's latest. The kind of music Cohen creates isn't for everyone, but what he makes he makes well. A good solid album, \\"Ten New Songs\\" should last us another 10 years until his next album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Speak...Leonard...","review":"This new disc is fine. I don't mind the backing vocalist, she has a very good smoothe voice. The backing arrangements are spartan but they work nonetheless. Leonard doesn't really sing per se, he sort of narrates or 'talk sings', this is fine too.He has a cool sounding voice. Why nothing really bowled me over on this disc, I do have a couple of favourites: A Thousand Kisses Deep, Here It Is and By The Rivers Dark. Sound quality is very good. You either like his style or you don't, I like it but I doubt I'd buy his whole catlog."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never find him on MTV. ( unfortunately )","review":"If you have never heard Leonard Cohen, don't expect hot musical tracks or a great singing voice. His style of background music which had always been minimal has been reduced to little more than a beat which our song meister seems to miss more often than he hits.The deep dark raspy voice has become deeper, darker and raspier to the point where it is sometimes hard to recognize a tune eminating from the artist's lips.From reading this review,some people may get the impression that I don't like Leonard Cohen's music. They would be wrong! In this collection of songs Mr.C. does what he does best. That is to use the poetry of words to create mental imagery which will transport you into the magical realms of the mind. Seldom does such a collection of music come along by a master poet at the height of his craft. If you prefer the power of the lyric voice to the power of a guitar amplifier, this is the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to be transported","review":"My friend who gave this to me advised that I not try to operate any heavy equipment or attempt any complicated tasks while listening to this CD because it \\"takes you somewhere else\\".It does."},{"rating":"2","title":"My #2 favorite from latter day Leonard.","review":"I am enjoying this album very much. I like the production value and I really like the lyrical changes and swells that lean inward while displaying outwardly. Leonard Cohen has landed in a place on this album that is a natural progression. From observation to pining to philosophical searching and yearning. This album is not folk. It is not rock. It is groove laden poetry sung with two shared voices.I think it is fantastic. I have been listening to it repeatedly now for weeks. I get it. It got me and I'm enjoying the fulfilling experience.If you are enjoying Leonard's LIVE in London CD. You will enjoy this tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear.","review":"I bought this album when it was first released, tried to listen to it once, groaned in disbelief and went back to the old stuff. I gave it a second spin today and still couldn't last out to the end. Compared with the earlier albums that could be beautiful, haunting, exciting, humerous and subversive, all at the same time, this one is just dreary to the power of ten, little more than a spoken-word recording of some new poems to a dreadful muzak background. I would have liked to listen to the poetry, as other reviewers have clearly managed to, but the whole thing just sounded so awful. How can a man who gave us Leaving Green Sleeves, Chelsea Hotel, Sisters of Mercy, Marianne and so many other wonderful - and wonderful-sounding - songs put his name to this dross?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a cohen album","review":"Dont get fooled this is not the real leonard.This is not his album neither.The major part belongs to mrs Sharon Robinson his back up singer for many years and i dont know why he is putting his signature to her songs.Here cohen sounds very light and meaningless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could just cry.","review":"After waiting all these years, Leonard finally came down from the mountain to deliver this mouse.

To be honest, when I looked at the playing side of the disc, I thought I had purchased a bootleg, a pirated copy of the original DVD release. Judging from the comments of other purchasers, however, I see that that isn't the case. If you must have this DVD, I recommend purchasing it from one of the dealers on Amazon who will sell it to you for less.

Regardless, it's a masterpiece - one that does not get the recognition it deserves. Shown on TV infrequently and never (as far as I know) screened at revival houses, this film works on all levels. Acting, directing, plot, dialogue, suspense, drama and even comedy. The ending is absolutely incredible. You'll be thinking about it for days.For those who have read the book (I have not), apparently Peter Ustinov does not play Capt. Veere as Melville might have intended. Still, compare his sytle, his delivery, etc to other performances of the era...it stands apart. It is, without question, a great acting job - and certainly does not bring down the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good concept but...","review":"I thought the concept was good and my kids think it's fun and hilarous, but I thought the durability and easiness to handle need work.

It's not easy to stuff the gooey's back in to play again and be able to close up the head. The gooey's have to be stuffed in just right or the head won't close.

At first Mr. Brautigam's playing seemed a bit brittle and aggressive, but I soon became accustomed to the sound and came to like the approach. There are plenty of lovely moments, too. Tempos tend to be quite fast. The period instrument used in this recording is lovely, but it is a fortepiano and not a modern grand. I have many recordings of these sonatas and like them all, but I think it may be this series more than any other that helped me to appreciate the genius involved in creating these masterpieces of the piano literature. My only reservation (and it is minor) is a certain sameness of attack in some of the faster movements, but various subtleties begin to reveal themselves as you listen.

It is put together correctly but we need to reinforce it every time we put her in it to make sure she is not injured. The monkey toy plays it's little song for about 3 seconds.... not long enough to hold the attention of a newborn, needs improving. Also, the third toy that hangs from the toy bar is a hard plastic ball, again, not safe while baby is in rocking mode as it has the potential to knock baby in the head, especially when the baby is learning to lean forward and hold there head up.

She weighes about 20 pounds and is now pulling herself up to a sitting position and I guess she reached for something and just flipped out. I would use the kick stand but I have a fear if she pushes back to far it will flip backwards. The only thing I can do is never leave her alone in it.Just be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for babies and toddlers at the same time!","review":"We love this rocker! We have a 3-month-old and a 15-month-old, and it's great for both of them. Our baby has used it since the day she came home from the hospital - it has a pretty steep recline and a kickstand if she's sleeping, or she can sit up and we can rock her if she's awake. The seat itself is very deep and pockets her very safely, so there's plenty of room to swaddle her in a blanket. She also loves the vibrations. Our 15-month-old loves it, too - he sits in it when the baby is not in it (I don't usually have the toy bar on it) and you can see that he enjoys being the \\"baby\\" for a few minutes. He loves rocking in it, too. He is very active and it has tipped backwards once or twice when he was climbing on it, but the little 8-inch \\"drop\\" was not enough to hurt him. We use this much more than the bouncy seat (Kick and Play). This is one of those truly necessary baby items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sensible product","review":"This is a good chair and is very affordable. We use it for our baby boy in the family room, and sometimes I put him in it while I take a shower. The toy bar can be attached or not, depending on your baby's mood. Our baby enjoys the vibrant colors and patterns. He also falls comfortably asleep in it. Since it converts into a toddler rocker, we are pleased to know that it will get years of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that impressed","review":"I bought this as a 2nd chair, because I got sick of lugging our first bouncy seat up and down stairs. Our baby just isn't nearly as impressed by this chair as she is with the Kick and Play Bouncer seat we also have. I hope she grows to like it as she gets bigger but right now it doesn't get much use."},{"rating":"2","title":"our baby loves his rocker!","review":"our baby loves to participate in his parents activities at home and we are able to move this rocker from room to room so that he can \\"help\\" Daddy work in the office or Mommy cook in the kitchen. Today he took a 3 hour nap in the rocker."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAZARDOUS ONCE BABY SITS ON OWN","review":"I thought that this was an awesome gift...and in the beginning it was. With the kickstand up, it gave my little girl a cozy small environment to lay in and nap.However, when she started sitting on her own was when the problems began. I would put the kickstand back so she could sit up more (all babies love to sit up stick straight at that age). One day, she went to reach forward, and to my horror and shock, the entire seat went forward with her. Fortunately I was right there and put my leg out in front of her and caught her...if I had not been in the room, her face would have slammed into pergo flooring. Fisher Price reps claim that they have never heard of this problem, but from reading other feedback here, I see that many many children have either face planted or almost face planted into the floor. Fisher Price needs to either ammend the instructions and state that the kickstand needs to be used until the feet can touch the ground or just recall this chair entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous - tips over with baby in it","review":"I have an 8 month old baby who loved to sit in the chair and play with toys. He leaned forward to get a toy from the floor and the chair flipped over with him pinned underneath. He ended up with a big bruise and two black eyes. Fisher price offered a refund and ups pick up, BUT explained it is ONLY INTENDED for a child who can not sit up or a child who is big enough to climb in and out without needing the harness. Fisher Price was not surprised by the incident."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS!!","review":"I bought this when my daughter was only 3 months old and it was fine. But when she started sitting up at 5 months, she reached forward to grab a toy that was on the floor directly in front of her seat and tipped it forwards. I saw when it was about to happen but by the time I reached her, she had landed on her head still strapped in with the seat on top of her. As you can imagine, I freaked out and now I only put her in with the bottom part out. And even then, I still don't trust it because I know if she stries to stand up, it will tip backwards. I read the reviews of others giving this a 5 star rating and I wonder, WHAT ARE THEY THINKING? So I just wanted to put in my 2 cents. Just be careful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love them","review":"I received this rocker as a baby gift for my first child. She is now 4 yrs. old and is still using it.

I love them and my girls love \\"their\\" rockers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money on a better product","review":"I thought this would be a really nifty thing to have, but it is BORING! There is stuff that the baby can look at, and it vibrates, but it isn't very interactive. There are other products out there that light up and play music when the baby kicks his feet. This is basically just a rocking chair with some stuffed animals hanging from it. Spend your money on a better product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Others are definitely better","review":"At first this chair seemed to be agood idea. Whenever my infant son was fussy we would place him in the chair and turn the vibrating chair on. However, this chair does not rock very well at all and my son never played with the overhanging toys. Reading other reviews of how children are falling face first this chair will not be around long enough for my son to that. There are better chairs out there, even some by Fisher Price. My son really loves the kick and play bouncer. It's more interactive and vibrates also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it!","review":"We had a regular little bouncy seat and when our daughter started leaning from side to side, I was always afraid she would fall out or tip over. So I bought this rocking chair... what a life saver!! She seems very secure in it. She takes naps in it, I've used it as a feeding chair, and she loves the toys (especially the monkey). She doesn't seem to like or dislike the vibrate feature. She is very content to sit in the chair as I do dishes or make dinner. And I love the fact that we can get a few years use out of it, compared to just a few months that most other toys/gear seem to provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT for my 9month old!","review":"This is a great chair. I also had another bouncer that I loved but due to my sons weight I had to go up to something more secure and this was perfect he is now 9months old and 22lbs, 19 inchs long. He loves it and the best part of it is that he can use it for months to come! great feeding chair also! This chair will not tip over....my son has leaned complety over to try to pick a toy up and it did not fall forward!COMPLAINT: could use more padding around rim of chair...my son seems to like to rock himself and when he forces himself back to rock his head has hit the metal bar that has no cusion. We since have kept a soft blanket over chair for padding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"When we brought home our new baby this chair was the only place she liked to sit. I think part of it had to do with how the sides curled up around her - keeping her safe and warm. Now that she is three months, she loves to sit in it and look at the toy bar and play. I think as she get's older - we will really enjoy how this chair grows with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent and Fun","review":"Our baby loves her bouncer since she was born. I used to lay her there so she could take her naps when she was a month old, the seat has 2 positions as well as you can set it up to be a rocker or like a hammock.Need to be careful when the baby is able to sit because if it placed on the rocker position and the baby starts to pulling herself to the front, she could trip over and hurt herself. This has not occurred to our baby, but we try to be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lysie's mom","review":"I really liked this seat for my baby. She was able to get it to rock by kicking her feet when she was still pretty young and it was the only way I got to take a shower or go to the bathroom until just recently (she is a little over one). Unfortunately I can't let her use it now unless I am right next to her or she is strapped in and the brake is on. She rocked it too far forward the last time she was in it and almost did a face plant on the floor. If she isn't strapped in she thinks it is lots of fun to climb on. I am sure she will be able to use it again in the next few months when the novelty of climbing has worn off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for baby","review":"Baby wasn't interested in it at first...preferred bouncer. The vibrations aren't near as strong as the bouncer, but once baby got older, she really loved grabbing the toys. Hope she still likes it when she's a toddler.I'm editing this now that she's 18 months, and she loves this chair!!! She loves to sit in it and rock her baby dolls, and she loves it for a TV chair. Great Chair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A chair that will last.","review":"I have to say the only thing i do not like about this chair is the toy bar. My son, now 3 months old is starting to reach for things and he cannot reach the toys and he gets frustrated. I wish that the bar was adjustable to bring them a little closer. WE bought this chair over other chairs after seeing my niece grow up with her chair, she is now 4 yrs old and still sitting in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I received this as a gift and it's wonderful. After a while my baby lost interest in the toys, but it still serves it's purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby fell on her head!","review":"I think that the packaging is very misleading. If I had known that my 7 month old couldn't be in the chair, I wouldn't have bought it. As far as \\"well it says adult supervision required\\" a 7 month old can lunge forward quicker than my pregnant body can move. If my baby was injured, and I filed a lawsuit, I guarantee I would win based on the misleading packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Boucer","review":"DS really loves the boucer. He likes the toys. They can either go overhead or on the chair with velcro. The strips are big enough that I can attach several of his toys to it. He doesn't seem to like the vibration of it. He'll take a nap in it or just sit in it while I do dishes or we eat dinner. It's to large to take places. I throw it in the trunk of my car when one of his Grandmas baby sit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!","review":"I received the rocker before my son was born and since he was born, we've used it for him to take naps in, read to him in it before bed, and play in...it's great! Now that he's 5 mths old, we make sure he's belted in so he doesn't slide out as he's more mobile now. It's a great product, easy to watch and you can attach so many other toys to the bar overhead...it's GREAT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the first couple of months","review":"My daughter is now 3 1/2 months old and is bored with it. I bought it when she was about a month for a seat for her to sit up in but now she whines when I sit her in it and attach the bar. It's just not doing enough for her. I have the seat adjusted to the closest position for her to sit up in and she still is trying to lift up to sit up more. Also the toys are not great at all. The only one she'll look at or play with is the monkey because it plays a tune but a very short tune so you have to keep pulling it to hear the noise. It's also starting to rip at the seems I guess where I've been pulling it to hear the tune. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't purchase this infant seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, if your kid will sit in it.","review":"My triplets sat in this for the first fwe months. about 7 months they started screaming whenever they were in it. The reason? They were now able to sit up and they wanted to be where they can move and play. Babies this age are meant to be up and playing, not sitting in a chair, thats why most bouncers won't hold them past 20 lbs. Now they they're 2 years old, they'll sit in them again to watch tv and stuff, but they've got other chairs for that too.I'm not a kid. I have to use this form because I have no credit card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe Product","review":"I have been using this chair for 1 year and have loved it until today.

I registered for another bouncer/chair and received it, but bought this one for my mother's house..well needless to say -- its at my house now and I use it everyday.

I wish I could tell every new mother about this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for growing infants!","review":"I bought this product when my 5 month old daughter had outgrown her bouncer. She is now 7 months old and loves her rocker. She plays with the toys on the toy bar and watches Rolie Polie Olie in her rocker. I have had no problems with her flipping the chair over and didn't have any problems putting it together.The only complaint that I have at this time is that it doesn't really rock. I would recommend this to any new mother, it will be an excellent chair for our next baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Variation of a bouncer seat","review":"My son broke his favorite Aquarium bouncer and I purchased this seat as a replacement. He absolutely loves this seat. It grows from newborn all the way through toddler making it a good investment. He is seven months old, 24 lbs and sitting up. This seat is reclined at an angle so that he can lift himself up to a sitting position and look around without tipping the seat over. It is great to help those little muscles develop. It is also good because it is designed to hold a heavier child so it is very durable. He thinks he is just big stuff and I really like how easy it was to assemble and how much he enjoys the patterns and toys! He sits in it more than he does on my lap! It also vibrates which he likes as well. I highly recommend for all ages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The hanging toys are boring!","review":"My daughter received this as a present when she was 3 months old, she now is 8 months old. She never really liked it. She would play in it for a short time but that was it. We put more interesting hanging toys on it and she seemed to like it better. I hope she likes it more when it is just a plain rocker for when she gets older. Buy something else :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good afterall","review":"We received this chair as a gift in our baby shower. I moved out of the US when my baby had three weeks, and we finally got the chair when he was two months old. The first thing that did not work was the vibration panel, we checked batteries and all, but it just did not vibrate, it only produced a strange noise.However, we still loved the chair because our son looked comfortable and happy on it, and he loves to be put on it to watch videos. However, since he learned to sit straight he also discovered that he can pull his torso down, so I've found him three times screaming, with his hands on the floor and half of his body tied to the chair. I am putting some books on the legs of the chair to keep it stable, I just think that this chair does not work well when children learn to sit straigh. Any suggestions to solve my problem?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to use after a bouncer","review":"My outgrew the bouncer early and we had a hard time finding someonething that would work.

It was very easy to assemble. But once I sat her in it, I thought \\"oh my what a bummer\\".Although the toys on the toy bar are cute, they are not easy to reach at all. The positions of the seat itself are only good for lying down, and they the baby cant reach the toybar either. But even in the so called sitting up position, its still hard for the baby to reach the toys. ALSO, THE TOYS DONT STAY SECURE. They attach by velcro and if the baby pulls too hard, (which doesnt have to be hard at all) The toys come off of the toy bar.It seems to be comfortable for her though. I suggest getting some of those links to attach to the toy bar so the toys hang down lower, but keep an eye on them so they dont hit themself in the face when the toys come flying off of the bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babies of all ages seem to love it!","review":"Before the baby was born the toddlers would play in the chair and try and rock in it(they are still to short for that toddler rocking chair) The baby seems to like the rocking and vibrating at once which is nice since I haven't gotten a swing for him yet and the toddlers still sit in it when its reclined and the stand is holding it up and they fall asleep in it! It's nice that it can hold their weights as well as the infant and one of the toddlers is a big boy(in the 90th percentile for height and 80th for weight) so he actually did fall once when he tried to climb in it at the top so just be careful if you have hyper toddlers who try to climb on everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 yo STILL loves hers!","review":"We bought this for my 3yo when she was a few months old. She loved sitting in the chair because it allowed her to do so many things from a new perspective before she was sitting up on her own (This was the original chair that didn't have a toy bar attached)--we would sit her in front of her Sparkling Symphony gym (which I also highly recommend) and she was happy for at least an hour (quite literally!)Now that she's going to be a big sister soon we're going to buy the newer model for our newbie since our daughter is STILL loving the chair (she sits in it as a rocker to watch her videos and read books) so that they'll each have their own special chair.Only 4/5 stars because our daughter wasn't crazy about the vibrating--though that could just be her preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't have a baby without it . . .","review":". . . Especially if you have a toddler, as well. I had two bouncie seats, both of which I got out again when our 2nd baby was born (and our 1st was 16 mos old). The older one kept sitting in the bouncie chairs and bent the seat part so much I couldn't put the new baby in it -- it was like she was standing up! So when I came across this chair that holds up to 40 lbs. I had to get it. The older baby sits in it all the time. I can tuck the straps away so quick for her and get them out again just as quick when I want to put the baby in it, I don't know what I would do without it!

I recently purchased the seat because I thought it was appropriate for my son until he was 40 lbs. (and his other bouncer seat had a 20 lb. weight limit) but obviously it is not safe. I am discontinuing use of this seat immediately and am very disappointed that Fisher Price would not test this seat to ensure safety. I would not recommend this seat to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous & Disappointing!","review":"After using this seat for just 4 months, some of the small parts (screws & bolts) have started to fall off already!

We have another bouncy seat that gets just as much use and it is holding up fine + has no small (dangerous) assembly parts.Do not buy this seat!

As far as tipping, only you know your baby best, and my son does not use the chair now while he is so interested in pulling up and crawling. He will not sit still for a minute and I would not trust him off of the floor right now. This chair has a kickstand to prevent frontal tipping. I will begin to use it again when he is ready for an elevated seat.

So I bought this one to accomodate a bigger child. He hated it. I don't know if it was uncomfortable to him or what, but he could not stand being in there, and the toys were very disappointing and boring to him. I tried rocking him in it, and the rocking was not very smooth and he did not like that either. As he got a little bigger I thought he would like it as a chair, but instead he would try to climb on it, and stand on it. This for us was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!

She takes naps in it all the time, and when she's extra cranky, I just plop her in it, turn on the vibration, give it a few rocks, and she's calm!!

My son couldn't reach the toys on the bar until he was 6 months old. This led to much fustration on his part. The seat isn't very interactive, in hindsight I wish I would have gotten a seat that responded to his movements. The only thing I like about this seat opposed to other infant seats is the kickstand. This allows a very young infant to be completly reclined so their head doesn't slump forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Buy","review":"We got this as a gift and I was hesitant about its use at first but now I see it definitely has a purpose in our home. Our baby sits in it happily while we eat dinner. She also enjoys the mobile. In fact when she played with that mobile it was the first time we saw her play. The vibration is not exactly a thrill for our baby so we leave it off. I also wish the item folded down a bit more for travel, but it is certainly easier to travel with than her swing, so we endure because its a great item to take when you are visiting friends and family for dinner or chatting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It! Love It!","review":"We bought this chair for our son when he was 5 months old. He had already outgrown his bouncer chair and this was looked fun. He loved it from the minute we put him in it. I don't really recommend it though when your child starts learning how to sit. Our son is 7 months old now and all he wants to do is sit upright. If we do put him in his chair, we always strap him in and are nearby. He loves the toys and the fact that they can be changed is wonderful.

It worked well...ofcourse it isn't intended for feedings. :O)Now that my baby is 8 + months we will put it aside since when he sits up forward and reaches it will fall forward.

The Deluxe Take Along Swing don't do that.Martha, NYC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Practical","review":"The selling point to this item is that it is both an infant bouncer and a toddler rocker. As a bouncer, it is simply too big. An infant bouncer should be small and light enough to carry the baby around in and to place onto a table for feedings. The toy bar looks deceptively like a carry handle. However, any attempt to lift it by the toy bar will result in the toy bar detatching. That scares me. It seems great as a toddler rocker, but it is a stretch to combine two items into one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other reviewers are right- this product is dangerous!","review":"This product should be recalled- I'm apalled it hasn't been yet.

I had triplets 15 weeks premature and this chair has been a lifesaver! It reclines enough that you can put a very small baby in it. We used this in the NICU when my daughter was 3 pounds. The toy bar now keeps them entertained so I can get things done. You can put one baby in the chair and rock it with your foot while you take care of another baby, fold laundry, eat... I also love how this can be used as a chair as they get older. With triplets you learn to love the toys that can be used for more than a few months.

Not recommended for active child and not a toddler as the company claims. I called Fischer-Price and they sent me a Postage Paid label and they will send me a refund. The company was great about it.Try another chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe","review":"My son was 8 months old when he was strapped in the chair playing. He pulled a toy off the toy bar and dropped it on the floor. When he reached forward to see the toy on the floor the chair flipped over. He fell face forward the the tile floor with the chair on top of him. He got a bloody nose. I reported the problem to Fisher Price and I feel that the customer relations department did not handle the problem with any concern. If an infant can cause the chair to flip how could it be safe for a toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNSAFE - BEWARE","review":"This chair is not designed properly. A small child that leans forward can tip the chair over causing serious injury to themself. I do not see how this company can market this product as it is so unsafe! I have always been worried for my baby while she was in this chair, and after a near accident, I stopped using this. Furthermore, the seat area has very little padding and your baby is sitting on a flat board - how comfortable do you think that is for them? Other reviewers also point out this saftey problem but seems like most people are not concerned with their childs safety and buy this anyway. Do yourself a favor and look to buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on target","review":"This is a great product. I found it to be very easy to sight in my Wincester 1300 Ranger with these sights. I had it shooting dead on the bullseye in 7 shots. The illumination in the woods is execllent!

It was delivered promptly and in a nice box. I liked it so much I wore it for my wedding! The image does not show the rest of the chain--which is a sort of fine box-chain. One star off because I would have preferred a smoother-looking chain to fit the polish of the front of the necklace, and because the sapphires were not quite perfectly set (although you could only tell with close scrutiny). A very good value for price and I would certainly buy similar items from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Good but more negatives than positives for me","review":"Pros: Good sound and fairly easy to use; unit looks nice; remote control; sleep feature- can fall asleep to radio or IPOD. Wake feature- awake to radio or IPODCons: PLEASE believe me...display is WAY TOO BRIGHT for use as a bedroom clock-even at the \\"dim\\" setting. There is an alarm setting but no snooze button- this is advertised as a table radio NOT an alarm clock; you can use station presets but only access them from the remote; when the radio or IPOD is used for alarm- be prepared to get blasted out of bed-lowest setting is a 10. It ramps up the volume when the alarm goes off but it happens so fast it's still quite a shock.Great for \\"table radio use\\" Not so good for clock radio use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might Not Be for the Bedroom","review":"I agree with the reviews written so far about the GR-10iOn the plus side:*great sound*integrates well with the iPod*well-designed remoteNegatives:*has a very bright display that may not be appropriate for the bedroom as it is fairly bright and might not work well for light sensitive sleepers*drab color*non-intuitive station presetsThe GR-10i does seem better built than the iHome and definitely has better sound.

I have tried almost every ipod speaker/clock-radio available in the market this side of BOSE and this baby beats them hands-down in clarity, depth, richness and price. I just love pretty much everything about it especially the convenience of having a full function remote control. My only grouse is with its size, which is a little too big for the nightstand but since we didn't buy it for the nightstand, we are fine with it. The other issue is the build quality. A few days after the purchase, the onboard volume control started acting up. (only increases irrespective of which way you turn it) But since the remote has volume control i am not too bummed about it. Other than that, it is a sure winner. I don't know what that other guy is talking about when he says it hisses or whatever. He probably has a bad unit and should just get a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, TEAC does not honor warranty from this seller!","review":"This radio broke and will not function at all after in the 10th month.

It's doesn't deserve one star but I couldn't give it less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Purpose, Authenticity and Passion","review":"Reading this book was like listening to someone moan about the subject. It felt to me like the author had somehow been forced to write about the voice, whilst really wanting to write about something else. There are certainly some interesting facts, and some myths expelled. But for me, there was no passion, and also little sense of the author having any real experience of working with the voice. Imagine someone who does no physical exercise at all writing a book about the amazing human body and you will get some idea of what this book was like for me. A kind of flat essay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly disappointing","review":"It would be hard to express how irritating this book is. The human voice is indeed an amazing instrument, but it is ill-served by the pop sociology, psychobabble, and profound disrespect for science contained in this book (along with a number of errors of fact). A good work of popular science should find the interest in \\"dry\\" scientific findings and make them accessible to a broader audience, not disparage them in favor of man-in-the-street opinions. I suggest Ms. Karpf rein in her adjectives and look harder for what science has to offer in her future works. She will produce a more readable, more interesting product if she does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This product has been a lifesaver. I highly recommend it! It works well to control those night sweats before your period. It balances your hormones. I don't feel cranky or moody before my period anymore. It also helps control bloating before your period. I also take 2-1,000mg capsules of evening primrose oil and 1 capsule of black cohosh for 2 weeks before my period. My PMS is GONE! NO MORE PMS!!! Ladies, give this product a try along with these recommended supplements and you'll be glad. I guarantee your PMS will be totally under control. It has totally changed my life.

It hit me hard! It was a record hot Oklahoma summer anyway and I was miserable. After spending the entire summer alternating my days and nights between hot-flashes and night-sweats I came across this product on the internet. I have always looked for natural healing remedies before visiting a doctor and have never had regrets. This time was no exception. The information given said to allow 2 weeks to notice any difference. In 2 DAYS I was virtually symptom free!!

I started having hot flashes last year and I bought the \\"New Phase\\" supplement which worked great for a year, but this March my hot flashes intensified and they stoped working. I bought the cream with high hopes of finding some relief, oh well! I will try the Bio-Identical Hormones that I found online, they are more costly, but I'm desperate. Summer is just around the corner and I need HELP! It may work for some of you, but you won't know till you try, Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emerita Phytoestrogen did not work at all","review":"I was desperately needing this product to work. After 3 weeks of habitually applying twice daily.....nothing. Not one of my symptoms were affected and I continued to suffer. Symptoms were terrible vaginal itching and burning and constant pain around that whole region.

I had quite a few, so I started researching solutions and decided to try this cream. It fixed me within a day. Seriously. A day. I've been using it now for a couple of weeks and I feel GREAT!!

I then stopped using the phyoestrogen and all my negative results stopped. I went off for a week and then resummed usage once a day, my hot flashes returned and the weight gained started again. I went completely of this product and all the negative symtoms stopped again. I had used natural progesterone creme before and during my use with phytoestrogen.

Well the \\"hencho in China\\" should have warded me away...no quality control parameters at all. The handle is design around the basic collet idea, problem was that the I.D of the threaded handle and the O.D. of the brass thumb screw were not to complimentary specifications and they simply didn't mate together...hence, I couldn't tighten the chosen bit into the handle.

And that shines through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter takes it to the next level","review":"Peter White's \\"Glow\\" is extraordinary! Stunning! Every track is a listening pleasure. Pedro Blanco, in particular, is smoooooth and elegant. Listen to \\"Glow\\" at home. Better than yoga for stress reduction. Listen in the car. The road rage will exit your body. Listen at work.

I will not buy this one..thank for the review..."},{"rating":"1","title":"smooth jazz? I think not!","review":"I liken smooth jazz to \\"syrup\\" jazz. Too much of it makes you sick. Well, at least Peter White doesn't pretend he's playing jazz. What he has been playing for the past 3 albums is sickly sweet instrumental music, and it gets to you even if you are a fan (I have all his solo albums). There's nothing in his latest offering that will excite you if you clamour for some of his brilliant solos or compositions which you'll find on the Al Stewart albums or his first two solo albums. Still, as elevator music, his latest album is listenable unlike Larry Carlton's latest, Deep Into It which sounds uninsipred and mechanical.I hate this smooth jazz business; perhaps these guitar players should take a holiday and come back with a \\"good\\" guitar albuminstead of going through the motions to put out an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music of past artists Repeated","review":"I was given peter white's cd by a co-worker as birthday present.

My wife and I couldn't get through it. The acting is wooden and flat, not that the script gives the performers much to work with. A lot of it seems like vaudeville -- Alice runs into a character and becomes the straight man (girl) for a not-very-funny routine. The visual effects are not even good for their time, in that the original King Kong came out the very same year. Add to that the fact that the DVD transfer is poor, with a print full of scratches and poor contrast.

Not having seen it since, I wondered how I would react to it as an adult. Without whiz-bang special effects or foreboding music, this film still can give me the creeps when watching live flamingos used as croquet mallets and talking pudding. It also can be amazingly funny. The Humpty Dumpty sequence seems like it was written for W.C. Fields. And who would expect to see Cary Grant weeping his eyes out in a giant turtle suit or Gary Cooper dim wittingly falling off a horse? You will not find this film cloying or even endearing.

The Alice is actually very good if by necessity older than ideal.I believe Cocteau drew on this or the other way around or both ways. \\"Belle et Bete\\" has some of this feel, very very similar. I do wish the UCLA 90 min. print were used, whatever the excuse. Perhaps the French or BFI will put out the complete version for those of us with all-region players.

For instance, many cookbooks recommend cooking a custard until it coats the back of a spoon, but when is that? Is it at 160 degrees Fahrenheit, or 180? This book spells it all out, and it does so with helpful illustrations.It puts the Ben and Jerry's book to shame, both in terms of quality of product and with its no-nonsense practical recommendations. Nevertheless, the average cook may wish to plan in advance when preparing any of these recipes, as they are quite time-consuming.Having used the book to prepare about five different kinds of ice cream so far, I can safely say I've had the most success with the simple chocolate ice cream recipe.

It still doesn't qualify as a real restoration of these films, but it is very watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great selection of Marino Marini","review":"This is a great re-release.

Not too complicated.I tried this with a (new) pack of Bicycle playing cards, and although it does seem to shuffle correctly (i.e., with an apparently-random mixing of cards from the left and from the right), it doesn't work reliably.

As it is I would not recomennd it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless.","review":"The beauty of the original \\"Dummies\\" books was that they presented useful information in plain English -- with the bonus of a fun, irreverent tone. This author, unfortunately, has concentrated on tone (which he alone thinks is clever), at the expense of organization and helpful information. Many basics aren't even covered -- for example, how to add unique (not repeated) fields, how to set up pop-up menus. Yet he spends an inordinate amount of time non-Filemaker topics like the basics of organizing (which he didn't follow in the book) and why databases are useful (which the reader probably already knows, after spending $200 on the program). My opinion: not worth the paper it's printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, not helpful, unorganized","review":"I found this book to be extremely confusing in its layout and organization.

To me, the picture quality of the discs that I have seen so far are all the same. I did not feel that Wrath of Kahn looked any better than Voyage Home or Undiscovered Country.

I like the enhancements to STMP - The Director's Cut, but I didn't like that they took the computer voice out of it! That's how a starship should be run, motly by computer! Also, the theatrical version is the one I waited for as a kid and was so amazed by when I saw it.

I won't buy these until they issue the director's cuts on blu ray. It would be nice if they would do both in the same package. Release each movie seperately like they did the dvd versions a few years back, give us the same extras, that's fine, but give us the director's/Tv versions too in high def. That's all I ask."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Agree With Gemas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Paramount is the worst. This release is just a thrown together bunch of crap to collect money from trekkers. Face it fellow Federation Members until we unite and stop buying these travesties they will keep rolling merrily along picking our pockets as long as they can. A blu-ray release should include everything we deserve as loyal Star Trek customers who have shelled out hundreds if not thousands each over the years and that means re-mastered theatrical and extended releases with all the extras thrown in. These Paramount Pirates obviously adhere to the Ferengi Rule of Acquisition which states: Sell the sizzle and NOT the steak - and then sell it again - and again - and again - as long as the rubes keep coming back.

(but they should have included both cuts wiht seamless branching)but what really gets me is the quality of the video on this. it really looks bad. go to www.avsforum.com and see the screen captures for yourself. it's certainly an improvement over the dvd, but it's still really bad for blu ray.i'll wait for the inevitable re-release...hopefully the jump in quality will be comparable to the jump from the original dvds to the 2-disc special editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Blu-Ray Quality","review":"The movies are great ... this transfer to blu-ray is not. It is a shame to even call these Star Trek movies on blu-ray because they have not been enhanced to match the high-def quailty blu-ray provides. Save your money ... or better yet ... buy the First Season of the original Star Trek series on blu-ray. The entire season is enhanced, even the music re-recorded, graphics enhanced ... a true work of art restoring the entire season. Whatever \\"bean counter\\" executive decided to release these Star Trek movies WITHOUT enhancing the films to match the enhanced technology of blu-ray should be fired. Releasing these great films to look ordinary on an extrordinary format shows no understanding of sci-fi, technology or the fan base. ...and by the way ... even the packaging is cheap and began falling apart the day after I got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again......","review":"This sucks, the movies I would give 5 stars, but come on, this is blu-ray it should be so much better, I would like to see a complete Blu-ray Collection of all 10 films, all fully restored, all with the original theatrical release, the extended cut, and the directors cut ext.......Blade Runner got it right, what an epic Blu-ray Collection.

Otherwise, this is a perfect package!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are in fact HD!","review":"The cat's out of the bag on this but I want to help raise the rating on this excellent blu-ray collection. I own these films and will state again: YES, these films are all HD-- some of the best HD I've seen at times (esp. part 3). There are moments where the picture gets a touch soft, and there are also moments of edge enhancement and banding, but these discs are without a doubt, honest-to-goodness HD. The packaging is incredibly unclear on this point but rest assured, it's as high-def as any blu-ray. If you're a fan but on the fence, relax. Buy this set and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD set of the original Star Trek movies","review":"This set of Star Trek movies have sharp and clear movie picture quality most of the time, but I have noticed that occassionally there are some group of pixels that sort of flash (come and go) on the screen as if the picture didn't have solid color depth in the affected areas. I have never viewed a DVD movie that did that before, but overall the movies are very good. I considered buying the Blu Ray version, but didn't because nowhere in the Blu Ray version description does it say that the movies are 1080P quality.

This Blu-Ray edition is superb in every aspect except for one: \\"The Wrath of Kahn\\" is, I think, inferior to the previous DVD version so far as the picture. It looks like too much editing was done and ended up with color over-saturation. Guess I'll keep the DVD version of that one.

HOWEVER, I only noticed after I opened the wrapping that right on the box itself in tiny font on the bottom, it says that \\"*Previously released content is presented in Standard Definition\\". THAT'S RIGHT, THE MOVIES ARE IN STANDARD DEFINITION, AND IT SAYS SO ON THE BOX IN TINY FONT. WHO WOULD THINK TO CHECK THIS WHEN BUYING BLU-RAY DISCS?!?!?

If you are looking for some of the extra stuff not in the theatrical release (as many Star Trek Fans may be) then don't buy this set. Spend more money. For me though, the cuts that they made for the theatrical release do not stop me from enjoying these movies as I also enjoyed them in the theater.Why only 4 stars? It's not quality related since the quality is good. The 4 stars is only recognizing that some people may be looking for the directors cut.

I did everything I could to fix it like wiping the disc with a soft cloth and blowing it but nothing helps. I would've given it a five star, but the disc is the issue and I wanna return this product back. So far I only saw Star Trek 1 & 2, but the third didn't do so well.

Almost every fine detail is lost due to this heavy digital processing. Faces look like wax figures from Madame Tussaud's.The transfers seem to be based on the 2001 remasters. In addition to that, Star Trek IV, V and VI seem to be old interlaced transfers derived from old 1080i transfers.

It was difficult to start; L&G is a very sweeping book whose narrative runs from the protagonist's childhood up through his adulthood and bounces around in between. It's supposed to be the story about his affair with an artist and his attempt at making a meaningful life in Communist Prauge, but it covers so much more: censorship, marriage, familial relationships, work. I've read it again since college and appreciated it all the more. How do we make our lives new? How do we make love work?

The mop pad picks up and scrubs the floor better than the wetjet or o-mop did. I just spray my cleaning solution onto the surface and then mop. I just love the fact these are washable which means no more waste. The pole is telescopic so it fits your height. It's lightweight and easy to store. I bought more of the pads both dry and wet.

Who wants a seam on the bottom of their heel. At that point I frogged and did it my way.

Even if none of the potential descriptions in this book rings true for a particular dream (and the book recognizes that the meaning of a symbol can change), what is provided is often an excellent trigger for seeing other possibilities. Using this book has also helped me make that step to not just understanding the individual symbols in my dreams, but to be able to piece them together to form a coherent message.

The downside is that it is very hard to get the stages apart without the command module and the 3rd stage separating (even for an adult)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy but needs redesign","review":"I have to agree with several other reviews of this toy: It it WONDERFUL for a kid who is into space exploration, but there are some definite design flaws that should be addressed. My 4 year old son's rocket is difficult for adults to take apart and put back together, and it is also fragile - the hinges at the top have broken off completely even though he is very careful with it. He has been most dissapointed by the countdown mechanism not working any more. Within a couple month's after we got it, it stopped reliably doing a count down and now does so only intermittently.

Do not get this rocket if your child is under 6, it is not made for them. I think this rocket is perfect for kids over 6 because it is very educational and if you handle it right you won't break it. Some of the great features of this rocket are that it is SUPPOSE to break apart and that adds to the fun of it. Also, there is a book that tells you how the rocket works, a launch pad, and a piece of the moon for the lunar module to land on.

Unfortunately, this release is the latter, which is a shame because I've actually seen a few shows where his singing was really strong compared to his usual decent performance. Once one of the golden throats of rock, he just didn't take care of himself like contemporaries like Glenn Hughes, and sadly, it shows. When he sings the classics, it sounds like a different vocalist.

I hang 2 bars in our kids bath so that I can pull back the decorative curtain yet still be able to keep an eye on the kids while protecting the rest of the room from splashing- but if thats not a concern you can put both curtains on the same hooks. I'm not trying to be sarcastic or harsh- I guess it could be difficult to see thru the clear panel with all that clear liner in the way....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This shower curtain is great. The colors are wonderful. I had to go to a couple different Targets to find it, but I did! The only problem is the curtain is fabric and there is no inner lining, which lets the curtain get soaked. I hot glued the bottom 3/4 of a clear shower curtain to the fabric swell curtain from the bottom of the clear window down. It works beautifully now with no soaking wet fabric curtain. This method also allows the fabric curtian to stay outside of the shower while the vinly one can be in the shower.

It is mad annoying. The story of the game isn't explained until you beat it which doesn't take long at all if your good at adventure games. This was a poor excuse for a Kirby game.

And he's not the only one. Seek out Francesco Albanese, Raoul Romito and Francesco Daddi.If Bocelli were not handsome, were not a romantic figure for the obstacle he had to overcome, and were he not pimped by a major record lable, he'd be singing for tips in Piazza Novona and not attracting much attention.

It works a lot better. The first one only produced sharp results on the right edge of the frame. The replacement zooms more smoothly, and has typical better center than edge sharpness especially at 200mm. The 55-100mm sharpness is very, very good and although the 200mm is a little soft wide open, it gets much better a stop or two down.Recommended... if you get a correctly assembled lens. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Lightweight Budget Telephoto","review":"Biggest asset is its incredibly light weight. My f/1.4 50mm prime is heavier than this, and although that is partly a matter of plastic vs metal construction, having a lens that equals 300mm on digital barely weigh anything at all is great. Speaking of plastic, the construction is durable, even in the steamy rains of a Costa Rican jungle. The VR does wonders in cutting down on grain and noise, and in daylight and cloudy conditions, the image quality is amazing. However, these things increase when the sun goes down, and then you are almost required to use flash (which I try to avoid.) In addition, this is not a fast lens by any means. Shooting futbol/soccer games are a joke with f/5.6 (although I tried this indoors...) but capturing things such as birds in flight, etc. with good light easily done. All in all, a wonderfully light and sturdy lens for most telephoto situations, but look for faster glass when shooting faster subjects or in low-light."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a nikon...","review":"I have a Nikon film camera and many lenses sitting in my draw.

At that price, it's an excellent choice for a new photographer who needs a fairly long zoom but can't spend the big bucks.It's important to have the right expectations for making this purchase. Its maximum aperture is mediocre, so it's a poor choice for indoor action. It will be much better for shooting in daylight. I'm really excited to put it through its paces when the spring sports season arrives, photographing baseball, softball, golf, and track.I was surprised at how light the lens is -- it really isn't much heavier than the 18-55mm kit lens that Nikon packages with its entry-level D-SLRs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens/case deal","review":"So I admit I was apprehensive, especially since the package is $10-20 more than the lens itself. But the seller sent it quick and it contained all new pieces (i.e., the lens did come with hood and semi soft case) exactly as advertised. The case is perfect for a starter kit (fits body, 18-55 and 55-200 with room), and the tri-pod was a nice bonus (albeit quite flimsy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good lens for the price","review":"I think this lens is pretty good for the price, but I am not real demanding of my lenses (except for my 60mm macro). The only problems I have with it are that it is all plastic, and the hood comes off a bit too easy. I have this lens and the 18-55 VR. I plan to replace them both with the 18-200 VR someday. But till then between the 2 lenses I have the same 18-200 range with VR for a little more than half the price of the 18-200 VR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nikon 55-200MM VR Zoom Nikkor Lens","review":"The lense is heavy and a challenge to focus; both distances and up close to the subject.

But then that's what 70-300mm lenses are for. The build quality is very plasticky so try not to sit on it or pick up your camera via the lens. Also, and this is kind of annoying, but there is no full time manual focus; it's either autofocus or manual focus. This limits its effectiveness for those who like to use autofocus to get in the ballpark and then make fine adjustments via the focus ring. VR seems to work okay--not particularly well or badly. Last note: this is not a fast lens so this is really only useful in good light or with a flash; or with a tripod against non-moving objects. If you don't have a tripod then VR sort of helps against non-moving objects, by reducing hand-shake effects, but it won't help if what you're shooting moves at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens","review":"I really love this lens. The VR feature lets me shoot in lower light and with higher zoom settings without using a tripod. The only drawback is it can't focus less than a few feet away, so I have to keep switching between this lens and my 18-55mm. If you have the money, splurge for the 18-200mm VR, although that one costs more than most cameras. For about 1/3 the price, I can live with swapping lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon 55-200 mm VR","review":"i love this lens! i'm just starting out but it's great fun to use. takes very clear pictures. the VR allows me to shoot at lower shutter speeds with low light and still avoid getting blurry pictures. works great with my D40!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light weight lens ideal for traveling","review":"This is a light weight lens, ideal for traveling.This lens is quite sharp from 55mm to 105mm wide open. From 135mm to 200mm, you may need to step down or do some post-processing to sharpen the image a little. VR works as advertised. You general gain about 3 stops. For instance, you should be able to get reasonably sharp images at 1/15 sec at 55mm, and 1/30 sec at 200mm.Vignetting (darker corners) is not noticable from 55mm to 105mm. Vignetting is very pronounced wide open from 135mm to 200mm. Again, stepping down one stop relieves the problem.If you are looking for optical excellent telephoto zoom, you may want to consider 70-300mm VR. If you need a lens you can take with you without breaking your shoulder, this lens is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photos made easier","review":"I am thrilled with my new lens, I am a casual photographer, but I wanted to be able to take pics of my son pole vaulting from a distance.It is a great lens for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Close Ups","review":"This lens is well priced for a good close up lens with autofocus and vibration reduction. It's easy to use and produces quality images."},{"rating":"2","title":"VR really works!","review":"I've owned this lens for a couple of weeks now. Chapeau to Nikon for this excellent piece of equipment.The VR really works! I can shoot from the hand at full 200 mm zoom (daylight conditions) with my D40 and get perfectly sharp shots taken from my kids. And I tell you, they won't stand still for long.Nice blur patterns too in the unfocussed areas. Well worth its money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zoom Lense Review","review":"I found this to be an excellent product that was easy to put on my camera and use. I was able to take great action photos of my children playing football and baseball. Bottom line is - Nikon makes great products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either a defective lens or mediocre performance","review":"I just received, and used this lens at a wedding last weekend. I was not thrilled with the results. I expected sharp, snappy contrasty images but they weren't - just okay.I then mounted the camera with this lens on a tripod, switched off the VR and autofocus and took a series of left, right and center pictures at different f stops of a distant sign with lots of lettering. I was even more disappointed as the left edge was blurry, and the images got better tto the right of the frame and not the center as expected. I hope that this is a sign of a defect, and not sloppy manufacturing.This lens is bargained priced, with the VR feature which seems to work, but at least in my instance the image quality is poor. When, and if I can get a replacement lens I'll update this message after taking the same test shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Nikon Standards","review":"I wondered how a Nikkor lens could cost so little - now I know. The quality of construction of this lens is shockingly poor. Especially in comparison to the other AF-S DX lenses in this series. The mount is plastic. The image quality is poor above 150mm. Bottom line: I'll save up for the new AF-S DX NIKKOR 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR, which reviews indicate has a better build quality and overall performance. It cost almost twice as much, but in this case saving money on the cheaper model is not a good option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nikon lens took too long to deliver","review":"I was very disappointed that the lens didn't arrive until after Christmas.

Which is like one of the best lenses I ever used. I can't even begin to describe the sharpness of my Images at full zoom. Anyway, the lens is great but really heavy to lug around all day. So I bought this one Nikon 55-200 f/4-5.6 with VR. It's alot lighter and works great with my D60. The Images at full tele are a little soft but good and a lot easier to lug around all day. Good lens I recommend it. Can't beat either lens for price."},{"rating":"2","title":"93% of Amazon reviews are Favorable","review":"198 out of 214 Amazon reviews gave this a 4 or 5-star rating. That's a 93% favorable rating. Pretty good for a lens at this price point.I have it and also have the 70-200 f/2.8 at $1600.For regular family shots, newspaper shoots, this is a 4-star lens. It is very light, too. VR works very well. The f/2.8 is like carrying aroung a lead pipe, so I leave it home when I shoot parades or have good lighting situations. When I want the best I use the f/2.8...but, you'll find critics of this lens, too.Let's face it: Most lenses today are pretty darn good. At this price it's hard to pass up. If you don't have a long lens, want to have some fun, and not rupture your bank account, this lens is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens for the money","review":"I purchased a \\"factory reconditioned\\" version of this lens and have been very happy with it. It came in like new condition. Before getting it, a friend who has a lot more to spend on camera equipment loaned me his Nikon 70-300 VR lens. To compare the two, I can't say that for me the 70-300 is really worth three times the price of the 55-200. (Comparing what I paid for mine to what he got his for, used.) In fact, in some ways I like the smaller lens better. It is a lot lighter. The thing I miss most on the bigger lens was the manual override of the automatic focus. Ken Rockwell has a wonderful website reviewing a lot of Nikon equipment, and he gives this lens high praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good mid to high range zoom lense","review":"very good zoom lense. we have had it for about 2 months now and its been flawless. the vr is key to getting those steady shots at full zoom. the clarity is really really great as well when paired with our two d3100's. if you need a super zoom though i would go for a 300mm alternative but the 200mm should sufice. great nikon quality speaks for itself they are know for making top knotch lenses and this is right in line with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon55-200","review":"Yes this Nikon lens is all that I expected it to be, very good product for the beginner and novice user.

However, this is the second Nikkor lens of ours that broke at the mounting plate. The ribs that secure the lens to the body of the camera are made of plastic and they can easily be broken off. We have a Canon body with lenses that have metal ribs on the mounting plate. I wonder if other Nikon lenses have metal instead of plastic.

I ordered the VR version of the lens to increase image stabilization and limit any distortion while using the longer focal lengths of the lens.So far the picture quality is superb even at 200mm.

It seems to be defective. When using the zoom at 200mm, the autofocus constantly clicks (like it's hunting for proper focus), and the pictures all come out blurred - more like double vision - in bright light. The VR didn't help at all.The problem is not present when using the lens at 55mm. Go figure.Sending it back to Nikon for repair or replacement - Amazon was no help. I'm a huge Amazon user, but in this instance I probably should have purchased locally so I could just walk it back to the store in the event of a problem.I'll update this review with how Nikon ends up resolving the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Work as describe.

Specially that I had high hopes to a Nikon built kit lens (my 18-55 is excellent).Most of the photos are out of focus and not sharp. The fact that some photos are sharp tells me that the focus is to be blamed (in a tripod setup , VR off).The VR (version 1) was a total disappointment to me too (again in comparison to Sony's in-body, Cannon and VRii on 18-55). It hardly compensates 1 stop for me (while I was hoping for 3). It appears to me that it does not even turn on sometimes (judging from the VR motor's noise).It is possible that the lens is defective but Amazon's ratings should also reflect quality control of products.I obtained the lens from overseas and I could not even use the Guarantee, but that's another story (my own greed for a 20% cheaper price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed.

I hate using a flash and hoped that this lens would help me capture photos in lower light without the flash. I was dead wrong. In my living room on a very sunny day setting the shutter on 1/25, I still got a huge amount of blur. I have not been able to get any of my photos to look any better with the VR on vs. the VR off. and I have tried everything.

I have an 18-55mm lens and I'm afraid it is going to waste because I love my 55-200mm VR to death. The funny thing is the VR isn't even noticeable until you see the pictures it creates.

Focusing speed is good, although not lightning fast. The close focus distance was 3-4 feet ... which is high. But overall, you will not be disappointed as long as you keep in mind the fact that this is a $235 lens and not a $600 lens.I think of myself as an advanced amateur on a tight budget, and had considered spending $850 on the 18-200VR.

As it says in the Awakening Beauty book, my skin started to break out at first (using Differin also contributed to this) but now my skin is starting to calm down, and it feels nice to use the slightly astringent facial toner after the cleansing cream. The gentle exfoliating process also helps to gently slough off the peeling skin (which is due to the Differin and cold weather).My one complaint is that, having a pretty hectic schedule, the cleansing process can be a bit too lengthy with this cleansing cream.

It worked fine the first time I used it, but the second time it broke and is not working at all. My son was helping me blow the driveway and placed it on the pavement a bit hard and after that it would not work. I could understand this if it were dropped from a height, but this was not the case.

We have pine trees and oak trees and raking over gravel was getting very tedius. The high air blast produced, without excessive noise, is plenty to move any needle and leaf debris. It is powerful enough to move the gravel too if not careful!! Not expecting to use this as a mulcher, no need to, plus as another review mentioned the plastic impeller might be damaged. The plastic case seems sturdy and the handle position is good providing a well-balanced unit in use. Not sure why there are two speeds...I have always used it on HI (#2)."},{"rating":"1","title":"8 hours is all I got","review":"This Toro vacuum/blower lasted almost eight hours before it died.

It is very powerful and lightweight. I highly recomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great electric blower at great price!","review":"I originally purchsed the Toro Model 51599 for $75 @The HomeDepot which is exactly the same as this model w/ exception of variable speed and metal impeller. The Toro Model 51592 is only $56 on Amazon (No tax or shipping w/ Prime) and has the same great power. I don't need variable speed and the 2-speeds on this model is perfect. I would imagine that the metal impeller is better for shredding leaves when vacuuming, but experience has taught me that vacuuming w/ these blowers usually destoys the bearings well before the impeller so I just use strictly for blowing. Great power that rivals my neighbors $250 Echo gas blower and I dont have to mess w/ gas mix or pull start. Also lighter and quieter than the gas blowers. For household yard work, I've determined that the hassle of the cord is far less than the gas mix, storage issues not to mention the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"blower/vac review","review":"I had an earlier model of this unit and it lasted for 8 years, I couldn't find it locally so was very happy to obtain it thru Amazon.com, it works just great and I hope it will last as long as the previous model did"},{"rating":"1","title":"shortcomings of the Toro Ultra with hose and bag","review":"The 12 amp Toro motor is strong. So strong, in fact that it will blow the hose and collector bag right off your garbage can creating the biggest mess you've seen. The hose goes into the top of the bag so is continually trying to collapse the bag. The biggest problem is that the bag doesn't have enough surface area to allow the volume of air produced by the motor, to escape. So you can't use the tool at peak efficiency without creating the huge mess. At the slower motor speeds, the process is painfully slow- easier to hand rake. Toro has no solution and is not interested in discussing it. If you don't mind carrying the shoulder bag around the product works ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I'm delighted with how powerful this blower is and how easy it is to use. I am happy I got one this powerful and I hardly ever have to use the higher setting. I had a battery one that was lousy, I had to practically touch the ground with it to make it blow even small stuff. This thing I can hold at my waist and it blows several feet in front of me and that's on LOW! For my needs it's fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good job for the money","review":"Very pleased with this blower/vac.

If my yard was large, it might be alittle slow, but for a typical yard, it should meet most people's need. Having two speeds in quite adequate. I am a little bit concerned about the plastice impeller. From time to time I get some acorns which could potentuially damage the plastic impeller.Switching from blower to vac is a relatively simple task. All the connecting parts are made of plastic. I can't judge how long the plastic parts will hold up.Having used this blower/vac a number of times, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this Toro again."},{"rating":"2","title":"leaf blower for my deck","review":"love it - don't need my husband to blow the deck off or front steps - even my 5 year old son can handle it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"toro blower design flaw","review":"My Toro blower fell off a 1 story roof and landed in a pile of pine straw. It appeared undamaged, but would not turn on. I ended up buying a new and different brand blower to replace it. Several months later I became curious about the cause of the Toro blower's refusal to work. I took off the impeller guard and found that there is a tiny plastic tab on the inside of the impeller guard that presses a tiny safety switch. The blower only works when the safety switch is pushed. The plastic tab had snapped off and was no longer pushing the safety switch. The tab is only about as large as the cross section of the tip a door key, and is apparently very fragile. Whoever thought this up should have his/her butt kicked! \\"For want of a nail..........

I work at a place that sells this unit for 60 dollars, paid 33 at Amazon. The metal impellar is not sharp and will still clog with wet leavers. The plastic impellar is just as good and is designed like last year metal impellear found in Toro 51598 model. I would say save your money and purchase this model"},{"rating":"1","title":"RECALL needed : Used 3 times - It went up in smoke...service/repair has been problematic","review":"I had a previous version of this blower for 5 years. Worked great until the impeller broke while mulching.

Obviously Toro has a quality control problem with these units.I've had fits trying to get it repaired. I went to Toro's website and local Ace Hardwares store that are supposed to service it are all saying we can't.

The old blower still works fine except the plastic locks on both the blower nozzle tube and the vacuum bag attachment collar fatigued and broke off with use. Can't complain about the service life; for that reason I stuck with Toro when I bought a new machine. After a couple uses, the new model continues to perform great in both blower and vacuum mode.

The plot is super dumb, omg, a jewel destroyed your castle, and now you have to hit it a 100 times. It has 4 stages, each with two levels and a final boss. It's kinda like super mario sunshine, and thank god it's similar, cause the rest of the game just plain sucks. I rented it, of course a week, by the third day i had already returned it. I passed two stages per day, and on the third day i beat the almighty boss, which i think easier than the levels, and they tried to make the game longer by makin you collect some of the treasure you lost.

My brother and I beat the game in exactly one week, although, my brother and I are very experienced game players. It's a short game, but it is a fun game.

Mario can jump on peoples head and squirt water. Wario can piledrive, ram, spin people around and punch.

I looked up so much stuff that I knew tons about the game. But there were many reviews that said it was short and easy. Some said that the badguys just have a different skin in the later levels. And it was true. When I got this game I realized that all of those things were true. But the game was still my favorite of all time. The games Bosses and level design rock!!

This isnt a game for the more experienced among you (unless you want a quick game inbetween) as it can be completed very quickly (if i can do it, anyone can) but it is enjoyable.

Unfortunately, it is not a patch on any of them. The emphasis is on tedious button bashing. Instead of quickly dispatching your enemies as Sonic might do with a quick bounce on the head, gland-challenged Wario has to knock seven bells out of them first, which makes the pace slow. With the much better Viewtiful Joe out on the shelves, Wario World is the worse platform beat-em-up by far. Strangely, its' fans seem to really like it. I can only think that they haven't played Streets of Rage or indeed any 2D platformer of the Megadrive/SNES era."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT step-by-step","review":"Well, the book has gotten great reviews and all by people that know a lot about the subject apparently. As a novice I do have to warn you, this is NOT the book to learn C++ self-tought or on an Online environment. It just gives you definition after definition (although very well described), then some examples and that is it. It does not take you by the hand and teaches you how to write a program, a method, so you start to understand the thought process behind it all. I suppose that if you know C++ you get to appreciate this book a lot more. But if you already know C++ then any book is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is outdated","review":"My intro CS class used this book. I don't care for it myself. He uses outdated (pre ISO Standard) methods to teach C++, although the book was written after the Standard was published.

So if you are not required to use this book, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how I learned to program in C++","review":"Among the many wonderful things about this book, in addition to it being easy to understand, is that it doesn't confine your learning of C++ to one particular compiler or platform. All the concepts and examples in this book should run fine on any decent C++ compiler. I used Visual C++ myself, but several others in my class used Code Warrior or Mac compilers.Yes, this was my textbook for a beginners programming course and I definitely kept it on my shelf instead of selling it on textbook buyback day at the college bookstore!Do youself a favor if you want to learn C++ and buy this book. It's easy enough to follow that I'm CERTAIN I didn't need to be enrolled in a college course to understand it. It will give you the foundation you will need for UNIX or Windows programming as you become more experienced.And besides all that, it is fun to read and not horribly dull and dry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BUY","review":"These protectors do jack squat literally.

I had read Treasure Island and loved the characters right away, so I knew this game was going to be a winner! I was very pleased with the graphics as I got into the game itself. The movement was very smooth and not comical in its use as well. Getting around was easy too and even better after I had the map in my possession.(Instant transportation was a real time saver!) Solving the puzzles was not too difficult and finding the items to complete a few of them, was not that hard either.My only complaint, is that the creators did save the best puzzle for the last. It was just getting good and then the endgame started up-awwww!I was left with wanting more!! I am hoping to see more of this series from the very creative and imaginative people who work at NOBILIS.Thank you for letting me share. Bye now."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK For Kids I Guess","review":"This game reminds me of the movies that Disney used to make years ago. Pirates, buried treasure, villains, boy, girl, smart parrot. That's about it. The graphics are good. Sound is fine. Puzzles are mostly of the inventory type, except the last puzzle which requires you to decipher Mayan symbols and push many buttons. This puzzle may take as long to solve as playing the rest of the game.While this is not a bad game, I doubt that it will hold the interest of many adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $10","review":"I couldn't get the game to install on either my new Windows 7 gaming laptop, or on my older 2006 Windows XP PC.

The length and width are perfect, but the two panels are too far apart to hold the phone in. There's about an extra 5mm's of space (about half the width of the iPhone 4, extra), which even for the 3G would make it too big. This makes it basically usable as the phone falls out quite easily. Also the belt clip is junk, and I wouldnt bet on it staying put for very long. For the price I suppose it's difficult to complain about, but this case is near useless.

The first is the designs let in the screen after the iphone was stored in the case. The fingerprints, after being rubbed off, leave a residue on the phone. This case then paces designs on the touch screen area that can sometimes be difficult to remove and can get pretty annoying. This is caused by the pointless diamond designs printed on the inside of the case. The second issue I have with the case is that it holds the phone too tightly. The black plastic piece on the bottom back of the phone can begin to come loose just from removing the phone from the case and reinserting it.

To the eternal credit of Gorbatsov, who made clear he would not support the DDR in military action, no bloody attempt to repression ensued, and so one of the most pervasive and controlled police states ever created melted away. It is also thought-provoking on the subject of what constitutes a state; it is essentially a psychological concept, and if enough people stop believing in that state, the state effectively stops functioning and exists no more.The whole story is better than fiction, it is reality. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made ripoff of another product","review":"While \\"The Royal Road to Card Magic\\" is a classic book that belongs in the library of anyone wanting to learn card effects, this DVD set is a poorly made attempt to cash in on both the book and another publisher's careful and far more professional effort to produce a video version of the book.

My husband bought me this book in 1991, and I have referred to it ever since. It's refreshingly written from a women's perspective. All the basics are here: casting, wading, flyrod selection and line differences, clothing recommendations, understanding insects and the various types of fish and flyfishing both fresh and salt water. You'll find nothing pretentious in this book, even though it's written by the best known female flyfisher worldwide. Trying flyfishing? You had better buy this book! Reading it while you are learning will enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review by a 9 year old girl","review":"I think this toy is very cool! I wear the cape and play with it every day. The cape could use more details, but it flows out very far. The dagger is very similar to the one \\"Lucy\\" had in the movie.

The strings are a tad thin but have an appealing and appropriate \\"chill\\" to their sound, and the woodwinds and brass parts are persuasively characterized.As a bonus, you get BIS' wonderfully natural recorded sound, superior examples of how to properly record a symphony orchestra. If you're looking for one-stop Sibelius symphony shopping, you will be pleased with this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"no gapless play on mp3s, Beware. ineradicable gaps between tracks that should be connected","review":"I think the title of this review says it all.

More often then not, they are quacks. Go to someone who specializes in the martial art you are interested in and you'll get better quality.Note: I didn't actually purchase this but again, I did see his preview of the video and I don't want anyone wasting their money on this.

The reader must do some additional reading outside this book to really start doing useful simulations.2. Replace flow charting conventions with more accepted and evolving conventions like IDEF, BPMN, UML 2.0 etc.3. Content on measuring performance is also basic.

It wasn't until Scott told me to \\"Get down with my bad self\\" that I really lost it!This video tries to provide a full aerobic workout and then leave you with a Tai-Chi type ending. I did like the last twenty minutes of stretching and relaxing techniques and would have liked it a whole lot better if that was the whole video.

I guess he must have picked up a Snoopy The Dog cd last year and this is what he came out with. I can't believe he gave up Motley Crue for this. This cd is an insult to longtime Motley Crue fans. I have nothing against musicians wanting to explore a little, but this is ridiculous. It remined me of Paradise Lost trying to sound like Depeche Mode on their lastest cd.

So this is the more pop/rock (not punk/metal) side of the MSPs - which is not a bad thing. The music and lyrics are terrific! And they've included the elusive Suicide is Painless and Motown Junk!

The plot of this film is bizarre, unique, sometimes confusing, and ultimately rewarding.The writer fills the dialog with notes on the afterlife, religion, the entertainment industry, and familial issues. No doubt there's a lot to cover. But it all comes together in a nice package, delivered surprisingly by a washed-up rocker named \\"Rex\\" (the highlight of the film, by the way). His character drives both the dialog and the music.I didn't expect to see such extended musical sequences. It was sorta like \\"Rocky Horror\\" in that regard, but the songs were catchy. The ballad, near the end, was the strongest.

Find something else to use to sharpen your knives, you wont like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.. Plain and simple","review":"Don't wast your money on something like this. Save and get a quality sharpening stone. This just isn't worth the hassle.I am completely unsatisfied with this stone. You can barely tell which side is the 240 or the 120. Either way after attempting to use what you think might me the grit side; it become the fine side after a few strokes anyway. 100% J-U-N-K.. But if you make the mistake of purchasing this thing anyway then I think the lighter side is the 120(gritty) and the dark might be 240(fine).. But don't make the mistake in the first place.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made a perfect stocking stuffer!","review":"I purchased this sharpening stone as a stocking stuffer, for my fiance. The 6\\" length gives him plenty of room to sharpen the full length of his knives' blades and the width fits very comfortably in his (large) hands. The price I paid made this gift, a 'real steal'! The rough side allows him to smooth out larger defects and the smooth side removes scratches and leaves his knives like new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anansi The Spider","review":"The story is from the Ashanti people of West Africa. Anansi is folk hero, well known to the people of Ghana, and a trickster. The story is about Anansi's six sons,- See Trouble, Second son, Thirty son, Next son, Another son, and Cushion. During the tale, Anansi gets himself into trouble- what else is new. Yet, each son uses his gifts to help save their father. The story can teach children that they all have unique talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This is a wonderful book that can be used to teach students how to write an opinion writing piece. I am glad to have found a copy at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditionally told folk tale","review":"I finally bought this book for my children after numerous renewals from the library. It is told with a traditional voice and artwork. Anansi's children each have their own talents that come together to save the day. Just when you think the coast is clear, there's a new danger for Anansi's children to solve. It reminds me of the Seven Chinese Brothers, but less gruesome and more appropriate for younger children or older. As with many folktales, it is not only entertaining, it explains something about creation in our world and also shares a lesson about teamwork. This book reads quickly for younger children with a short attention span, but is charming enough to old the older ones' attention as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A fresh and interesting take","review":"After an initial listen, it was evident that the music was creative and well executed. After a second, the arrangements stood out, and the interaction between the players caught my attention. After the third listen - Wow! These are men of God with a real message.The combination of each musician's unique style contributes to a sound unparralleled in these modern days. The Keyboardist lays down the foundation while putting together beautiful voicings against the bass players slick and funky rhythmic lines. The drummer seems to be full of ideas and surprises, as he combines finesse with force on his kit. The sax player exemplifies what it is meant to play creatively with much articulation and spirit.What a pleasant surprise!!I wish this new band the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"11 years later and still phenomenal","review":"I purchased this album as a sophomore in high school, around the time when I was very eager to soak up as much knowledge of classical works and composers as possible. Because of this interest, I bought a lot of compilation albums, most of which I now view as trite, hackneyed, even. At the time, they were a great and inexpensive learning tool for me. However, this album has been a solid rock in my life for over 11 years, now; and I still relish in its indescribable beauty, often. Please do yourself a favor and get this album. It's been one of the few albums I have put on every single iPod, laptop, and phone I've had, throughout the years. Hats off to the producer who selected this wonderful variety of well-known to unheard-of works that has changed my life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Dreams: Music to Inspire","review":"The music and performance was excellent. The only negative element is the volume is too low. When I play it in a sequence of other similar CD's it is too soft and I have to adjust the volume control."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money.","review":"I wanted to prepare for the French SAT II subject test, and I purchased this book because most of Barron's test prep books are excellent. But I had several problems with this book. First, there is no scaled score conversion table in the book. Also, the practice tests were not at all like the actual SATII in length or difficulty. The real SATII I took was much more difficult, and although it too had 85 questions, the test took me almost twice as long to complete.A good alternative to this book is the one put out by the College Board, which includes real, recently administered, SAT II tests. The practice test provided is much more indicative of the actual length and difficulty of the test, and it comes with a scale score conversion chart so you can see how well you would do in comparison to other high school students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prospective buyers beware!","review":"I bought this book bearing in mind Barron's reputation for publishing overly difficult test prep material. This book, however, is an exception. The grammer review is not terribly informative and, as another reviewer has mentioned, there are no excercises after the chapters to give practice using the concepts learned.The practice tests are much easier then the actual test. The listening section and reading passages in particular bear very little resemblance to the actual test. I scored much higher on all of the tests in this book then I did on the actual test.Do NOT buy this book, it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing customer service","review":"my son is studying to do the SAT tests and this book, together with the CD, was well recomended.

The mattress pads work really well, and are very nice. The only complaint I have, which really isn't a complaint, is they are very DEEP. If you have a VERY thick mattress that would be perfect, but for smaller mattresses, you have to tuck in a lot of excess pad. But they protect really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine for knife edge buffing with a strop","review":"I'm not sure why this product hasn't received good reviews. It's excactly what I hoped it would be. I use it on a leather strop to polish the secondary and primary edges on my hunting and utility knives. It does a great job. Strop turns black, even with premium hard steel, very quickly. One review said that it flakes off too easily (The product is not terribly waxy). However, I haven't seen that problem, perhaps because I put a little mineral oil on the strop. Given Amazon's price, free shipping and great customer service, I don't know how you can do any better than buying this product from Amazon. Presumably, it also functions perfectly on a buffing wheel, the purpose for which it was intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else to say?","review":"This is the good stuff to use when you put on the strop from your blades. Had it for awhile, more than enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Performs to expectations","review":"This item was quite useful in polishing up my Sanke keg from the \\"fine\\" polishing wheel level to the mirror-finish level. If I were polishing up another keg, I would have used an intermediate polishing compound before using this one, in order to smooth out some of the rough spots and scratches left by the find disk. Either way, this bar, combined with a suitable angle grinder, were very effective in bringing out the reflection in the stainless-steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works","review":"if you have a strop you need this stuff.

Additionally, they were apparently a repack and not as pictured.My intended use was in smoke detectors and CO detectors, so I felt that due to their extended exposure to heat, I could not trust them. I gave them to a neighbor kid who used them in toys.So,two complaints:1. The product recieved was not the product pictured. I could have bought bulk batteries for less money locally.2.

You could get a tama drumset for cheaper with better stuff for cheaper all you would need to do is get a Crash and ride seperate. oh yeah it doesn't come with a ride cymbal. after 6 months the cymbals are bending alot.

I think this is one of my wisest purchases yet to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as different as you think","review":"I was actually looking forward to this release and I wasn't disappointed. This is a good album, but not as different as you might think. If your into Bizkit or Powerman 5000 this is for you. If your a Motley fan from way back, maybe not. Though if you listen to it a few times through (setting aside the lyrical style) some of these songs could actually have fit nicely on Motley's reunion album \\"Generation Swine\\", for example 'New Skin' and 'Metamorphosis'. Ironically, these Motley sounding songs speak of 'everything must die...time to move on...leaving the past where he's been'. If these are words refering to his tenure in Motley Crue (which they may not) Tommy will be eating them. Motley made him who he is today, and M.O.M. will not have the longevity of his former band.

Even the addition and cowriting of several hip/hop artist on this album are not much help. The music is not concise and lacks a consistant melody and beat--which is necessary for a hip/hop record. The lyrics are trashy, leading one to believe that Lee's thoughts go no deeper than sex and vulgarity. On the brighter side, as poor as this album is, MOM can only get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back to the Crue, Tommy!","review":"How amusing. Tommy Lee, drummer of world renowned Motley Crue, has started a rap-metal band. Talk about trend hopping! He goes from 80's hair metal, to the 90's equivalent: rapcore. There's absolutely no doubt that Methods of Mayhem would never have been formed if not for the recent explosion of rap rock. That being said, the \\"artists\\" who supposedly \\"pioneered\\" rap rock make guest appearances on this pathetic pile... Kid Rock & Fred Durst. Both on one CD. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Hell. There is simply no other way to put it... this album sucks. Methods of Mayhem are simply another parasite, leeching away at the foundation of rap-metal. The music is bland and uninteresting. The lyrics are terrible. But what do you expect with song titles such as \\"Who the Hell Cares,&quot... Total garbage. Avoid at all costs. I can't believe they were on Ozzfest..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but short","review":"Minus one star for being only a little over 30 minutes. Besides that, this album is an excellent cd.

The guest artists are also a major bonus to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's amazing what fame can do for you","review":"Let me just say this plain and simple this cd sound like a bunch of garbage that was put together in a week. Tommy Lee's famous so he can get all these guests to appear no problem. I dont even care that hes hoppin on tha bandwagon, the album just doesnt have any continuity to it. New Skin is a cool song and i made the mistake of buying it after hearing that song. Tilo doesnt even get a chance to show his talent(I dont know if he has any)Overall I'd say there are 2 or 3 decent songs on the album. It just sounds like someone trying too hard when theyre not even into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"here we go again (sweet jesus why? )","review":"Wow how surprising another $3 bill (mr pam anderson) thinks hey everyone else is doing it why can't I.

Motley Crue meets NWA meets Public Enemy meets DMX. Metal and rap combine better than I have ever heard it before. Not Run DMC, not Kid Rock(although close), not Limp Bizkit, NOBODY jams harder than the Mayhem! \\"Get Naked\\" with Lil Kim and Pam Anderson on the video where NOTHING is left to the imagination! Not just rock, this is METAL and HARDCORE RAP combined for a decadent, stripper club sound that has yet to be topped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Explosive and Aggressive","review":"When I first heard this album I was just dying to get my hands on it. So I rushed to a store and bought it to find the perfect type of music for me. Methods of Mayhem is an awesome band with a great sound. Although they are considered to be another rap/rock band i think they have a really unique sound and beat. The first four songs are loud and aggressive, then after that it slows down and mellows out. This album is a must have in my opinion because it sounds really good with Tommy's and Tilo's unique voices and a sense of rhythm to all the heavy guitar playing and drums. The album also features many well known artists of today such as Kid Rock, Fred Durst, and Snoop Dogg. I really enjoyed this album and anyone who likes hard rock with a beat to it would really enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER","review":"Why is this album is at 3.5 stars? This CD puts 11 of the best rap/rock mixture together and its all done collectively by Tommy Lee and Tilo. Just look at who all helped on this album, George Clinton, Lil Kim, Snoop, Fred Durst, Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys, the Filthee Immigrants, Scott Kirland, Kid Rock, and U-Dogg from the WU Tang. For all of you out there you gave it anything below a 3 or 4 you all can just listen to track 6 or go back to listing to Britney Spears, the choice is yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit 2011 grand cherokee as advertised","review":"(update: Amazon graciously granted a refund for this, even though it was way out of the return period.

It is definantly a different type of series for Nora but I like it so far, as long as you are willing to let go and just accept the fantasy of it.

There is poor character development and a sad plot. Even the \\"twist\\" at the end of book three was predictable mid-way through book one. While I am normally a Nora Roberts fan, these books were obviously only published because Jove knew they would sell no matter how bad they were, due purely to the author's name on the cover. For shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writing - Crummy subject","review":"As do all of Nora Roberts books, this one holds your attention, and is a good read. However, I have never cared to read vampire books before, and after reading this series, have decided not to read anymore, even if written by Nora Roberts. If you like this subject matter, you should enjoy the series; if, like me, it is not your cup of tea, save your money for something else. I hope she does not waste her time on any more vampires, as I, for one, will not buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth it","review":"I am not generally into vampire stories, but I am a Nora Roberts fan, so I decided to read this book, along with the others in the trilogy.

Unfortunately, since so many millions of us buy on faith, the trilogy will most undeservedly end up a best-seller unit.

I think she writes too many books and the quality is poor. There were so many typos in this book that I found it distracting.

I will not go to the closet I put it in; it is an Ugly Place. This coffee maker is horribly made. The lid has to be pried off of the carafe, and its hinges appear to be so weak and apt to break that you find yourself preforming an oxymoron and prying gingerly. The filter takes an act of God to remove and put back onto the machine; you have to lift and turn and adjust and pray that *that* hinge will not break in the process. (because it, too, is a thin little piece of plastic) Worst of all, the carafe doesn't fit onto the hot plate. It sits askew and no amount of adjusting will make it flush with the plate.

It is still worth the listen though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music, but incomplete album","review":"I loved the movie, and thoroughly enjoyed all the music mentioned and played. I especially liked the inclusion of the Dylan song and \\"Twist in My Sobriety.\\"However, I am not sure why the U2 song was not included, as it's played twice in the movie, and is especially significant as the closing song. The only reason I can think of is that the group did not agree to having it on the soundtrack. If that is true, shame on U2 for marring a great set of music! If it was the producers of the album, shame on them for depriving us."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't need love, I've got The Radio Dept","review":"This album was released directly after \\"Lesser Matters\\" and is a continuation of the same style. While later albums like \\"Pet Grief\\" found the band exploring more synth-style pop, \\"Pulling Our Weight\\" shows the band at its peak. Every song on the ep is classic and flows just as smoothly as \\"lesser Matters\\". There is an overall grandiose feeling to these songs, only on a laid back scale. If you dug their first album and wanted to hear more like it, than this ep is a definite own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calvin and the Colonel","review":"This CD brings back a lot of memories. This was a classic cartoon show with some great lines, even though the animation was pretty basic. i thought there might have been some later colour episodes but I might be wrong.

There's one or two things on here I liked, but overall, I was disappointed with Raphael Rudd's inconsistent diddling on the harp.The final three songs on the album are truly hideous. Caterwauling of the same verse over and over while banging on a piano. I was always of the opinion that Pete knew more than three chords, but he didn't use any of them here.Tying \\"Tattoo\\" to his religious beliefs reflects poorly on Pete AND ruins a humorous song.I did, however like \\"Sleeping Dog\\" and \\"Let My Love Open the Door\\".This album's for completists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great, distorted guitar and all","review":"This release is quite excellent. Great versions of \\"Sleeping Dog\\", and \\"A Little is Enough\\". Oh no, the guitar distorts when Pete turns it up too loud. OH NO!!!! Isn't this Pete Townshend, known for his super clean guitar? And it sounds as if this were a bootleg, not a great professional recording like the lame Deep End Live. Asking for an expanded edition of Deep End Live is like asking for an expanded version of WHO'S LAST or IRON MAN This is much much better than either of those. This is a beautiful recording, i recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fit For Release","review":"Pete Townshend's Oceanic Concerts is only interesting for its historic value. It amazes me that a recording of such low quality was officially released. The generally monophonic recording sounds like a bootleg. Distortion can be heard when Townshend plays his acoustic guitar too loud. The performances are nothing special either. Raphael Rudd's harp and piano playing doesn't fit well with Pete's guitar. It doesn't even seem like they rehearsed the few songs they played together on.Oceanic Concerts just shows that objectivity must be observed when releasing a CD. Quality should be paramount.I would rather hear an expanded version of Deep End Live which would include the songs from White City that were performed.[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oceanic Concerts is a Washout","review":"I never heard of Mr. Rudd. His fortune to play with Pete Townshend adds no value to this recording. As a Townshend fan and music collector, I now own another recording I do not really need. The recording value is awful. The performance value is questionable. Pete's tunes hurt my ears even though the selections were choice. Rudd's selections are plesently esoteric. Its too bad the source material could not be improved upon with today's technology. I fail to see or hear the historical value since after three or four listings I would have to swim the Atlantic before needing to wet my appetite again with this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live Raphael","review":"Not a great album, but if you like Pete Townshend, you'll probably like it. A nice document of Pete playing with Raphael Rudd, who died earlier this year (2002). Jai Baba!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic, Intimate Portrait","review":"This is a fantastic unplugged album, though it was recorded well before the unplugged idea came into being. There are probably four or five essential tunes here, including versions of The Who classics \\"Bargain,\\" \\"Drowned,\\" and \\"The Seeker.\\" Those tunes barely prepare you for the stellar version of Townshend's \\"Let My Love Open the Door,\\" which appeared on his Empty Glass album about the time this set was recorded. In between those highlights, Rudd provides some really fine moments on the harp. The insightful, occasionally intimate ramblings of Townshend between songs adds to the value of this package. The primary flaw is the distortion we sometimes hear coming from Townshend's guitar...this is bothersome, not a deal killer. Essential for all serious Who/Pete Townshend fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Album, it feels like you're really there.........","review":"It's a great compilation of heartfelt songs played by both artists - perfect synchronicity between them! It's a completely different sound to hear Pete Townshend play to a small audience, it sounds like just two guys having a great jam session. The acoustic versions of \\"A Little is Enough\\" and \\"Let My Love Open the Door\\" are awesome and very different than the versions on the Empty Glass album, \\"The Ferryman\\" has a real 'blues' feel to it. Piano and Harp solos by Raphael Rudd are awesome as well and powerfully inspirational.

I took the chance as I really didn't want to replace the entire receiver on my crosman 1322 to mount a scope.I found that the mounts tighten down just fine. No stripping or slipping.I suspect the issue folks have had may center more around the fact that the crosman mounts are 3/8\\" which will not allow a standard 1\\" ring to securely fasten on to the mount. I had to purchase new rings that convert from the 1\\" tube down to the 3/8\\" rail mount.Using these new rings allowed me to securely fasten both the mounts to the barrel and the scope to the mounts.

The Mehaz Rubis tweezers also have \\"swiss cheese\\" holes on one side of the tweezer to aid with grip. If the tweezer drops and the point gets damaged (hence my need for several tweezers over the years), Mehaz offers lifetime repair and sharpening for $3.00 each. Just send it in to the Mehaz Service Center (1-800-669-3555) and expect it back as good as new in a couple of weeks.

He might not match my black I-Pod (he's white) but he's cute as heck and great sound as well!I mainly got him so I can listen to my I-Pod at work. He's small enought to fit on my cluttered desk and has great sound. I couldn't take much more of the local \\"Lite\\" station anymore, so it's nice to be able to listen to my choice of songs.I love interacting with him and my co-workers really got a kick out of him.Also, he didn't put a hole in my pocket like a I-Pod dock would have and I can take him in the car and not get the dock for the it which runs about 99 dollars.I got him in the Toy's r Us in Times Square and they had a load of accesories for him, but they were much money in the store than online.I wanted a fish for my desk, but could not get one, now I have a puppy I don't have to clean up after, lol.Overall, It's handy, small, travels with you, has great sound, fun to interact with, not TOO expensive and just damn cute!Two thumbs up in my book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cute fun musical puppy","review":"I just got my pink idog today and think it is just the cutest thing. Although I am just learning how to use it,so far I am just so interested in watching it's movements and colors. The problems that I have encountered are that it is quite difficult to \\"turn\\" the pup off and that the \\"on\\" button (nose) is much too sensitive. All you have to do is very lightly tap the nose and the pup makes noises. In addition, I have found that the batteries are a pain to insert as you need a screwdriver. I wish like my ipod, there was a \\"hold\\" button to avoid accidently activating the toy and \\"wasting\\" expensive batteries. I might make the investment and buy re-chargable ones to avoid the cost. Anyway, I look forwars to using it on desk at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bow wow - I love my IDog","review":"I love my IDog. It's great. It's small enough to sit on my desk.

Tell me, why would I waste the time to do that? Also, the sound quality is horrible.

I was not going to spend $100 bucks on another boom box just for I-Pods. So it caught my attention while I was in Herbergers and noticed I could listen to music through the dog. It was cute so I grabbed it. You have to put two AA batteries in the dog's leg. Then you just plug in your I-Pod and instant music. The sound isn't as good as with a stereo system which makes this good for me since I live in a condo and do not want to make a lot of noise. The dog is cute and its head turns and its ears go up and down to the beat of the music. There are also lights that go on and off to the beat of the music too. It also cries and barks. That kinda gets annoying after awhile. It demands attention. And if you pull its tail it growls. You control the songs and volume through your I-Pod. This is a cute cheap way to listen to your I-Pod without spending a lot of money or a lot of hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute but Battery life is AWFUL!!","review":"My daughter loves her new I-Dog. She is 6 and absolutly loves it. The only problem is that the Battery Life on the thing is only SEVEN hours. Today we put new batteries in and by 7:30 she needed new ones. I thought that we must have had a defected one because she kept needing new batteries all the time but when I looked at the Hasbro website it confirmed that the battery life was 7 hours.Like I said she LOVES it and shoot I must admit I wanted one too, but not now!

For example, it likes to be \\"petted\\", it growls when you turn it off, and it barks if the music goes off. Overall, this is a great addition to her mp3 player because now she can hear her music without having to use headphones. But it also works great just sitting in front of the stereo speaker when music is being played.Please be aware, though, that the description above says that the i-dog needs 3 AAA batteries.

Have had it less then 2 days and have gone through 4 AA batteries. Which, if we were using rechargable would not be that bad.

I never got the jitters and never had a blood sugar crash.During the run, I gave a GU Chocolate Outrage to my friend Saul who had never heard of it. After a while he asked,\\"Where can I get this stuff? It really works!\\" GU is also helpful when I have to stay up late(1am)and get up early (5:30)to work all day.

But I'm usually hungry and have low energy when I wake up. I find that eating one of these packets and then doing my high intensity cardio or strength training will keep me from completely crashing during the workout.

On my really heavy workout days, I take Gu right after my warmup and it kicks in about 15 minutes after that.

Definitely in the top 1% of its genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fully satisfied","review":"I enjoyed this book as I have all of the David Morrell novels I have read. It was a bit slow to start, and in a few scenes it dragged a bit. The book is definitely worth the five stars I gave it considering. But for an overall package, it was a great read. It was based in the late 70's, early 80's and his story reflects the that error very well. The story is fiction but within it is a sense of believability.

Really enjoyed the book and will read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, funny, intriguing","review":"I loved this book! I was a little worried about getting it because it was supposed to be funny. I don't like books that don't take themselves seriously, but this was not one of those. Contrary to the book jacket, this book is not centered around a tooth. Sure, that is part of the plot, but there is more to the story than a tooth. The tooth is just the beginning. I thought the mafia hit on the main character would make the book strange, but it all fit perfectly. The plot is very believable and the characters are endearing! I'm not sure if I will continue this series, this books seems stand alone to me. One of the best in the many books I have read recently. A quick and fun ride, I highly suggest it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, Funny and Really Enjoyable","review":"I'll try to make this short and sweet. Lots of humor in this book. I found myself laughing a lot. It's one of those books you can't put down and you just want to keeping turning the pages to find out what happens.

You really don't get much sex in this book till the end but there's so much fun and excitement going on that it didn't bother me. And when it final does happen, it's special. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"God's Blood","review":"The one thing that bother me the most was the CONSTANT and VERY FREQUENT use of the words \\"God's Blood\\". This drove me insane and took away from the already sketchy storyline. The heroine of this book at many of times just downright got on my nerves. Sparks tried to make her both strong and independant while still making her seem fragile and incompetent and after a while it was just too much.One of the other things that aggravated was towards the end where Roman tells the villian is whole plan of attack. Ridiculous. The story could have been great but the execution was less than favorable. It took to long for things to happen and once things did happen it quickly ended. I was hoping for so much more and hope here other books will be better executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to marry a millionaire","review":"I enjoed this story and world enough that I have the original paperbook and now kindle versions. I recommend this book and the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible read","review":"Terrible story line and terrible read. Not sure why anyone would rate this a 5 unless they have never actually read a good book. I agree with another reviewer about Roman's quote \\"God's blood\\" which would make for a great drinking game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Painful","review":"I have a problem where I must finish a book I started. Its a flaw because God's Blood this book was terrible. The lead character was so annoying. Shanna spent the whole book in love with Roman, then out of love, then in love, then out of love. If that wasn't bad enough the lead guy, Roman, spent the whole book in love with her, then not good enough for her... you get the point. The plot was pretty dumb along with the title. I should have read the reviews. This books savings grace is that it was short. It didn't take long to put this book out of my life forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it, but...","review":"This book doesn't reinvent anything in the romance genre, but it still would have been a great read if the writer could have only breathed some life into her pages and her characters. While she had a few good ideas as far as the storyline, not giving anything away here by talking about the choco or diet blood to which some of the \\"hilarious\\" references might be aimed, she just never seemed to make the story become an escape for her readers. I never cared for the characters at all and I easily lost interest in the book a lot. Only purchase if it's free."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have read the wrong book...","review":"From all the 5 star reviews I am thinking I read a different book. This book was beyond terrible. I kept thinking since it had 5 stars that the book would eventually get better, it never did. Had I know that I would have never bothered finishing it. The plot and the main character, Roman, had such potential for a fresh story but in the end it turned into a mess. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1, was for the potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"God's Blood it's Horrible","review":"I have to write this review just to add another one star rating to try to offset the 5 star ones. I have to admit I couldn't even get to the point where there was an interesting twist to the story. The \\"God's blood\\" repeated over and over again by the H drove me absolutely crazy. There was nothing about the beginning part of this book, that I made it through, to make me be able to continue to read it. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Don't waste your money. I don't know how so many people could have given this book a good review???????"},{"rating":"1","title":"it started out strong","review":"at first i loved how well written this story was. strong plot and strong characters but then it shifted and started to fizzle. it seemed as if the author had a deadline and stopped putting thought into the story. it became cheesy and the ending reminded me of a sit com. quickly wrapped in a happy ending while the bad guy cries out \\"you have not seen the last of me!\\" and the canned laughter laughs along with the other main characters. quite the dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this book down !!!!!!","review":"I have read all of Kerrelyn Sparks books. They are FANTASTIC !!!!! Once I started this book I didnt put it down until I was finished. Great author and great series. I am all caught up reading them. Can't wait for the newest one to come out in March called Vampire Mind. Keep up the good work Kerrelyn !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So book","review":"The book started off OK but there was a lot of repetition from the main characters. Roman wanted to be with Shanna but used the phrase \\"God's Blood\\" at least once a page if not more. Shanna, wanted to be with Roman but thought he might be crazy and then didn't wanted to be with him since he was a vampire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"One of the silliest books I've read. Well, read half of, for I couldn't even finish it. Harlequin romance for vampires. I thought it would be cute. It wasn't; it was cutsey. Maybe something for a teen with low expectations as to a book with a decent plot that is moderately well written. This is neither. Total waste of six bucks. I'm embarrassed to even write this review showing I purchased this dreck.I give this one and a half stars. Two was being very kind. How this got a four star average is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining premise - horrible writing","review":"I really could not get into this book because of the constant use of \\"Sheesh\\" and \\"Jeez\\" by the female protagonist and endless \\"God's Blood\\" by the main Vampire character. The extremely cliched use of what the author presumes to be a Scottish brogue also did not help. The clincher was when the over 500 year old Vampire discloses that he is really a virgin and has only ever had mind sex. Honestly !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche to the extreme","review":"I keep reading the book because it has an interesting plot, but I can only get through a few pages at a time because the scenes are so cliche. The main vampire character is very poorly developed. His outward persona versus his actions just don't match up. The story seems very stilted and it doesn't flow well. The scenes seem very scripted and like something you would expect a teenager to write in their first writing class. It had the potential to be a great story but I may never get through the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was hoping for so much better after reading the many good reviews. Possibly it was a question of timing. I read this book right after finishing Queen of Shadows by Dianne Sylvan - which i found to be a truly fabulous story. By comparison, How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire felt embarrassing to read. Another reviewer used the word \\"cutesy\\" and that's probably quite apt. And i agree with whoever made the point about the use of the phrase \\"God's blood\\" - I was reading on a my iTouch and at one point the term was used once per screen for several screens in a row! Anyway, if you are in the mood for something campy and silly, this might be what you're looking for; the book does have a decentish pace with lots happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to domesticate a millionaire vampire","review":"if you read most of the reviews (heck, including mine), you've ready most of the book already. but you should still read it... because - how often do you run across a hot sexy physically virgin vampire who'd commit to a big house with a big yard and a big dog and willing to get his DNA implanted into a boogy sperm to make sure the mortal love of his life would be his wife, mother to his children, and soulmate?i normally don't reread my smaller paperbacks but i have a feeling this will be in my library of favorites. it was spunky, feisty, saucy, and all around fun. and - like some of the other reviewers - i am eagerly anticipating a series based on this book. heck, i'd be happy to read more about roman and shanna.infact, sparks can call the next sequel \\"how to domesticate a millionaire vampire\\" for the sequel. perhaps followed by \\"how to raise mini half vampires\\"....it should be interesting trying to spoon a vampire in his sleep when he's dead cold, no?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me......","review":"I've read many different type of Vampire books and seemed to enjoy most. I just couldn't get into this book. The writing style, story was a weird read for me. I like Sookie Stackhouse, The Blackdagger Brotherhood series, Twilight series, Anita Blake series something along those are what I tend to go for."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Marry A Millionaire Vampire","review":"I was very skeptical about reading a love story involving a vampire, figuring it would be silly and ridiculous. However, I was hooked from page 1 and loved it. Could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would recomend however would not read again.","review":"Its a once and done for me. I tend to rate books on how often I can stomach reading them.Once and done rating for this book. It had some good dialogue but lacked something. I just can't put my finger on what exactly it lacked but I'll know when I actually find a book that delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter crap - albeit very entertaining crap.","review":"Had me hooting with laughter at the overwrought and downright atrocious clichés. Seriously someone published this!?! I skimmed through pages and pages of mindless drivel, chuckled over the interaction between the leads and resisted hurling my kindle out the window at the frequent repetition of lines. The author is a good storyteller but the publisher deserves a damn good slap for not editing this harder. I won't buy any of the others but I do foresee myself reading bits of this for a laugh. So as I said, it was entertaining. It's just I could have cut half the book out and not missed anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I guess I have read too many books with depth in them to like this book. I was greatly disappointed in it after reading the reviews before buying. I guess these people have not read such authors' books as Gena Showalter, Jacquelyn Frank, Cynthia Eden, or even Jeaniene Frost. I mean....it took half of the book before Roman's tooth was put back. The book really had potential and it started out great. Any of the authors I mentioned I think could have taken the storyline to a new level, especially with the hero Roman Draganesti. I have ordered other books by Ms. Sparks due to the reviews. I hope I have not made a mistake.However, if you like a light read in which one can put the book down and go about their business until the next spare-time slot, then this is the book for you. Unfortunately it was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading even though its free","review":"This is by far the worst book I have ever read. New to kindle, I downloaded it b/c it was free and I enjoyed the Twilight series. Well, save yourself. I cannot believe this book was even published. It had a surface plot line, immature and unrealistic dialog and unlikeable characters. I wanted to like the book and kept reading hoping it would get better but it never did. I wish I could get the 3 hours of my life back I wasted reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"hilarious?...really?!","review":"this was basically a vampire Harlequin...it seemed to me like she was trying to do a mixture of Twilight and UnderWorld and failed horribly...as for hilarious as several reviews stated...that also failed horribly...honestly i luaghed more reading the reviews and comments than i did at anything in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, light-hearted read","review":"Characters are developed with a deft hand. Although darker elements and danger are part of the plot, the narrating voice is light and breezy, creating confidence in the reader that the story will successfully resolve itself, and the like-able main characters will elude the bad guys with little damage. The banter of the two leads works. Book is similar to the Sookie Stackhouse novels. Includes sweet male vamps who work security in their kilts."},{"rating":"2","title":"an entertaining new series","review":"I came across this book by accident, just looking for a new book to read and this came up as a recommendation. I'm so glad I took that chance and ordered it. Shanna Whelan is a dentist who has a little problem, she's afraid of blood. She hasn't always suffered from this problem, but it's a result of a deadly shooting she witnessed. Roman Draganesti is a vampire who needs a dentist. His fang has fallen out and he needs it put back before he heals. He winds up on her doorstep, and thinks he can \\"mojo\\" her into fixing it and that will be it. Problem is she can resist his \\"mojo\\" and has the Russian mob after her. This tale has many twists and turns, a few surprises and finally a herione that isn't helpless. She takes matters into her own hands, and doesn't fall right into his arms. It's a very entertaining read, and you'll be happy you picked this up. I'm looking forward to her future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Short and simple. I liked reading a paranormal romance with some humor it. Its a nice break from the harsh tragic lives that are the backstory to most paranormal romance hero and heroines books.It was a could not put it down for most of the book. Crazy vampires, vampire reporters, True Blood in Chocolate making the lady vamps fat and having to drink the Blood Lite version....Vampire sex toys....The ending of the book was lame. Everything just kind of ended and was left unresolved. The heroine Shanna's family ended up being worse than the vamps but that was not written in a satisfactory way, when your Dad has abandoned you and you find out he is the reason for your lifes trauma, trust me when your grown you can definatley be mad at him....Someone sould have punched that man : )Roman the hero was Alpha but a lovable Alpha.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time","review":"A good read. Easy to get hooked into the story. Likable characters-primary and secondary. Lots of funny lines. If you're looking for a good story to pass the time and entertain you this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the series...This book not so much","review":"The Love at Stake series as a whole is awesome, but you have to get past this first book. It is hard to believe that the author who wrote this book is the same one who wrote the rest of the series, because How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire was just blah, but I kept reading and wasn't able to put the rest of the books down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"The story is weak, and the writing is not the best. I deleted it off my Kindle.
