The color of Bixler's alto and Wendholt's trumpet is used quite tastfully and it is a subtle mix of standards and originals. Anyone wanting a sort of \\"jazz now\\" in their ears should feel welcome to pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Prog-Rock","review":"After hearing the band's first CD, THE RITE OF PASSAGE, I can say these guys are one of the premier groups in their genre. WTTT takes off where the debut started. These guys can play and write better than most anyone out there. \\"Dark Room\\" and \\"The Fall of Rome\\" could have been a radio 'hits' had radio not gone the way of lifeless, money-driven, drivel. \\"White Shaman\\" reminds of something Peter Gabriel might have done with its percussion-based orchestration. The final track \\"The Nightmare\\" is one of the most 'progressive' pieces a rock band has ever recorded. I highly recommend this album as well as their debut, THE RITE OF PASSAGE to any fans of progressive music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Disappointing","review":"If you already own Glorious Patchwork (a great book) by Kaffe Fassett, you don't need this book. There is only one \\"new\\" pattern in this softcover booklet and the quilts and photographs are much better in Glorious Patchwook - which is a great inspiration on color. While there are better instructions on piecing, I didn't want a quilting how-to book. Better options for how-to books are Joy of Quilting or a book by Nancy Martin, Judy Hopkins or Marsha McClosky."},{"rating":"2","title":"megaman zero","review":"This review is about the mega man series 6' zero version 2 figure, which is actually an action figure of mega man zero from the popular gameboy advance series.

I highly recommend this figure for mega man fans and collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Letdown","review":"I put off reading this book for a long time and was looking forward to reading it this summer. Even though Larry Kramer can be called a prophet with his lacerating vision of what happened when gay liberation came along at a time when America was on a sexual expedition (and unaware of the awful plague that was coming down the pipeline), the novel gets weighed down with too much repetition and not enough objectivity. Not even halfway through the book, I got tired of reading exploit after exploit without any narrative balance. I'm sure it's accurate in its depiction of the era, but I would've liked one narrator to step in and throw some kerosene into the mix. After a while, the satire becomes bland and you could care less about any of the men. Still, it's frightening to see how little some things have changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I thought this was a TERRIBLE book. I could hardly get through it. I even tried to remember the time setting when the book was written as I read it. I sure cannot understand why this book is supposed to be so signifigant. Kramer's other works out weigh this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooorrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiinggggg","review":"If you are in the mood for a long, whiny, long winded rant by all means read this book right away!The first pages of the book talk about how many gay people live in the various boroughs of New York City and how they outnumber the Jews, as if this is some significant demographic. Who cares? Most people don't live in New York. The whole thing just comes off as overly bitter and negative."},{"rating":"1","title":"sourpuss attitude undermines any satire","review":"Larry Kramer has never been able to forgive the cosmos for the fact that he is neither handsome nor endowed with the physique of a god, and this juvenile obsession crops up in and flaws almost everything he writes. Faggots is no exception. This satire runs afoul of Kramer's personal problem and sputters out in boring waspiness. A tiresome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING CD!","review":"Children's Songs of Inspiration by the Peter Pan kids is phenomenal! My 3 year old daughter and I love music and we have many cds, but this is one of our favorites (me because the songs are so uplifting and beautiful, and my daughter because of \\"Tomorrow\\"--she asks to listen to it over and over and over and loves to sing along with it).The children have great voices and sound highly professional. Several of the songs were new to me, but they turned out to be some of my favorites: \\"Help is on the Way\\" and \\"Different Light\\" are very profound and very comforting. The \\"Annie\\" song \\"Tomorrow\\" is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!! Now made in China!","review":"This was Wacoal's best selling bra for a reason, comfortable supportive, wonderful. For years it was made in the USA, and I was happy to pay the premium price. Now it is made in China, the fabric feels flimsy. The padding on the channeling is not near as nice as the original. The wire twists in the channel. I've bought nicer bras at Walmart for a third the price.To add insult to injury they moved production to China and raised the price by 20 percent. This is not the bra Wacoal built their reputation on. I hope they rethink and move production back to the facility that made their name. This bra is a loser. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable/Would Recommend","review":"I am a petite person who always has trouble with bras. I am small in frame, but not necessarily in the bust area. I wear 36-D. I have purchased bras, in the past, in this size and have had to \\"take in\\" the straps myself. These bras accomodate my situation. No complaints, bras are pretty, very well made, and worth the price!! I have ordered two diff.types recently, but both by \\"Wacoal\\", and both purchases suggest that it is better to pay a bit more for a well-made and extremely comfortable bra. I am impressed!!!! Thank you, I am glad to have finally found you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Quality Issues","review":"Well I agree that this bra may be a bit pricey, but it is worth it for all day comfort and support. Personally I have bought 5 and all mine were made in the Dominican Republic. No quality issue for me. There is no padding or soft cups which I love because there is no need for that with larger cup sizes. The material is smooth so clothes hang nicely. I highly recommend this bra to full figured woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Bra for Smooth Look","review":"I looked for a long time to try to find an underwire \\"t-shirt\\" bra - a bra that will give a smooth line under thin or clingy fabrics - but it was very difficult because most t-shirt bras only go up to a 38DD (I'm a 42DDD). This Wacoal bra fits the bill! It comes in larger sizes, the cup has no seams, the fabric is smooth but supportive (i.e. not too flimsy) giving a nice clean look to fitted shirts, and it's pretty - not industrial looking like many full sized bras. For my taste it's also not cut too high - I've had trouble with other full sized bras having a very high cut so that wearing a v-neck or low scoop-neck shirt was out of the question because the top of the bra would show. I find the bra very comfortable to wear and it could also be used for very low impact exercise (i.e. walking). The only thing that prevents me from giving this product a 5 rating is that the cup fabric could be a bit more substantial - you do get some nipple seethrough when it's cold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive bra","review":"This bra does not run true to size. small in both the cup and band.

No sweams make it a \\"go to\\" bra for any occasions. I return to buy this same bra year after year. For me, it's been worth the extra cost because it lasts longer then cheaper versions. Very well made."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO SUPPORT, UGHHHHHHH, ALSO DIDN'T LAST.......","review":"I had purchased this bra, it was recommended by a fitter, so I tried it on, it felt comfortable enough. I am a 36 DD, after 3 wearrings all I did was sag, it did not hold it's shape, and I hand wash all my lingerie. This is the worst bra, and very pricey. Makes you look wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway..TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort, great t shirt bra, there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also.This one I hated and I had purchased more than one, just wore them till they DIED, and they DIED fast...I truly beleive in the BALI bra, VF is good to, after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway, why spend more than $40.00...Thanks, hope this helped...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Finding the right bra makes all the difference!These are a great fit without making me looklike I have \\"formed\\"cups.

From Windows NT users a certain minimum knowledge can be expected and NT specific topics are not treated enough (i.e. how to maintain user accounts etc.). Too much blank space and lines in the book, it could be reduced to less than a third in pages without reducing the text and the readability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Covers material, but better know programming.","review":"The first impression is the large number of typos in the code.

The glass sugar containers in the local stores were the commercial type with a stainless screw on cover with pour spout. I was afraid the spout would allow moisture in.Several people mentioned that this bowl is small. I measured, and it holds one (1) cup of sugar. The value depends on how much sugar you want in a container. For me, this is perfect. For a family who uses a lot of sugar, this bowl would be small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"Good quality and pretty bowl. I like its the size and shape.

It's title, IMHO, over-promises information regarding living blonde like Marilyn Monroe. The review of MM's hair and make-up techniques is cursory. Similarly, the review of MM's mannerisms (for those who intend to impersonate MM) offers little except the advice of renting her films and practicing what is seen. Few specifics are spelled out. The book is still an interesting read for the few scraps it offers, and I would have rated it 3-stars (instead of the 2 I gave) had the price been lower to reflect the content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Friends in a New Light","review":"This string quintet version of the two piano concertos is a revelation and a joy to the Chopin lover. As the CD notes show, it is close or identical to a format that the composer himself knew and used.Fialkowska's playing is strong, limpid and passionate.

What was originally written as future economic competition between Germany and the United States is transformed by Weinberg into a battle for actual physical world domination. In other words, Jewish Weinberg wants to convince us that the Nazis were planning to invade America way back in 1928! Before they had even taken power in Germany!

Get the first edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating view into Hitler's mind","review":"This is the unpublished sequel to Mein Kampf(Hitler's first book). If you are not familiar with the history, it was discovered in the 1950s and unpublished until the 60s after it was verified as authentic. Hitler had previously written Mein Kampf and later thought he revealed too much in it. He did not make that mistake again and kept this book secret. He planned to publish it after he had invaded America.It is mostly a continuation of the ideas in Mein Kampf but he goes farther too.I read this second book after I finished Mein Kampf The Ford Translation(which I also highly recommend for its historical notations and accuracy). This second book of Hitler's is not as well translated as Ford's version of Mein Kampf and is a bit stilted in places but still understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitler, An Understanding Of A Mechanical Mind","review":"No doubt this will offer the reader retrospective insight deep into the mechanical mind of Hitler. Easily set aside from Mein Kampf and ramblings, this volume should be standard reading in all military science curriculum.What is most concerning is not Hitler's perversions. Rather, it was his ability to consume and control a nation of people; possibly the greatest salesman of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally A More Complete View of Hitler's Thinking","review":"The text by Hitler actually expands on Mein Kampf and focuses on foreign policy which tutnred out to be of enormous importance to the world. Hitler had a great impact on world history and is the central figure of the 20th century whether we like it or not. The added importance here is the presence of the introduction and notes that do not appear in any edition of Mein Kampf. Hitler's Second Book is therefore much more useful to students such as myself and I strongly recommend it. And by the way it is completely AUTHENTIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I had never read Hitlers second book, but have of course read Mein Kampf.

Having entering the Bay Area legal scene a year after Susan Wolfe, I can vouch for the authenticity of Howard Rickover's angst. Yes, partners do dump projects on your desk that can't be billed and then chastise you for not having enough billable hours. No, partners generally don't get murdered in their offices.Anyhow, the mystery aspect of this book is adequate but the sense of life and greed in the 1980's legal world is very real. I left the law in 1989 - can only hope that things are better.My notes indicate this book won an Edgar for best first novel. I can't find any hint of sequel.

Lots of revenge.The characters live Texas large and the story rolls along at a fasten your seatbelt pace, all of which makes for a fine winter read if you are watching the snow pile up outside your windows or a good beach read if you have had the good sense to spend some time in a warmer climate.This one is fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book; bad edition","review":"Do not buy this particular edition of Parker Hitt's classic (published by General Books).

To make things worse, The History Channel/A&E are releasing only one half of a season this time (\\"Season 3, Volume 1\\").

The author should have done more research when she wrote what she did. Buying this book will only leave the purchaser horribly misinformed about the Immaculate Conception and about the nature of Wicca (there is no black mass in Wicca, for starters.) Its one thing to say one religion disagrees in philosophy with another, it is another to flat-out lie about that other religion. Catholics will recognize her Catholic errors. All in all, the book will mislead readers who are uneducated about either religion, and should be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best D-Day books ever","review":"Ever wonder what the difference is between an LCI, LCM, LCVP, or LST? All these mysteries and a host of others are clearly explained with charts, maps color graphics, etc. Equipment and D-Day organization of all amphibious elements including Naval Beach battalions, Amphibious Engineers, Rangers and Infantry are depicted along with their equipment and objectives. Suffice it to say I learned more in one hour of perusing this book than in four decades of reading other books on D-Day. Although the author chose not to write about the Airborne landings, I even found obscure details pertaining to the 101st (thrown in as incidentals by the author) which I didn't know about-and Airborne is my specialty. Don't miss this valuable book-it's every bit as important as The Longest Day.

If you like good music, avoid Paolo Meneguzzi's CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rehash, Not a Redefinition","review":"Senses Fail made leaps and bounds with the release of their \\"From the Depths of Dreams\\" EP, an effort that encompassed such a broad spectrum of human emotion with dark, chaotic music and beautiful lyricism. The band's hugely awaited full-length \\"From the Depths of Dreams\\" did the band justice, still. They grew more confident in their songwriting and more capable in their hooks.This new effort, \\"Still Searching,\\" is a huge letdown, all things considered. From a band who, five years ago, helped pioneer the music that hundreds (if not thousands) of bands are now rehashing, Senses Fail have fallen into their own trap. \\"Still Searching\\" is poorly conceived and forgettable, a lackluster effort. Save your money.The song, \\"All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Problems,\\" is the standout track on a record that is otherwise a complete failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly, this album doesn't suck!","review":"I thought this album was not going to be very good, but I gave it a chance and was extremely surprised. It does not suck, as a matter of fact, it's actually pretty good! It's growing on me, \\"Let it Enfold You\\" didn't. The addition of Heath on guitar has DEFINATELY changed this band for the better. This is worth a listen or two, it'll grow on you.Lyrically, a lot of the songs are about losing faith in God/Christianity...which I thought was very surprising for thie band. Poor choice in first single asside, there are some great tracks here.The Rapture/Bonecrusher (they go in together, really...), Can't be Saved, The Priest and the Matador are my favorite three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected","review":"I've always been a fan of Senses Fail. I was hooked to their debut EP 'From The Depths Of Dreams\\". \\"Let It Enfold You\\" seemed a little weaker in my eyes but was a decent album, nothing special. I didn't expect much else from this album and didn't plan on buying it until I saw it on sale. Lucky for the album was better than I expected. I think the instrumentals are exceptional compared to the last two albums. The album has a very good sound throughout it, while maintaining the vocal style one would expect from the band. The best tracks from me are \\"Calling All Cars\\", \\"Still Searching\\", and \\"The Priest and the Matador\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Senses Fail has yet to \\"fail\\"","review":"This album is good. I feel that I have now given it enough listens to give an accurate opinion.It appears that their sound has matured a bit somewhat from their previous two efforts.

As a thitrysomething, I found the lyrics on Sep. Sun. to be a clever look at the party scene and the passage of time, with both the highs and lows of growing out of the mayhem and into adulthood, or reaching your own \\"resurrection\\". This new album (Boys and Girls) is much more drab, with less of an in-your-face delivery of fairly lame lines that I would be emarrased to listen to if I were older than 20. These are juvenile songs which sound aimed at the MTV generation, with cheesy lines and hooks. I had thought this band was the real deal, and had argued as such, but after hearing this it is clear they are a bunch of posers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great classic rock music, tiring and creepy lyrics","review":"I know a schtick when I see one, and Craig Finn's is creepy, pathetic, and tired. Not that he's lazy--he's clearly put a lot of thought and energy into his lyrics, but life is just a lot bigger than the world his songs inhabit. It doesn't help that Finn isn't all that good at portraying the carefree exhuberance of teens getting wasted, which is pretty much all that he writes about. Rather than the escapism of kids looking to get away, he trades more in the nihilism of twentysomethings who've realized there's nowhere else to go. How else can you explain how exquisitely *boring* Finn makes getting oblitterated sound?To be fair, a number of the tunes succeed, (the opening track is monstrous, \\"Same Kooks\\" absolutely shreds, \\"The First night\\" is an instant classic), mostly in the top half, but the hit:miss ratio falls off simply because, in my opinion, Finn's central thematic obsession only has enough steam to carry so many songs per record."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hold Steady: Dividing America's Boys and Girls","review":"Here's the deal: Craig Finn doesn't sing like most rock frontmen. That's the Mason-Dixon Line of the people who listen to The Hold steady. You love him or hate him. He is nasily, somewhat monotone, and rants more than harmonizes. On the other hand, he is a brilliant story-teller, clever phrase turner, and uses references as diverse as The Beastie Boys.I personally love him, but I understand that he is not everyone's cup of chai. The music is reminiscent of early Bruce Springsteen or Joe Jackson and of course The Band. Standouts are \\"Chips Ahoy\\" and \\"You can make Him like You.\\" Try it. You might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll, Pt. 37","review":"Many argue that the best rock and roll is about sex, drugs and rock and roll itself. Well the Hold Steady provide a song cycle on that very subject with his album, BOYS AND GIRLS IN AMERICA. Channeling GREETINGS FROM ASBURY PARK era Springsteen through a hard rock sensibility, the Hold Steady paint a picture of drinking, drugging and scoring at the suburban mall that's as vivid as the Beach Boy's California summer, the Drive by Trucker's Dirty South or Springsteen's Jersey Shore. It's a record that's full of dynamic music and great lyrics, but will we respect it in the morning?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Hold Steady beginners","review":"Okay, I didn't really care for Hold Steady's previous album, \\"Separation Sundays.\\" It had great lyrics, but the musical side was lackluster and the lyrics, though the saving grace, were often hard to decipher. \\"Boys and Girls in America\\" is, however, excellent. The lyrics maintain the same quality, and the musical end has improved drastically. If you've heard a little of the Hold Steady and don't get the appeal, check out this album. Or, if you're looking for a jump-off point, this is it. If you like this album, then you should look into \\"Separation Sundays,\\" but I would advise going with this one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"\\"Separation Sunday\\" totally rocked. This, not really. Like other reviewers, I was turned off by what seems like an attempt to sound like Springsteen- tinkling piano fills and all. And I think he's taking this \\"youth in America\\" narrative a little too far- and in the process become corny and boring.Does the world really need an indie Bob Seger?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait a minute...","review":"Comparing the Hold Steady to the Velvet Underground is one thing (and quite a stretch at that) but to imply that they are SUPERIOR to the Velvet Underground is just ridiculous.This is decent stuff, but the vocals are exactly the same on ever song, which gets old fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruce Springsteen circa 1977.","review":"We need to make this perfectly clear: this CD is pure Bruce Springsteen circa 1977. I mean PURE, to the point where he should think about suing. There are slight hints of other dated music -- Van Morrison, Warren Zevon, (adding insult onto injury) Randy Newman -- but it's pretty much unadulterated Bruce down to the \\"rocking\\" piano parts and harmonica solos.if you're interested in music of *this* century, then, this isn't something you'll want to listen to. This CD will find its fans: I mean, I wouldn't be surprised to hear it blaring from every frat bar in town. But I like new, current music -- stuff that's fresh and original and surprising -- which means I won't play this thing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled again","review":"Read the reviews. Buttons pressed - Replacements, Springsteen... Buy CD. Insert. First track... thirty seconds in and you get that sinking feeling. You know that this is probably as good as it will get and it is poor. Struggle through the rest of the album, hoping for some respite, but no, it maintains the same level of life-wasting mediocrity all the way through.I don't mind the \\"Oh poor us, look at all the drugs we've taken\\" lyrics, because there is a long line of honourable successes in that field, but I do mind having to listen to songs with little apparent melody or construction, only crude riffing, and with no sense of transcendence. Westerberg and Springsteen have that sparkle and this group does not.Life is short so do not waste your time here. Do not drag down your music collection by having this. Mine is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!","review":"The Hold Steady make another classic. I really enjoyed \\"Seperation Sunday\\" when it came out last year, but this album is ten times better. Smart lyrics with stories that will blow you away and a tight band make this the truth.

If you are a fan of early Springsteen or Bob Dylan, this cannot be passed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Boys and Girls in America is a great album.A little like Springsteen and E street Band, A little smaller band sound. Most songs have a strong piano lead.I heard most of this live on NPR (All songs considered.) and then picked up the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"beat poetry to music","review":"I liked the pure rock and roll of this cd and then...I saw the Hold Steady live at lollapalooza and the pure joy of this group overwhelmed me and made me a believer. Their lyrics are bukowskian and kerouacian and their music is joyously and shamelessly derivative of springsteen and chuck berry and john cougar and probably just about every american rock and roll hero in the last several decades. God bless these guys from Minneapolis who put a band together just so they would have an excuse to get together and drink beer once a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun New York band with a Midwest sound","review":"Hailed as a great live act, The Hold Steady returned in 2006 with their third album in the same number of years. Listening to them, lots of references came to mind: Bruce Hornsby, Toad The Wet Sprocket, Crash Test Dummies and more. The one running thread through all of the music they bring to mind is great production values to deliver a definitely Midwest sound, in spite of being based out of New York.The album is made up of a bunch of solid tracks that are captured on record impeccably. With no particular favorite songs within the album, I'd say confidently it's one of the year's most fun releases (along with the new 2006 Arab Straps album), and a band to continue to keep an eye on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Garbage","review":"I just don't get it. The Springsteen comparisons are appropriate... There are enough tinkly piano fills on this album to make me want to take a shotgun to my stereo.

It couldn't handle the fast action of the 1991 classic Sonic the Hedgehog via Sonic Mega Collection... it made it look worse than on a 20\\" Magnavox. It doesn't just blur 2D games either. The problem was also noticeable in Radiata Stories for the PS2 where anytime the character was moving the background blurs which doesn't happen on any other television in the house.I give it a one star for gaming.

I had to force myself to stop reading, for I could not wait to see what happens next. It was very descriptive and realistic, although lacking in the main character's choice of friends, and lack of concern for others. All in all this was a good job by the author and an amazing read. As for myself I would give the book 10 out of 10 if I could. I would also recommend this book for anyone who was looking for an action packed, semi-sad book. Or if you're looking for an easy read that will keep you up all night long, or even a family with teens read, I am sure that you will find this book one of the best books that you have ever read.

It is my favourite of Keiko's. It is delightful to hear the voice and emotion of the piano through Keiko's playing. I have listened to this CD many times and as with much of Keiko's work, the more I hear it the more it grows on me. It is easily as good as Full Moon and the Shrine although different in its content. It shows an evolution of Keiko's career and her strength to carve her own furrow rather than continue with more derivations on the smooth jazz theme. My favourite tracks are 5, 10 and 11.

Keep it up and I will continue to buy more of your books. Thanks for these beautiful books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as Good as the Others","review":"The first part of it was quite good. I was just as much in love with the characters as I was in the first two books. I enjoyed the small amusements even in the face of the adversity. The kindred Blood were more important in this book and so we got to see more of them; this was a pleasant happenstance for me because I enjoyed how Bishop wrote them. Unfortunately, the ending was less than satisfactory for me. Don't get me wrong, it was \\"good\\" as these things go but it left me with more questions than it did answers! I know the main outcome of the story but I want to know how things continued from that point. It's my understanding that Bishop has written another book with for novellas of a sort from this world. One continues the story and so I think I'm going to have to find it and devour it like I did the other books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I waited many months for this book to come out and when it finaly did I was not disapointed. Anne Bishop has written another great book that kept me up all night reading. It was a great ending for the trilogy and I thought this book was just as good as the first two. The characters are easy to love and some were easy to hate and the plot keeps the reader wanting more. Now that I am finished with this trilogy I will not hesitate to reread it whenever I miss the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever","review":"I own almost a thousand books and have read many times over the amount. This, in all my experience, is the best book I have ever read. Anne Bishop has a very creative imagination, designing characters and worlds and emotions better than I have ever seen. While reading this book, I forgot where I was, what I was doing, and how much time was flying by. An excellent conclusion to the series, I highly recommend this book to everyone over thirteen years old. There are some sexual parts. The characters are well-loved and respected, and leaves the reader craving for more. This book is so good and creates a situation that may not be happily ever after, but there is still much good. It is a good compromise that makes it stand above all other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely end to the trilogy, but a bit of a cliffhanger...","review":"Anne Bishop is a marvelously gifted writer, and I recommend this entire series to any who enjoy the fantasy genre. Predictably fascinating, Queen of the Darkness is an intriguing conclusion to the tale woven by her two previous novels. However, the end was rather puzzling: the entire reconstruction of the three realms in a reformed Blood society was left off the end of the story. I have no room to criticize, as I have not written anything even remotely as worthwhile myself, but I don't believe the tale has truly ended. Perhaps this merely encourages the reader's private imagination, allowing each individual to draw his or her own conclusions. Regardless, the book was magnificent, and I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT","review":"Anne Bishop is the BEST! I personally ran into thebookstore and obtained the first copy of the book before they even putit on the shelves. Queen is the last book in the Black Jewels Trilogy and I have been waiting months for it and I will say, it was well worth the wait! Jaenelle, Saetan, Daemon, Lucivar and all of our favorite characters were still as strongly written as in the first two books. Those of us who have been waiting for certain deaths will be pleased and many questions are resolved, new ones are also brought up so we will hopefully obtain further input from Anne in the near future. This is not a critical review analyzing the aspects of the book, but I will say this, Anne knows exactly how to control your emotions and you do not need an interpreter to help you read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to beat my head against the wall.","review":"The series started out wonderfully. What happened? Anne Bishop has lost any talent she may have had. Her characters have become boring and unbelivable, the heroine's pretentious \\"all-powerfulness\\" is distastful, and the plot fizzled and died somewhere on page 6. If you haven't started reading the series, don't. Read \\"The Invisable Ring\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! A great third book..!","review":"Just got the book and am about 2/3 of the way through. This is a great series with a unique setting.

For month's I've waited for the release of this title, and now that I've read it I can only sing it's praises. Ms. Bishop has once again demonstrated her ability to bring the noble, darker side of human nature to the fore. This piece is a masterwork, filled with humor and magic. But always reminding the readers that underneath it all lies a brilliantly dark and violent world.Thank you Anne Bishop, for granting us all a look into this haunting world of your imagination. It is truly a Dream made Paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this trilogy: Where's the rest of it?","review":"I found this book just as absorbing as the first two. I wish that the maelstorm could have been described more rather than escape from Hekatah and, boom!, wake up, save Jaenelle. It's wonderful that Jaenelle and Daemon are together at the end, but what about everyone and everything else? What exactly is Twilight's Dawn? This can't be the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Forwarned","review":"Be Forwarned, this was an \\"interesting\\" book.

The books were very exciting and I finished reading the whole trilogy within a week. But like all the other readers who posted a review, I too have some questions. What happened to Saeten after everything happened? Did he and Sylvia ever get together? I am assuming that Daemon and Jaenelle did get back together? What about Karla? If Mrs. Bishop reads these reviews, I would like for her to know that I am eagerly awaiting her next book. I just hope it is about the characters in the trilogy and what is they're life like after the destruction. However, I do recommend the trilogy to other readers who are anxious to get they're hands on a new author.

Her third novel and, one can only assume the conclusion of the Dark Jewels trilogy, was rushed, choppy, facile and altogether disappointing.Let me be clear: I adored the first book, enjoyed the second, and looked forward to this one for months. Perhaps I set my expectations too high. But the strength of her characters and storyline in the first two seemed to promise a terrific climax. Unfortunately, while there was a whisper of the former glory, the third book has left me feeling cheated. Where is some sort of resolution for the various beloved characters? What the heck kind of ending was that last chapter? How dare Ms. Bishop give her devoted readers such a facile conclusion! I know she could have done far better, and that's what hurts; to imagine what might have been!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor detail about product.","review":"I ended up withCosequin for small dogs instead of for large dogs.

The excitement continued for almost 20 pages. Then all of a sudden Bamford starts in with pages and pages of partisan ranting that isn't even connected with the NSA.

I did not find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Body of Secrets has a great deal of information","review":"Merchant sent book as promised arrived sooner that we anticipated.Book as as represented, was used for research.Book had detailed footnotes and background information.Was written more like a documented novel and not as a pure research focused book that I anticipated.Yet, it was factual, we used the \\"notes\\" section to identify and read the original documents cited in the book and found those documents to support the author's conclusions and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engrossing Read, but...","review":"There are few books that I devote a full day to, but this was one. Among the other things that have been mentioned, _Body Of Secrets_ provides a great historical perspective on the last few decades.I may be totally off base, but as I read the detail related to offices, etc. within the today's NSA, I found myself wondering if Bamford wasn't given a bit of a tour by some NSA PR types after his last book. Given what I've read in other places, it didn't seem as if he wanted to make too many waves.Having said that, I would still highly recommend the book from a number of different standpoints (most of which have been covered in other reviews)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"Body of Secrets provides a great overview of the electronic side of intelligence and its role in US foreign policy. The research is well done. Despite occasional one-sentence editorials revealing the authors views on his subject, he remains detached enough not to get in the way. Some critics \\"can't decide\\" if he's pro or con, but I see that as a strength rather than a weakness.The book also includes information, disturbing information, that if correct should change how history has recently judged the Eisenhower administration.The last chapter is a little dry, however, offering an overly-detailed description of the NSA campus that isn't relevant or interesting. But, overall, Body of Secrets is worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marks the US government as fearful, and well it should be with the information provided.","review":"Highly recommend to learn what got the US into the domestically fearful and universally feared position it's in now.

Bamford releases classified information gathered by the NSA on some of our nations most controversial actions..Bay of Pigs, Kennedy assasination, Vietnam, Six Day War and more. The book is extremely well written as well as eye opening. Very exciting and hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up to Puzzle Palace","review":"I read the author's previous book when it first came out. It was a ground-breaking exploration of the NSA and the role it has played. I stopped reading Body of Secrets after 85 pages because it veered suddenly into unsubstantiated conspiracy-theory hogwash. The text has no footnotes, so it is impossible to find the author's source precisely. However he has page indexed notes at the back which cite zany assasination-theory groups (the kind with the storefronts at Dealey Plaza!) Too bad he couldn't stick to the facts about a truly fascinating subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with The Puzzle Palace","review":"This book just didn't live up to my expectations. Outside of the in-depth material on the USS Liberty, and some interesting discussion about NSA activities in Southeast Asia, there really isn't much energy in this book.To me, the best material here really is in the last few chapters; chapters I fear that many folks won't even get to if they focus their energies reading the \\"revelations\\" about the USS Liberty. The chapter on \\"Crypto City\\" is quite interesting, as was the last chapter about NSA and development of new electronic and computer technology.I guess that I was really looking for a history of NSA activities in those two areas, building on the strengths of Bamford's earlier book, The Puzzle Palace. To find the discussion of the NSA's real physical anatomy, and their important role in the development of new technologies, relegated to the concluding chapters of this book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling but Misguided","review":"Horribly exaggerated by a journalist that tries to present personal insight as historical fact. He makes outrageous allegations that are wildly misguided and unproven. He is persuasive in his arguments, which make his assertions even more dangerous and outright foolishness.It is a compelling read. Just be careful what you perceive as storytelling, what is attempted journalism, and what is fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could of been better","review":"This book had interesting tibits of information. However, there were several points that were in error. Such as the description of the cockpit layout of a RB47. I felt to much time was taken pointing out what \\"Body of Secrets\\" had uncovered rather than providing facts or telling a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Hope It Isn't All True","review":"Bamford's book contains revelations about the NSA, the military, and our government in general that will keep some readers awake at night. And if that isn't enough, the details about the Israeli attack the USS Liberty add to the shock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dubious platform for obsessions about Israel","review":"The author of this book devotes a large portion of his work to the Israeli attack on the U.S.S. Liberty during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, essentially claiming that the Israelis attacked the Liberty because it was eavesdropping on Israeli war crimes in progress. The author ignores the context of the times, including longstanding U.S. support for Egyptian President Nasser, especially in 1956, and the fact that Israel was a client-state of France, not of the U.S. It apparently did not occur to Bamford that the Israelis may have thought that the Liberty was transmitting real-time intelligence to the Egyptians about Israeli positions and its order of battle."},{"rating":"1","title":"He is politically biased and shows it.","review":"I worked in this area in a peripheral way for many years. Bamvord didn't go into details because he did not know any. I was disappointed in most of the book. His little political asides smacked of Democrat talking points. He could have covered the downsizing of intelligence gathering during the Clinton administration, but didn't. I enjoyed reading about Crypto City and the references to Seymour Cray and the super computers. All of the two hundred references cited here saved the book from being a total loss.There could be a great book on this subject but this wasn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind numbing","review":"Although some of the historical events covered in the book should lend themselves to the thrilling type of stuff other reviews seem to say exists, I find the whole book as boring as it must be to sit for hours eavesdropping on meaningless conversations.

But I do recomend the first 9 or so chapters when Bamford talks about WW1, WW2 and Vietnam ect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and Disorganized","review":"The author's anti-establishment bias shows in every chapter. The book has no logical organization, no evident chapter themes, no structural consistency, no recognized method of citation for source material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hard Read","review":"There is no question the author did a hugh amount of research. I enjoyed the first quarter of the book. After that it got tedious with too much information, much of it unimportant except to experts in the field, and a seemingly slanted view that our government and the people in codebreaking committed wrongdoing. Too many of his interviews were with people who had an axe to grind. I stopped reading it with a quarter of the book remaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good...","review":"I would hardly call it an anatomy but nevertheless it provided great insight for those without a clue on what the NSA does. The book focused primarily on the years between 1960-1975 on gathering of intelligence aboard on foreign nations particularly Russia and Vietnam. Bamford is sometimes controversial and comes to conclusions that to me warranted a much more careful examination; for instance, the claim the USS Liberty was purposely ambushed by Israel (rather than a mistake) and U.S. administration knew but in short let it slide. Other times the author examines how officials in U.S. administration(s) would be willing to clandestinely kill its own in plots that would rally the people and justify war.Only in the last couple chapters does the reader get a glimpse of the inside of the NSA. And it is merely a glimpse. This book is much more focused on history and operations of gathering intelligence without getting technical. Certainly worthwhile for those never privy to the NSA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presents the right facts and makes you think!!!!","review":"I see many people have criticised James Bamford fact presentation and asked readers to view it as fictional. Well it is not fictional to think that Isreal's intention in USS Liberty's case was to sink it completely and then put the blame on Egypt. Unfortunately USS Liberty turned out to be a hard piece of metal to sink. It makes you think that how Israel could possibly play both sides and get USA involed in a mess of hatred that dates back centuries."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very negative book","review":"Bamford must have some something out for the NSA. He is extemely negative in his approach to just about everything they do and all the personalities involved. After 400 pages I gave up trying to deal with it. I am sure they aren't perfect, have made their share of mistakes, as well as there were people that had their own agendas. But I have to believe that there must have been some huge victories and that there are some terrific people who have contributed significantly to this country's successes. It would have been a much better book if he had tried to balance it.Would welcome others thoughts at arnie@impact-ep.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough account of the NSA","review":"Bamford has trod important ground by presenting a fully-realized essay on the NSA. There are, of course, holes of information and areas where the author's viewpoint is asserted, but these should be considered within the remarkable achievement of the whole. Bamford has dared to deliver a single volume text on an organization whose currency is secrets. That he at times maintained an objective and exhaustive stance is worthy of recognition. For fans of espionage and the real-world uses of cryptography in the intelligence community, this book delivers on the promise to reveal the nuts and bolts of the NSA. David R.

Many of the tales are \\"war stories\\" told from sources who clearly are retired intellence officers, so there is a focus on the dramatic events where boats were sinking or lives were on the line, although the book notes that much of the work of the NSA was dilligently listening to distinctive radar pings and other telltale signals intellegence throughout the cold war.

Furthermore the author does not use footnotes, endnotes or in text citations. If you are curious about the source of information you must turn to the back of the book where there are \\"citations\\" (if you can cal them that) arranged by page number.

Unfortunately, Bamford needs to learn how to write. Chapters are chaotic. He even includes entire chapters that have nothing to do with the NSA! Grammatical problems abound.

Nevertheless, you will marvel at Bamford's voluminous and generally objective information on this fascinating agency."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare inside look at the National Security Agency","review":"Jim Bamford's \\"The Puzzle Palace\\" gave the world one of the first in-depth views of the inner workings of this super-secret intelligence agency. Now, years later, having gained the trust and confidence of senior people throughout the organization, Bamford reveals even more. Bamford will inevitably be criticized for telling tales that others might wish had remained untold, but the book is a must-have for anyone who cares what goes on in the intelligence community and what our country does around the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting But Uneven","review":"The NSA is a great subject for an investigative journalist. Bamford unearths some fascinating material, but overall the book is a mess. There are too many abrupt shifts in tone and theme, from outraged polemics on the Liberty and Pueblo incidents to dry accounts of bureaucratic structures and breathless you-are-there reconstructions of Cold War exploits. As a result, the book is often intriguing but rarely satisfying.

Another reviewer noted that his 50' was really 45.5 feet. Mine is the same length - so at least they might be consistently short! The quality is fine - basic wire, flexible sheath, easy to strip and install, but the missing 4.5' really frosts my window panes and it's not worth sending it back and waiting when I need it now - so I give this 1 star to send a message!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, short, short","review":"If I buy a 50 foot wire, I expect it to be 50 feet long.

Metra's best deal is the 100' 10 gauge for $38 delivered.UPDATE: I got another one of these and it was short 6 ft. When doing in-wall wiring, that's not good. I had to make an extra trip to Walmart because of Metra. The other complaints about wire length against metra may be true. The only reason I found out was because I knew how long of a wire I needed. When it was short, I then measured the wire against a tape measure. 6 ft short is a large percentage on 50 ft. I will no longer order from Metra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wire at a great price","review":"A nice heavy gauge wire that's more than sufficient for most home users.

In the climactic scene she performs a miracle out of Maori tradition, perhaps a Maori equivalent of a newborn Moses recreating a Biblical story, the only problem being that the new Moses is a girl.If you are curious as to the nature of the miracle that our darling Maori girl is to perform, just notice the title of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whale Rider DVD","review":"I received my dvd quickly, and it was exactly what I ordered.

Usually films others rave about get a 'so-so' reaction from me. But I really loved Whale Rider. This is a classic tale that will appeal to young and old. Whale Rider is the story of a young Maori girl (Pai) who must overcome the difficulties faced between herself and an aging grandfather who insists that being a warrior is not a suitable occupation for a young girl, and indeed, that this is taboo.The granddaughter must overcome her hurt and her grandfather's old-fashioned customs to prove to him that she's the best person for the job.

I watched it more than once. There are so many wonderful points to be learned in this film, but the most important of all is to be true to who you are. Pai, the main character, is convinced that she is to be the next leader, and sets out to become just that. It isn't an easy road, which I am glad to see, because it mirrors true life, which is never that easy. However, she stays true to herself, and overcomes a big obstacle to achieve her goal.The setting, and the film itself, are beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whale of a tale","review":"Whale Rider is an exquisite movie. Eastern New Zealand lends itself to a sumptuous setting. Gentle winds from a blue sky blow over the waves of an even bluer sea. Pikea is the granddaughter of a Maori chief. She was born under tragic circumstances. She has the potential to be the leader of their community, but she faces tradition and her own grandfather's obstinate disposition. Keisha Castle-Hughes gives a starred performance. She has a lot of potential in the cinema world. This movie has a very touching soundtrack. It has a great girl power theme. Perhaps the thing I liked most is that Pikea instead of rebelling and fighting to make change, she uses tradition and works within the system to effect change."},{"rating":"2","title":"grrrl power ... Maori style","review":"Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is the only grandchild of a Maori chief, and when he states that he will begin training the male first-born of the tribe to replace him, she doesn't accept this verdict, but quietly and confidently sets about learning the skills she will need and proving to everyone but him that she is the right person for the job. Will he eventually come around? Considering this is considered a \\"feel good\\" movie and \\"female empowerment\\" film, chances are he will, but how this comes about is worthwhile and entertaining. Castle-Hughes is outstanding at the head of a great cast. This is a great film for the family or anyone interested in other cultures.DVD extras include featurettes about filming, building the waka (ceremonial canoe) and the soundtrack; commentary with writer-director Niki Caro; 8 deleted scenes; trailer and tv spot; and stills. The film can be heard only in English but subtitled in English or Spanish."},{"rating":"2","title":"There was no joy when I was born.","review":"I am sure there are many levels & cultural themes to this rich movie that I am missing. However, what struck me powerfully was Pai's (the main character) courage & fraility as she faced a life of blame for something she had no control over. Her grandfather, leader of the Maori tribe in New Zealand, was waiting for a first-born male to lead his people out of poverty & discouragement and into the glory the culture once had. His first-born son refused this role, and so he awaited his first-born grandson. However, this grandson died at birth, as did the mother. Pai - the twin sister - survived. And while she had enough spirit to win over her grandfather's affection & love, she could never erase his blame & disappointment that she was the one that lived. The ultimat triumph in the movie leaves a lasting sense of hope & healing. This movie does an amazing job at showing how complex & dangerous & necessary love, pain, hope and expectations are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed!","review":"I can't imagine a more engaging and generally uplifting movie. This film is a wonderful mixture of story, character, location and music that slowly lifts you to a sense of wonder and appreciation of the human spirit. One doesn't usually hear applause at the end of a non-animated movie, but our audience of thirty to sixty-something adults was thoroughly pleased, and spontaneously showed their gratitude for a terrific summer gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"Be sure to watch the extras!!Tradition calls for the male decendant of a great ancestrial savior to be the leader of the tribe, but there are problems with that. Either the female decendant or some one who is not in the lineage will become chief. You can guess the ending, but the middle is so good that this is not a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A star is born","review":"Whale Rider is named after the mythical ancient chief who was saved from drowning by riding to shore on the back of a whale. This is a classically constructed 21st-century fable of generational and gender conflict in which the old ways compete with progressive ideas and an individual female voice attempts to be heard in a patriarchal society. As the heroine, Pai, Keisha Castle-Hughes is a real find - possessed of a glorious screen face, with her dark unruly hair framing strong features and piercing eyes locked in concentration or scowling at the weight of her destiny. In a film of many delights, her mesmerising performance carries the conviction not just of a natural born leader but of a natural born star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This was truly one of the best films I have ever seen. It was breathtaking seen in the theater. As soon as I came home, I logged in to buy my own copy. The soundtrack is wonderful and evocative. Keisha Castle-Hughes is incredible. NZ is beautiful as always. The DVD extras are interesting (including director and actor interviews). I think everyone should own this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a moving and realistic film! Oscar-worthy!","review":"Man - let me tell you, I have never seen such a moving and realistic movie like this before! The acting was excellent for the Maori characters' played in this movie, especially from \\"Nanny Flowers\\", Pai's Grand mother! The story was basic and may be seen as slow and a bit strange (compared to Hollywood movies')- but I think it had to, because it was a story about a foreign (to American viewers') culture/tribe trying to survive by selecting a new chief. It is a shame that come oscar time this little film will get ignored, and white americans' will dominate these awards'. Because of this I wish it future sucess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a movie that will stay with you","review":"This movie is so amazing that I watched it two weekends in a row to make sure I did not miss anything. I took a towel the second time because kleenex were not enough. The movie takes place in New Zealand in the Maori Indian culture. Pi's grandfaher is awaiting the birth of his grandson so he can lead his people once again, like the legend of the Whale Rider led thier people to New Zealand. The child was born dead and thus only his twin sister survived, and, in her grandfather's eyes could never be the leader that the Maori People needed. The young girl loved her grandfather, and her heritage, and forgave his narrow mindedness because she understood his frustrations and wishes she could be the grandon he wanted. The girl ( Keisha Cstle-Hugess ) gives the most touching performance I have ever seen, worthy of an Oscar nomination. Also, the scenery is beautiful and witnessing some Maori dances customs was an added bonus. Great for a family or a date!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cultural learning with a girl as teh heroine","review":"I bought The Whale Rider to show to my grandchildren. It is a excellent way to show a girl as the heroine and how she overcomes being excluded from traditions because of her gender. It also presents a cultural tie to nature through the native peoples tie to the whales. Although it is a little predictible from an adult point of view, their love and traditions of life with the whales are presented in a thoughtful and gentle way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful film . . .","review":"This is an absolutely inspiring film. It touched my heart and brought tears to my eyes.

The main premise of the story was of two fraternal twins (boy and girl). The girl survived and was discouraged from becoming a chief. Yet she persevered and trained with the help of some other villagers even though her grandfather wanted a male heir. Her grandfather's goal was to recruit one of the boys from the village school. There were tests of fighting skills and retrieving a whale medallion that the grandfather threw into the ocean. I would highly recommend this movie because it made me feel very good to watch it.

The Art of Pilar Lorengar will give lovers of great soprano vocalism a strong idea of what they have missed. If for no other reason get this album to hear her exquisite way with Charpentier's Depuis le Jour, the Song to the Moon from Dvorak's Russalka, and the Arabella/Zdenka duet from Strauss's Arabella. All are close to sublime. Add Mozart and Puccini and you've got really cherishable singing.Some listeners complain about her fast vibrato. That is merely the nature of her voice and literally becomes irrelevant as you listen to Lorengar's great interpretations."},{"rating":"2","title":"When a product is good you have to give them the credit","review":"I have tried three products for wax.

The essence has been changed from \\"Romantic\\" homes to \\"Vintage\\" homes as it's obvious that Ms. DeMontravel is obsessed with vintage style.For many years I subscribed to the \\"old\\" Romantic Homes magazine and kept every single issue. I could not part with any of the issues as each issue was packed with gorgeous photos oozing with true romantic style, but all that changed when the current editor took over. Not only did I stop saving every issue, but I chose not renew my subscription.With myself included, there are many readers out there who are hoping for the \\"old\\" Romantic Homes magazine to return!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally inspirational and beautiful!","review":"I've bought many magazines on cottage/country decorating and Romantic Homes is by far the best! My eyes are glued to the beautiful & inspirational photos on every page and I usually finish reading in just 1 day. When I pick it up and start reading, I just can't stop till I reach the end of the magazine! My complaint? None except that I hope there are more pages in every issue to satisfy my cravings for beautiful/chic photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic - No, Amateur-Yes","review":"I bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen. That was a bad decision. After having received two issues, I continue to be disappointed. The quality of the art & design, and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky. I would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I have enjoyed reading Romantic Homes for many years, but lately the style of the magazine has changed. Once you could count on every issue for romantic, whimsical, and lovely decorating and gardening ideas. The 2007 issues, however, have a very muddled style - some articles/photo spreads are starkly modern, or downright pretentious. The Romantic Homes company itself has TERRIBLE customer service. The customer service representatives I've spoken to on the phone barely speak English, and are unable to perform simple tasks like an address change. Letters written to the customer service department receive no response at all. Romantic Homes is definitely not worth my money anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home as sanctuary","review":"I still haven't quite gotten over the demise of Victoria magazine but Romantic Homes has helped. The photography is not as beautiful but the ideas shown offer possibilities an average person (i.e. not wealthy) might incorporate into one's home. At first the designs seemed primarily shabby chic and while there is still a lot of white rooms portrayed more color and variety has improved the spreads. I would like to see more garden articles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rollover, Linus","review":"I would carefully compare prices and formulas for this multivitamin. Looks like sheer effronty and exploitation of the great man's name.I can't imagine Linus Paulng recommending a multivitamin with only ~21 mg vitamin C per tablet when there are a number of high potency multis now with over 200 mg vitamin C per tablet. LP himself used 3000 mg, 6000 mg, 12,000mg and 18,000 mg per day with advanced age and experience. This formula is lower strength per tablet for most nutrients than in even many cheap but comprehensive multis.Although I might agree with a 3x per day format, I would carefully consider stronger potency multis, especially in or above middle age.

I don't remember off hand if there was any episodes left. I don't remember reading Shore Leave. But for whatever reason this novella was included, and this makes it the least of the four Star Trek Readers, since it seems to not fit, but it's still adequate Star Trek fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bad book","review":"I can't even articulate how poorly crafted this book is. The characters are two-dimensional, the heroine unsympathetic and the entire story is a jumbled mess. The connections between Arthurian myth and the main narrative are tacked on and utterly confusing. There was no reason for Arthur to be present in the book at all and it seems like a cheap gimmick to gain more attention.This book is awful, and cheapens the already cheapened genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure soft/loud","review":"That good old soft/loud dynamic originated by Beethoven reappeared in late-20th century guitar-based alt-rock.

He's at his best. The album features an all-star chorus with Adalberto Santiago, Ruben Blades, and Yayo el Indio. Listening to the songs brings back fond memories from the fall of 1976 when I was a 19 year-old in college. Characteristics of this album: sharp arrangements, excellent vocals, catchy lyrics, danceable songs, large big-band type orchestra, a real tight sound. Pity that this, to my knowledge, was (formany years) the only album recorded by timbalero Tito Rodriguez Jr. It's a personal favorite, and I am no newbie because I've been listening to salsa and the likes of Palmieri, Barretto, Pacheco, etc since the boogaloo days of 1967.

Buy both books and then decide. Maybe I'm biased because I read \\"Heaven's Window\\" months before \\"For One More Day\\" came out, but I still think it does a better job reminding us of how much we should appreciate the people we love and how much peace we can find if we have a little faith.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read","review":"Enjoyed this book - easy to read and keeps you wanting to know more about the characters. Worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"The story for this book was not what I expected. Although I do like Mitch's books. The story was presented in a different context than I thought it would be. I never thought it would happen the way it was described. Although I thought it was a good story and shared alot of emotions one might think would take place if you met a loved one after they had passed. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life's basic lessons in a quick read.","review":"Albom has a unique way of tapping into the darker human emotions we would prefer not admitting we each possess. ie: selfishness, regret, guilt, etc... and share a story and a message in which we can relate .

I found the main character to be annoying and not worthy of being able to carry the book. As much as I liked the idea of the book, I thought I could have written it a lot better. What we have here is Chick a sad sorry sack of a man who lived for his father. His mother, a sad sorry sack of a woman who, behind the scenes did everything for Chick and Chicks father who's \\"secret life\\" was supossed to be shocking but was just stupid. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another poignant story that will touch your heart","review":"This is a story that is both heart-wrenching and heart-warming. Heart-wrenching in its depiction of the sacrifices of a mother for her family, and of the seemingly pre-ordained poor choices made by the main character, Chick Benetto. Seemingly pre-ordained, because the tragic influence of his father guides Chick throughout life, even in his father's absence. Albom invites the reader to consider the possiblity of one more day with a loved one who has passed, at the same time posing the challenge of how that would change the course of a person's life. With his characteristic poignancy, Albom weaves a tale that draws the reader into the story and simultaneously enables one to find one's own place in the greater story of our own lives. It is a quick read, taking only a few hours from start to finish. But the lessons given may take a lifetime to fully understand and process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"For One More Day is a book about a man, Charley\\"Chick\\" Bennetto, and his struggle in life. He is the son of divorced parents. The book tells of his attempts to reconnect with his father and his journey playing professional baseball with the Pittsburg Pirates. He finds himself in his hometown, his child hood home communicating with his deceased mother for one more day. For One More Day is a great book that makes you think about your relationships with loved ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!!","review":"Albom is a one-trick pony and, I admit, I was suckered into buying this book. But, it will be the last one of his that I purchase. In a word \\"corny\\". I want the time back I wasted reading this book. He's only in it for the money, at this point. He's a hack, a sell-out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For One More Day is a must read...","review":"Mitch Albom does it again. I thought the Five People You Meet in Heaven was a wonderful quick read, but For One More Day was a book I gave as a gift this Christmas!In some ways, this book has a message for everyone. I know we have all wished for \\"one more day\\" with a loved one or a friend we have lost. The tears that were brought by the book, also leaves you with a lesson and a feeling of hope.The reader may reflect on things that were ignored or not appreciated in their life until someone is lost. Estranged family members may begin to think of the value of not letting that situation be permanent. Families can read it and realize the true value of family. It was lovely, and for me, too short, because I did not want it to end.However, the fact that it is a short book, will also make it appealing to those who are not avid reader!High praise for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...Just OK","review":"I am a bigger fan of Mitch Albom's sportswriting and columns than I am of his forays into fiction. There were points in the book that I thought were genuinely good, but for the most part, it just didn't do anything for me. (And, I love a good cry during books, so I was ready, willing and able! However, the sentiment seemed very forced.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"For One Moe Day","review":"Not as good as the other books.An interesting point of view not usually seen from a man's perspective.The end did not fit the book--did not link with it and felt as if it was tacked on at the last minute. It is a good summer read."},{"rating":"2","title":"For One More Day","review":"I really enjoyed this book as much as Tuesdays with Morrie and Five People you Meet in Heaven. Albom gets in the characters head and makes you part of his life. What more could you really ask for in a book?I think that a lot of people expects his books to solve your life's problems but that is not what it is about, it is a story that makes you think. It did and it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft & Sweet story","review":"A great reminder to say to friends and relatives the things you really want to share.

Good, fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy, saccharine","review":"Growing up in the 60s, I'd be amazed when a stuttering Mel Tillis would start singing and have a voice completely unlike his speaking voice. Same for Jim Nabors as well.Mitch Albom strikes me the same way. I have read his sportswriting and have seen him many times on ESPN's \\"The Sports Reporters\\" on every Sunday morning. Albom is a smart, funny, sarcastic and wonderful reporter. Yet he writes trash like this.For all those reviewers who say one should always love their mother, I suggest they volunteer at their local child protection agency. All mothers are not angels.The story is sappy and corny and Mitch milks it for all its false sentiment.Albom is a great writer, sad that he does stuff like this to pay his bills."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont remember getting this","review":"dont remember getting this, dont remember getting this, dont remember getting this, dont remember getting this, sorry im not sure"},{"rating":"1","title":"The 5 People You Meet in Heaven....Again?","review":"Ok, so Mitch Albom basically took The 5 People You Meet in Heaven, tweaked it a little and then changed the title to For One More Day.

I saw Mitch Albom on Oprah last week talking about it and the TV program which will be on tonight, 9 December. It looks promising!I got the book from the library yesterday and read it in one sitting.

Not only did it hold my interest, but I had to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next. It was simply told, very believable, and sentimental. It also filled me with emotions, happy and sad. It also made me believe in the eternal power of a mother's love. For the readers who have trouble staying interested in a story, this book will keep the interest there the whole way from the first to the last word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Albom book","review":"I was a little disappointed and don't know that I'd recommend it.

I plan to read it again. Mitch Albom is an expertly detailed author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crying Giant Tears in Kansas","review":"Beautifully written, heartfelt, and thought-provoking story reminding each of us to appreciate those who touch our lives in wonderful ways while they live. I usually pass on books I purchase to another reader, but I am keeping this one for my personal library. If you read it, you will cherish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gravely Disappointing","review":"Albom centers all of his works on the same subject matter: the preciousness and value of our time, of our lives. Unfortunately, For One More Day is largely predictable and somewhat absurd. The twists are so ludicrious that they are almost laughable.In Tuesdays with Morrie and The Five People You Meet in Heaven, Albom poignantly prompts us, the reader, to reflect on the direction and purpose of our lives because we are faced with people and characters who we cheer for; they have faced tragedy and buckled to it, like many of us, or overcome it, like many of us hope to do. In For One More Day, the main character, Charley, is pathetic. His obstacles and situtations are so incredibly forced and silly, as is much of the dialogue, that I was left wondering if Albom had run out of material after his first two books and scratched something together for publishing.Sorry Mitch...I loved your first two books, but this is defintely not you best effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life","review":"For One More Day, I liked the book, Actually I finished it in a weekend reading and although it did not reflect my life, could see where at 48 yrs old this would be close to the way many of our neighbors grew up and Mom ran the household and kept things together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it at all","review":"I read this one for a book club, but was so put off by the character that I could hardly get through it. Defintely could not bond with him. Lack of depth, spare writing style, overly sentimental, not interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet One More of Albon's Formula Books","review":"If you liked The Five People You Meet in Heaven, you'll like this one, too. I didn't care for the earlier book, and I didn't care much for this one either. Talk about a schmaltzy ( sp ? ) formula. The gazillion people who keep Albon's books on the best seller list must see something I don't. I suggest your $21.95 could be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very touching story","review":"It's rated a 4 because it took me a few minutes to understand exactly what was going onAfter I picked up on it I could not put it Down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning in a vat of syrup","review":"I was asked to read this book and did so with an open mind. The idea of exploring the emotions of a flawed desperate man ready to take his own life should have led any reasonable author to explore the minefield of emotions which must consume such a 'lost' individual. What do we get with this book? a lesson in silliness and overbearing sentimentality. It is a truly awful unintelligent book. The author does not appear to have been close to anyone who has been on the brink of suicide for the main character is a flat, cardboard cut-out without substance and who elicits not sympathy from the reader. His relationship with his dead mother is superficial and fails to uncover anything interesting to justify the storyline. Why am I wasting more time on it with this review? Time to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left disappointed","review":"I was very drawn by the premise of this story, but quickly tired after it began to go on and on with one boring cliché after another; it felt predictable and rather preachy. Only glad it was so short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Moving Novel By Mitch Albom","review":"I've read two of his books before: the well-known \\"Tuesday With Morrie\\" and \\"Five People You Meet In Heaven\\". I actually like this book more than \\"Five People You Meet In Heaven\\"; spending one more day with your dead mother already hooked me into reading this novel. I always like Mitch Albom's work because he writes simple story that carries many valuable lessons; \\"For One More Day\\" brings readers many worthy lessons and it explores the complicated relationships between family members. After reading this book, I learn to appreciate my family even more! This is a moving novel that nobody should miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to a mother's love","review":"For One More Day is much like Albom's previous novel about spiritual healing after discovering life's meaning. Albom takes the reader through a near death experience in which Charley, a depressed man who has destroyed every relationship and failed himself professionally, is blessed with spending one more day with his mother. On his way to his family home where he plans to commit suicide, Charley crashes his vehicle and encounters his deceased mother. He spends the day with her, but it isn't anything like any normal day. As they visit elderly women, he encounters truths about his mother's and father's divorce and the sacrifices she made for him. This is a touching story of a man finding closure through spending one more day with his mother and finding his own strength through forgiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad tale of \\"modern family values\\"","review":"This book was a well written depiction of the worst parts of our modern society. What a terrible waste of time to read about such a selfish man and his immature and indefensible choices. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sappy","review":"If you like sentimental, and like a selfish hero, you will like this book. Charley, the central character, was not someone I could relate to or would want to know. Whiny, selfish, and demanding, I was unable to care about him at all. From my perspective, the book was not short enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Pablum For The Dummies","review":"I guess Albom will just keep churning out this psychobabble but I'm done with him. At least I can say I never paid for any of his Oprahlit. Just wasted time at a library. Please don't make this huckster one cent richer. Buy something more edifying. Like toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!","review":"This was the WORST book I have read in a long time. I loved Mitch Albom's first two books very much. It was a no-brainer that I had to have this the minute it came out! I read it in about 3 hours with few interruptions (maybe less time, not sure as a nap could have come in somewhere there!) and all I can say is: WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT???? It was awful. It had no meaning, the characters were terrible, it had no message and it was plain boring. At the end, I thought there was a joke or something or that I was missing a few chapters. I sold it on Ebay the next day to another unsuspecting soul. It was so bad I wouldn't recommend it if it were the last book on earth. AWFUL!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book ever written","review":"Sappy, boring characters, totally predictable, cheezy. My guess is that Albom laughed the entire time he was writing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go and hug your mother","review":"This book will want to you to go and hug your mother if you are lucky enough to still have her around. This is a beautiful, poignant story about a son and his mother.The son has an accident and somehow in the haze of the accident is having a vision of one more visit with his mother, and revisits various periods of his child hood. I found especially touching the thoughts which he titles \\"Times when I did not stand up for my mother\\". He remembers all those little things in live where he could have done some-thing a little different and probably would if he only had one more chance. The story is delicate, nostalgic and warm. It is written in a very intimate way, as if you are listening to someone's thoughts. It is a beautiful story and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable read","review":"Having lost my dad suddenly at 12 I had him in mind while reading this and almost felt jealous of that time that Chick gets. It reminds you that nothing is so bad that you can't move past it, relationships can be mended. Its also a good smack in the head for me to find the time to visit with my own mother, despite my schedule and our strained relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUCHED MY HEART AFTER MY LOSS OF MY FATHER","review":"This is my favorite of all Mitch Albom's books. It is so close to how I felt after the loss of my father. More importantly, after the loss of my husband when I felt so much was left unsaid and undone for us. This book visits the part of your heart that wishes you could talk to your loved one just once more. What would you say? Would you experience closure? Most probably. I think I did. I found that even though we'll never get to physically see our loved ones again, they live on in our hearts. One day we will see them again and share again all the love that was there before. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Time for every purpose","review":"You know, for a sportswriter, this guy Mitch is a helluva story teller! I've read some other books by him but this one strikes a chord! The way you can tell if a book is good, to my mind, is that when you're reading it, you're thinking, remembering, wishing along with the protaganist in the story! As I read this book I found myself enjoying and wondering the ride I was on and guessing where it was finally going to take me. I think we all would welcome the opportunity to revisit a past moment with a loved one and have a chance to say those things we couldn't or wouldnt say at the time, or do that favor or undo that unkindness we visited on them. I know I wish I could take back some words I've said out of stupidity or laziness or whatever! This is weird but I kept thinking about that old Roberta Flack song (Killing Me Softly) while I went through it and I'm the better for it! Yes, I liked it, a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"moved","review":"I was sitting in the red carpet room at heathrow airport waiting for my flight and I reluctantly began reading \\"For One More Day.\\" Someone had passed the book to me as I was leaving my office a few days earlier. I typically do not like people to tell me that \\"You just have to read this book.\\" In this particular case my co-worker was right - I did have to read this book. I found myself surprised and moved by the story and more than once had to wipe tears from my eyes. I am lucky that my mother is still alive and relatively healthy but as soon as I landed I called my mother to tell her that I love her and that I thought she was/is a wonderful mother. I have since passed the book on to another co-worker with the instructions: \\"You just have to read this book!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening!","review":"This book was just as good as \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\". Albom's writing makes the character's feelings resonate throughout you. The writing style is slightly different than his other books, and includes entries throughout of clippings found throughout the character's home. The relationship between the main character and his parent's, and the transition it took once his father left is one that many readers will have experienced. This is an easy read, that will leave you feeling fulfilled in the end. If you have never read any of Mitch Albom's books, give him a try...he will not disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"Mitch Albom's 'For One More Day' is a book that makes you think about your life, and that of your loved ones. It touches the soul, and makes you think about the ambitions, dreams and fears that lie deep within. It forces you to come to grips with your own mortality, as well as that of your loved ones. This message and theme is also in Understanding: Train of Thought , which I found to be a refreshing and light philosophical read, full of insights and outlooks. These books make you think not only about life, but also about death. Sometimes you will carry away something special from a book, and these are two of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"For One More Day by Mitch Albom (book)","review":"This book is very endearing and heartwarming.

If you have lost a loved one, you know the depth of feelings the author could have reached for. Unfortunately, the book was a disappointment! The characters were flat and antipathetic. I felt absolutely no sympathy for the main character and his regrets, and certainly, I did not feel like he redeemed himself towards his mother on that last chance he had with her...at any level! How can you read a book based on this storyline and not shed a tear, or achingly long for your lost loved one? Have Mitch Albom write the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Summer Read","review":"I thought this storyline was great. Is there anyone who doesn't wish to have a second chance? I personally felt this was a better read than \\"Tuesdays With Morrie\\" but not quite as good as \\"Five People You Meet in Heaven\\". This book made me stop and think about how we all seem to take sides or ignore how we affect other people in our everyday living. I know I think twice now before I say or do anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For One more Day","review":"I enjoyed this book - I think that Mitch Albom is a great writerI still think that \\"Tuesday's With Morrie\\" was his best book, but this is a close second.This book makes you think about where you have been and who has been in your life - makes you think that you should live each day to the fullest and enjoy what you have today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has never re-crezted depth of first book.","review":"Nicely done - however only GTuesdays With Morrie really was fabulous - this seemed like fluff.sorry, I love this writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read and a Feel Good Book","review":"I enjoyed Tuesday's with Morie but did not enjoy The Five People you Meet in Heaven. I was a little hesitant to pick up this book since I didn't enjoy five people. I read for One More Day in one short evening and enjoyed it. I think everyone can relate to the reviewing regrets but this book also reviews good times as well. The final message of repairing relationships and the preciousness of life was clear. I enjoyed the method that the story was told with confusion of Chick when he meets his mother. I think this is worth reading and would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and maudlin","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book - read by the author - and resisted feeling emotions from the story because, I think, the writing and the author's voice just screamed at me FEEL SAD! THIS IS SO SAD! THIS IS SWEET! THINK THIS IS SWEET!I was intrigued by the description of the book and still think it's a very interesting idea for a story, but the character development in the story is so, so poor. By the end, I still felt like I knew the main character only in the vaguest of stereotypes-- a deadbeat dad with mommy and daddy issues. We are TOLD so much in this story and SHOWN so little, and I'm not sure how much of it was based on how annoying the author's voice was in reading this (srsly authors, never read your own book (attn: Mary Karr!)).Tuesdays with Morrie apparently is supposed to be great, but based on how much I didn't enjoy this book, I guess I'll never know if it is or isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crybaby!","review":"This gets my vote as the most depressing book ever written. The hero(?) is nothing more than spineless crybaby.

I find Tuesday's with Morrie a good blend of sentimentality and decent writing and storytelling. The Five People You Meet in Heaven leans more toward sentimentality, but I would still recommend it. For One More Day, however, is terrible. It is pure cheesiness and just kind of made me nauseaus, because the \\"seize the day\\" motif is so heavy handed. Work on your writing, Mitch, because this is just one big cliche!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitch does it again!!","review":"Mitch Albom does it again with \\"For One More Day\\". His other books include \\"The Five People You Meet In Heaven\\" and \\"Tuesdays With Mauri\\" were a hard act to follow but Albom was able to do it again.

All Mitch Albom books are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Had One More Day...","review":"I would hunt this Alborn fella down like the snake-oil salesman he is. He abuses weak people's desires to feel better by feeding them treacly motivational glop that appeals to their TV denuded emotions. Meanwhile, he reaps money by the ton. You can bet he feels good.

Towards the end of the movie, I found myself crying out for the pain to end. Most of the humor lies in the ridiculous slapstick category, which would make it a great children's movie if not for the constant sexual references (honestly, the funniest joke was the innuendo about the B-17). My only hope is that you see this review while trying to decide if you should purchase the DVD, and it makes you decide not to buy it. Epic Failure in the truest sense of the term."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Slapstick -","review":"Watched this movie because it was directed by Spielberg. Unfortunately, even Speilberg can't fix a dumb plot. It was hard to sit through, but I forced myself so that I could honestly say that I'd seen the entire video. This is not something to waste time or money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of talent","review":"This movie was just plain stupid despite all the great talent involved.

Tore it!","review":"A boring comedy with no sense of timing, made even worse in its \\"extended version\\". It's like a long joke badly told; you cringe all the way through it. Rule of thumb: avoid any movie referred to as \\"wild\\", \\"zany\\", \\"wacky\\", \\"crazy\\", \\"insane\\", \\"hysterical\\" or \\"screwball\\", unless you have a taste for forced humor, overkilled comedians, worn slapstick, or excruciating experiences in general.

World War II has arrived on American shores and California is in a panic with expectations that a Japanese attack is imminent. This movie could have a been a lot of fun. Heck, Spielberg had a wonderful cast to work with but he just blows it is endless scenes of the characters acting totally idiotic and yelling at each other. There is a LOT of yelling. It is so annoying. This film could have been hilarious but Spielberg goes the route of a total goofball comedy, and a very unfunny one at that, and he's not very good with the comedy chops here with this movie. \\"1941\\" is very long and very much a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"LM's reveiw.","review":"I think the movie has mostly jokes 4 people over the age of 12! im over that age so im mature enough. 11 and under probobly wouldnt understand most of the jokes.

Anyway i hope u enjoy this movie as much as i did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, disc not enhanced for widescreen","review":"1941 itself is an entertaining movie, and I have always enjoyed it thoroughly. I was quite shocked to buy the disc and find that first and foremost it is not enhanced for widescreen TVs, so you have to zoom to view it in the proper aspect ratio, thus distorting the resolution. Secondly, the colors on this print are very blurred. It was originally slapped onto DVD at the end of the '90s, well before the concept of cleaning prints and removing dust and fecks was common practice. In short, it still has not received this treatment and desperately needs it. Good movie, bad disc, a pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic-Just Classic","review":"What can you say about this movie that hasn't been said? This movie is pure comedy from start to finish. The all star cast is probably one of the greatest generations of comedic actors which we will ever see on film.

But don\`t let that bother you, it really is a very funny film.It all revolves around the fear of a Jap invasion of CA right after Pearle Harbour. There are plenty of nuts running wild and evenone or two reasonably sane characters. It\`s non-stop gags and non-stop laughs. If anything it\`s too wild and crazy. Not the besttiming, with too many things going on at once.Still, I give it 4 stars just for the shear number of laughs.

Even Mr. Spielberg himself said that he had no direction for this film. The acting was so cheesy. All it was, was a bunch of people going insane. Yelling and dancing, drinking, fighting, boom, boom, boom, boom, bang, bang, bang. Oh my God. Stop me. This is probably one of the worst films out there. Don't buy.

I don't even want to give this movie onestar. Surprised this bomb is still in print, it's truly a dawg. I picked it up in the library, I saw John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd, figured it would be good. Wrong.It is bad as it can get. Spielberg tried to use slapstick. It's continiously not funny.To think of all the stunts and wrecks and all the money that wasted making this film, and there are people starving.

Superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny film","review":"Although many people find this film largely unfunny I find it hilarious. They got John Belushi to play the same kind of character that he did in Animal House and, in my opinion, it works!! Dan Aykroyd is also as funny as ever, he gets a bump on the head and does some crazy things that are sure to make you laugh. This film is worth renting just to see John Belushi's many comedy falls and Dan Aykroyd's impression of a bug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viciously Underrated","review":"One of my favorites. The only reason why critics had such a great time bashing this film was because it wasn't Jaws or Close Encounters. But then, a lot of films aren't (1941 DID win two Oscars, you know). This is a very funny film about the (very real) hysteria that gripped the west coast after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and its source material was taken from actual historic events such as the Zoot Suit Riots of 1942 and the paranioa-induced air-raid of LA by non-existant planes. Widescreen is the ONLY way to see this film, and while the director's cut runs a little long (2:20) the added footage makes the story make a lot more sense. The dance scene alone is worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT MISS!","review":"1941 is undoubtably one of the greatest movie comdey classics of all time. The setting is from the day after Pearl Harbour to Pearl Harbour +6 and contains some of the driest and yet funniest humor usually associated with a Monty Python production. This is clearly one of the funniest movies ever produced and comes highly recommended. THIS IS DEFINATELY STEVEN SPIELBERG'S BREAKOUT MOVIE. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This is a bad re-mix of a great movie. First, they got the screen aspect wrong. Second, the restored footage is of very poor quality. It's easy to see what new scenes have been added... just look for the blurry parts!I loved this movie at the theatre and on VHS. Too bad that when I wanted to purchase it on DVD there's now only this garbage version available.Not worth a nickel in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"1941","review":"I didn't enjoy this movie. It hit me as being rather stupid. I didn't even watch the whole movie because I got bored with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIrectors cut not as good as original version.","review":"I personally think the original version is better. I saw the movie when I was young and was very upset with the new footage. I my opinion there was a reason the movie was cut. It was too much and the characters were rightly shown in the theatrical version. This is a great movie with an impressive all-star cast. The characters were strong enough to stand alone without any stephen king style over explanation. If anyone knows if the original exists then please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak but funny movie, terrible DVD","review":"I agree with those who say that this movie, while stupid, is still funny. No one, though, has said how truly bad this DVD is. I have about 150 in my collection, and \\"1941\\" is one of the worst for video quality. The print is murky and scratched. Colors are faded. It almost looks as bad as a VHS tapes; in some ways it's worse. On VHS, at least there is the excuse of that being why the quality is bad. On DVD, Universal has only itself to blame. Others in the Universal \\"Collectors Series\\", like \\"Dante's Peak\\" and \\"Apollo 13\\" have been great examples of what DVD can do. I know that \\"1941\\" was delayed a couple of times due to production problems. It probably should have been canceled, or at least held up until a full digital restoration could be completed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip the extended version, the shorter one is better","review":"First of all, I think you should watch the original, shorter version of this movie. The extended version has some scenes that slow down the pace and aren't really necessary.I really like the sheer zaniness and energy it has. It only seems to slow down a few times here and there to introduce a new character or story element and then it's back to the fun! If you like fast-paced slapstick or silly comedies then you'll probably enjoy this one.I'd probably compare it with Time Bandits or Monty Python and the Holy Grail. They don't take themselves too seriously and always make me smile when I think about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfunny movie, bad DVD","review":"Others have written about how unintentionally unfunny this picture is. And I agree. Even with character actors like Joe Flaherty, John Candy, Slim Pickens, and Ned Beatty, everything falls flat. But what really depressed me about the Collectors Edition DVD was the poor quality of both video and audio. The DVD is NON-anamorphic, which would have kept me from purchasing it had I known. On top of that, there's this fuzzy, vaseline-on-the-lens effect to much of it, which I assume was the intent of the filmmakers and not a flaw of the DVD. But it's really pretty distracting now. And even though the DVD has a 5.1 audio track, the audio is distorted and clipped.If you really want to own this movie, wait for (or look for) an anamorphic transfer that has an improved soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies ... seriously!","review":"I can't help myself -- I LOVE this movie. I think it's one of those flicks you either love or absolutely despise.From the opening sequence (a hysterical send-up of the \\"Jaws\\" opening) to the final crazy madness, I couldn't stop laughing. Yes, the story is ridiculous (the \\"love story\\" especially is kind of dumb, and the \\"sex only in an airplane\\" is just stupid), but from what I've heard from older family members who lived in that part of the world in 1941, the movie accurately depicts the attitudes of many folks -- the near hysteria over possible additional attacks, the civilian look-outs, etc. OK, so maybe it's a *little* exaggerated in this movie, but it was very real at the time.Everyone's sense of what's funny and what isn't is different, so this will definitely not appeal to EVERYONE. But I count it among my favorite movies -- along with \\"A Letter to Three Wives,\\" \\"Raising Arizona,\\" \\"Singing in the Rain,\\" and \\"Joe vs the Volcano.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"1941... if I had a time machine I would love to see how it really was.The movie is awesome; a lot of know talent and \\"legends\\" of our time.

HORRID!!! Having recently viewed it, I found it extremely difficult to find jokes or anything structured like a joke anywhere in this so called comedy.

I just saw alot of people yelling tojo and jap and John Belushi acting like an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only its mother could love it.","review":"I began collecting DVDs recently and the only disc I regret buying thus far is 1941. You see, I was tempted by the exhaustive extras and the chance to see Spielberg's director's cut. Don't fall into the same trap, dear readers. This film is bad. I got as far as 25 minutes in and decided I couldn't take anymore. It's a film which believes that there is a goldmine of comedy to found in shouting, falling over, and then shouting again. Not funny. If sitting in front of an animated corpse was bad enough, it turns out the extras are a chore, too - the dullest being a very long, very boring documentary about the making of the film in which all involved (who should have known better) recount in nauseating detail how the film came to be. A waste of time and money - theirs and yours"},{"rating":"1","title":"One word says it all: TERRIBLE","review":"Hey listen, I'm a HUGE fan of John Belushi, but this my be one of the worst movies you'll ever see.

They tried to have John Belushi play the same type of character as in Animal House and it turned out to be a disaster.

If this film had any comedy in it, I'd love it too. Unfortunately, this is just a frenetic and pointless attempt at humor that explodes into two plus hours of tedium. There is abundant talent here, but it is rarely used. The sparsity of plot, which usually works in comedy's favor, here, just highlights how sad the jokes are. There is scarcely a laugh in the entire movie.How anyone can take a fantastic cast like this, and create a bomb like this is beyond me.

Check other parodies, like Dr. Strangelove which is shoter and much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty watchable for a bad movie","review":"\\"1941\\" is a complete mess with a whole lot of unfunny forced jokes and an awful screenplay (by Robert Zemeckis and John Milus). It's clear that Spielberg is a talented filmmaker who doesn't quite have the knack for choosing good scripts. While nearly everything he did before this was gold (including \\"Duel\\" and \\"The Sugarland Express\\")... he was obviously at a loss for how to handle a slapstick comedy. That said, his talent does shine through in a lot of scenes. There's a pretty fun dance number, the special effects for the plane chase through Hollywood haven't dated a bit, and how can anyone resist a movie that pairs up Toshiro Mifune and Christopher Lee? Maybe the casting of Mifune wasn't such a good choice, because I couldn't root against him, even while he was plotting to blow up Hollywood. I just couldn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't Anamorphic...","review":"All story points aside (I loved it as a kid and couldn't wait to see it again), this presentation is NOT anamorphic, not enhanced for 16x9 screens.

We have laminate flooring and thought it would be a good energy burner for the rainly winter. It works smoothly on the flooring and my son can make some tight turns on it and really get around the house on it after only a week of using it. For the first week he used his feet on the floor to push it around even though I kept trying to explain to him to just turn the wheel. Suddenly he figured it out and is quite proud of himself. The same night he also figured out how to back it up to make a tight turn. The only hazard I can see is sometimes if he leans over too far during a turn he can tip over and fall off but he is hardly moving fast enough to hurt himself just going down a hallway. I'd keep an eye on younger children using it outside as they can get up some speed if the surface is smooth enough, but overall a fun, battery-free car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manuver ability for the child","review":"Learns a child manuver ability, particularly to give him more upper strength.

Though this was a gift, this is one of the the WORST TOYS I have seen in years. To the point of a scam! Perhaps it would work better indoors and destroy your floors. It did not work outside. The way it is designed to generate forward motion like a skateboarder uses side to side motion, the wheels are hard plastic and would generate very little forward motion. A push car would be better. In a period of two days the wheels were ground down. This product is so bad I'm looking for what plastics were used so that I can break it down for recycling as the raw materials are worth more than the product it's self.

They are both three and active. The car is great for kids since it is low to the ground, not like a bike that they can fall off of. They move really fast. At first, they could not get it to go by moving the wheel. Instead, they moved it by using their feet. This might be tough for an older child, although they would then have the coordination to use the steering column. It was great fun on Christmas morning. The mommies and daddies rode it too, which speaks to the strength and durability of these cars. Another good thing about them is that they are light weight and can be transported with you on outings to parks or other places where kids can ride them.

It has withstood, wind, hail, rain, snow, way below zero for weeks on end, heat...

I'm surprised that no label templates are provided for Microsoft word.The hardware is also not well-designed. It fails to print for no obvious reason with no debug information. It also mangles labels that do print by pulling up label separators during the printing process.Dymo technical support was not helpful; I used their website chat support and they were not able to help me make the printer work. I'd like to think that as an engineer, I'm fairly savvy about how things work, but I have not able to get the printer to perform well.I would not recommend this label printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it - needed one years ago","review":"We have business that provides payment choices for merchants.

We do a fair amount of first class mailing to the same people and it is much easier to quickly print a single label than to print an envelope.The printer works very well. Excellent, in fact.

EVER. It jams every time I want to print a label and when I press the feed button, it prints a bunch of blanks and wastes the very expensive labels that you have to buy from them. I have never before encountered such a poorly designed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy - Designed to Fail","review":"I've owned and re-owned many DYMO label printers while running my own home based business and use them for a variety of my product labels. Be warned, after owning and re-purchasing many of these in the hope one would last, I have given up. These will work fine until one small label gets wrapped around the feeder then they will massively print out blank labels or get jammed to where your only options are micro surgery with tweezers for many hours or re-purchasing a new printer.The rolls of labels are insanely expensive even if you try to get generic brand.I have even had sales people try to sway me from buying these because of the amount of problems they have. It's true please take it from someone who has used these waayy past the point of patience: These are HORRIBLE printers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great printer if you really only need a single","review":"In this day & age, I'd recommend a dual label printer. Once you get one, you'll be addicted and you'll wish you had a doubleshot. Having the ability to print two label sizes without replacing the roll ever time is really a convenience.That being said, this is a great model but it doesn't print postage. You need a Turbo for that feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it promised, but darker than expected.","review":"This brand of wax is great.

It says \\"Chestnut\\" wax... that means dark brown. They sent me Neutral... which is basically white. I needed the Chestnut because it helps cover gray hairs in my moustache. The neutral wax actually accentuates the grays, makes the whole stache appear waxy and white. Unfortunately I did not find out it wasn't what I ordered until I opened the package and used the product.This seller should pay more attention to what product is being sold. Maybe he ran out of Chestnut and just sent what he had on hand. I don't know. Either way I had to go to a beauty supply store to buy the right color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reckless","review":"When Kat Adair dives into the river to rescue the object of her secret crush,David Turnberry, she quickly learns she has plunged into more than she bargained for. First, Hunter Macdonald tries to rescue her, needlessly. Then, she fakes amnesia to get closer to David for a little longer. However, that ruse does not last until the water gets hot. Then, she is rewarded with the chance to come along on an Egyptian expedition with the noble family. However, Kat is lovely, albeit not of the gentry. She could easily steal the hearts of the men along on the journey, including David, who is virtually promised to another. To save her from being expelled, Hunter marries her. It is never merely a convenient marriage, they do have a real attraction, but can it be love?** The amnesia plot that begins the book seems rather pointless, and it is never clear what Kat sees in David. However, this is a fairly entertaining read that moves quickly. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for your health","review":"I could have easily bought this item from a vitamin store but it would have cost me more money.

Once I finally RECEIVED this and opened it, the label says that there actually is only 1000 mg of CLA in each capsule.So, if you are comparison shopping, like I was, to get the best price per dose, this labeling will lead you wrong.

It's loaded with stereotypes, gives no real opera information, and is at least one-third filler. Mystery fans, it's not a very satisfying mystery. The detective, \\"Pryde of the Yard\\", is both rude and dense. The best parts of the book contain the two cleaning women, both of them a hoot, one of them the brightest character in the book. There are many excellent mysteries, some with opera as a background; this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photocopy?","review":"It is just a poor quality photocopy masquerading as a digital book.

I look forward to more!","review":"This is the first book I've read of Kathleen Morgan's but it won't be the last. Her characters are compelling and very human. Their struggles to trust God & His will for their lives even when they don't understand it are very realistic and certainly speak to my heart. Vartan, the gifted warrior, first doesn't see why he needs a power greater than himself. He relies on his skills and abilities. Then, when he is placed in a situation where he no longer has all his physical abilities, he struggles with anger against a God who would allow all this to happen to him. His journey of faith is one that will be very familiar to many.The story itself is an epic adventure; a struggle between good and evil.

It's clumsily written and the \\"shocking\\" sexual situations are the most common that you could imagine. Still, it's a lot of fun, a guilty pleasure with some mystery and grace- just not much. I enjoyed it thoroughly and would read anything this author wrote even though I might hide it under the bed if I had dinner guests."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word...","review":"Tedious. It's rare that I speed through a book solely for the purpose of getting to the end of it so I can throw it down and get to a better book, but this was certainly the case with \\"Lunch\\". This formula has been done before, more engagingly and intricately, by better writers. The author's attempt at provocation fails miserably and the book reads like an over-dramatized romance novel with a buffoon for a central character. The author also has a tendency to build up to nothing which I first noticed in \\"Belladonna\\", (which was, nevertheless, better written and more engaging than \\"Lunch\\", due to the narrator's viewpoint of the story and a more developed plot and central characters). This novel may have been quite the scandal if it were written in 1940, but it certainly doesn't cut it today. Lunch? No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I devoured \\"Lunch\\"","review":"This is not the type of book I normally read, but I'm glad I took a chance on \\"Lunch.\\" As a writer myself, I found Moline's tale thoroughly compelling. Her characterization's sharp and believable, her narrative as breathless and urgent as the relationship between her protagonists, and though her dialogue's a little off, it didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of her story. Nick and Olivia's haunting affair tapped into something deep with my soul, and I'm not at all sure how I feel about that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I really enjoyed the mix of rock with some sweet ballads.

It is not a terribly accurate book but all of the main points are true. To make it more interesting for people not horribly interested in history he added some details that are not entirely clear in the historical record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little book","review":"This is a great little book. A little different, and maybe not quite as profound as Mahfouz' more modern stuff, but a very worthwhile read nonetheless. The themes of religious impact, the relative nature of truth, and the complexity of human motivation are all the more powerfully portrayed by the fact that these characters are supposed to have lived some 3500 years ago. Some things never change. This slim volume can be read in one, or at most two, sittings, so do yourself a favor and pick up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmm","review":"This is an engrossing book but entirely historically inaccurate. It has fallen into the pit so common with writers on Akhenaten in that it tries to romanticise this king. First of all, Akhenaten did believe in the Aten, that was his one and only G-d. Nefertiti was not Akhenaten's only love. He is known to have had many wives including his daughter, Merytaton. Nefertiti probably died, and Smenkhare did suceed Akhenaten. He was not a pacifist and is known to have fought some very successful campaigns. Besides this however, the book provided some interesting reading, and though I disagree with its interpretation of the sun king, one should read it anyway, at least if one also reads some Alan Gardiner to unbias him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beguiling","review":"Okay, I confess: I plagiarized the adjective beguiling from the back cover, but it was the best one word phrase I could come up with to describe this quirky book. In some senses, it reminds me of a detective narrative, a kind of Egyptian Oedipus who is searching for the \\"truth.\\" The story in this case revolves around this monotheistic pharaoh and his peculiar religious leadership and reign. I'm not an expert at the history of the period -- my above reviewer points out several inaccuracies which if true would be disappointing to me. After reading 15 or so different interviews of those close to Akhenaten, some of the mysteries are resolved. It's a short read and quite a unique narrative that will transplant you to ancient Egypt. It's amazing at times how modern the narrative feels. How much really separates sexual escapades of someone like Clinton from those of the ancients? Not much as we see from our study of history. A bit offbeat, but a good read on an intriguing subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Akhenaten: Dweller in Truth","review":"If you are interested in Egyptian history, particularly the enigmatic Akhenaten -- the pharoah who attempted to convert his people to mono-theism -- you will enjoy this novel. Interesting theory, even if you don't agree with the premise. Mahfouz's writing is, as always, excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!!!!! not for TV,VHS, or DVD players","review":"As others state this is a 6 pin S-video, not for use with TV, VHS, or DVD S-Video plug in.Newer TV'S dont have S-Video anymore, so you must use the poor picture quality RCA cables on most VHS players.

This work is the opposite. It is ironic that a supposed how-to on instructions does not get to any hows by page 54, where I quit reading. This is an almost 400 page tome, and considering the author's reputation as an information presentation expert, it was frustrating to not find quickly, at-a-glance, the locale of the meat of this book. I was plodding through it sure that I would refute other reviewers low ratings, but after falling asleep the second time while reading it, I threw in the towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total fraud","review":"This book was assigned reading in a technical writing course I took in college. It is quite simply the worst thing I have ever seen in print. The book is supposed to be about giving and receiving information efficiently, yet it is filled with dozens of misspelled words and grammatical errors. It looked like it was written by an 8 year-old.It's filled with silly cartoons and information that alternates between obvious and useless.

The authors begin with Alexander Cartright and Abner DoubleDay, and just keep on going. There's a lot here in these readable pages, from personalities like Cap Anson, Babe Ruth, Cy Young, Willie Mays, Pete Rose, etc., to some of the more more successful and more colorful teams, key World Series', etc. The book covers each era, from the post-civil war teams of the later 1800's, to the dead ball era, the roaring 1920's, the Depression and War years, postwar baseball, expansion, etc. Hard core fans will recognize many of the anecdotes, but there's so many here that some are bound to be new.

(You may recall, that Daniel Okrent was heavily featured in the PBS series)The only missing element that would cause me to bump my ratings to 5 stars would be(you guessed it) photos.With the unearthing of Charles Conlon's negatives they would have a trove of other 18,000 images to choose from - most of which have yet to be published in this half of the century. (Only a fraction of these incredible images made it into the Abram's book, \\"The Golden Age of Baseball\\")Of course, this would drive the cost of the book up and possibly detract from the wonderful stories here - I wonder out loud if it isn't perfect just the way it is...Never the less, you will be all the poorer if this book in not in your baseball library, photos or not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's unfortunate that Mr. Winchell didn't check out the other side of the story before writing this book.

I was interested in reading a novel that was inspired by events that I had had a front row seat in viewing. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed. The author was too close to the situation and sacrificed a good story for too much unnecessary detail.

Still I recommend this piece 'cause I bet you'll like the performer. I'm gonna get me more of his records: he's REALLY good! How come I never heard of him? Amazing... thanks to Naxos once more for this series.

I mean, I am a total Conner-and-Liz freak, but the whole thing was getting old, ya know? Anyways, this was a great book where Ken is finally REALLY back on the team and he's kind of taking advantage of Maria, and Maria is the only one who sees it.

I know everyone hates them, but Will and Melissa are my favorite characters, they flavor to the series. Ken and Maria was a dissapointment, I love them together. I just hope he doesn't hook up with Melissa, which might actually happen. The Conner thing is getting really old, they need to solve it. I am glad they are fading out the twins, they get dull real fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This book was awful. It rushed through everything WAY too quickly. The Conner/acholic dilemma sums up to a huge confrontation WITH his sister which COnner hates, and walks out. Ken and Maria break up. Will refuses to see Melissa which makes her totally bummed. You have to feel sorry for her. Oh, and you don't know if Jeremy and Jade are back together or not. Jade thinks they are, but I don't think so because Jeremy is flirting with Jessica full time. There's MAJOR confusion there. Also, Jade FINALLY gets fired.

I followed this up with a Nano for my wife and was very happy with the improvements, even if it was not as tough as the mini.The iPod Video blew me away. For those of you who wonder if you can really watch a show on that so-called little screen, the answer is a definitive yes. It is bright, clear and large enough when holding to cause you to forget you are watching that sized screen. Everything about this one is better--battery life, brighter screen, unit size, memory.I bought the 80G version and highly recommend it. The only (minor) downside with the black is that it can hold fingerprints, but with a protective cover--which is recommended--this is a non-issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch, a bit small though","review":"I like the watch, I wish it were a little bigger though.

After reading dozens of reviews I ordered this Analog-Digital model, and I heartily recommend it as a best buy. It's accurate, stylish, functional, and dependable, with an easily viewed date/time window. The resin strap band is a welcome and comfortable alternative to other watch bands that I find objectionable since they are either made of leather (produced from the skin of cruelly abused and dead animals, no thank you!) or painfully heavy and ill-fitting metal bands.

I have had my Casio AW49HE-1AV for about four months and to tell you the truth, I don't even know where it even is right now. Why? The digital display is so small and with the gold background and the dark LCD numbers, is very hard to see. It is a good idea and looks good but for practicality and useage is not a good deal. With the cost of these sport watches as low as they are, I have replaced mine with one that has a larger number display and a lighter background.

You can quickly fix that by wiping it with any compounding material. You can use either car polish or even something like Comet or Ajax cleanser.

You have to build the side panel exactly right otherwise the panel well curve and you can't fit it to the craft.However, you if have a kid, who wants to play with this product after it is built, it seems to me that it is very big and heavy for a kid to play with. Also there are some parts that are snapped on to the main body which may be loosely fitted.After it is built, it is fitted on a stand.

My family loves waffles but 99% of them come from Eggo. I'm not a big fan of super thick Belgian waffles so I thought this would be a good compromise. Turns out it makes something more akin to a waffle pancake or thick crepe. I could not get them crispy though they would get very dark in color when I turned the dial up to 5. To give you a sense of the finished product, think of something about 30% thinner than an Eggo. I ended up returning mine to Amazon and will try out another make/model.The design, controls, etc were all very good, though the darkness control was oddly loose.

The batter got into all kinds of little crevices in the control part and I can't clean it very easily. Also the top of the iron is stainless steel and it discolored on the very first use.

It is rare that one scene can make an entire movie worth the purchase price but the scene in which Quinn and Hayworth dance is that scene. Quinn uses the moves of a matador with Hayworth dancing the part of the matador's twirling cape in her rose colored gown.

The use of color is spectacular, with brilliant blues and reds, and sets filled with shadows and light. The scene where we first see Rita Hayworth, a pre-corrida prayer, is an exquisite example.The music by Alfred Newman is wonderful, and the marvelous guitar selections played by Vicente Gomez are a treat. The bullfight scenes are good, but very sanitized, and the one with the young Juan, practicing at night, is terrific.I would have given this 5 stars, but for the casting of Tyrone Power as Gallardo. It's apple pie and milk instead of paella and vino tinto, and misses the mark by a mile. In the small part of the new matador that takes Gallardo's place in the ring and in Rita's heart, Anthony Quinn steals the show. He doesn't have Powers' eyelashes, but has the passion and intensity that would have made this film great had he been the leading man."},{"rating":"1","title":"My one word review, ponderous.","review":"The only Tyrone power movie I have not liked!

Chatwin in particular was heavily influenced by this book. It is the story of Robert Byron's efforts to see large brick burial towers located in Persia. Or at least that it was what Byron said he was looking for. The book is more a depiction of his misadventures -- he was suspected of being a spy by most who met him, although there was no truth to this. The style of this book is highly innovative; rather than presenting a straight narrative, it is (or appears to be) a collection of diary entries, newspaper stories, anecdotes, and cultural analysis. This makes the book sound themeless, but Byron's personality holds it together. This book should be on a short list of the best travel books in the English language."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest travel books, at least.","review":"A wonderful book: some of the best descriptions of architecture in English; comic dialogue; observations on the politics of the countries he travels through - and the sense of a robust, awkward, narrator throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red sheet","review":"I bought this no for reading but to use in my flashlite for night viewing.

CDRs are known to have compatibility problems when used in a different computer from the one used to create them.The CD consists of two tracks, one with frog sound, the other supposedly does not. However, I heard frog sound in the second track as well, although it is not as frequent as the first. It is very annoying especially if you listen to it at night while trying to sleep.The recordings are clear, with no static hissing sound. But I am very disappointed that the editorial review does not reveal that it contains frog sound. Also, I wish the CD were professionally made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"The third in the \\"Truth\\" series, this one seemed a bit more predictable to me than is typical of this author.

This was the worst in the series by far; it was literally a chore to drag myself through the end. All the stuff about Eddie Kroll is just completely irrelevant and stupid and detracts from what's supposed to be the main story. Nina was also incredibly stupid and annoying, and as other reviewers have mentioned the killer was quite obvious and the resolution a mess. By the time I got to the end I was just finishing it to finish it and was completely unconcerned and uninvolved in what was happening. A terrible read; the first two (Cold Truth: A NovelandHard Truth: A Novel) are worth borrowing, but this one isn't even worth that. Lacks suspense, romance, mystery, humor--it doesn't have a single redeeming quality.

In fact, they actually list this mode as working with XP and Win2k, but not Vista.Well, this is bad news for me since I paid about 4 times as much for this card as I could have for a 54G PCI card, because foolishly I thought Netgear products in the same line (Rangemax) would work with each other and with the operating system they are advertised to work with.

The lead woman meets a man onboard, who she starts having a shipboard romance with, only to ultimately wonder if he is the hit-man. Yes, it is a pretty lame idea, especially for Heller.

I couldn't get it to work with the yellow box, eventually got frustrated and removed it. The tubing by itself (and water once you get the bubbles out of it) worked great thereafter. Bottom line: do not waste your $24 on this thing. Go down to Home Depot, buy 20' of 3/8\\" clear vinyl tubing, clamp off the ends with a couple of those black springy binder clips from your office, and add a little food coloring to the water to make it more visible.

It was not expensive, so if you're handy and more patient than I am, give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good level","review":"Used it once so far for leveling cabinets in a kitchen. The alarm went on and off every time the water got to the mark or above. the only potential problem I saw was if I tugged on the tubing I could get the sensing unit to tilt and throw it off a bit. I filled it by using a gallon jug set on the counter and got a siphon going. The alarm feature does depend on the conductivity of the water so keep the contacts clean and maybe add a pinch of salt to the water. If you have 2 people one can watch the unit to tell as you get close to level (but the whole piont of the alarm is to make it a one person tool). I used it in conjunction with a laser since a minor adjustment to the laser can dramatically effect the elevation 15 feet out. I marked the far wall left and right with this level at several reference points and then set the laser line to go through them. I could then check any elevation of the cabinets ( front, back & side to side) any where in the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource!!!","review":"Actually, I'm a pre-teen but I'm glad my parents got this book.

I enjoyed the other book and thought this one would be as pleasing having greater depth of cited proof and width of cultural exposure. I am said to say that I did not find it convincing and this book showed a lack of credence in the argument it presented with little if any citation from verses within the Bible. I expected better from the author based on other material."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the right book for the right tool","review":"The book helped me alot through my master thesis in self-assessment and also to practice the tool in my company. It helps every one who wants to know more about why organizations need the self-assessment tool, the various models available for assessment, and the different approaches for implementing self-assessment. The only negative is that it does not include case studies. Any way I did not expect that one book can contain every thing I want.... But the book supplies me with 90% of what I need to know about the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Video Reproduction","review":"Just bought this DVD,the video is very blurred that you cannot make out the actual photoshop palette's so essentially loosing what the author is trying to tell you, they should have rather used a real time capture of the screen directly on the computer and merged it into the DVD.In fact the lessons would have been better as apple movies on a DVD that you can simply click each one and follow the movie while practising live on photoshop,Also sample files and photos would have been great,the american twang also gets irritating as well.I have over 8 years photoshop experience and 20 years in the photographic and computer industry and have seen many \\"free\\" lessons that are far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"The product is sticky and it stays on the fur.

The fact is that this camera takes excellent pictures, but it eats batteries so fast (so UNBELIEVABLY fast) that I have to give it one star. I am using AA rechargeables and I am lucky if the batteries last two days or over 20 pictures. It really is that bad. Forget about movie mode or using the LCD screen. I've never had a camera die on me so many times, and I've only had this camera about two weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I bought this camera last year. After taking 3 pictures it stopped working. It would not open properly and sometimes when it opened it would not close. It eats batteries at a ridiculously fast rate.

A very expensive and disappointing experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic camera","review":"I am not a great photographer, but with this camera, I take great pictures.

The delay time in between photos with this camera is almost non-existent. It has many other great features and settings, which are overshadowed by the excitement of finding a camera with a short delay and decent zoom. Two small negatives? The camera isn't tiny, and I don't like the lens cap - but at least it's attached with a little strap. This is a GREAT camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Buoy","review":"I love the camera.

After a few call with KODAK it was determined that the backup battery was dead in BOTH cameras.....and here is the BAD part.....they are internal in the camera and must be replace by a servicing technician at $80 per camera!!!%%%%###%%%!!!Needless to say I am NOT happy about this. All KODAK can do is appologize and say ...there is nothing we can do about it. I have been a long time KODAK customer BUT that ends with these 2 cameras. VERY DISAPPOINTED in thier customer service.

It takes decent night time pictures.The 12x optical zoom is fantastic, I never use digital zoom as it degrades the quality of the picture.I couldn't be happier and I would recommend this camera to anyone. For the price it can't be beat.I would also recommend purchasing a couple of rechargeable Klic-8000 battery clones and charger from Ebay.Of course you need a decent size SD card, at least a 1GB card or higher capacity.

Great speed in start up and between pictures, a ton better than the dx7590. Image stabilization not worth mentioning, can't really tell that it does anything. Good manual controls. GREAT price for a 7mp 12x zoom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kodak Customer Service is Awful!","review":"I bought this camera 10 months ago. Although it was fairly easy to use and took great shots it keeps breaking down. After contacting someone at Kodak they had me pay for shipping to send it to Precision Camera Repair who decides whether or not it is under warranty. I included that I had to pay for shipping because everything else Ive had to send in for repairs the company paid for the shipping. After mailing the camera it somehow takes weeks for them to get it. Then each time they decide its not under warranty and will cost me in the vicinity of $140.00 for repairs....PLUS Shipping. I will NEVER buy another Kodak product I dont care how good of pictures they take... this product is obviously poorly made and if the company is not willing to back it up...Im surely not going to. By the way, the Fuji I bought several years ago and gave to my kids may not look pretty however it still works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Camera.","review":"I'm very happy with this camera. The pictures are crisp and vibrant. The video quality is not that good (it is not ment to shoot video). The 12x optical zoom is fantastic and with the digital zoom you can see even farther. It is a bit bulkier than the point n shoot, so it might take a while to adjust. The 2.5 inch LCD screen is good. About the rechargeable batteries, do not purchase \\"Kodak KLIC-8000 - Camera battery Li-Ion 1600 mAh\\" battery as we dont have a charger for this battery. Kodak claims that the charger \\"Kodak K7500-C Battery Charger Kit\\" can be used to charge the KLIC-8000 battery, but it does not work out. I had to return the charger because it was not able to charge the KLIC-8000 battery which i purchased. The battery that came with the camera has lasted for quite a while though.

I'm not aware of any physical damage this encountered, but there was nothing I could do. Kodak does not have their own repair center or customer service people, they use service centers for both. All I learned from this is that Kodak is no longer a REAL company and their products should be avoided at ALL costs!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"My husband purchased this camera for me for my birthday in May. I had only had it 4 months when the lens froze up on me. It had to be serviced and was found to have had an \\"interface\\" problem with the lens. When I received it back it was less than a month before it \\"froze\\" up on me again. This time I was able to take the battery out and put it back in and it went back to \\"normal\\". I took this issue up with the retailer where it was purchased and with a letter to Kodak and neither could replace the defective camera. While it is user friendly, I am very dissapointed in Kodak for the way they handled my situation. This camera should have held up better and for longer than 4 months before needing service. I had a Kodak prior to this one, but doubt I will purchase another because of the service and product quality of the camera.

Over the first year of use, I mailed the camera in three times for repairs. The first time they performed their usual clean-and-return treatment. The second time they kept it for two weeks and mailed it back untouched (a fact that they confirmed during later phone calls).

I am an intermediate exerciser who likes to work up a sweat without the steps being too complex. I do this video on risers. It is 30 min of pure basic step so if you're into complex choreography, then you'll be bored. Some say it is repetitive, but I like doing the move enough times to know what I am doing and to benefit from it! I am not at the point where I want fancy footwork. The stretch at the begining and end were good and it was set to classical music which I thought was nice! The class seemed like a real class of exercisors. I recomend it to you if you want a good heart pumping workout without complicated moves! The negatives of this DVD is the production quality such as some blurry spots and the music is rather faint. In any case, it's still a good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUGH!!!","review":"OMG this workout was so hard for me that I had to actually stop two or three times to catch my breath.

Even though the instructor is pretty friendly and cuing is not a problem, she is constantly off-beat with the awful music. I had to force myself through it and not look at the screen because she was so out of synch. I worked up a sweat because I was using 2-lb hand weights but it was just not motivating to do. The 10-minute toning section consisted of a couple of leg lifts and push ups. I think the best part was the warm-up, but it was longer and slower than I'm used to.

If you instead love all types of people but do not accept that everything they do is perfect, then this book is NOT for you. The gay overtones in this book are quite heavy, especially when the author writes that the two male penguins \\"must be in love.\\"This book presents homosexual relationships as healthy and a good environment for rearing children - it's dangerous to indoctrinate your kids with these false notions. Tolerance is good and it is a virtue, but acceptance is not. I can tolerate immoral behavior, but I don't have to accept it, and this book overtly and needlessly glorifies the idea of homosexuality.Since the book was written, the penguin couple has split-up; Silo left his male companion for Scrappy, a female penguin. This too tests our acceptance and is a testimony to diversity. Will there be a follow-up book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roy and Silo offend the sanctity of marriage","review":"I was reviewing new children's books when I came across this one. My fear is that the modeling of Roy and Silo is a direct attack upon the sanctity of my marriage to my wife. Our 6-year old daughter might be swayed into believing that homosexual couples are capable of loving as deeply as heterosexuals. Both Rush Limbaugh and Bob Bennett commented correctly that this book degrades the purity of our traditional marriages. I mean no offense to those who choose that lifestyle, but protecting kids should be our first priority."},{"rating":"1","title":"A political book and no longer a true story!","review":"I don't know if this was the intent of the author but from appearance this book is a \\"politically correct\\" statement to push the idea of homosexual relationships on children. That idea itself is shameful given the age this is directed at.And now this \\"true story\\" is no longer true. Silo eventually found a female mate and no longer is considered \\"homosexual\\".In fact, if you look up the case of Silo and Roy, you will note that the zookeepers wanted to introduce female mates but the gay organizations argued against it so the zookeepers backed off (thus leaving the two male penquins alone). If the zookeepers were allowed to do their job, rather than appease political correctness, these two birds probably would have had female mates and their own offspring years ago. Thus, I feel environment was the true culprit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for children","review":"I purchased this book, read it once, and promptly returned it. The book has one purpose - to advocate homosexual adoption. If as a parent, this is a message you want to express to your child, by all means buy the book. The message is not subtle; it is direct and is the only theme of the book. As a parent I feel that 6 years old is not an appropriate age to address the topic of same sex marriage and homosexual couple adoption.I simply felt there was no value or purpose to the book other than the social message. If you're not purchasing the book solely for this message - skip the book. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children","review":"This book is too much for children. I was given this book as a gift for my son. Didn't care for it at all so I went to read more about why it was written.

Let's stop tussling.","review":"Was the book any good? Yes. The watercolor illustrations were beautiful, the message of love creating a family, rather than blood relationships is definitely one to share with children. I do not believe that children will become homosexual from reading this. They'll probably giggle like little Olive in \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" and say, \\"That's silly!\\" Parents should not be concerned.

To me it is just a lovely story that says there are all different kinds of families and as long as there is love, any family will do. That message is appropriate for every age, I think.Of course there are people who wish the world to be as black and white as the subjects of the book, and when given evidence to the contrary foam at the mouth and allow personal hatred and fear embolden their voices. You'll have that.As to the reviewer, and others who believe likewise, that the story is a lie becuase the penguins are not \\"together\\" any longer...well, I'm sorry to point this out, but the present doesn't negate the past. The events actually happened and so the story, by definition, is not a lie. The ending's just different.The book itself is wonderful. Well told and well worded."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true story and a lesson in tolerance","review":"I am a kindergarten teacher and I find this book to be an excellent way to demonstrate \\"alternative\\" kinds of love. It's not \\"political\\" although it has been controversial. It's a true story about 2 male penguins who become close companions and who nurture and egg and baby penguin together. It didn't shock my students. They take life how it is and recognise love and goodness.

I made the mistake of ordering the book based on the cover and the number of stars from reviews without actually reading the reviews or the book summary. This book is about two male penguins who are a couple and adopt a baby penguin. I did learn an important lesson...don't buy books and give them to your children without reading them yourself first!

I love that it is based on the true story of penguins in the NY zoo and I am sad that people are trying to use it as an excuse to spread their hatred and bigotry. Children need to be taught love, tolerance and equality and people like those represented in some of the reviews here are those that would see only a white, middle-class, heterosexual male world. It is time for people to stop teaching hatred and start teaching acceptance. Books such as this are a great start. Every child should be able to read books like this to help them learn that the world is not a black and white place as many of the reviewers here would have you believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"All need to read","review":"A story that in a great way teaches a very important lesson.

However, the writing lacks any flow or literary mastery. It sounds like a vocabulary-deficient 10-year-old writing an assigned book report. There is no real beauty in the telling...I sincerely believe that the only reason people are even reviewing this book is \\"agenda\\". Those opposed to homosexual parenting are just out to bash it (as if it's not apparent from their review they haven't even read the book - they are just \\"towing the party line\\"). However, I also don't understand why LGBT community is blindly embracing this book. It's seems contrary to the intended point to use a book about a one-time anomoly, synthetic environment, and manufactured situation to support that homosexuality is normal. This actually undermines the goal...For a truly enjoyable book with a natural family, try \\"The Different Dragon\\" by Jennifer Bryan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong lesson about zoos.","review":"There are good and bad lessons for children in this book. Teaching children good lessons about prejudice and love is wonderful. But the book starts with the claim that zoos are good.

I oppose bigotry of all types, but since two of my relatives are gay, this is a topic that I have a firm stance in. I don't understand why the idea of two beings of the same gender in a relationship upsets people. I understand there's a religious opposition to this, but most of the homophobes I come across just say that it's \\"wrong\\" without giving any actual reason. It perplexes and depresses me.As for the book itself, it's f'ing adorable. If you like penguins, that's enough of a reason to buy this.And for the parents claiming that this book is harmful to children, I guarantee you that this book, along with any other inanimate object, will do a far better job of raising your kids than you ever could. Keep your backwards morals to yourselves and give your kids a chance to form their own opinions.

I love Gary's music-especially his older stuff, all the way back to the Tubeway Army days.

It has English-thai, and Thai-english sections, and shows Thai with consistant rominazation, plus thai script.Now, the best part of the book is the intro (before the dictionary begins) to Thai language. It gives all the basic rules (summed up nicer than many Thai language books!) Rules for different kinds of questions and everything. Even a section on profanity (so you'll know when people are upset:) ANd all examples give thai script, roman-thai (including tone marks), and english.I highly recommend this book to anyone even remotely interesed in the Thai Languages.

As far as the range goes, it will shoot, maybe 6 feet before it starts to decline.

I included two packages of marshmallows with them. At first, the blasters wouldn't work because, believe it or not, jet-puffed marshmallows are too big. After someone found a bag of regular-sized marshmallows, the fun began. It took a while for my grand-daughter to get her blaster out of the hands of one of the \\"adults,\\" but she finally retrieved it. I have given them much more expensive gifts over the years, but nothing was ever so much fun as these.I gave these toys 4 stars instead of 5 because it was too hard to pump the blaster enough to get a major blast until they oiled the pump with olive oil. I suggest this recommendation be included with the toys.PS Their dog probably had an overload of sugar, chasing and eating the flying marshmallows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun","review":"These are a blast and is always the hit at any birthday party and is the favorite gift!

Would buy a pair again for the same use - silly fun and laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the mini marshmallow gun","review":"It's worth the extra few bucks to buy this item instead of the ones that fire mini-marshmallows. This one uses a different kind of air pressure and fires from a trigger - you can pump it up to determine the velocity at which the marshmallow fires. The mini marshmallow guns get jammed easily and are far less reliable. Personally, I also think since you're inevitably going to try to shoot marshmallows into someone's mouth, there's much less chance of choking to death on a bigger marshmallow being fired at you than those little guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This toy Never worked properly, marshmallows constantly got stuck, then warm and sticky.

I rather assumed while reading the book that she was not free to leave, or would be shunned forever or something if she did.She seemed quite masochistic to me. I think this book helped form my feminist awareness, seeing religions as subjugating women, even making them want to efface their own identities, as well as giving merather a horror of the extremely religious (sort of the way one feels about those who flagellate themselves, or give themselves stigmata). I was so relieved when most women's religious ordersloosened up in the 70s.

James' title, there is \\"A Warning to the Curious.\\" It's necessary to read this novel with caution. Many of the quasi-military practices described in sister formation, daily life, and Sister Luke's exit from religious life appear to be unknown to most religious orders. Furthermore, Ms. Habets and Ms. Hulme apparently became life partners; that's pleasant for them, but does affect the views presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of The Nun's Story","review":"The Nun's Story, by Kathryn Hulme, is not a book that can be read in one sitting, due not only to its length but to the fact that the depth of its contents requires the reader to take a deep breath after every paragraph. This touching story tells the life of a young woman who tries arduously to become a good nun. Although The Nun's Story is not related to the majority of people's everyday lives, it demonstrates the beauty and the enchantment of a world which to many is a complete mystery. The Nun's Story is absorbing to the point of tears, a novel in which it is quite impossible not to sympathize with the character. Although it is said that Hulme's intentions were to criticize and denounce convent life, the book in no way creates that sort of atmosphere. It simply shows to the world a bit more about a very special world, and in all truth, this is done beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Encounter by Lisa Tawn Bergren","review":"This is the 3rd of this book that I have bought to have as gifts.

Russian violinist Naoum Blinder was Monteux's concertmaster at the San Francisco Symphony and it is apparent that they had a fine working relationship, brought to the fore by Blinder's featured role here. The recording is mono, and is fine for 1947. Tod Und Verklarung was issued on LP coupled with Siegfried Idyll; they were done in stereo, during a return visit by Monteux to the San Francisco orchestra in 1960. To many it is a better work than Heldenleben, and its performance here is a deeply felt one.

When I first got this adapter it worked just fine, I can surf the net and download files in an instant then about 2 months later the problems began. I first noticed that it took hours to load my home screen of my operating system account. It usually takes about fifteen to twenty minutes to load my background and programs. then once it connects to my router it takes another twenty five to thirty minutes to connect to the internet. I have also faced the same problems with the adapter dropping the connection when I am connected to the net. In summary, this is one of the worst wireless adapters available in the market today.

Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If \\"Sex and the City\\" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.Feminism is not about having to use \\"scary\\" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are.

Jong's Sappho's Leap is an obvious parody of Greek fiction through the ages whereas Bell's PSAPPHA may well become a modern classic. Where Sappho's Leap is based on mythology and comic plays, PSAPPHA stands on a firm foundation of Sappho's own words - what few of them are left to us after centuries of censorship and deliberate destruction.For those contemplating purchase and wanting a quality read, I hightly recommend PSAPPHA, a novel of Sappho instead of Sappho's Leap. Or, buy them both. This one is good for a lot of laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"Wow, I'm surprised some people graded the book so low. I must admit, I don't really know the history of Sappho, so I can't judge. I only know her poetry.Regardless, I find the book quite enjoyable. I've had the book for several months now but I only take it out when I'm in the mood. I feel somehow like Sappho is a dear friend, sent back in time. LOL. I like that in this book, she goes through much of what many women go through.I find the descriptiveness that Erica Jong puts in the book is very helpful in understanding the rich beauty of such an ancient time. However, I do agree with some that the descriptiveness can go overboard. There were a few times where a character would go into an unreasonably long lecture where I didn't think it fit in.Anyway, it's a great book.

Conners' novel The Hampton Sisters (published in 1987 in hardcover by Donald I. Fine, Inc.) reminded me of Stanley Cohen's The Diana Game gone extremely Gothic.Two rich sisters, Emily and Lydia Morrow, beautiful look-a-likes, but extremely different: one evil, one good, night and day, residing together in a mansion-by-the-sea (in this case the Atlantic Ocean) adjacent to an extremely hostile no man's land known as the Sanctuary where spirits of the wronged-dead wait in limbo for revenge. This book had the atmosphere, but the abrupt, non-existing ending leaves readers hanging and very much unsatisfied. Read this book if you like novels having a creepy Gothic atmosphere, but steer clear of it if a complete plot with an satisfying ending is important to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste you money","review":"Very cheaply made, not safe to use, no ground.

For some reason the back of the box says that optional equipment are weighted gloves, weighted ball, and a step. They don't use the gloves or ball however, so not sure where those come in... Using the step makes this a good workout and the weights add some intensity. Billy is very energetic in this video and gets kinda crazy during parts of the workout - starts singing and dancing, but I personally don't mind it.

In light of his comments over the years I am frankly surprised that this is even out there. I have just about everything that Simon has released and I like everything except You're The One. The songs are unmemorable, the lyrics are often forced and awkward. After I recently had a renewed interest in Paul's music I went back and listened to this cd again, thinking perhaps I was too hard on it. I could barely get through one listen.

However, after about seven days I awoke to find my ground cover dug up in many of the places where I had applied this repellent.

A complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cats could not care less","review":"The major reason I wanted to try this product is that we have a strong presence of feral cats, plus raccoons and badgers come out at night as well. I have a square lot running a little over a quarter acre. One five-pound container was not enough to cover the entire perimeter, so a week ago, I concentrated it on the two borders where I have seen the cats the most. No change; I just chased two cats out of the covered area this morning; the product does not seem to bother them at all. In order to cover the entire exterior perimeter (four-inch wide band) of my lot, I would need 2 and containers; the label also indicates that one application only lasts up to 30 days, assuming you apply it as directed, only on sunny, dry days. The annual cost for me to use this product would, therefore, be: 2.5 containers x $27.09 (current cost per container) x 12 months, equals $812.70. From what I have observed this past week, it would not be effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for squirrels","review":"We applied this yesterday around the perimeter of our house. Today I watched a squirrel come right up to the window next to where I was sitting and dig in the dirt where this product was applied. He stayed quite a while, dug up a nut and ate it while staring at me. I'm not at all impressed with this product and don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for skunks","review":"Tried this product to help us deter skunks digging up the lawn for grubs. It may have deterred the skunks for one(!) night but most likely they filled their belly somewhere else. Havahart is being very generous in their marketing saying that it lasts up to 30 days. Perhaps if the lawn was literally buried with this stuff. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely, 100% does NOT WORK.","review":"After applying to the perimeter of the yard, squirrels were walking through the granules in about 15 minutes. That night, the raccoons were back. We put some into a small dish, placed it about 2 feet below the birdfeeder, and within minutes, the birds were there (which we wanted, but still) and later that night, the raccoons emptied the birdfeeder.I wasted $30, and since I used it all, I can't seem to return it.Very Very FRUSTRATED. I think the 5 star reviews MUST be from people associated with the company that makes this product. Don't be fooled into thinking this stuff is any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to apply and ineffective for squirrels!","review":"The product label says to apply at the rate of 1 lb. per 40 square feet. Impossible to measure the rate of application and when using the narrowest opening on the spout the 5 lbs. were gone in about 50 square feet (???). If it had some color to it you could a least see where you've been with it but as it is it blends in with the grass so well you can't tell. I used it to circle my peach trees to keep the varmints away and so far it appears to be helping but it will be very expensive to have to reapply every rain. I think I will look for a cheaper alternative or I will have the most expensive peaches in the country.This is a follow up to my review. It has been about 4 days since I sprinkled the product around the base of the peach trees. It has not rained but today I was watching the squirrels running through the \\"protected\\" area without even noticing it as they continued stealing my peaches. So much for that idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sends squirrel's to the neighbors","review":"For years I have been dealing with squirrels digging acorns into my lawn in the fall and digging them out the rest of the year. Nothing, and I mean nothing has worked to prevent this digging damage. That is until I sprinkled this pepper intensive Critter Ritter on the areas they like to dig. It has cost me 8lbs of pepper so far, and I am going to order another 8 today. It is now obvious, squirrels hunt with their nose to the ground -- it is a very sensitive nose -- that cannot handle this pepper. Result -- no holes in the lawn since. If you need to get rid of any pests with a nose, this will do it.Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent Granular 5 Pounds"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry. Can't tell it did a thing","review":"I really thought about buying another brand of this, just because my neighbors little dogs always runs into my front yard and I don't mind but it sets my dogs up to barking and that is annoying! Well, I used the whole canister of this across the whole front of my yard and my neighbors little Papillon and Chihuahua just came right on in, right across the \\"barrier\\".

The fact that it is natural/organic was a plus in deciding to try it. But the pluses ended with the product description for this very ineffective answer. Despite using it heavily especially in the vicinity of our trash the repellent did anything but. We even tried spreading it heavily on the cans. It did not stop the animals from continuing to attack our trash.Sounds like a good idea but just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Chipmunks!","review":"I will update this review in time if a different conclusion is reached, however, after about a month of time and two applications we still have chipmunks burrowing under our step and patio. I will say that it seems the chipmunks frequent our patio and back step LESS now than they did a month ago, but they are not gone. I think this product would be more effective if all of my neighbors used this product too. I live in a suburban area and our yards are small and our houses are close together. I know that all my neighbors have chipmunk problems too, so maybe if we all used this product, then I would find this to be more successful."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"We have two types of nuisance pests - bunnies and voles. The bunnies eat up our garden and the voles eat up our lawn. I've tried all kinds of repellent, from commercial granules such as this to home-made recipes containing urine & castor oil. Although they may repeal for a time, our pests always return.This critter ridder was easy to apply, although I wish the shake canister top had a more finely calibrated way to shake out the ingredients. The ingredients appear to be relatively natural, and the dominant smell is of pepper - which didn't bother us while we applied or spent time in the yard application.It's been 2 weeks, and so far, so good. There has been no sign of bunnies, and there are no new vole trails. The product is expected to last 30 days, so that gives us just over 2 more weeks of protection and cover. Time will tell, but I would use this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stop determined skunks","review":"I tried this product as a deterrent to some skunks that were digging around my porch and found it to be totally ineffective.

Perhaps this works as a casual deterrent, but in this case I think the skunks were determined to get out of the cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Doesn't work for dogs or cats, at least not mine.

I live in a neighborhood that doesn't really have any public space to it, so you often find people that walk their pets and use your lawn without respecting their neighbor's to clean it up. There are also a few pets that roam freely and have their pick of lawns. I used Critter Ridder around the edges of the lawn to create a border. Most dogs appear to have just walked over the border of repellent and continued to use my lawn. They didn't even appear to be affected by the repellent, so it wouldn't have helped to spread it over a larger area.I'm sure some pets might have not like the repellent, but I definitely could not recommend this as a general purpose solution. There were too many breeds and kinds of dogs in my yard, even the very next day after using this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't work","review":"I put it around my fish pond to keep the cats out of there.And the dogs i got up in the morning and a dog was in the pond.and the cat still come over."},{"rating":"1","title":"It seems useless","review":"I spray the repellent in my backyard to repel those little things.

Irregardless the critters had a feast of newly planted young plant leaves and left me with just stems. My garden is gone.

However, we also have a local population of squirrels, chipmunks, groundhogs, etc., etc. Thanks to the wildlife, we have yet to see a single ripe strawberry; as soon as a berry begins to ripen, it's a sure thing it will be gone by the next day.So I tried this product on our strawberry patch. I applied it a little more liberally than the instructions indicate, replenished it after heavy rains, and followed all other instructions on the container.The result is... we still have not tasted a single home-grown strawberry. The strawberries are still being pilfered by critter or critters unknown. This product may work for some people, to some degree, under some situations.

I put it around the flowers in the pots at my pool. I was having squirrels literally toss the flowers out, I assume looking for nuts from last year. Not being terribly squirrly myself I can't claim to know why the squirrels were yanking my flowers out but that is my guess. I put this stuff around the flowers and have not had any issues since. I am making a leap of faith that the granules are the reason why the squirrels have not returned. They are still in the yard but have not bothered the plants. Since I am not sure that the product drove the squirrels away I can't give it 5 stars but since I am pretty sure, I will give it four stars.

I used it according to directions & there was no rain/wind for a good 2 days after application. I haven't seen a squirrel since but my chipmunks are ATTRACTED, not repelled by it.

This time, after my grass was cut, I sprinkled this stuff on the many spots that I've seen the cats go to the bathroom and they no longer go there. I also have alot of squirrels and a possum or two from time to time and haven't seen them either. This stuff is safe for your grass and plants. I'm hoping it works until it rains then I would have to sprinkle again. I'm not sure why the cats dont' like it but I've seen them walk to their normal spots and then just walk away.

I used the spray just yesterday on the ground around these nests and sprayed the steel posts the Nest Boxes are attached to. This morning I checked the closest Tree Swallow nest to my house and sure enough a Racoon had a late night dinner of the two baby Tree Swallows inhabiting the nest and the nest was all torn up.

You have to get licences the same as in Gran Turismo so if you have played it you will be familiar with the concept of the game. This is the closest the dreamcat will ever get to a Gran Turismo and i think its a job well done"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This has got to be the best Dreamcast car racing game yet. In fact, it was so realistic that I had trouble adjusting my driving style. Most games you have so much traction that you do a 180 without sliding an inch but if you try it on this game your going to end up in the wall. But it can be remedied, if you bought the adjustable suspension system you can taylor the car to your individual style. One thing I have never encountered before was having to earn a license to drive certain cars. It took me a while but finally I got all of them. After you earn all of those you can build a custom car then qualify for even bigger engines in your car. This is a Great Game and thats why I'm giving it 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst car control ever!!!!!!!","review":"this game is so badd i dont even want to talk about it one thing to say is the car control is horrible. whats a racing game with no car control. sega how could you let this one out of the door.AAAAAARRRRRRRHHHHHHGGGGGG!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mad as ...","review":"i purchased this game twice.the first time the game wouldn't play.the second time i purchased it on december 17th and it hasn't even got here and it's january 3rd.i will never order anything from this site again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game, but...","review":"The game is great, but I didn't know that Celicas were classic sports cars. Control-5 stars; Graphics-4 stars; Music-3 stars; Replay Value-4.5 stars. If the game would have had more classic American cars I would have given it a 5 star rating. The only American cars are the Dodge Viper and the limited production Cobra R Mustang. No Camaros, Firebirds, or even Corvettes. Porches, Ferarris, and BMWs would have also added to the game. Most race car fans would prefer to race American cars, unless your into imports >8(.

Now I bought a Dreamcast and this game hoping to get at least the better graphics, Well thebackground's are sweet! but the car's leave alot to desired. The game also left me cold with the way it drove,none to realistic. If U like your games heavy on the arcade side this game will please U, but if U have a drivers license and want to live out your racer's fantasies this game will disapoint! To bad, So much more power with the Dreamcast and except for Ferrari F-355 there does not seem to be a decent driving sim out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm telling the truth - there are better racers... (sorry)","review":"I was one of the guys who bought this game the first day - I was that excited. There are 3 things wrong with it, and they are wrong enough that there are better games to buy. First, it takes forever to build up to a good car. Truthfully, unless you want to spend hundreds of hours, be content with the little boxes. But mainly, the controls are too touchy. The cars have serious difficulty being controlled, and the only people who will argue with me, are children and people without a life - so they don't mind a game that is sort of like a relationship. This game abuses you from time to time. 3rdly, the interface is so tedious, that you go from menu to menu. Again, the only people that will love this are those who feel satisfaction for figuring out how to run it. Forget it - get \\"Test Drive LeMans\\" = it's much better, or \\"Test Drive V-Rally\\" or \\"Sega Rally 2\\". In my opinion - they all offer a better gaming time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading photo- not 3 but 1 mustard","review":"Why show a picture of 3 mustards when you only get one.

Any mystery solving game with two teenage girls is never going to stand up against the likes of Mario, Zelda, or any sports game for that matter.

If you have money to blow you could feel better giving it to Mary-Kate and Ashley to help them fund a DECENT, and I mean DECENT movie. Or you could buy their dolls which makes even less sence because why would you need two of their dolls their TWINS! So in all this is the worst game ever and I mean EVER created. The worst thing is it's even to small to be a door stop and its to light to be a paper weight so it's like spending money for a joke book made by Al Gore, It's has know chance of selling and if you buy it, it's like listening to a Spice Girls CD.

I had thought the birds were safe in this feeder, but it turned out to be not quite true. The hawk had trouble pulling his foot back out of the cage with the pine siskin trapped in his claws, but he finally managed it.Even though Duncraft makes some great bird feeders, there are three reasons why I would not buy this model again:--red squirrels can squeeze through the bars and get at the seed--the cage bottom is very difficult to clean. The discarded husks, seeds, and bird droppings create a formidable cement, even after just one day (as I said, the small birds really like this feeder)--hawks can reach through the bars and extract the smaller birds"},{"rating":"1","title":"So so hard to keep clean","review":"Do NOT buy this bird feeder. After a thunderstorm, half the feeder was full and it was hard as a rock. It took me hours to finally get all the seed out, the tube is almost impossible to clean.

The best mode by far is the arcade mode which consists of 8 championship matches leading up to the grand finale. This game has the ultimate replay value, and is fun with 2 or 4 players.

I'm so good at this game now that the computer is my only challenge on the hardest setting. Danny says that I use secret button presses to pull off my expert moves and serves but this is not true.

But as someone who plays tennis a lot, I would like to see a more complex game that allows us to have more control over the game like slicing and more spin control. Also, I wish we could have the option to play a full 3 set or 5 set game. But that's enough negativity! This game is fun! I've been [beating my] fellow coworker ... at work, even my supervisor got beat by me! Hope I don't get fired. How much did I love this game? Well, I bought the dreamcast because of this game.

There are very few players. No women. Why? Jim Courier is supposedly the best player in the game! What a laugh. I would rather play as mario or toadstool. When you are playing doubles you might as well be playing with a braindead cripple. Your partner is constantly making horrible plays. The control is decent. It seems like you can never hit a lob back, yet in singles the computer ALWAYS smashes them back. They should have just taken the lob function out of the game as far as i'm concerned.

This is a very worth while title to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tennis is one cool sport","review":"I have never watched a single tennis match on TV and barely know the rules, but when I picked up Virtua Tennis I became a instant fan. This game is another great sport title put out by Sega. This is meant to be a arcade game not a sim so put aside all your complaints of how you can't chose exactly what kind of hit you do, it's all fun! I haven't played such a great multi player game before. I can play this with my younger sister or even my Dad, and you can become a good tennis player quick. The multi is great but what makes this game a winner is the world tour mode in which you travel to diffr. arenas around the globe and compete for money. The money is then used to buy secret players and stages. The mini-games are a great addition too, ranging from knocking over bowling pins off a serve to lob tennis balls into buckets. This is a great game to get even if you are not a fan. It is a easy game to get right into, so you can be a pro. A definite winner.

Yes fans, this game is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtua Tennis a Good Start","review":"Overall the game is great nice graphics and sound. The downside to this game is that you only play with two buttons. Another con is that the play is unrealistic.

Although the gameplay is unrealistic, I'm a tennis addict in RL, I still find myself paying again and again. Great game overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This Game is so much fun.

I bought the unit to unhook a particular printer from a PC that it's hooked up to and make it a shared printer.The printer I wanted to hook up is required to be hooked up to a Windows PC to function. This is apparently a common configuration for a printer where much of the smarts to run the printer are in the PC (especially for cheap ones which was the case with the printer with which I planned to use this print server). Definately check out the Netgear support site to make sure that your printer will be compatible.You may be better off to just buy a new printer that has an embedded wireless print server. Printers keep getting more and more capabilities and the prices tend to drop as well. The printer manufacturers make the real money of the ink cartridges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy set up and I am a novice","review":"I read many reviews of the Linksys and Netgear Print Servers and knew the Linksys was probably not for me.

I can no longer do automatic duplex printing on my laserjet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This","review":"I was on Amazon shopping for a replacement to this device.First of all, Netgear has it on its EOL list, meaning it's officially no longer supported.Secondly, while the product works well enough, the installation guides and tech support are terrible. Every time I've had to install this product, I have needed live technical support (mediocre as it was) to install as the software could not complete the task.Apparently, the policy at Netgear has changed so that any support more than 90 days out from purchase is billed at $40. So, yep, every time I have a glitch and need to reinstall I will have to shell out $$.Better off buying a different one. That $30 used switch will be $70 by the time it's hooked up and running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"We have never gotten this thing to work the way it should. We followed all directions possible, the printer would make noises, but for some reason the connection kept timing out before any document would print.

This has been working great! I hate having to have a desktop on when I'm not using it, but I can print from anywhere in my house now. Thus, this product was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"I bought the Netgear WGPS606 last year, and it has been a rock-solid device for our wireless network.

I have even had to reset my Linksys router a few times during that time, but never the 606. I works fine within our router firewall, and it does not interfere with the default setup for Norton Internet Security.It does a really good job of serving a small Epson printer, and I now have it as a gaming adapter for my Xbox 360. It also allows us to plug ethernet cables into the back of it, instead of going to the wireless router.All in all, it does exactly what it is supposed to do...and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"Product was difficult to setup and didnt come with complete instructions.

The documentation is flat out useless. I've seen more amature documentation, but I've also seen junk with better.2. How do you release a product that doesn't support printers that Linksys' uber inept WPS54GU2 does? For that matter, why would you produce a product that has such a small list of supported printers? Isn't it a clue when your unsupported list is larger than your supported list?3. The setup (largly due to the senseless documentation) was not much worse than the WPS54GU2. If you think thats a good thing, try the WPS54GU2. At least it mostly works. This kind of product is exactly the kind that will keep me from mentioning Netgear when someone asks. It doesn't engender trust in their other products and its the kind of product that pretty much makes me look at other products the next time I buy. Indeed, I'll have to look elsewhere for a competent print server."},{"rating":"1","title":"They get money, I waste my time","review":"I spent over a year working with their online tech support (which is awful) trying to get it to work, and after spending countless hours trying fixes that never worked they finally told me that it must be defective hardware. Of course, by then I'd spent so long working with tech support that the warranty was no longer valid. I wish they had just wasted my money instead of my money and my time. I don't recommend buying any NETGEAR product, and especially not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I spent hours trying to get my computer to recognize this thing and was finally able to get it sort of installed, though I realized at that point that you can't scan from a multifunction device through it - you have to plug the printer back into the computer via USB to scan. I did this and then went back to wireless, only to find that it had corrupted the printer driver, so I had to download and reinstall a fresh copy of the printer driver to get the printer to work at all. After that I stopped using the print server and in the meantime switched internet providers and had a new router and wireless network. Today I decided to try the print server again with the new router/network, but I'm having the same problems with installation (it says it can't find the print server even though they are connected by ethernet cable and all firewall is shut down). I don't remember what fluke allowed me eventually to get past this problem last time, so I'm giving up and throwing it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works when it wants to","review":"As with some of the other reviews, the print server has to be power cycled on a regular basis. When printing, we listen intently for the sound of the printer starting up. If we don't hear it within a minute we know the server is down again. I've updated the firmware as well as replaced my wireless router (not to solve this problem, just an upgrade) and still the problem persists. Invariablly, all the print jobs will get stacked up unless we get up and walk into the room with the printer to unplug the power and restart it. Then it works. This happens about 30% of the time. I write this as I search Amazon for a new print server to replace this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"setup no snap","review":"Took forever to setup!!!!

Straightforward and simple setup went smoothly. My need for this device was as a wireless ethernet bridge - I did not need or test any USB printer functions. Initially, it worked. I could ping into and through the device, and all seemed well.But after a short time, an hour or so, it would stop working. Connecting directly to the unit with a cable, its status screens indicated all was working, but no wireless connection would work. Rebooting the device would sometimes get it back on line, but several times only a complete reset and setup would get it working. I attempted various combinations of starting routers and other devices, but this unit never worked reliably.Maybe I just had a bad unit, but I returned it and got a Linksys WRT54GL router, flashed it with the open source Tomato OS and set it up as a wireless bridge. Works great - and costs $30 less."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a hunk of junk","review":"This thing is a joke.

This printer server will only support one way traffic. In order to FAX the driver software needed to read from the all-in-one. When you get Netgear Support online you find out that you might as well read the book. They can only tell you what is easily available.Otherwise, it is a pain to setup since you have to directly plug the box into the back of your computer before their software works. Even then their software failed to overcome a problem with VISTA that could have been worked around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware it all depends on your printer.","review":"If you have a printer that's not on the Windows XP default driver list then good luck. I tried installing an HP 1315 (not exactly a scarce printer) and in order to get it to work you MUST install the printer on each computer, and have it set up as the default printer, BEFORE it can be installed using the server. This means, in my case at least, that the printer must be lugged to each computer to be installed first. Ridiculous. Why can't it simply download the drivers from an already existing install like any other network printer installation? I've got a trouble ticket in to Netgear support to see if they can fix this before I return the unit.This is really too bad because once it's working it's pretty good. I have it working on my main computer that already had the 1315 installed directly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check the printer compatibility list first!","review":"I actually bought mine from Circuit City (after crashing and burning trying to get a Linksys print server to work).

So...caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got past installation setup","review":"I tried this printer server and couldn't get it to work so I tried the stationary, wired Netgear mini server and couldn't get that to work either. I am somewhat computer savvy - I understand the the IP address assigned in installation needs to match what my own router assigned for an ip address. When the setup CD prompted me to assign and IP address, I was a bit befuddled because it doesn't tell you to check your router and find out what the router assigned, but I did anyway. However, I could not find a \\"subnet\\" address anywhere and the installation wouldn't let me go any further unless I assigned this too. I decided to return this for the mini server, which automatically assigned me an address which did match what my router assigned and it does not work either. The so-called instruction manual for this is laughable. IF you're not an advance level IT person, don't try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly disappointing","review":"Long story short, (6 hours of frustration), this server did not work with our system.

Clear and direct with language, he gets to the point and tells his story without hoo-ha. Lot of interesting glimpses of colourful characters: he manages a striking portrait with ease in the fewest of words. I found his comments on the last weeks before the fall of the South fascinating. The ineptitude of the some of the major players from the Saigon consulate is bizarre, believing right up to the last weeks that the NVA would make a peace deal when on the verge of absolute victory.

I mean, really who cares in the least if the song TITLES are derivitive of another band.

And \\"The Way We Get By\\" got stuck in my head for days, only to be replaced by \\"Vittorio E.\\"(Another Malkmus steal?) Also, i must take issue with the editorial reviewer's description of Spoon as \\"Fall\\" sound alikes.

It feels like sound clips taped together. All of the songs are catchy, lyrically complex, and melodic. The instruments sound as if they were pieced together, one by one, with meticulous care; much like someone putting together a model airplane. It takes what we constitute as the generic rock song, breaks it apart, then selectively puts it back together, forming a cohesive yet sporadic jumble. This music isn't just \\"good,\\" it is interesting and challenging. Wilco did just about the same thing on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, but the results for these two bands couldn't be more different. While Wilco's album left room for loneliness and sorrow in the \\"holes\\" in their tunes, Spoon seems to have allowed for more upbeat, perhaps aggressive, emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not very good...","review":"I have no Spoon history so I think that unlike most reviewers I have no preconceptions about liking or disliking the record... I just don't like it.After several full listens, I find the songs sounding amateurish and weak. The tunes that I think are supposed to rock (Jonathan Fisk) never really do, and the ones that are supposed to come off as perhaps more meaningful or introspective (Paper Tiger) never succeed in hooking me in. I like two and three-chord songs as much as the next person but these just don't have enough else to them to really deliver.Instead of comparing this one to other Spoon albums or even albums from other \\"indie rock\\" bands try comparing this to good albums from any genre. With this approach I think that you'll agree that Spoon's Kill the Moonlight is just not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"aidin please... this","review":"..this is the best record of the year thusfar. aidin's review is miserable: spoon does not sound like the fall and does not sound anything at all like pavement. aidin does not demonstrate that he/she has even listened to this record. there is not one bad track on the album. i never imagined that spoon could top sneaks, but i was wrong. pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great, Diverse, Creative Recording","review":"I've never heard anything quite like Kill the Moonlight.

Admittedly, these are kind of lean times for the music community, so maybe it doesn't take all that much to stand out these days. But Spoon displays genuine enthusiasm performing melodic, adult rock and roll, supported by an active, but not too heavy handed mixing/effects board.

At times they sound like the Kinks, Thin Lizzy and even Steelyu Dan.

Thankfully, I picked upThe Arabic Alphabet: How to Read & Write It, which gives you an introduction to the alphabet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"okay i have just been through the introduction and the first sixteen pages. this book is great, it helps you pronounce everything very well, it has many examples, and it always specifies that you should go over examples and master them before go on to the next. for all of the people that rated this book less then 5 stars, they obviously didn't go by the rules, and are fools that think arabic is a walk through language, when in doubt it is a language that requires hours of study to learn. J.R Smart this book gives me a 100% satisfaction SO FAR, so enshallah it will until the end, by the way i'm not an arab, i'm persian, so do not think that it's easier for me, because it's just as hard, if not harder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for beginners","review":"This book has a lot of good things except it is more constructed as a class text book than a teach yourself book. The tapes are okay, but I wish it was longer. This book DOES NOT have phonetics written out to help the user pronounce the words. The examples are written in Arabic and you will have to decifer what it means by remembering what the Arabic letters sounds like. In other words, the book does not have examples of how to pronounce. You will have to learn the pronunciation of the alphabetics and put it together to form or read words. It wasn't easy for me because I could have been doing it all wrong and wouldn't even know it. The tapes can sometime be hard to mimick because with every language there are always something you are missing when speaking. I would only recommend this book to someone who is somewhat already familiar with the Arabic language, not a beginner who have never been exposed to Arabic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desapoint","review":"I was exated waitting for may delivery, but I were desapointed when I opened my order.

Arabic/English so I would know the meaning of the words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discover a GREAT new, fresh album!","review":"An incredible debut for Hanne Hukkelberg, the Norwegian vocalist. Her fresh voice is unlike anything I've heard before, especially in juxtaposition with unlikely instruments like pots and pans and bicycle spokes. It is easy to be immediately swept by the lyrics, and the melody, but this is far from being \\"easy listening jazz\\" or boring predictable pop. Each track is full of eccentricities that will excite your ears and your mind. I've been listening to this album non-stop while I write and its proved to be an aid in my own creativity. I look forward to more from this emerging artist and hope she will make it to the USA to perform someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfying & soulful..","review":"I've had this album for just a few short days, but it's definitely near the top of my favourite albums this year.

Bill Goldberg had been doing HUGE busniess as World Champion for much of 1998, and looked unstoppable. Then, in one night EVERYTHING fell apart. First, I must point out that WCW sold this PPV on the promise of there being matches in the form of Scott Steiner-Lex Luger, and Scott Hall-Bam Bam Bigelow, NEITHER of which materialised on the night. Instead we got an endless Billy Kidman love-in in front of an apathetic crowd, and othe matches featuring such legends of the ring as Prince Iaukea, Norman Smiley, Ernest Miller, Jerry Flynn and Eric Bischoff. No Hogan, Sting, Luger, Savage, Steiner. Piper or anyone else of any note. Then DDP gets an ego-driven victory of The Giant, and in the ultimate power-play, Kevin Nash downs Goldberg for the World Title. This event is only worth it to see how badly someone can mess up a sure thing in the space of 3 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really, really bad value","review":"When I ordered this, there was no picture of the product posted (first mistake) so I went by the weight, which was listed as 16oz.

It was a tiny pack of only FIVE pieces varying from 4.5\\" to about 5.75\\" in length (that's 5 total pieces, NOT 5 of each). The whole thing was SO light in weight that I had to weigh it out of curiousity, it would not even register on my digital scale, I would approximate it at 1 ounce and more that 3/4 of that is packaging! At about $5, even 16oz.

A pleasure to listen to. I don't think that one is likely to be stirred and shaken by Jando's genius, but such things are rare, anyway. I would not probably pay a full price for this CD.

Modestly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian Pooley - The Allnighter/Calypso","review":"Ian Pooley shows off his more dance-oriented side with this collection of THE ALLNIGHTER & CALYPSO EPs off NRK Sound Division. \\"Gimme Sound\\" and \\"In the Bins\\" start off pretty straightforward, but \\"Gimme Sound\\" thankfully shifts into a new dimension 1/3 of the way through with some synth pads. \\"The Allnighter\\" starts the disco guitars right away, and you can almost see the strobelights flickering in the background. The Brazillian-tinged percussion on \\"Calypso Theme\\" fits the title perfectly, especially once the melody kicks in. Slam, as always, delivers a quality mix, this time smoothing out the edges of \\"The Allnighter,\\" while Junior O mix isn't as transformative as I would have liked. Dave Angel's take on \\"Gimme Sound\\" is similarly disappointing, but we can at least rely on Ian Pooley to provide great dancefloor fodder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passes my test.","review":"This movie, the latest from the \\"Nerd Fantasy\\" subgenre of childrens' cinema, is more than wonderous enough to entrance any kid, yet cleverly-written enough to keep the attention of the adult sitting with him to watch it.

The plot concerns an underground manufacturer of sex androids, one is let out and is befriended by a street person. After the first ten minutes, all real structure is thrown out and it turns into an arty student film with massive jump cutting, grotesque imagery, etc. I admit, it held my interest just to see what strange things would happen next, but overall, I wasted my time.

This book has rare photos and quotes given by the band members and other friends and musicians, spanning from their Haight Ashbury era, the Kool Aid Acid Tests, throughout the 70s and 80s, and the early 90s. Also, on the grayer side of things, tributes to musicians like Janis Joplin and one time organist Ron \\"Pigpen\\"Mc Kernan were written,respectively: which is sad, but good reading material. I would say more, but I think that it would be better if anyone who has appreciation for 60s classic rock or for the Dead especially should try this book out for themselves, since there are a LOT more thing in this book than I just said. Like I said, this book is for serious fans of the Grateful Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one","review":"This movie only gets 1 star from me, and this is for the courage it must of taken the cast & crew to show their faces after it was made. Those of you who are big fans of camp films may like this movie since you will enjoy almost anything. In my opinion, it isn't even that acceptable. Bad acting, bad script, and bad production values all combine to make this a true waste of time. Buy this movie if you happen to see it in the $5.00 bin at your video store, plug it in, turn off the sound and pause it on any scene which shows the incredibly cute Stuart Perelmuter shirtless.

There are multiple nooks and crannies, including areas where two pieces of plastic come together that form a seam with a space for food to collect. I find it very difficult to clean and I'm not running the dishwasher to clean it every time I use it.

By the way, I use Windows 2000 OS, and it didn't crash my pc.This program has about 10 games (I play with 5 of them). It also has a magazine section that lets you choose from 9 different topics. Once you choose the topic, it gives you at least 40 other titles under that topic to choose from. Each title has at least 3 pages of information for you to practice typing.I don't use the beginning typer's lessons. I just finished taking a class that taught me the basics, and the basics now bore me. I use this program to improve my typing skills, and it seems to be working.My analysis: Buy this program if you want to learn how to type or improve your typing skills. It will be one of the best investments you've ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY UNLESS SERIOUS BUGS HAVE BEEN FIXED!","review":"Though I just finished installing 30 other programs on my computer without a problem, VERSION 15 of THIS PROGRAM NOT ONLY CRASHED on my Windows 98 computer, but IT CRASHED MY HARD DRIVE and TOLD ME I NEED TO REINSTALL MY OPERATING SYSTEM!

I have a 6\\" wrist, and the band fits perfectly, with 3 holes left over. So nice to be able to find watches with watchbands that fit! I bought, and returned, three women's Timex watches because all the watchbands were much too long. Any woman who complains that Casio makes their watchbands too small should try Timex. The dial isn't real big, but still very easy for me to read. Great little watch at a great little price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you pay for what you get","review":"This watch runs very small.

This CD is fantastic, especially Voodoo, as it captures beautifully Rotondi's trumpet as well as some fantastic piano and saxophone work. As is abundantly clear, I am not a professional music reviewer but I think one strength of this recored is the supporting cast. Rotondi doesn't force himself into the music where it isn't necessary. He realizes he has a great band and he isn't afraid to let them shine. A very good record enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Eurythmics Tragedy","review":"Historically, this was a low point for the band. They made a soundtrack for \\"1984\\" that the director hated and I think critics derided too. I remember seeing a photo of Dave and Annie crying upon the album's release. Whereas \\"Sex Crime\\" did well in Europe, but not in the US, where the title raised concerns, \\"Julia\\" was one of the band's worst-performing singles. If you hear this record, it may seem like an extended mix, but it is just the version that is on the soundtrack. They may have add about a minute to the song \\"Ministry of Love,\\" however. There is an American, independent film about a teen's coming-out that shows this record in the background because the main character is a Eurythmics fan. Remember that the single had a slow, boring video for it too? The cover actually shows a female character from \\"1984' after an \\"adult\\" scene. I owned this record back in the day, but only those who worship the Eurythmics would need it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classical music's heavy metal.","review":"Another disc concocted by the RCA marketing boys who brought us the daffy \\"Space Classics\\" CD.

You can be a starter skater and make your way up by competing. It's hard to get the judges to give you high scores so you keep playing until you do. Or you can play for high scores. There are also many games for two players. I like the fact that this game has no blood. Tony Hawk's Game has blood coming out everywhere. Although this may be more realistic, I play the game for the tricks, not the gore. So what if nothing happens when the skater runs into the wall...it's a game....and I have yet to see a real skater do a stalefish 900. So if you're into a game for the content and how fun it is...buy MTV Sports: skateboarding featuring Andy Macdonald."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's not enough in this game to be a copy-cat.","review":"The physics in this game are outrageous. Try this. When at home, get on your skateboard or any thing else that rolls, and go full speed at a wall. Do you know what happens? You fall down. Not evan the best skaters could sustain such a hit. Unless you are in this game. In this game however, you just stop. This is a bad thing. Also, when you do fall(and when attemting tricks you will do a lot of)you only have two bail animations. Falling on you back, and, well, your back in a different way. Grinding will lead to such rages that you have never imagened. No clue as to when you are going to fall off. Oh, and don't evan think about doing any other tricks, not that there are many to try. The only thing good is the music.

It started out very funny with him talking and joking about his radio program and the questions that he is given. Hilarious in that you have tears in your eyes from laughing so hard, but then, a major thud comes when he gets political, as our economy is NOT something I want to hear about when I'm wanting to laugh. Putting down the present government and all that political stuff just isn't funny and the audience was unmoved as well.

The only problem, in the end, is that each of the little sections are short and provide no depth and are easily forgetten. After awhile there is a sameness to the book (for obvious reasons) that, perhaps, mirrors its subject.

Great advice. Interesting reading. You can tell immediately that the information comes from deep experience. I appreciate that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Private Investigations: How to Be Successful!","review":"I bought three how to detective books and this one was the most expensive and totally lame. If you are interested in a 1950-ish Polly Annish commercial on the exciting world of being a private detective, then this is the book for you. Repetitive and dull presentation of the most obvious and mundane facts that are basically useless. If it had presented the real business issues around being a detective, pros and cons, options for dealing with such matters that would be one thing. Instead this book is akin to the most gung-ho military recruiter who will only speak in the most glowing and simplistic of terms. A total waste of time and money. Just say no! Outstanding books instead are Be Your Own Detective and the amazingly thorough Get the Facts on Anyone. The former has more about the nature of the business, the latter an incredible compendium of investigative techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time & Money","review":"This book was written for those clueless people who have no conception of how any business works. It is perhaps the most useless book I read (or tried to read).I learned more about the PI business from one short conversation then from this entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nolan helmet","review":"This is a superior helmet. Sadly for us however, there was no way to try it on before the purchase. They run small. The seller let us know there were no returns and we felt secure in the fact it would fit after viewing the chart for sizing. This was purchased for my elderly neighbor via myself as he has no computer. He understood the conditions. It is now for sale on e-bay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collection","review":"During Munch's tenure as conductor in chief of the Boston Symphony (1949-62), it was often referred to as the world's finest french orchestra. Why? Because the woodwinds and brass had a somewhat nasal and pointed sound, characteristic of French ensembles, but with significantly greater orchestral silkiness of tone, precision, and virtuosity, on a par with the world's finest orchestras. It is these characteristics, together with the volatile, intense nature of Munch's style, which makes these performances a very effective combination of sensuality, fire and elegance. The same is true of Munch's La Mer and Escales (Ports of Call), coupled with the Saint-Saens Organ Symphony on another Living Stereo album.A very worthwhile purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT use with alcohol","review":"I strongly suggest that you do not waste your money on this.

I wish I had purchased a single box of 6 instead of 12 boxes of 6, because 11 boxes will now be trashed. As soon as I opened the case box, all I could smell was dirty grease. I went ahead and filled 6 shells, my husband and I each tried one & threw the remaining 4 filled shells away. The filling did not over ride the nasty flavor and odor of the shells. In addition, several shells came broken. If anyone knows of a good brand to try, please advise. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I AGREE","review":"I agree with the last review.

This book was written without the writer's first-hand experience, but as Balzac's better-known works demonstrate, he was a meticulous observer of those around him.

The book depicts both traditional Chinese characters and the simplified character set. If you have both the time and the patience, you can learn a multitude of essential characters and phrases. One thing I would suggest to Turtle Publishing, is to expand the Student's Guide section dealing with pinyin pronunciations on page xii; add pronunciations of multiple vowel combinations. Outside of this one recommendation, if you are planning a trip to China and truly want to learn how to both read and write \\"putonghau\\" Vol.1 and 2 are the books for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing Chinese characters is relaxing.","review":"NOTE: I bought Vol 1 and Vol 2 of these books. I am still on Vol 1 and this review is based on practicing 178 characters so far from Vol 1.I wish my hearing was good enough to learn a second language but it isn't so the only thing I can do is learn about languages. One of my hobbies is learning other languages' sentence construction, use of phrases, alphabets, etc. Practicing writing Chinese characters and discovering how ideas are assembled with the characters is relaxing.But I don't understand the order of characters in this book. Were they placed by amount of use or some other reason? I am up to 178 characters out of 250 in Vol 1 and I haven't understood any build up or building on past characters. Maybe I am learning something without realizing it but I wish some goal was more apparent to me.Perhaps I lack patients as a high school graduate in China is expected to know about 10,000 characters so I have a very long way to go to even by a 1st grader:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Guy loves this machine...","review":"I did a little research, read the reviews, and took a shot.

( yeah, i weigh about 250 trying to get to 220)Cons- Big handles, heart rate monitor doesn't work too well, plastic foot pedals kind of chincy.Overall, this machine will get your heart going and seems to hold up to my weight well.

It's SIMPLE, wash by hand and then dry with a clean kitchen towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not new","review":"My current KitchenAid mixer's beaterhead's skin is pealing off.

I found it deceiving to receive an apparently used one that I thought was new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement flat beater","review":"Purchased this flat beater for my kitchenaid artisan mixer after the original beater (with the white coating) started, rather soon after purchase, cracking and peeling (even after hand washing only). Hand washing this one also, just in case, as I don't really trust the dishwasher. It would be nice if companies like this would just use good old fashioned stainless steel to make more of their products with! I think that most people know quality when they see it and are willing to pay for it as long as it means that it will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't dishwash","review":"The is like the beater that came with my mixer, but do not put it in the dishwasher because it will cause the coating to wear off, which will leave you with a beater that leaves a dark grey residue behind every time you towel dry it. It would be nice if they made one out of stainless steel or something with a more durable coating, but I think it probably is the best option available. At least it is a relatively inexpensive part to replace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like my beater","review":"but it really wasn't. Cost me as much to send it back as the original price.

I agree w/other reviewers that this should be the beater shipped w/the mixer. After using my cheap, painted beater for a short time - it started flaking! My beater-to-bowl clearance was correct. When I complained to KA, I got an email explaining how to check the clearance & directing me to their overpriced website to buy a new beater. I was not impressed & fortunately, they are not the only place to buy a new beater. KA has slipped in quality over the last several years. I have an old KA mixer (20+ years) that I moved to my weekend house when I got the new Artisan. That beater/mixer is fine & has seen a lot of work.This uncoated beater has to be hand washed or it will discolor....if they just went back to their old coating formula, we wouldn't have this problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"gross; turns food gray with aluminum","review":"This is a horrible product.

I thought this would be it, but without instructions to state \\"HAND WASH ONLY\\" I put it in the dishwasher on the first use. When I pulled it out, my hands were covered in black chalking \\"substance\\". Can't win with Kitchenaid.

After following the \\"pre-use\\" instructions in the booklet, and after beginning our cooking process, the metallic coating started to come off the beater, leaving black powder and flecks of the coating in our food! After rendering the food completely inedible, and the beater completely unusable, we called Kitchenaid. The lady on the phone asked me several questions, (such as if I followed the instructions for use in the booklet,) then promptly agreed to send me a coated, white, beater- stating they have had several complaints about the coating coming off the burnished beaters after only a few uses!

I bought the plastic one and will pay close attention to make sure pieces do not get in the food. I do not like the idea of an aluminum one either. Neither one is a healthy choice. I wish they made a stainless steel one even if it is much more costly. I went on their facebook page and posted a message. Hope more people do that and maybe then they will do something about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't stay burnished","review":"I ordered this because my orignial beater blade had chipped.

I had no trouble soaking mine in the sink, but one trip through the DW was all it took to ruin it. The really icky part is I used the beater once before noticing that not only did it not shine, but also it was coated with aluminum powder! YUUUUCK!! Unless you are the kind of person who cooks and immediately cleans up by hand, get the coated kind, because KA no longer makes the stainless beaters. This is a good example of the sad deterioration in overall KA quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renews faith","review":"The text supports beliefs that I learnt years ago - that children must be supported, to learn well and at a pace that suits their own learning style.Concise lists are an aid to developing patterns of words and give an ordered framework to develop reading and spelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well written or particularly interesting.","review":"I suppose if you are a pilot, hearing Edgerton re-tell his own experiences learning to fly would be pretty interesting. If you're just interested in planes, the book is just OK. If you're looking for a good story you'll be deeply disappointed.About 1/3 of the book is learning to fly one plane after another. About 1/3 is an attempt to make sense out of his service in Vietnam. The remaining 1/3 is filler with an occasional anecdote, sometimes interesting.What is so surprising is how clumsily the text is written and how little he has to say.

However, if you listen to it enough, it gets so beautiful it's amazing. This woman is so smart and poetic. Her songs make you think, and are so far from sugar pop it's not even funny.

Must have album for any Madonna fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty tame songwriting","review":"None of these songs are very well done. The silly sythesizer elements sound out of place and tacked on to the song Frozen. The lyrics for that song are just the same four lines of dialogue repeated over and over. The same goes for Power Of Goodbye very little attention paid to song writing. If you listen to a thirty second clip of these two tracks you've heard the whole thing. This album just strikes me as a major rip off of U2's POP, which also wasn't a very good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe with a little more time......","review":"With Madonna's 'change' from material girl, to maternal girl, I expected more of a powerful, more enthusiastic album. Madonna's efforts are weak, and pretty much sad.

Oh and did you ever notice that she uses the same chord progression on EVERY DANG SONG!!! And the lyrics? Bleah. Same old lost love that we've been hearing for years. \\"Love is a bird/She needs to fly\\". What kind of lyric is that? Ever heard Negativland? They're cool. Buy their records instead. Or better yet, just get The Immaculate Collection. It really kicks amoebas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't listen to the critics - this album is the pits!","review":"I can't believe that everyone is praising this album. Madonna is marketing it as 'electronica' when really all it sounds like is a heaping pile of the same old cheese pop she's been putting out for years.She repeats the phrase \\"Your heart's not open\\" in several songs, and resorts to putting out the same corny ballads that her fans eat up for whatever reason. Also, don't forget the use of the phrase \\"lucky star\\" - Madonna proves that she doesn't have any true inspiration either. This is adult contemporary music that no decent human should be subjected.Madonna was never really about music - anyone who liked her in the past did so because of her sexy image. Now she's a mother, ditched the sexpot thing for a lame new age thing, and anyone who hasn't before can see that all the songs are really pathetic. One of the worst albums of 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy Cat Got Your Tongue","review":"This album is just another example of Madonna ripping off the ideas of other, better artists. This time it is Bjork who has already established herself as the leader in the electronic field. Just because Bjork didn't want to produce M's 1994 album she has decided to try and beat Bjork at her own game. But fortunately it doesn't work. Madonna comes off sounding as cheap and selfish as ever. She has always used her music to try and justify her reckless behavior and this is her real contribution to the world. Nothing Really Matters could sum up Madonna's entire existence. Long live Bjork, 2 thumbs down to Madonna. And by the way, Madonna if you think \\"you\\" invented emotional techno, then you're even more irrelevent than I thought. Listen to Massive Attack, Everything But The Girl, Tricky, and of course Bjork for the \\"real\\" emotion of techno."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was never a fan of hers,but this album sure doesn't stand for a chance of changing that. I think the whole thing really sux."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACT YOUR AGE, MADONNA!!!!","review":"You are not hip and you are not cool! I am sick and tired of hearing 40+ singers trying to catch the \\"wave\\" of what is cool. This CD only demonstrates that Madonna is going through yet another style change. Give it up, you haven't been cool since 1985, and you aren't going to be ever again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Madonna go?","review":"Maybe the answer would be...Buddah Buddah Land? Maybe just in the path of a really tasteless album? It contains songs with too much image and too little depthness. The album is miles and miles from reality. Just like the Madonna we now know."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"this disc is one of the most overrated ever.her voice sounds as bad as ever and the music has been done back in the 80's.the group garbage did a better job at the eletronica thing.remember erotica? did it already and it wasn't good then and isn't good now.her first album and bed time stories are far better.and awards don't make a lasting album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a whole new Madonna, and it's *good* !!","review":"With a new techno-dance-trance beats on the radio hits, Madonna breaks new ground once again. Ray of Light is easily one of her best albums, and I'd venture to say that \\"The Power of Goodbye\\" is definately her best song ever, topping even the potent \\"Live to Tell\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH YEAH!!!","review":"This CD was really good. I especially like Frozen, Drowned World and Ray of Light. All the songs were good. and the music video for Frozen was way cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madge's best","review":"I've heard some of Madonna's other work (including \\"Music\\" which I also have) and this is her best work...ever. The title track is just peppy enough so that it gives the Madonna signature song to the album. The other songs that are just plain good are: Drowned World, Skin, Sky fits Heaven, To Have not to hold and Swim.Now there are a couple of \\"experimental\\" songs on the album such as: Candy Perfume Girl, Shanti/Ashtangi, Nothing Really Matters and Mer Girl - but they are not so weird or overpowering that they ruin the album. Quite to the contrary, I think they add to the album greatly.For the final BEST two songs of the album are: Power of Goodbye and Frozen. Power showcases her impeccable way of mixing her voice with the electronica and it works perfectly. Now, Frozen has to be my favorite Madonna song period. It is just that great. They lyrics are simple but they speak scores. The backround music is moody and enhances the feeling of the song.Ray of Light is her best work to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the fame and the controversy, emerged a true artist","review":"I first bought this album the day it was released and since that day this album has helped me deal with personal issues, such as a relationship that i couldn't sustain and the death of my mother.With this album Madonna truly emerges as an artist. Yes indeed, she did find her artistic integrity in \\"Like A Prayer\\"(which also is a great album), but this one stated that Madonna is a human like the rest of us.Whenever i get asked what my favorite album of all time is, i don't hesitate to say \\"Ray of Light\\". As an audience we should feel privileged that Madonna did some soul searching and gave us a wonderful album. True that!!!If you haven't bought it, get off your [butt]... and experience the true genius of Madonna!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Open Is ***Your*** Heart?","review":"If you hate Madonna but can't get some of her tunes out of your mind, this CD won't help matters any because it's a fantastic collection of catchy, fascinating melodies!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"Having grown up in the eighties, there has always been a certain amount of sentimentality that I associate with Madona, however \\"Ray of Light\\" made me a die-hard fan. Watching Madona reinvent herself album after album, I believe \\"Ray of Light\\" brings us closest to Madona's true self. The songs are an intimate look into her life, beliefs, and a reflection on her past. I found it interesting how this CD also reflects, the modern society in India (interesting scale usage and a tinge of modern techno influence so popular in India today). I have owned the CD for many years now and still find it extremely inspiring and uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a Madonna fan but...","review":"If you dig William Orbit and his techno inspired harmonics and sharp interplay you'll like this. Madonna does OK (\\"functional\\") in the real world of comparing her to top tier vocalists - but this is definitely the best production she ever had IMO. Orbit finds the best way to blend her seamlessly into the mix of layers he creates. As someone else noted, for a serious collector of music, this should be in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's Ray of Light!","review":"Madonna has been around for almost three decades which is hard to believe. I remember when she first came on the music scene with Borderline and the rest is musical history. With the recent and sudden passing of Michael Jackson, Madonna even paid homage during one of her concerts to his memory which I thought it was touching.Madonna's Ray of Light is above average but not excellent but she keeps trying and recording. Her songs here are fine but not groundbreaking anymore. She has broken a lot ground during her career and there is not much left. As a mother and wife, Madonna has matured and so has her musical inclinations. She is a solid performer and can dance as well as sing a tune. The collection of songs here are mixed and no two are really alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"when i first heard this album, i thought, \\"of all things i knew madonna could do, i had no idea she could do this...\\" i love the way this cd has this techno/trance feel to it, again something that i never incorporated with madonna in the past. to me she definitely proved she can pull it off as though she's been doing it her whole life. i have to say though that after this record, i haven't found much interest in her work... however, i can't stress enough how great this cd is. the standout tracks include \\"swim\\", \\"nothing really matters\\" and \\"the power of goodbye\\"... i would have liked to see madonna release \\"swim\\" simply because it seems like a song w/a more controversial tone to it, something that would go great with her, and then the song is just amazing with the echo of the ocean waves in the background... and of course, it is always nice to hear a mother singing to her child, so \\"little star\\" shows us madonna crooning in memory of her daughter...something worth checking out :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what all the hype was about...","review":"When I first heard the song Frozen in March of 1998 I thought to myself...What the hell is this? When the album came out and I actually bought it, I found that the only two songs that I liked were Ray of Light and Mer Girl. This CD was not Madonna at all, and just another re-invention for her. She needed people to stll be interested with her so she went to the Spiritual look which definitely is NOT Madonna Ciccone! This is a bad CD and the songs aren't good. Erotica is Madonna..Ray of Light is NOT Madonna. Only buy it if you like a cheap imitaion of Spirituality..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't listen to the critics - this album is the pits!","review":"I can't believe that everyone is praising this album.

William Orbit's backgrounds are just what you thought we'd be listening to in 1999, and I'm definitely going to flip to his page next. But as for the Queen of the 80's... sorry... I was waiting for the next female artisan-spirit to enter this talent-deprived music world and listening to the singles, I thought Madonna now had potential. But this album offers nothing to the listener. The lyrics are as generic as you'd expect from a team of four writers. Orbit made this album by himself and he should have stopped there... Madonna could have (and probably did) cut the vocals in 2-3 hours. Tremendous disappointment.Alanis is still by far the most talented artist on the Maverick label (by light-years), and Tori Amos is the Queen of the Keys. Nobody compares to these two ladies, and nobody appears to even be close."},{"rating":"1","title":"please this music is so not madonna","review":"i absolutly hate this cd i mean she used to have such good music .then she had a baby and her music all changed now her music makes me want to throw my radio. why would anyone like this music if i could have given her a 0 i would have. madonna go back to your old music when you were cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor vocals and music","review":"This has some of the the worst so called electronica music I've heard. It so dated and lifeless I can't undertand how anyone would think it is different or original. One song has that old flying saucer sound they use in those old Godzilla movies. Also, the song writing is poorly done. It's painfull listening to Madonna try to hit the semi high notes. This is especially evident in ROL and To Have Not To Hold. There is also alot of echo vocal layering on POG to make it sound like she has a better voice than she does. Sad thing is it doesn't work that well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The very best -and worst- of electronica","review":"Boy, what a pile of dung. All of it. I fully agree with all the electronica fans who rated it as garbage.Oh, hold on a second: I just remembered, all of electronica sucks, every single \\"song\\" or whatever electronica is.So let me rephrase my critic: this album is a great, perfect example of today's electronica."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying,overrated,and pretencious","review":"techno [poo] with pretensious lyrics. Don't get me wrong, I am a big Madonna fan, but this material just failed to live up to all the hype(and my personal expectations).I've really tried liking this cd,but after about a million listens,I just fail to see all the emotional depth,or perfect musical quality that everyone thinks this cd is full of. I just find it shallow, and just as bad with the like a virgin and material girl [poo] she started out with. Maybe it's just the fact that I SERIOUSLY dislike techno music, but that's not even the point. The melodies are totally dull,definately stuff we've heard before.the lyrics are childish and completely pretencious.

Her latest album is really not worthy of her talents. The musicianship is amaturish and worse the lyrics are an embarrasment. I really don't want to hear about Madonna's discovery that the world does not revolve around her. I am happy she now has a child that she loves. Thank god she does just have herself to think about any more. Another embarrasment is the graphic overlayed on top of her photo in the CD booklet. Are we to understand that the \\"Ray of Light\\" is Madonna's nipple? This is really bad! Skip this one but give her another try later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like sand in my under pants.","review":"As much as i look forward to a day at the beach, I know that every good thing in life has a consequence.

In many ways I have grown up with Madonna and her music....which is a good thing. Having said that, \\"Ray of Light\\" is clearly her finest work to date. I bought this CD when it originaly came out 5 years ago, but it took me that long to learn to appreciate it. Above all else, the lyrics are superb here. They are deep, thoughtful and ironic. I particularly like \\"Drowned World\\" \\"Swim\\" \\"Little Star\\" \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\"......and last but not least \\"Frozen\\", a song whose lyrics are sublime.I was lucky enough to see Madonna's Drowned World Tour this summer in Atlanta. It was like seeing an old friend and talking over old times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Album!","review":"Great dance tunes with an eclectic mixture of songs.

Thou her \\"Enlightened\\" stage was like a breeze in her ever-changing life, it left a trail of beautiful results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album!","review":"The very beautiful Madonna strikes again with 1998's RAY OF LIGHT. This was a best-seller spawning hits such as the title track,FROZEN,THE POWER OF GOODBYE, and DROWNED WORLD/SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE. They're all on GHV2(Greatest Hits Volume 2). The video for RAY OF LIGHT was totally awesome,I must admit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's Best","review":"I have listened to most of Madonna's music from the 80's to the 00's, and her 1998 album \\"Ray of Light\\" is my absolute favourite. She has matured so much since the \\"material girl\\" days of the late 80's. Some might say this album was her inauguration into the world of electronica. Although it is true, some of the songs do have fast beats with futuristic sounds, many are just plain Madonna pop (\\"swim\\", \\"nothing really matters\\", etc.). It is an eclectic mix of traditional pop, modern electronica, and hindu mysticism. But dont let that scare you, it makes for a perfect combination that is distinctly madonna. A must buy!!my favs:every single one. even shanti/ashtangi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return Of The Queen","review":"Ray Of Light was Madonnas first album in four years (the previous being the stellar Bedtime Stories). This album is essential, it is stunning. The songs are so well crafted that I feel that it's wasted sometimes on me. There are no words without repeating to express this albums brilliance. I suggest this album highly. The best songs are; Drowned World/Substitute For Love, Swim, Ray Of Light, Candy Perfume Girl, Skin, Frozen and Power Of Goodbye.YOU HAVE GOT TO GET THIS ALBUM! Even if you hate Madonna this albums brilliance transcendes your hate, it's rock with electronica mixed in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronica Madonna!","review":"This is the best CD I have listened to in a long time.From Drowned World/Substitute For Love to MerGirl, it is Madonna's most ambitious recording to date. The electronica music I have heard before was bland but this isn't. It is rich and the way producer William Orbit layered the music is superb.I strongly recommend this CD. If you are a real Madonna fan, check out the Video Collection 93:99. It includes videos from the Erotica album through Ray of Light. It is interesting to see how much Madonna changed in between.Especially in 'The Power of Goodbye' video. You can really see a different Madonna shine through. I know she changes her look periodically but there is an inner change as well (brought on by the birth of Lourdes,no doubt)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ray of Perfection","review":"This, without a doubt, is Madonna's best album ever. All of the songs are meaningful and emotional. Also they have such a powerful rhythm and pulse that makes you dance without even realizing it. All of the traks are exceptional, but the ones that stand out are \\"Ray of Light\\" \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters.\\" I heard there were plans to release the follow up album later this summer. I am sure they will be companion albums, so you can't have one without the other. The \\"Ray of Light\\" album that was released in Japan has an extra track called \\"Has to Be.\\" If you can find a copy and listen to it you will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulous!","review":"This CD makes me feel very fresh and energetic! Whenever I need revitalizing, I turn to Ray of Light. Every song on this album is an electric example of Madonna's extreme talent for giving out good vibes. From the deep emotion in Power of Goodbye to the comforting tone in Little Star (those are my two favorite songs from this album), this is feel good music at its best and every track is pure bliss. I use it to help me stay upbeat and happy when I work out or clean - hearing these songs make even the most mundane activities seem like fun. This is a super CD for people who are Madonna beginners, as well as old-timers who like a thrill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"* Ray Of Light *","review":"This is definitely a ray of light to my CD collection. It's adventurous and atmospheric - definitely a great work.There are no low points to the album, every song is beautiful in its own way.This album is very well thought of, which is no surprise to me. It's a great work, very forward-thinking and definitely one of Madonna's best. If you are a fan of Madonna, or even if you're not, you should listen to this album. Simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Madonna album","review":"I'm not a big fan of Madonna's music as I once was but Ray of Light remains my favorite album she has put out. A lot of the credit goes to producer William Orbit who provides a killer sonic background to her lyrics. I think it is Madonna's most mature effort she has put out and it shows in her lyrics. I like how subtle the dance beats are and how they allow Madonna's vocals to be front and center. The ballads on this album are the best that Madonna has ever done especially \\"The Power of Goodbye\\", \\"Frozen\\", and \\"Skin\\". Ray of Light is not a perfect album.There were a few tracks that I didn't care for but most of the album I love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance","review":"Well what can I say...I'm still in shock...

Forget Like A Virgin, Vogue and even the phenomenal Justify My Love ....this album is an amazing leap for the Material Girl. Finally a Madonna album that's more about the music than the media. A solid piece of work, an ingenious collaboration with Willam Orbit, by far her best songwriting, Ray Of Light is a defining moment for an artist who has had several. It's as good as popular music gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sucess - Ray of Life","review":"Here in Brasil the music more listened is Frozen.

The music is just great. My favorite song if Frozen. All the songs are so good i had a hard time chooseing a song that i like as much as that one. Who ever buys this CD is in for a real treat. She moves me with her voice. Some are also soothing to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"These lyrics and music are the best.","review":"Madonna has changed her image so many time in the last 15 years I guess I shouldn't be suprised to see this one. This is by far the album of choice for me. No bubble gum pop can be found on this album. Every song has meaning. Ignore the other comments on here about it being bad...these other people never gave the album a chance...they probably listened to the first 15 seconds of each song and made a decsion about the whole song and album. The song \\"Power of Good-bye\\", teaches us all the lesson of letting go of lost loves as hard as it may be. \\"Frozen\\" also teaches us that not admitting to yourself as to who you are is, just as bad as not letting go of the past. An excellent album...an all time favorite of mine...a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CDS ever!","review":"I never really liked Madonna until I heard this album. I saw the video and than I really wanted it. I finally got it last weekend, and I have made a tape of it for my walkman.

I still have the \\"Ray of Light\\" cassette tape I bought in 98', along with the ROL CD and of course a few single remixes from this album. Timeless and classic. Every single song on this CD stands out on its own merit and artistic value. Each song blends and molds perfectly for what I consider to be her greatest masterpiece so far.For ten years now I have been listening to this CD and not once have I got bored or tired of it. Each play is like hearing it for the first time and falling in love with it all over again. The videos that accompanied the songs from this album only highlight how \\"full on\\" in harmony she was for this entire project. Everything was as it should be. And it glowed radiantly, still does.With the release of her latest album, Hard Candy, which I was less than pleased with, what a comforting gem Ray of Light has been as it showcases her true talent in all its glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album","review":"First of all, I would like to say that this is one of Madonna's best albums. Songs like \\"Ray Of Light\\" and \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" are great toe-tappers, while ballads like \\"The Power Of Goodbye\\" and \\"Frozen\\" send chills down my spine. Now, to the person that said that Madonna should stop acting like she's the first woman who's ever had a baby, I found this to be very insensitive. What if YOU were as talented as Madonna and you had a baby, wouldn't you like to share your joy with the world through your music? That's what \\"Little Star\\" is, pure joy. Once again, a great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be a madonna fan to love this cd.","review":"This is by far her best work in over 10 years.

It sounds like Madonna has a crazy computer for a singing partner. The 'music' was way too over-synthesized and the 'singing' Madonna does adds no musicallity at all. I would not suggest you buy this CD unless you enjoy having headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"severe garbage","review":"\\"Forzen\\" is pure excellence. I really looked forward to the rest of the CD upon purchasing it. It turned to be 12 other tracks of Madonna hopelessly trying to ape Bjork. Pathetic. Orbit has talents, but nothing could lend credibility to the sorrowful attempt for Madonna to become a rave hippie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche's, cliche's","review":"That's about all there is to the song writing and theme of this album. Infact the words(more often than not) border on grade school level writing. ROL is all image with no substance. It doesn't offer anything new or original. As for the music, many of the songs have the same monotonous sound that goes nowhere. Emotional techno? Yes I've heard it, in fact it's very common. Unfortunately, you wouldn't know it listening to this insipid dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoke And Mirrors","review":"If you are into 40 year old wanna-be musicians, desperate to appear hip, this album is for you. Lots of techno sounds to keep your attention away from Madonna's voice as much as possible. Songs are shallow but then so is Madonna's vocal range. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont like her attitude or her voice","review":"me me me is all this cd is about. she sings about having a baby. like the whole world is suppose to care. well sorry maddy, we don't. millions of women had babies before you. she remains selfish and unchanged. im tired of her cd, and attitude"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"This Cd of Maddy is really weak. I used to like a lot of her 80s songs when I was a kid. But this CD is getting so boring after not even one month. Madonna seems to be mysterious, but somehow it seems to be rather superficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"its terribly recorded","review":"first of all i am a fan of madonna. the quality of her material over the years will stand the test of time. But i cannot listen to this cd because it is so badly recorded and overproduced. Themusic itself is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable.","review":"I like Madonna. I like techno. This CD is like nails on a chalkboard for me. Banal lyrics. Horrifically off-key singing. A monumentally empty effort, devoid of Madonna's usual wit or intelligence, and expecially disappointing coming after the whip-smart \\"Bedtime Story.\\" Grammys and sales aside, this is just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Without a veil to hide behind, Madonna truly shows her flaws","review":"I can't believe that everyone is praising this album. Madonna is marketing it as 'electronica' when really all it sounds like is a heaping pile of the same old cheese pop she's been putting out for years. She repeats the phrase \\"Your heart's not open\\" in several songs, and resorts to putting out the same corny ballads that her fans eat up for whatever reason. Madonna was never really about music - anyone who liked her in the past did so because of her sexy image. Now she's a mother, ditched the sexpot thing for a lame new age thing, and anyone who hasn't before can see that all the songs are really pathetic. One of the worst albums of 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your time on this","review":"im not tryin to dis on madonna but this album, in my opinion, is her worst. maybe its because im hardly a fan, and when i was one, she was still 'like a virgin'. so if you must hear this album, i highly reccomend skipping song number four.. candy perfume girl? come on now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"While it should be credited to Madonna that she has proven to be very versatile and often tries something new, this time she didn't really hit the bull's eye. A couple of songs (mainly the hit singles) on this album are pretty okay but the rest is really horrifying. This overly electronic music makes you nervous! There are many better albums in Madonna's rich opus. The best about this one here is the pictures in the booklet. So if you care about the music, you better buy another Madonna CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Return to Sender","review":"Madonna leaps and bleeps her way through New Age exploration. \\"Ray of Light\\" is fun but leaves you feeling like you've had one too many one night stands. This is a vacuous dance CD with an occasional foray into psuedo introspection. You have to be a Madonna fan for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Done That","review":"Madonna has pulled up the sounds, beeps and bleeps from 80s techno and tries to pass it off as new. Pet Shop Boys? Communards? Erasure?

Revenge is the best track of the album but Love affair is good too and Cyberraga"},{"rating":"2","title":"best of Madonna so far","review":"It's the kind music that is both easy listening and unique to me. And almost five years passed, it is still refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the next....","review":"This is a great cd, not Madonna's best but certainly one of them, and MUCH better than Music which is bland. The best songs on Ray of light are mainly the singles , although there arent any songs you can really describe as 'bad'. It is perfect for chilling to. My personal pick for faves are 'frozen' candy perfume girl' and 'little star'. I cant get too excited about this album but it is Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only \\"Has to Be\\" has made it onto the album...","review":"Madonna has never really proven herself as a capable producer, as this album clearly demonstrates. Ray of Light is bogged down by muddy production, only twice (on the beautiful ballad \\"Frozen\\" and the techno-inspired \\"Skin\\") reaching a level of ambient greatness. The album also suffers from rather cliched and predictable lyrics (most notably on \\"Nothing Really Matters\\"). Nevertheless, Madonna still manages to create several captivating moments. The meditative opener \\"Drowned World\\", for example, or the swirling title cut. The album's highlight, however, is the dazzling six and a half minute album track \\"Skin\\". Madonna's fantastically ambiguous lyrics make this song one of her most provocative. Overall, despite it's flaws, Ray of Light is an above average, satisfying pop album, light years ahead of most other mainstream pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not a big deal,really","review":"I don't know why everybody is making such a big deal of Madonna. OK, she's not bad. This CD is OK, but not overwhelming at all. After 2weeks it falls on your nerves."},{"rating":"2","title":"She never gets old, she is a shining star that never fades.","review":"For many years she has grabbed the attenion of millions of fans with her power of strength and freedom.

She is a strong woman. -Jacklyn Watkins"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"There are three decent tracks on here (Ray of Light, Frozen, Power of Goodbye) but not much else. \\"True Blue\\", \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" are Madonna's truly great albums. This one, however, is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENON!!!!","review":"This album is deeply amazing! I bought it the day it came out and i still listen to it all the time. Its something that i won't get sick of. My favorite song is substitute for love, ray of light and nothing really matters. It's amazing how she made electronic music into something emotional. Once again Madonna had proved to be the ultimate DIVA and the queen of pop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Madonna CD I wanted to buy!","review":"This is a great CD!

My favorite songs are the immediately catchy 'Swim', Ray of Light, and 'Power of Goodbye' (I LOVE the words to that one)I think this album's a good dance album.

I like it.People who liked this stuff will also like Jesus and Mary Chain's 'Honey's Dead'."},{"rating":"2","title":"This could easily be the best cd Madonna has made yet!","review":"I love this cd it rocks everyone should buy it because you're guaranteed to love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very racey, but morbid at the same time.","review":"Sounds don't grab me like they have in prior albums, but a handful are really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must get this CD!","review":"Madonna made a wise decision to push her music forward by working with William Orbit on this album. Just because this album may not sound like the old Madonna, it doesn't mean the music is not any good. Madonna has never revealed so much of herself as she does in _Ray_of_Light_. She sounds less angry and more personal. I absolutely love this album and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant...shows Madonna's evolution as an artist.","review":"Ray of Light may seem different and a little strange at first, but this is where its charm lies. Madonna isn't afriad to try new things, unlike most artists, and she does it with vigor, strength and above all else- style. Most impressive is her vocal evolution, the voice is much stronger now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's finest record ever!!!","review":"This is no doubt a Madonna's finest record album up to date, and also is my favorite studio album. The sound is new, fresh, and very deeply impressive. every song on this album is a masterpiece, they all sound very serious, and much efforts have been put into it to create the amazing sound of them!I love all the tracks, except track 8 (cause I dont understand the language on that song) The singles and videos released off this album are:Frozen (1998)Ray of Light (1998)Drowned World/Substitute For Love (1998)The Power Of Goodbye (1998)Nothing Really Matters (1999)Though I would like \\"Swim\\" to be a single or have a video too, thats such a great song (better than Nothing really matters I think)Absolutely amazing, Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Familiar music with a new twist","review":"Much has been made of Madonna's recent ascention into the realm of enlightened spiritual goddess via a trek to India. Far from raising her lyrics to a new level, Madonna's newfound spirituality has instead made her songwriting incessantly annoying. Songs like \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" and \\"Drowned World\\" are examples of the kind of self indulgence that is intolerable even from the woman who invented the concept. And the music, while certainly listenable, contains familiar sounds and melodies wrapped in Orbit's new wave and rave foil. Madonna's voice is pipe-cleaner thin, perfectly suited to the lyrics she weaves. All these elements add up to a Grammy favorite that will appease most fans and may even earn Madonna some new ones. But true dance music fans will only respect the album's title cut and the sole sex-romp \\"Skin.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best","review":"This is amazing what she did with this record artistically - this music can be listened to in the years to come over and over. These are really good songs. In adition to this, commercially the album already 9 million copies sold worldwide!!! She really is seated in the female singers' thrown"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappionted","review":"I liked \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" \\"Frozen\\" and \\"Little Star\\" but can't help thinking to myself: had this album had been put out by an unknown artist or incognito, it never would have been noticed -I can't say that about Madonna's other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Yeah, I like Madonna, but the songs on this CD were not that great. I like only three songs on this CD: #1 (Drowned World/Substitution for Love), #8 (Shanti/Ashtangi), and #9 (Frozen). I bought the CD after hearing \\"Frozen\\" on the radio, and was overall very disappointed. I hope no one else makes the mistake I did of buying this CD after hearing only one or two songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's my lucky star??","review":"I don't think people who like Madonna in 80's will enjoy this album.I'b better buy Immaculate Collection or Like a Virgin. Why can't we have fun like we did in the 80's?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ray of Light","review":"I am a fan of Madonna's, I enjoyed this rare and difficult to find album.

LOL Really can't say anything else about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's best ever","review":"When I first got this CD, it was good, but I didn't know what all the hype was about. After listening to it some more, I discovered how deep the lyrics truely are, and how much attention was paid to detail. This CD is one that you can listen to over and over, and discover something new in the music each time. I'm not a big Madonna fan, but this CD is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album she has ever made","review":"The Disk is without discussion the best one from Madonna. Ray of Light made me a fan of Madonna, since i have ever thougt listen to her music.Drowned World, and some other songs, are an artistic play of the instruments, and make her one of the best music creator, because of the conbinations of instruments and sounds, mixing basic electric guitar with MIDI sounds. This combinations made the songs unpredictible, only until you listen to them a few times.Is a great album, if i could get it 6 stars, i'll do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna is a Queen!!!","review":"I have been a Madonna fan since the boy-toy days. She still amazes me. This CD hasn't left my CD player since I bought it. This CD makes me feel happy (Ray of Light, Ashanti). It makes me feel sad (Power of Good-bye). It makes me FEEL. Madonna shows how much she has matured, especially when you listen to her \\"early years\\". Although, I still appreciate those years!! Madonna, you are my Queen. Rock on sister friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna is evolving","review":"Ray of light is hopefully just one step in the development of Madonna. Compared to her earlier work there's definitely going on something. I agree with some people saying that it's not all that special. Let's wait for her next step."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very interesting cd.","review":"Madonna has done a fair job at capturing what is happening in clubs and making it go pop! Consumers who are clueless to underground trends will appreciate this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna is totally awesome and I recomend her CD to anyone!","review":"I find Madonna really cool.I love her voice, style and sound affects. I guarantee this is not a waste of time or money.This CD is definatly one of Madonna's best and a inspiration to anyone, anywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Madonna... So-So William Orbit","review":"As a fan of William Orbit and occasionally a fan of Madonna, I was looking forward to the release of this collaboration for a long time. Of course, I loved it at first listen. It is Madonna's best album, by far. If you're a follower of William Orbit, however, I think you'll find the work to be less sophisticated than his work on Hinterland and Strange Cargo III. Still, a must-have for a fan of either of these artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny , didn't deserve a grammy","review":"I don't get all the five star reviews. There's not much cutting edge about this album. Yeah it sounds good, but there's isn't anything unique about the song writing. Plus, most of the music is adult contemporary, no real dance tunes except ROL. The album is OK, but no classic. I mean \\"your frozen if your hearts not open\\". Come on! I know people in my neighborhood who could write better lines than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't know Madonna could be boring.","review":"No matter how much you like Madonna I would not recommend this album to you. She tries way too hard to sound older and spiritual and just turns out sounding boring and crappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe people like this!","review":"Something is truly wrong with the world when critics and people are praising this album. Madonna jumps on another bandwagon, and makes a fool out of herself. This is NOT electronica, and if you don't like this album, don't let it deter you from checking out the good stuff like Fluke, Crystal Method, Underworld, Photek, etc. , as all of it is much better than this boring pop junk.Everything Madonna has done in the past has always been incredibly cheesy, with some of the worst lyrics this side of the Backstreet Boys. The critics are absolutely wrong - don't waste your time or money on this awful disc, unless you are looking for an expensive coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Last year I really liked the song \\"Ray of Light,\\" so I tried this album. All of a sudden it seemed as if \\"Ray of Light\\" was being played too much on the radio. Also, I never really liked \\"Frozen.\\" The only song I liked on the whole album was \\"The Power of Good-Bye.\\" I realized that this album wasn't worth my time. I really wanted to like this album, but I just couldn't listen to the rest of it. I finally sold it to a used CD store today."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks","review":"This whole album is just Madonna complaining about how people mistreat her and how smart she thinks she is. Her singing stinks, and so does her attitude. Does she really think people should be impressed it took her until she was fortysomething to realise money and fame don't buy happiness? I knew that before I was twelve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like the soundtrack to Forbidden Planet","review":"Forbidden Planet is a sci fi movie from the mid fifties. Anyway all the sound elements on this album sound old hat to me. As usual the critics wouldn't know a good album if it bit them on the head. Madonna sounds like a hick on this album, slurring her R's in an attempt to sound like a better singer. I hate how she uses the phrase 'YOUR HEART IS NOT OPEN' over and over in these songs. Talk about overkill. Also, if this is such a personal album why hire so many song writers? My suggestion is to leave this on the sales rack and pick up the far superior Garbage version 2.0. Better sound, better lyrics, and better singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly bad","review":"Whenever Madonna's in trouble she usually calls Patrick Leonard in for the rescue. Unfortunately this time not even Pat can help Madonna save face. Never has blending pop with techno elements been more mundane. ROL is neither cutting edge nor radio friendly. The only decent songs are the ones with five or more songwriters. Those being ROL and DW.Whoever said they have never heard emotional techno should check out the FAR superior PORTISHEAD a true techno act. And one that has been producing emotional music long before Madonna tried to take credit for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lite wanna-be electronica","review":"This album is a perfect example of what Madonna is good at. She manipulates the most popular current style of music and applies her faux intellectualism and musical background to fashion it into something as her own. It is like taking in a lost dog and feeding it out of you own dog's plate. The sources for this type of music are far better than this run-off of drainage electronica."},{"rating":"1","title":"one good song, the rest sound similar, all kind of slow","review":"madonna's music is often unique. Much is dancable, and much is easy enough to sing along with. This new album goes away from that. Only one song on the cd sparked a fire in me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"Madonna is not good. this is her worst music ever. she can't sing at all. she should retire. she's old she can't perform at all. she made a fool out of herself this past year with her crapy tv performances. No wonder she decided not to tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Original!!! This whole album sounds like 80's Erasure","review":"I do like some songs, but frankly, I think Erasure does better music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it the first time, when it was called ACHTUNG BABY","review":"A big disappointment. Ray of Light is the ONLY song with any energy at all; the others are limp, \\"introspective\\" wet noodles. I'm a huge fan and ran to the store the first day this came out, but I'm sorry I need to dance and this doesn't deliver. Also the resemblence to U2 is blatant and stale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one Madonna!","review":"I saw Ray of Light on MTV for the first time, and found it stuck in my head all day, which saved me electric as I didn't need to play any other CD. To me the song and Madonna came across as a copy of Alanis Morrissete, which is very unusual as Madonna usually has her own image. It's still good though all the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's Best...","review":"Not since Like A Prayer has Madonna put together such a wonderful and captivating album, though maybe I'm biased!) She has perhaps added a new dimension to electronica by giving it meaningful lyrics. Way to go Maddy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I really didn't think this album was very good. Madonna changed her style and does not really sound like Madonna anymore. Missing are her signature dance songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"Madonna didn't used to be this bad. I recall the song \\"I'll Remember You\\" being somewhat good...However, this CD (And the Ray of Light video) just don't match up to the standards Madonna used to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album, bad attitude","review":"I have grown up listeing to Modonna ever since lucky star nad Borderline I have idolized her ...until i saw her attitude, yes this album is her best yet, her vocals are beter than any other album and her lyrics are too. This is my favorite album by her however, it is not origional, Bjork is the starter of this trend anyway, I saw on the MTV awards and for her to say \\"many people don't impress me\\" is so ridiculous b/c shes been around a long time and has surely created a name for herself but there are people more talented than she for example, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Tina Turner, Aretha ect. so for her to say that is just dopey. However I love Madonna and thsi album is her best work yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Cd isn't much of anything","review":"Infact ROL comes of as rather tired and fake. The vocals are poor and the lyrics are manufactured with nothing real to digest. Not innovative or inspiring, just another manufactured career move."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"This is the best Madonna album? Her beats are retreads on earlier material by other better artists. Her lyrics are typically self-centered and she still cannot sing. Get \\"Erotica\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good dance record","review":"None of these songs have a really good hook or are filled with any energy. Most of the tacks are murky and watered down techno. This is probably why the singles didn't make much of an impression on radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Madonna Album","review":"Ok, while Ray of Light may be an unfair comparison to Pink Floyd's Dark side of the Moon, Pet Sounds from the Beach Boys, or Beatles Psychedelic songs that we all love, Madonna's material on this album ASPIRE to that greatness. I like the mood it sets...space odessy like sounds with a bit of mystery, along with great beats (the ambiance makes you feel good). I think it's one of her best albums where her voice works well with her music......and for the first time ever, I actually agree with the critics......her singing lessons from \\"Evita\\" really paid off on this album. She's singing at her best and her material feels more mature too.Songs that catch my attention (besides those well known hits off this album): Substiute for Love, Swim, and Nothing really matters.Ray of Light is quite unique. It leaves me longing to hear more of these types of songs from her......and that's when I know it's a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"some really creative work on this CD","review":"swim, candy perfume girl, ray of light, frozen, power of goodbye and little star are some of madonna's most experimental music of her career in which there are sophisticated songwriting, electronica, r&b and dance music combined with unique sounds and fabulous videos for the songs mentioned that were released. Getting the album for these songs alone is worth it, believe me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"could be the pinacle of her career","review":"I couldn't stand Madonna before this album (or after), but this combination of herself, William Orbit, Hinduism and Yoga have produced something really special that I just had to add to my small music collection. Although, you get a whopping total of 13 well crafted songs for your money, one of them is garbage (\\"Mer Girl\\") - thus the imperfect score."},{"rating":"2","title":"The stories the spawned the \\"classics\\".","review":"Sometime between going from a magazine writer to a schlock B-movie maker himself, writer/director Jim Wynorski put together this collection of short stories that served as the basis for numerous classic and cult classic movies. For any B-movie buff this book is required reading just to see how close (or far) the adaptations kept to the source stories. Especially noteworthy is John Campbell's Who Goes There, it will give you an added appreciation to John Carpenter 1982 film version of the tale. Great stuff. Find it, buy it, read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game stinks","review":"Oh my gosh. This game stinks so much.

I just played the 2 player mode at first and that's probably the best part of this game. The music is really bad. I don't pay money to hear some one cussin'. The gameplay is kind of disapointing, all's you really do is jump, hit a bunch of buttons... jump, hit a bunch of buttons...jump, hit a bunch of buttons... But if I were you I'd look for a better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controls are too hard","review":"The controls are too hard for me. If you have a Playstation or a N64, get the game for that. If not, skip this game. I think Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 would be 3 stars. Don't get this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tony Hawk Stinks!","review":"This game really stinks because it has no point to it. You would be better off having Tony Hawk 2, 3, or 4 for other sytems. It is a better use of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad game","review":"I was convinced that this was a great game by all the good reviews, so I got it thinking it was worth the money... But guess what, IT'S NOT! It may be fun in the begining but after a few days, after you get used to the controls, it's just the same boring thing over and over again. So take my advice and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game rules","review":"In the past I'v played games such as Trickstyle for dreamcast street Sk8ter for playstation and many others and im being totally honest when i say that none of those games even come close to Tony Hawk Pro Skater. With the games wide variety of characters levels boards and oh so awesome tricks this game is endless hours of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, something original!","review":"Forget all those typical fighting, role playing and sports games. Tony Hawk is something new and original! With hundreds of moves to learn, it's a new challange. The graphics are excellent, the game is fast paced and the music (with bands such as Primus) is great. Being an old school skater (such as Rob Roskopp, Steve Caballero, Jeff Kendall and others) the only skater I was failiar with was Tony Hawk. The Playstation edition came out long before the Dreamcast version, and I kept saying to myself, \\"Why waste my money on a Playstation copy when I know the Dreamcast one will be far superior?\\". Let me tell you something, it was worth the wait! This game won't end up on the floor or some game place, that's for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater","review":"This is an absolutely wonderful game!

This is a must for any Dreamcast user!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom Physics","review":"First off, this is an awesome game. Killer graphics, a pretty good soundtrack and awesome gameplay. So I do recommend it. But let me gripe about something. Whoever came up with the physics for this game is border line genius/idiot. Sometimes you'll pull of some of the most amazing stunts and magically land on your feet, other times you'll be coming straight down from a pipe jump and fall flat on your face. You'll just magically trip. I don't know if this is just a sort of weird thing going on with the Dreamcast port or what but it's painfully noticeable sometimes. Ok, done griping, get the game :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"I got this game 3 days ago and I love it. The 2 player modes are awesome. The single player modes are good as well. Plenty of hidden characters and levels to send you coming back for more.

All of them failed long before the should have. I will never buy a canon product again. They are marketed to be mobile but they cannot survive the simplest trips. At this point (after 4 pritners in a year) it is cheaper to go back and use the business center at the hotel no matter what it costs. At least I don't have to carry a broken printer in my breifcase or luggage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap piece of junk.","review":"This is a review written after 3 years of ownership. This printer is an over priced piece of garbage. I've owned 3 of them. Canon replaced it several times under warranty. I print very rarely and the printer is used on the desktop and never moved. Every time I needed to actually use the printer (once a month) it was clogged or the ink had dried up. 30 minutes needed to be spent hooking it directly to a computer to perform maintenance and figure out what was wrong. Finally, last night when I really needed it, the black print head died all together. I took the thing out and washed it by hand with alcohol and water. Scrubbed it raw. Pleaded with it. Screamed at it. It still wouldn't print black. I have a $250 brick sitting in my cabinet now. My next print with cost a lot less and have lasers in it and no clogging parts. Canon can kiss my print head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect printer, great \\"on the road\\"","review":"This is a great little printer on the desk and it also travels well, fits into the side pocket of a laptop bag.

Hopefully, I won't have any feed problems!"},{"rating":"1","title":"software nightmare","review":"The unit is a great size and I like its size.

I travel with medical teams to developing countries and have taken it on several trips. Works fine with 240V power outlets, ink cartridges are small but cheap and easy to pack.

The Bosch 40918 Excel Micro Edge wiper blades that I bought 2 or 3 years ago were great. They NEVER squeaked, not in light rain or heavy rain or cleaning the windshield with the cleaner fluid. But the replacement wiper refills ALWAYS squeak so loudly that it drives me nuts!

So, don't consider it a selling point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad execution; good idea","review":"At first this sounded like a cool idea. Take the MP3 player from the gym to the car and get your music. No CD's to burn. If there's a quality unit that accomplishes the concept then I would own it. This is not the one.I tried 5 of these (yes really....I'm a slow learner). One worked, well sort of. The issue appears to be in the plug. If the plug connection from the unit to my MP3 player is just right then we have stereo. If not then we have an \\"underwater\\" sound music coming from the radio. The other units were all \\"underwater.\\"As for the one unit that worked, the quality of the sound is just ok. I'm used to CD's in a good player, or MP3 through headphones.

When it was used in the car, it never produce quality sound with all the channel selection. It always has noise in the background which can not be removed. The channel selection is very unconvenience, you would need to keep the channel list, and adjust on and off accordingly every time you want to change the FM channel to get better sound.I was first attracted by its USB appreance. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING -- DO NOT BUY THIS!!!","review":"The idea was great and still is great.but not this product. it's horrible.What was SIIG thinking?Signal strength is very weak and there's constant background noise. The sound quality is absolutely horrible and not acceptable to most people. It comes with an audio cable to connect from the wireless card to an audio device. it fits very loosely and it makes sound quality even worse. also the whole unit is extremely sensitive to touches and bumps. every time i hit a bump, i end up loosing signal and have to readjust connections.if you're trying to get this to play music, this is not the one.I don't even know how SIIG got this to work up to 10 Meters.the farthest distance mine worked was 1 meter.if you still cannot resist and absolutely have to try this product, buy it from a local store with a generous return policy.good thing i bought this from a local store. i'm taking back tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant watch","review":"I have had this watch for over a year now.

As a long time Stooge fan, I know that there is still a few good Shemp shorts out there. It does contain the worst Stooge short though Cuckoo on A Choo Choo and most shorts are mostly remakes of earlier films with a little new footage being thrown in. It's still worth owning if your a Stooge fan and you can never beat the price of the sets. I'll be looking foward to the final volumes, hopefully they'll just release it as one volume rather then wait for two seperate volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"stoogefan","review":"This is the best three stooges collection on the market. Looking for the best quality picture and sound this is what you want. This is the best stooges collection of all I have every volume so far you won't be disappointed when you buy this collection I give it a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Sony","review":"I must give Sony credit for including the 2-D and 3-D versions of Spooks and Pardon My Backfire. But come on Sony! The 3-D encoding is awful! Horrible digital grain as well. Not to mention, what's with the magenta and green encoding?! Sure that is one way to do it but red-blue is standard with the anaglyph format. Glasses are not included either. Lucky for us, the 2-D versions are there. So... I used DVD shrink, ripped the tittles, opened up my Xilisoft 2-D to 3-D video converter program and BAM! Burned it onto DVD, threw on my standard red-blue 3D glasses and it looks amazing. Why is it that I did all of this on my crappy PC home computer in about an hour and a studio like Sony can't get it right? The only reason I bought Stooges vol. 7 is for the 3-D titles that I enjoyed as a kid. I'm glad I was able to remedy the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but On the Decline","review":"I'm total satisfied with how Sony has released this collection. I really commend them for putting every short in the volumes, however this is when the shorts start to decline. Overall, the dvd is good. The shorts are restored to really good quality and they have included a couple of 3D shorts. It also comes with two pairs of 3D glasses which is nice. Most of the shorts included with this volume are recycled shorts already made with Shemp and even some Curley shorts with Shemp in his place. Still a good one to add to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"wide screen too","review":"It's all been written from the other reviewers except that Columbia is including the original theatrical wide screen versions of the shorts too. 3-D and Wide Screen. My HD TV will love up converting these. Maybe a blu-ray isn't so far off."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO PRETTY, but not sturdy","review":"This ring is so pretty, I got so many comments on it. But it's not very sturdy or strongly made. I slipped my hand into a file cabinet and the ring caught on a file folder and snapped right in half! I was so upset because it's so pretty and I loved wearing it. So my advise would be - wear when you're not working!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good quality","review":"I purchased this ring only to return it. It's a beautiful ring, but the quality is not very good. It says it is adjustable, but when I tried to tighten it, it sounded like it was cracking. I thought it would break in half.

I made the mistake of ordering this item and figured that the \\"Elite\\" meant nothing. Well, Elite means the style of JT mask so just keep that in mind. I thought Amazon mislead me on this purchase. I bought the JT Flex 8 and underneath of that item, this lens was listed. I just figured it would fit. Stupid Me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goggle lens","review":"This lens won't fog up but it is very difficult to install and clean. I'd recommend going to some other brand of facemask that has a quick release lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good thermal lens.","review":"With the strange temperature variances between winter and summer here in Nevada a good thermal lens is a priceless piece of equipment no player, woods or otherwise, should be without.

Still a great addition to the line of compatible goggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"JT Elite full head","review":"I really like these lens, they actually make it easier to see during the evening hours just before the sun goes down. They leave little to no glare. Hard to change out but still very nice! Don't fog up as easy as the OEM lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Elite\\" Thermal Lens","review":"This product is not what is advertised in the name. I ordered this lens for my jt elite helmet with the headshield and this lens didn't even come close to fitting in. DO NOT BUY THIS if you bought the jt elite helmet with the headshield. IT DOES NOT FIT. Even though it mentions that exact helmet in the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"JT Thermal replacement Lens","review":"I bought this (about $16+shipping) for use with the JT Mask ($24.99) that I bought at Sports Authority. I have used it once and it did resist fogging through a 25 degree day of airsoft in a snow storm. It definitely worked a lot better than the standard lenses, and for the price (about $50 total, including shipping and tax, etc), was worth a shot before investing in a fancy $200 mask with a fan.Results may vary - if you tend to sweat a lot, you may see some condensate, though I still didn't get any fog. Probably not perfect, but much better than my $90 paintball mask... seems to resist scratches and dings well."},{"rating":"2","title":"she's a master","review":"I think Deborah Moggach is a master of misdirection. It really fascinates me how she can lay something so obvious right in front of your nose but then prevent you from seeing it. I don't always engage with her characters deeply, but I always like the mind of the writer behind what I'm reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book? Oh please...","review":"This has to be some of the worst writing I've been subjected to in years. It was so bad it was almost hilarious. I can't remember who recommended it to me, but if I can I'll be more careful in the future about her choices. People, do not waste your reading time on this - you surely have better things to do. Like ironing the bath towels or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, lust and art....","review":"This is a delightful historical romance with a dark edge and a wonderful meditation on love, lust, deception, art and redemption. The prose reads like blank verse, the characters are strongly drawn, the setting evocative and realistic and the plot strong, convincing and sustaining to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it","review":"In this book I found myself walking the streets of a dutch city or looking at a Vermeer painting. I was totally taken by the overall atmosphere of the times : the tulipomania, the painters, the booming economy of Holland at the time. I personally didn't find the book to be predictable but well constructed, delicate in a way. Most is not said. It is up to the reader to sense: this was the magic of the book for me. I had a great time reading this book for its simplicity, engrossing storyline and hidden messages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tulips, Dutch art, and romance","review":"The story is about a young woman married to a much older man, a solid Amsterdam merchant. As was common, he commissions their portrait, and, inevitably, Sophia and Jan, the painter, fall in love and begin an adulterous affair. At the same time, the maid Maria becomes pregnant. Sophia comes up with a plan that will allow her to be with her lover. (I won't give it away - you'll have to read it.) But it takes money. And so they get caught up in Tulipmania.Moggach does an excellent job of bringing 1630's Amsterdam to life. These are the people in Rembrandt's and Vermeer's paintings, in the flesh.It's an interestingly constructed book as well. The chapters are short, each being told through the eyes of a different character.The last few chapters seem, in some ways, to be tacked on, as though the author felt, \\"I must decide what happens to everyone and tell my readers.\\" No loose ends here."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok I guess","review":"This was one of the last books I had read during my \\"dutch\\" phase (i.e Girl in Hyacinth Blue, Girl with Pearl Earring, Coffee Traders..) so maybe I was getting bored with the period. Or maybe I can't imagine people getting so invested - emotionally and financiall - in tulips.The ending was too...easy. I usually hate a sad ending but since I didn't really like Sophia I would have preferred something darker at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty Historical Small Gem- Travel to 1630's Holland...","review":"...On a Time Machine. You've got a rogue of a lover with an old master art talent,a naive and sentimental young housewife married to an old bore of a husband (shades of ANNA KARENINA),some vivid desciptions of Dutch life way back when,the floods,wars, day to day affairs, religious friction,and generally crisp on the mark prose, that would make any aspiring author green with envy. Plus a roller coaster ride in the tulip craze of the time (update \\"dot-com\\" craze.) How can you beat it? Not easy! If you're a gardener,and especially a tulip buff,this is even better. It's obvious Ms. Moggach has done her homework,and has a sense humor too.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous and offensive!","review":"As an art historian, I found this book ludicrous and offensive! (...) but THIS book is just a smutty attempt at historical fiction. I couldn't finish, I was too disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"too precious","review":"There seem to be one of a raft of books set during the Dutch era of tulip speculation. (I assume this has some weird link to our own era of dot-com excesses.) As a guy who reads mainly women authors, even I found it too chick-flicky (although, admittedly, I only got a third of the way through). The epigraphs were distracting. I'm surprised other people found the sex offensive -- that was the best part. I think that Gregory Maguire's \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\" is a much more compelling treatment of the same era."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that gets better as it goes","review":"Was lored into the the book by the cover and the subject matter. Slow start -- too many stange sexual references. Loved the way each chapter came from a different character's perspective -- clever. Story unfolded in a compelling fashion -- couldn't put it down for the last quarter of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Please don't buy this. A terrible waste of my time. It rambled on and on and had a horrible ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Tale","review":"I have to say that I was quite surprised in that this book was a last minute choice of mine from the reduced table at Barnes & Noble. The pithy but elegantly exact language made this story intriguing and enjoyable. No, it's not Austin or Bronte prose, but the ebb and flow of description and dialogue draws one in and before one can really settle in, the story has reached its ultimate climax. With its numerous scriptural references, it is somewhat like a parable. All the ingredients are there: Love, deceit, greed, adultery, repentance, and redemption. The twists and turns of the author gives flavor to events that has the tulip mania of Holland of the 17th century as its backdrop. A good read that has brevity of language but a richness of content, a miniature gem if not delicate flower."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good read.","review":"I read this book very quickly, and really enjoyed it. It's about tulip speculation in the 18th century, which is like stock market speculation today. It's about a very young woman married to an older merchant who adores her. He commissions an artist to paint their portrait, and she immediately falls in love with the artist. There are a few side plots going on, with the maid and her lover, and with the servant of the artist. There are tangles of things going on, and a real surprise close to the end. I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tulip Fever","review":"Just didn't hold my interest but, for what it was (period piece taking place in Amsterdam)...well written. I did truly love \\"Marigold Hotel\\" so assumed I'd enjoy this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"This was a selection for my book club. I actually really enjoyed the book. After reading the book I went to the local institute of art and checked out some of the mentioned painting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing author!","review":"I don't think it would matter what this woman picked for a topic...everything I have read so far (which is most of them) is riveting and thought provoking. Just can't put them down! I can only hope she writes more soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging morality tale","review":"You have to read Tulip Fever in the right spirit. It's a clever, literate, witty, fast-paced tale of intrigue, love, lust, and greed, and the tragedy that results from trying to outwit the gods or fate. Yet the rhythm is such that one can't be too sad or take it too seriously. Just sit back for the roller coaster ride and let the sights and sounds of 17th century Amersterdam, and the characters in their silly and reckless behavior that will be their undoing wash over you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I love historical fiction, but you have to be a fourth grade girl to appreciate this cliche, slow-paced story about a serving girl in love with a painter. The rich, vivid setting is not done justice in the least, as the story mostly takes place in one house, and the historical magnitude of the events of the Golden Age are barely mentioned. It's disappointing overall, and not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but gross","review":"Tulip Fever is a really good book. It would be a great book if there weren't discriptions of what they did in bed together. I read historical fiction to get an idea about what life was like back then, and the parts in bed back then are the same as now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tulip Fever","review":"Admittedly, I did not get beyond page 27, but this is a Harlequin romance in disguise. The offensive sexual content was enough to make me stop reading (at page 27 no less). This was recommended to me because I also bought Artemisia, which is an excellent read. The two couldn't be more different. Artemisia actually told a story, but the plot in Tulip Fever took a back seat to the sexual exploits of the book's main characters.Don't be fooled by packaging or other reviews. If you like romance novels, this is for you. If not, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Read","review":"This is a wonderful book. The author takes you to 17th century Holland and builds a story around some interesting characters, including drunks, artists, merchants and prostitutes, before finally peeling off the layers, one-by-one, like an onion to the final conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful soundscapes that defy logic.","review":"After buying his first album, Confessions of a Selector I was intrigued enough to get the follow up. At first, it didn't seem as upbeat, as fun. But you listen to it a few times, and like many albums, you gravitate toward particular tracks that stand out. In this case, for me at least, Sombre Hombre is quite beautiful. Other tracks certainly deserve mention. Not just as background music, but quality time with the headphones or cranked up in the car.It's probably one of those CD's you end up listening to so much, you get sick of it... you discard it for a while and then refresh your memory and everything's wonderful again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim 'Love' Lee - Just Call Me Lone Lee","review":"JUST CALL ME 'LONE LEE' is a marked improvement over Tim 'Love' Lee's first album, CONFESSIONS OF A SELECTOR. For one, there's much less reliance on samples. Second, he draws on more influences on his tracks, particularly from the country-western genre. \\"Exit 747\\" could have been written by Ennio Morricone, while \\"Twilight Reservation\\" shuffles at its own morose pace. The \\"One Night Samba\\" interlude is the pure essence of what lounge music is, and followed, as it is, by gentle and sensuous \\"One Night Samba.\\" \\"The Goodbye Highway\\" is similarly gentle, boosted by its careful percussion and the musical moments of mystery and grace (not to mention trucker chatter mixed in with a harp!). And the closing track, \\"Go Down Dixie,\\" has such a lingering sadness with its crackly guitar and plaintive vocal sample that it makes you feel like you've been stranded on the open plain. Strangely powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unopened gift","review":"I thought a certain someone would love it but he put it on a shelf in the closet & it's never been opened -- Bad choice"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is fantastic--- very Russian in tone and intonation.","review":"I first heard this music while taking a class on the introduction to classical music, and have looked forward since then to buying it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This CD is a wonderful combination of technical skill in recording and artistic rendering of beautiful music. Other reviewers have commented on the Pictures at an Exhibition tracks. I think this is the benchmark which performances of this work should be judged.

Every time I listen to it, I get a better appreciation of its beauty and the talent of the artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which version is it?","review":"The CD displayed for this work and the downloaded mp3 files list the conductor as Carlo Maria Giulini, but the reviews all mention the classic Fritz Reiner performance.

It appears to be empty.Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not impressive","review":"I agree with many comments made before. This is a nice CD, with many amazing performances by superb soloists. However, it is not \\"perfect\\". There are minor problems, such as some of the tuning in the wind section, and rhythmic disruptions at some points. Reiner did a great job conducting the pieces, especially Pictures. Some of the sound and tone is not as developed as I would like, particularly in the low brass. In fact, there is little presence of horn, as well as inconsistent trombone playing(which I enjoy hearing). Don't get me wrong, there are great moments, but it's not the quality I love to hear from the CSO. I would recommend this CD to anyone interested in the music of Mussorgsky and the other composers, however, I am currently on a search to find the best performance, and I do not think I have found it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"8-Step Swing","review":"Great compliment to the video of the same title. McLean breaks the golf swing down to its basics and provides a nice illustration of the parts of the swing. Approach is simple enough for even a casual reader, but delves into great detail for a person of keen interest. Covers drills and procedures for improvement at every step, and is a great reference for a golfer of any skill level. I think this is a classic work, and recommend it to any golfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"marketing without instruction","review":"Mr Mclean's book on the golf swing is poorly written for the novice with 10% of the book devoted to why he is a great instructor.

This study guide may be helpful but only if you have the full text. Beware what you are buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failed attempt to compare two historical periods","review":"I felt rather disappointed reading this book. I seems to me that the author failed in giving a convincing picture. His comparisons of the Vietmam experience and classical or Homeric Greece are either superficial or forced. I suppose that the book may attract persons more involved in the Vietnam affair than I but I am convinced that this is caused by the Vietnam experience and not by the comparisons with classical Greece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachmaninoff excellent","review":"While I'm glad I have this cd, I wish I would have paid a few dollars more and purchased the Van Cliburn cd that couples the same Rachmaninoff recording found here with the Tchaikovsky concerto. The Rachmaninoff is first rate, with thunderous climaxes, melancholic phrases, and a wonderfully poetic adagio. Also, the huge chord in the final movement that leads to the final few bars brings me goosebumps. I must admit some disappointment with the Beethoven however. Although recorded only a year earlier, the sound quality is not nearly as good. Van Cliburn's playing sounds wonderful, but I often had the sense that he and the orchestra were not entirely together. Pay the few extra dollars and buy the coupling with the Tchaikovsky (which is a legendary recording)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure I agree with the reviews here...","review":"I'm not sure I agree with the reviews here... To me, Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto is one of those strongly Russian pieces that loses a lot of its vigor if its Slavic edge is muted, as it is in this recording. Fritz Reiner conducts the orchestra with leaden overstatement, as if it were Brahms or Wagner or some other Germanic composer. Van Cliburn gives a typically energetic performance, but in my mind it lacks the Slavic edge that you hear in, e.g., Rachmaninov's own performance of the piece. It's too optimistic and not harsh enough--in short, it's too American and insufficiently Russian.To me, Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concerto here is even more obviously lacking. The orchestra and Van Cliburn clearly fail to play together more than once. RCA seems to have added this recording as padding to fill the CD--don't treat it as anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked as advertised","review":"I purchased this as a sensor for a garage door open/close alarm I built. It worked perfectly for me. Note that there is a small arrow on the magnet and switch that should be aligned when installed, and also this is for low voltage low current control applications--definitely not 110V/15A.

Using these at low voltage and current without any issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnetic Switch Review","review":"I was disappointed at this purchase. Regardless of what the manufacturer claims, this magnetic switch is more for a hobbyist than in a commercial application. I purchased it to add an additional sensor to the side door on my motor home, so the intrusion alarm would work on the side door in addition to the main front doors. The alarm system works through the dome light circuit. I ended up getting a magnetic switch from a friend of mine who does home and commercial alarm installations. Now is works like it's supposed to do. I would not purchase this product again for an identical installation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch 'sticks' when the current flows","review":"I am using this in a 12v DC application, and the switch sticks when the magnet is applied and then removed, presumably due to the current flow. It is running a small bilge pump, so the current must be too much. There are no amp ratings anywhere in the description or packaging, so it's up to your best guess if it will work for you. I took the unit apart to see if there was an obvious issue, but none was evident. The tolerances in the glass tube that houses the reed are incredibly tight, and there is hardly a difference in the open/closed positions. Sensitive little bugger."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed. I purchased two of these switches and one is defective.

In my application I didn't need or want the tape, but when I removed it, it pulled the plastic case apart.

I would not recommend using them in close quarters where a wide motion isn't possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as represented","review":"The primary reason I purchased this one was due to it (supposedly) being 16\\" wide to cover up the hole from a removed light.

The collaboration of Barber and Price on the \\"Hermit Songs\\" and others reveals the composer's affection for the singer and the singer's understanding of the dramatic intent of the word and music. Alone, Price's interpretation of \\"Knoxville: Summer of 1915\\" is worth the price of the CD; it is singularly exquisite and cannot be matched! Price brings unmatched beauty, power, and understanding to the arias from \\"Anthony and Cleopatra\\" -- an opera composed with her voice in mind. It is indeed sad that Price never recorded \\"Vanessa,\\" nor the song cycle \\"Despite and Still,\\" nor the hauntingly beautiful \\"Sure on this Shining Night.\\" You will not be disappointed if you buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Leontyne Price's Samuel Barber recording on one CD","review":"Let me add to what was already mentioned regarding this CD release. Miss Price recorded Barber's The Hermit Songs after she premiered them in New York in the early 50's. The original LP which was released on Columbia Records was part of a series of new music. The record was deleated many years before Price became the opera superstar and her RCA Red Seal recordings became chart toppers. Years later, CBS released a CD of The Hermit songs and then RCA released them along with an album she did of arias from Anthony and Cleopatra and Knoxville Summer. This is a great opportunity to experience America's best.

Now, if somewhere in the cover, or at the beginning of the workout, it was explicited that you will require other elements, it would be different. But the whole idea of this dvd was that you were able to do it in your hotel room, so why not using elements that are likely to be there (towels, bed, sidebed table... )?

This is the first of this kind that I played. It was really fun. Unlike other racing games, you can do dirty tricks to win! The graphic is OK. It's South Park. What do you expect? The courses are a bit challenging at advanced levels, but it still is very enjoyable. The only things that I didn't like was the loading time. I had to wait about 10 seconds for the game to load every time I do a new race. The beginning sequence always shows the logos and the usual South Park song which cannot be turned off, so you have to spend at least 20 seconds looking at those things everytime you turn on the machine. But I think it is worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't bought them...","review":"These cards are well made, no problem there, and the design of the cards are great. The problem is that each character is printed separately on its own card, whereas a high percentage of Chinese vocabulary are made of of two characters; for example, \\"garden\\" is hua-yuan, but, there's a character card for hua and another card for yuan. It would be like English cards that had a card for base and another card for ball, but, no card for baseball as one word, or for sweet potato or for study hall. The cards would work well for learning to recognize distinct, separate characters, but not for practical vocabulary practice : you may not mind this, and I wouldn't have imagined it to be a problem, either, but, for what it's worth, I no longer use the cards (instead,I have made my own so I have all of those two-character words on one card...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for absolute beginners","review":"The flashcards are fine, but I would recommend them only as supplementary material once you are acquainted with some of the principles of character formation (there are several fine books for this), like character roots, and the more you know about this, the easier it will be to remember the characters. The booklet that comes with the flashcards is only a very shallow introduction to this. I think that, if I had begun to study characters with these flashcards, I would have been completely overwhelmed.

It takes time to realize that without this bunch of garbage that Epson has packed with the default installation we will do much better.The scanner by itself is very versatile,it is reasonably quick and has very good color rendition. It accepts MF film that makes many things for the inspired photographer much simpler. I'm not sure does it posses as much of the physical resolution as it claims to be, but I will describe it of as decent and reliable.

However it comes with these slide adapters for scanning slides. That's not so great. I've had mixed results with this, some slides come out great... and others, not so much. But for what I mainly use this scanner for, documents, business cards, artwork which I need to stitch together and photographs, its an excellent buy.

The performers on that LP included Sonja Knittel, Luise Camer, Heinz Hoppe and Willy Hofmann.Another disappointment was the finale - Tausend kleine Engel was less than one minute long. This favorite of mine could certainly have been extended for at least another minute - as is done during live performances.On the positive track, in addition to Die Cszardasfurstin, Naxos offers more than 28 minutes of excerpts of other operettas by Kalman.

The reader does not get a good feel for what is going on with many of the characters. The character development is lousy. I've enjoyed most of the other Batman related books that I have read even the ones that brought in DC characters that I wasn't overly familiar with, but this one, no, it just didn't work for me because I don't feel like I've gotten to know any of the characters that well.

When you write a journal you aren't writing for anyone but yourself. You don't need to tell yourself about what you already know.Also, a pilot who can fly jets could easily fly a Cessna.My biggest complaint is that at the end (SPOILER) he felt bad for killing people? Its the end of the world, people are trying to get to your survival mechanism.

It's not as bad as, say, the literally unreadable _Monster Island_, but it's certainly not in the same league as _World War Z_.

If, however, you're looking for a well-written and more realistic book for your reading enjoyment, look elsewhere. As I said in my review of this book's sequel, I realize that zombie fiction is fantasy, but some authors make the experience as realistic as they can, which adds to the enjoyment. But when the main character is a military officer who is already prepared for the apocalypse and is the luckiest person in the world, it just gets plain boring.

Take the book at face value and have a good time with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"EPIC","review":"This is one of the best zombie books ive ever read...its in journal format so its all \\"meat and potatoes\\"..anyone with some survival skills would be doing the exact same thing..the author is smart..good at description and you will not be able to put it down..i finished in 1 day..then my wife was \\"browsing\\" threw it and decided to read the whole thing also...this is a must for anyone thart has had any enjoyment with zombie movies in the past...ive given to 4 friends to read and all have said the same thing...WHEN IS PART 2 COMING OUT.....which the author states is almost finished...only bad thing i can comment on this book is the cliff hanger ending..thats it..a GREAT read and would make excellent movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read!","review":"I'm not really a huge zombie fan, but I did enjoy this book. It was recommended for me by the Amazon site so I bought it for the Kindle. An excellent read full of action that keeps you right in it from beginning to end. The only thing I didn't like about the book was the introduction as it seemed like it was written by someone else. Once you're past that though the book will keep you enthralled to the last page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I just finished reading this book, and must say it was an exhilirating read. I felt that even though people point out grammatical mistakes, that it was neccesary and was in fact a concious decision to portray realism.This book was great well placed, action in all the right places it left me hanging I can hardly wait for the sequel.If your a fan of Romero, you will enjoy this book, the zombies tend to be Romeroesque. As oppose to the hyper-violent variety that tend to run rampant through out literature. Though they are equally as blood thirsty just driven on a more primal level.Great book and zombie, or survivor book fan should check it out. Great first book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I ordered this book blind hoping for a surprise...and surprised I was. I sat down and read this book cover to cover in one sitting. Very well written and well paced. The writting format is that of a journal, which I haven't read before. The descriptions of the \\"writer\\" are very good. The action was believable and wasn't far fetched. I wouldn't call it a thrill ride, but I will say it was exciting and a bit suspensful. I wouldn't put it down until it was spent. I can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"i lost a whole day reading this!","review":"i must say that there have been maybe three books in my life that were as compelling as to keep me reading them without stoppping. this is one of those. i did welcome the format as a journal. definitely different. and while i personally noted discrepancies with some of the technical aspects, this is an outstanding read. well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read!","review":"What a great story, I'm another reader that just couldn't put it down! I loved the insight into the mind of the main character through his journal entries, how he planned ahead and tried to thing of escape routes.. food resources and such, come on who hasn't thought about.. \\"how would I survive...\\"! Oh.. and just go ahead and pick up \\"Beyond Exile\\" the 2nd in the series cause you'll want to jump right into it!!Eagerly awaiting the 3rd!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book in the Genre","review":"All I can say is wow! This is the book that got me into the genre! I loved it and the second one, I cannot wait for book 2 to come out. Mr. Bourne has some great idea's and I love the journal format of entries. This is by far on my top 10 list. Thank you for your service, and I look froward to reading more of your books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Journal style was a blast","review":"This is the first journal zombie-themed book I have read and I like it alot. It gets into the story with a minimum of long boring background and set up.What made it really interesting was that the author used real locations and people which I could relate to. The book moved fast and is a really fast read.I read it in a single afternoon but I was very satisfied and caught up in the story.I look forward to the follow ups that complete this saga.This is the beginning and the early parts of a zombie outbreak so do not expect closure at the end of this story.Very satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Zombie Fan","review":"I'm not a fan of zombie's. I'm a fan of books and movies that kill zombies! This book was a really fast read and very entertaining. It reads like a journal. I thought that may be irritating, but I was wrong. It reads very well and adds an extra element. I'm already reading the second book and I'm enjoying it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I really got into this book! could not but it down until i was completely finished and instantly bought the second!!!The way the author tells the story through a journal is awesome! It gives one of the most personal accounts for a zombie outbreak as any other movie/book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey begins","review":"The begining of a journey, a ride on a rollercoaster, that could make you scream, curse, fight or flight and maybe soil something. The Model of the Genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Top Three Zombie Stories so far","review":"Day by Day Armageddon is simply on of the best zombie novels out there. I just finished my twelvth zombie novel, which was not that great, and decided I needed to come back and give kudos to JL Bourne's first Day by Day book.Like WWZ, this novel is written in a very unique way which gives it a new and interesting feel. That unique writing style (Essentially a diary) revolves around an interesting and realistic character who reacts much as I would in his situation...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!","review":"This story is great. I bought it because it was suggested to me. What a great book! I would definitely suggest this book to anyone who is interested in the subject manner. I love how the writer makes you feel as though you are there with him struggling to survive during this zombie epidemic. I have not finished the book yet, but it is so good so far! I'd recommend reading this during the day because you may find yourself hearing things..HAHA.I hope that you enjoy the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome","review":"This book was a quick read...every time i told myself \\"ok one more page then ive got to put it down\\" something else happened and i couldnt put it down...excellent...also good for some ideas on self sufficient living too!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"author;PLEASE HURRY UP W/ SEQUEL!!!!!","review":"This book rocked. I absolutly cannot wait for the follow up.The guy who wrote this book is in Iraq and as far as I'm concerned they need to bring him home NOW as he is a NATIONAL TREASURE!! Dude please keep your head down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its a good buy","review":"this is a great boook its fun to read. the book is true to all the old school rules about the undead. and if you have read the zombie survival guide all the same rules and thoughts about survival of a zombie armageddon. i cant wait to see more from J. L. Bourne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite the awesome journal of the apocalypse","review":"Day by Day Armageddon is a book that I think I had placed in my shopping cart upwards of 10 times only to remove it. Eventually, I ended up buying it and was quite pleased with it. The book tells of a man on the run from a zombie outbreak that somehow manages to keep a daily journal of the events. The book is very gory and I will commend it on that. It manages to scare without over-the-top hijinks (not that I have a problem with over-the-top hijinks!) but if you are a fan of the zombie genre, do pick this one up.Also, I've read a lot of people complain about the writing. One thing you have to remember is that this book is supposed to be kept by a military pilot on the run from zombies - I think the diction works. I'm not for a moment saying that the the typos and grammatical mistakes were intentional, but they add to the journey nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear diary: The dead have risen!!!","review":"A really excellent story by a naval pilot. It's told in journal form starting with the mundane Jan 1 entry of a new year's resolution to keep a journal. The best part is that he really seems to know how to handle weapons. Too many zombie stories have the characters all wielding desert eagles getting head shots every time. Bourne comes across as having experience with guns and knowing their limitations. He is very convincing as a real person watching the world go to hell. A normal \\"joe\\" in a very abnormal situation.The book isn't real long and I eagerly await the promised sequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"I loved the book and the sequel as well. Max Brooks author of World War Z writes a great review for it also"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I was lucky enough to stubble upon this book when I started on my current zombie fad.Thank goodness I got to read this before the other crap in this genre. I just finished another bad read. I felt like I had to give credit where credit is due.This is a solid read with good characters and believable dialog. I appreciate the characters' motivation and their struggles to survive. I wish the 2nd installment was as strong as this one.You cannot go wrong with reading this story. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"Day by Day is a great read. The biggest issue I have with the novel is the fact that it is full of typing mistakes. However, I wonder if the author did some of them on purpose to make it more like a journal. The story is solid, and I have plans to read the next one. If you are looking to be entertained, you will not be dissapointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and scary","review":"If you are part of this new sub culture of younger (mostly male) Americans who love to talk and BS with your buddies about end of world scenarios this is a book for you. This book takes an apocalypse more serious than other zombie books, which makes it both fun to read and will also scare the hell out of you. The author tries to focus more on the survival aspect than the killing zombie aspect. Don't let that fool you though, there are plenty of high suspense moments that will have you gripping your book tightly.I sat down and read this book in three separate sessions. It IS a short book (200 pages) which is slightly disappointing but the author followed up with a part 2 (which I have just finished and will review next) that makes up for it.Why you will like this book:1. Survival checklists2. Zombie killing3. Resourceful main character(s)4. Believable scenarios"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book-!","review":"this book and the next one are amazing. I'm in the military and some of the comparisons he makes hit the mark. I really enjoyed these books. can't wait for the next one. arrived quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Soldier Here","review":"Did not like this book. I found it to be boring and the narrated voice was very boring also maybe another narrator will have been better. I felt like this story was all military based. To much detailed in what size his car or the size of the room and the type of gun and bullets used. No action is this book. I will not buy the others if this is how the story line goes plus I see he is using the same narrator for the other books too. Now I see why this book got so many 1 stars. Wished I'd listen to all of the 1 star reports before I purchased this audiobook"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this book","review":"this is a great book i got it on amazon as just one of those random zombie book buys i got it and was ordering the second book after reading the first few chapters i love to way the character speaks and the time the author must have taken to put in the details and items that he did just a great realistic zombie book if that exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best zombie novels ever!","review":"This book was another one of novels I purchased on amazon based on reviews that were mostly positive. And I must say that I was not disappointed. I've previously read \\"Patient zero\\", Rot and Ruin and Ex-hero's. So in comparing those I rate this second to only Patient zero since I'm such a big Joe Ledger fan. I was half way through this book when I decided to order the sequel. This is an action packed, highly suspenseful epic story, which the author made you believe. I highly recommend this book to every one. Because even if you're not a fan J.L. Bourne will make you a believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked!","review":"In my search for a new author to fulfill my addiction to zombie apocolyptica I found J.L. Bourne's Day by Day Armageddon. I was hooked immediately. Awesome book. The diary format of the story enables the reader to connect to the main character in a very realistic way. I felt that I was there. This is a quick read and great for those of us that either have short attention spans, or little time to cuddle up with a book, but when you do have the luxury of a couple hours to just read be prepared to get lost in Bourne's world. At some points in this book I was so caught up in the story that I had my husband carrying his 9mm to escort me outside for a smoke. Realistic as hell. I was so bummed when the book ended, like I said it's a quick read... but imagine my joy when I found he had already wrote the sequel. I just finished that book last night... equally as good and kept me on the edge of my seat. Now, I can't wait until the next comes out. I'm jones'n for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"March 19th, 1830 hrs","review":"If George Romero set the standard by which zombie movies are measured then J.L. Bourne has done the samething for the zombie novel. It is written in the form of a journal instead of a straight narrative. That's the only reason I didn't give it a Five Star rating. Hopefully it will be released in hardback so that more public libraries will pick it up. I think I will walk the perimeter....just kidding...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an Editor","review":"This book is basically a plot-less tale of survival in the zombie apocalypse. Very little character development, very little action, and no clear plot. The best part of the book are the last 20 pages or so, and even those events end in a trite manner. I can't recommend this book as it's nothing particularly memorable or worth reading. I don't want to bash the author but it's clear this book would have been a lot better if there were an editor involved - someone to correct grammar and more importantly to tell the writer to develop and polish an outline for the story they are trying to tell. There's no story being told at all, just a log of someone trying to survive. Reading a book that has no arc and no character development means it's a throwaway story because there's nothing or no one to care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap would be an understatement for this book","review":"I know it was written by an amateur, which is stated in the book, but that doesn't excuse it. IMHO, the book was glib and boring. Nothing new, no ambiance created in work, no texture of storytelling.If you've never read a zombie novel before, then this one might seem interesting, but in the end it's a wash."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"This is by far up there in the must read zombie books, I enjoyed it as much as world war z by max brooks and the (as the world dies)all 3 books. So read them all and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day by day aramaddon","review":"It was okay but, it was a little to slow and the discriptions just go on forever making this book much longer than it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can ya dig it ramero?","review":"The book is simple, straightforward, and a wonderful quick read. The book is written in a long series of journal entries, some of them short, such as those in a crisis situation, and some of them longer, when time isn't a problem but developing a clear thought process and understanding the unfolded events is key.If you're a zombie fan you've seen the movies and have probably read Max Brooks' \\"The Zombie Survival Guide.\\" Everything you know about zombie survival boils down to one thing: hide somewhere - sure, fortify your compound a supply it well, but HIDING is key. But how easy would that really be? This book is a step by step tale of someone trying to find that fortress and survive in a world gone nuts.Read this book slowly, imagine it as people in a real world (or a movie), and follow the downfall of mankind, one day at a time"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth 11.99","review":"Very short book for 11.99. The story was not very imaginative or very detailed. Might have been a decent read for .99 but do not waste your money on this very short story. I believe most of the reviews are highly over rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A survival horror masterpiece","review":"This book was amazing; I could not put it down once I started reading it. I have been a zombie fan all my life and it was very refreshing to see a original story that wasnt a clone of others. The problem with most zombie stories is you can predict what will happen because it happened in every other one. When I was reading this book I could not stop because I wanted to know what could possibly happen to the main character after all hes been through. I can not wait for DBDA2 to come out because I have already read this book like 5 times and its still great each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I love this book!

Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget's Review","review":"A new kind of terror is lurking in the shadows. It seems the dead have found a way to rise again and they are determined to rule indefinitely. One man has taken it upon himself to stand against them and try to rid the world of this evil.

I'm a huge zombie fan and this is one of the best zombie tales I've read yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you like walking dead you will love this series.","review":"Fantastic, book 2 is sizing up to be pretty fn epic!!!

Book. Is. Awesome.It's a fresh approach on the, sometimes old, zombie genre. By telling the story in a journal fashion, you really connect with the characters. It also makes the battle scenes and attacks that much more exciting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Zombie Book","review":"This is a great book if you are a Zombie fan. The Author Incorporates a lot of realistic technical knowledge that really pulls the story together and continues to keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Escape to a Scary World","review":"This book delivers on all the aspects of zombie apocalypse fiction that I enjoy: a rapidly disintegrating world, scary scenarios of survival, and more or less traditional zombies. The format of the main character capturing his story in a journal can be disjointed and clumsy but here it works. And to be honest, this is not high-fiction but it sure is entertaining and fast-paced. Lines like this give you a taste for what is in store: \\"America, I'm sorry to report that despite our best efforts, this disease has broken the bonds of our containment measures. It is no longer safe to inhabit larger cities. Safe zones are being established on the outskirts of high population areas and will be open to those not infected.\\" If you are fan of zombie and/or post-apocalyptic fiction, you will enjoy this contribution. I also encourage you to visit the author's website, [...], for his list of other books in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great zombie fun!","review":"This book is a great read. It never slows down, and it delivers! I hope the author writes another one in the same vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"day by day armageddon by J.L. Bourne","review":"After the first few pages i realized the hardest part about reading this book was the fact that the more i read the sooner it would end. It ended in about 10 hours (give or take a bathroom break and some edibles) This has easily made it to my top 5 favorites in the genre.all i can do now is to wait patiently for the sequal."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written with inaccurate tech details","review":"Reads like a high schooler's zombie fan fiction. I get that it wasn't written by a \\"professional\\" but the journal format is just an excuse for the author to write badly and mix up homophones. \\"To\\" for \\"too\\", \\"lightening\\" for \\"lightning\\", \\"breaks\\" for \\"brakes\\", it goes on and on. Get an editor. What was the point of the girl rescued from the car? I think she disappeared at one point for like 50 pages.For a story so hung up on technical details it's surprising that there wasn't more accuracy in the aviation bits. As a flight instructor myself these are somewhat glaring errors. According to the author, the hydraulic brakes in a Cessna 172 don't work too well when the engine's off. Oh really. There are lots of little mistakes like this that show the author's lack of research and attention to details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanting more !!!","review":"A great book , it really is a good read that is well thought out. Written in a journal format makes the reader get into the character right off the bat. If you are into zombie books and movies it is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I just finished World War Z and wanted something as good so I signed up on Shelfari and asked around. Two people recommended this book so I read a free sample first and then I decided to buy it. I really, really liked the book. It drew you in and personally, I couldn't put it down. I know not everybody loved it the way I did but chances are that if you read it, you will like it. The writing style is different since its like a journal but it's exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I read a lot books, this one is one of the better Zombie books I have read in a while.

I read this book and the sequel and loved them both. I enjoy good zombie movies and stories and this is a great one. I love the mix of authentic action and military detail mixed in with the zombie apocalypse. There are good scares in the story. The books are well written as well. I for one can't wait for the third installment. Kudos to the author on a job well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant novel!!! So good it will ruin others for you..","review":"This is a brilliant account of one man's fight against the zombie apocalypse. The book is extremely well written, it flows beautifully and I really enjoyed the military aspect that J.L. Bourne brought to it. It is a gripping survivalist read. The only downside? Day by Day Armageddon was the first zombie book I ever read, World War Z was the second.. and few books in the zombie genre can compare to these two books. They are both absolutely brilliant. I only wish I could read them both for the first time again. I give this book my highest recommendation!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best Zombie Books","review":"I just finished finished reading this book. It is one of very few I could not put down. I'm kind of at a loss for words right now. There are plenty of unexpected plot twists, dark humor, and moments of suspense. I spent a solid 6-7 hours reading it (even while on the toilet). I highly recommend this book to anyone that loves a good a Zombie apocalypse book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I understand that is written as a journal but the writing is so incredibly bad that it's barely readable! Poor grammar, word usage, sentence formatting, syntax, and bad analogies combine to make this one of the worst books I have read in awhile. This book makes it seem as if the journals' author barely made it past 8th grade english, in my opinion. A bad buy for my $11; I'll be buying no more books in this series. I really don't understand how everyone can be giving this book such high ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased at t'all !!","review":"After reading the first two books in a matter of days i was so much looking forward to the third and (perhaps)final book to the story?The first problem being that I wasn't sure if I'd still be alive by the time it was released? I was beginning to wonder if Mr. Bourne and George Martin were playing golf together down in Santa Fe?After the release date was moved back, Shattered Hourglass was mine to buy, I did ... not Narrated like the first two and it seemed like someone else wrote this? It was so rushed at the end that I felt cheated out of a Great story?Of course it's only one mans opinion?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original","review":"Original is the best word for the book. Original and great. J.L. Bourne has a great future as a writer if this book is any indication. The idea of releasing a book in the form of a journal or diary was a stroke of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling","review":"Journal style books walk a fine line between boredom and over exaggerated action. DBDA does a great job keeping each entry interesting without resorting to every day another monumental event happening. The build up to the apocalypse is realistically covered, much like anyone (should) prepare for a natural disaster. Once the event hits, the author refrains from the typical \\"survivor in a homemade fortress\\" and portrays how limited resources will determine where and how you find refuge. There is excellent portrayal of how careful planning, a little ingenuity, and some luck is needed to survive.A note on the zombies: I loved their portrayal. They are not some super race or have some sixth sense ability to find living people. They can be outsmarted but not controlled in any reasonable sense. It adds to the believability that there can be a total zombie takeover but there will also be some survivors with a fighting chance.Can't wait for the sequel!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear diary..today I wasn't killed by a zombie!","review":"I can't stress how great this book is. It is written in a very realistic way and you can truly get a sense of how a soldier would think during such an outbreak. The writing is vivid and sends chills as you can actually picture yourself in this situation because the author does such a good job. I hope the next book is as entertaining as this one...I finished it in two days because it was hard to put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull + Flat + Boring = This Book","review":"Don't understand why so many people rated this 5 stars on Amazon!!

What's the most wanted elements in Zombies novel?? Excitement, Tension, Suspense, Dramatic!! Where is it?? Summed up there may be only 5 to 10 pages are worth reading!!The main character seems a very lucky man, when he's around the \\"supposedly zombies infested streets\\" there's only handful of zombies wandering. And he doesn't have to fire many shots but just out run them and always found a secure places to stay!! I don't see any point of reading this novel. Totally waste of time and money.

What a rip off"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea that suffers from terrible execution","review":"The journalistic approach this book takes to the end-of-the-world-by-zombies is a great idea, but unfortunately it reads like a high school book report, complete with the awful character development, grammatical errors, and terrible wordcraft. The main characters are completely generic without any of the emotional content that would naturally go along in a story like this. The descriptive language is repetitive, awkward and cheesy during the fight scenes. The book ends way too abruptly without any sort of closure. I don't care who the author is in real life, he can't write fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad !","review":"A red neck novel written by a red neck for red necks. I wish i'd known this before i started.And please authors, don't you know that the myth of the lone rogue good officer gone rogue to serve and protect and survive is pathetic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad story poorly written","review":"The first rule of writing in a journal style is that you have to make your writing sound like a person would actually write it in a journal. While a first-person narrative is often a great way to build tension and help the reader identify with the main character, the way this one is done is so un-natural it distracts from the story.The story itself is inconsistant and often consists of long, boring descriptions of unimportant details.As far as post-apocalyptic stories go, this one is not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne Sucks","review":"This...book...sucks.

Apparently synonyms (like \\"steel\\" and \\"steal\\") are a concept Mr. Bourne never mastered - that and the compound sentence. The text is stilting, truncated and abrupt - absolutely no \\"flow\\" in the writing style. I feel like grading this book like my high school english teacher used to do and sending it back to him; maybe he could learn something. Do me a favor, Mr. Bourne, and use a spell checker.Lastly, this reads more like an outline for a book than a book itself. It doesn't even read like a journal or diary. There is no character development, no dramatic tension, no identification with the characters. It's more like reading a police blotter or a duty officer's log.This book is horrendous.

(And I finished Clown Girl which I didn't think was possible). I love zombies but this time I want to hit Bourne with my copy until I get my money back and he becomes one. Unless you are illiterate, mentally handicapped, or seven don't read this book because it will be a waste of your cognitive capacities. Hands down the #1 worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Five Star Zombie Read","review":"This book was great. Not only did it keep me on the edge of my seat, but it was the first zombie book i've seen that lacks a level of cheese most zombie tales can't seem to escape. Don't get me wrong, I love most of the romero stuff and can enjoy a little cheese here and there, but I am excited to see that someone has finally taken this genre to serious level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Holy crud this was a great book!! I'm VERY picky on my non-fiction and even fiction reading, I like authors that draw you into the story, that make chapters that end with a comma so that you cant wait to jump into the next. Details of event but not overly to the fact that they bore you out, Having said this I have to say this was an awesome read. I'm all over the board in types of books I read, don't stick to just one genre, and this is one book & author that I'm now hooked on! Sure I loved it because it was focused here in Texas (mainly southern Texas) but they way this was done has me rank Mr Bourne among the GREAT sci-fi (if your will) authors such as Christine Golden and Eric Nylund! He his EVERY detail on how survival would be in this type of situation. WARNING though, after reading this, you will be more critical on movies of this genre like Zombieland for not coving all the bases and making it more realistic!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best zombie book out there!","review":"Simply the best Zombie story I've read so far and that goes for the second book as well. From the start you are hooked and cannot put this book down. The writing is top notch for the genre which has many wonna-be's. If you have to read any Zombie story right now, this is the one to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cause for Thought","review":"With so many reviews it's hard to say anything novel. I wanted to add my 2 cents' worth though. The negative reviews talk about style, character development, etc. I'm sure they are right from that analytic point of view. However, the real test comes when you read it. I found I couldn't put the book down, nor its sequel. I'm not sure how to describe it stylistically, but he writes a story that kept me quite interested. The whole time I found myself wondering what I would do and how I'd handle circumstances described. I think the Zombie scenario is a metaphor for something else that may already be going on. We'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"Fantastic. Hope there are many more to come in the series. Gotta see where the story is heading. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal author-events-characters","review":"Enough said. The most detailed story line with believable characters. Absolutely the best set of books I've read. Can't seem to find another zombie genre book/author that could hold a candle up to J.L.Bourne. Hoping for another one from him soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Mr. Bourne!!!","review":"Lotsa reviews for this one already...I'll make this quick. Literally read this book in one sitting. Could not put it down. This book told a great story about that guy who's prepared for when the SHTF. (Of course, a story about a guy who isn't prepared would be short and boring.) I really enjoy post-apocalyptic fiction in all formats. This one did not disappoint. True, it did contain some grammatical errors, but this is supposed to be a jounal written by a guy on the run, not a journal kept by an English scholar. Give the guy a break, he's living in world completely overrun by zombies!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's....ok","review":"Basically everyone in my family had this finished in a matter of hours. It's a good book, I enjoyed it. It's just not super special."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Zombie Journey","review":"I love the journal type zombie novels, and this one definitly stands out. I read this about a year ago when I picked up 6 other zombie novels, and this is still the one that stands out the most. While the Hero is a little unbelievable (military man with solar power and lots of weapons), he makes you feel safe for the journey. I prefer the average man/woman survival story, but this was still a great read. This book truly shines hope into a time when hope is dead, and I loved that about this. It also shows human nature, in its best and worst forms. A must read for any zombie lover! I will be picking the sequel up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and informed. Story keeps you gripped.","review":"Told mostly from the first person narrative, the story takes you from the beginning of the changes to the earth and turns the protagonist into a survivalist almost immediately. Well written and thought out, the journal style of writing creates a fast pace to the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly perfect","review":"Just the thing to get me over World War Z. Reading this was exactly what I needed after my last disappointment. Day by Day is a great series and I'm looking forward to Mr Bournes' future releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great zombie book!","review":"I greatly enjoyed Day By Day Armageddon. A fun, quick read that leaves you wanting more (which, BTW, I've heard is coming or maybe already out).

I was hooked from the beginning and could not put it down. I swear to you all that there was not a single boring page in the entire book. It flowed excellently. You get to experience the horror first hand through the main characters perspective in this first person diary thriller. Violence, horror, fear, and a bit of comic relief at some points. Definitely a must read. This book definitely has my standards high for future zombie books that I read.Right now I'm reading World War Z and sadly I'm not enjoying it nearly as much as I did this one. I will definitely be buying the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$","review":"I can't believe what I paid for this on Kindle, when it contains errors like \\"wearing a pear of jeans\\" and \\"applied the breaks\\". C'mon, is there an editor in the house? The author does not know how to use a comma. Totally flat characters with practically no physical description, let alone personality. The pictures were nice, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very juvenile read.","review":"Ack. Where to start? Small vocabulary hinders this short story. Page after page is predictably chunked out in the same fashion. To further degrade this zombie novel author seems to be living out a personal fantasy rather than hooking the reader with a plot. All this would not be bad if his main character wasn't a wimpy nerd geek that feels uncomfortable when he hasn't shaved for a few days. The main character as well as the minuscule development just does not fit with a person that survives the zombie hordes. Day by Day Armageddon is a less than average try at a novel and should have been a free read on the internet bulletin boards. There are far better zombie novels to spend money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I read this cover to cover without taking a break. I was expecting more encounters with hostiles but, book seemed more character driven. I am waiting for the next book since this one is part of a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"my give (and take)","review":"I know what work it is to finish a novel. I'm a writer so I'll give the guy one star for getting it done. He gets another star for making it interesting enough for me to finish. But I'm taking two stars back because he didn't have the sense to get a better copy editor.Spelling mistakes and some bad writing can be corrected with a good copy editor, but c'mon... getting your setting right in a novel this simple should be easy. Instead, we have an author who hasn't done the proper research. Hurricanes do not come in the spring and underground bunkers can't be built on the coast.That said, I think this author has real potential which is more than I can say for a lot of authors on the NY Times list so I'm giving him back his two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumping on the Zombie Bandwagon (and falling off badly)","review":"The premise was very good, but the military hero's daily diary was not dynamic enough to hold my attention. I also have serious problems with absolutely wretched editing. The author promises a sequel. Please, NO!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"over priced for a simple story","review":"Well, what does a fan of zombies not a fanatic say about a book with so many good reviews, even the preface got me going. I won't say this is the best book ever so pick it up but damn the ebook version not worth the price. yeah, yeah, ex millitary but some time I just began to get a little confused with the times because it seemed some times was it day or night dusk or dawn. I still use the 24 hour clock in my day to day life. Also seemed to do some filling in with the same stuff a few times. his detail of the area of texas was nice because its in my back yard. I'll give it a few weeks before i read the second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!!!!","review":"Outstanding read. I couldn't put it down and I'm waiting for the next book by J.L. Bourne. Very engaging and well written, a must for any zombie book fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start for the new author","review":"I ordered this book not knowing what to expect but I got a pleasant surprise. It is well-written and the author keeps the story flowing. It pays homage to classic Romero - the zombies do what the zombies do best lol and humans do their best to survive. Although the hero is a bit \\"heroic\\", the other characters are more realistic which is nice to see in genre full of supermen. The book definitely leaves rooms for sequels and I'm looking forward to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This is by far one of the best zombie stories I ever read. It's pretty realistic and it doesn't lose it's edge or get boring on you. I wish it were longer and I hope the author writes more like it. If you're into zombie books then you must read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"shood bee free","review":"this is something a buddy writes and says read this! you read it then say \\"that was really good\\". to say it is great? yuck. world war z is a zombie classic- this one is an enthusiasts solid effort...not worth 10 bucks! please get an editor....the spelling errors are so easy to fix...another set of eyes is all it takes."},{"rating":"1","title":"day by day armageddeon","review":"the book shoulda stated that it was part 1......it left me hanging for an ending, and the rest of the middle. its like leaving the theatre right when the movie starts getting good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Daddy's Zombie Story","review":"I first read Bourne's story as an excert on a zombie fan website late at night, and it was truly gripping. I kept reading and reading instead of going to bed like I should have, and when I got to the end of the piece, which was something of a cliffhanger, I screamed, \\"I want more!\\" So, I had to get the book. It's a page-turning, attention-grabbing, nail-biting, seat-of-your-pants, crackin' good adventure! And I still want more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"If you're Conan the Grammarian and have the urge to impale yourself on your own sword every time you see a spelling or grammatical error in a book, you might want to pass on this. If, on the other hand, you want to read an awesome book about the zombapocalypse, then get this book now... and while you're at it get DBDA2: Beyond Exile. Its in stock now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Hard to put down!","review":"I read this when the author first wrote this on his website and it was just complete. I have to admit, it was very hard to stop reading and I completed it in a couple of days. It flows very well and never gets dull. I've had the book on my wish list since it came out as I do plan to add this to my collection at some point. I tend to grab paperbacks used at greatly reduced prices and I've looked for this one to come down. It appears I may have to grab it soon! I'm glad to hear the author has a second zombie book coming out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this was a great book!!","review":"Okay I have seen on the reviews for this book that some here on Amazon have not cared for this particular title. I actually got lucky and found it on the shelf of my local Borders. While we are all welcome to have our own opinions, I must say that I actually really enjoyed this book. It seems that these days there are a lot of zombie books out there some of which are good and some which are not as good. In my opinion this is definately one of the good ones. At first I wasn't sure about how good it would be because of choices the author made in the execution of his artistic vision. I believe however that it is those choices and the risks that the author takes that make this book so strong. If you appreciate good zombie fiction that is done well, I think that you will enjoy this book a great deal. I for one am counting down until the sequel is published."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch out for this seller","review":"seller \\"Get My Mailbox and MORE!\\" waited 3 weeks, and until the order was cancelled, to email us with the news that it was out of stock for another 2 months- do not order from this seller"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Stain Remover!","review":"This stain remover is great! Gets out wine almost instantly. Removes ink from washed and dried clothing (need to wash in machine again). When ever I see this product in a store I stock up and give to family members.

The bag in which the citric acid is shipped is clearly not for storage after opening the bag once - just use three zip-lock gallon bags to divide the contents into portions.

No more musty smell","review":"After years of having a smelly front loading washing machine and trying so called cleaners from Tide and others, this actually worked. A few detergent scoops of citric acid, boiling water poured into the drum and the machine set on wash. After the wash cycle was completed, I stopped the machine, let it sit with the water still in the drum. Finished the wash cycle in the morning and drained the clean out hose and lint trap.

I completely understand the argument about the cheap bag--it is flimsy and of poor quality. However, they apparently learned their lesson.

I tried everything, vinegar, baking soda, bleach, clr, lime away, etc. etc. etc. you name it, I tried it. Citric acid is they way to go! Just add it to the bowl or whatever you're cleaning let it soak awhile and then scrub and you'll be amazed!I also used it to make my own dishwashing detergent!

Then I dispensed all of it so that it went thru the tubing. The leftover smell after it was empty wasn't appealing so I refilled it with plain water, boiled it and dispensed it all again. No more smell or buildup. I also used it on my son's sink which had lots of buildup and soaked it for an hour. Buildup all gone. Worked also on all the toliets in the house.

I love that it has a lid that fits snugly, and I use this to store things like soup in the refrigerator, so it's not totally useless (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), but in terms of what I bought it for it is a huge fail. The spout does not narrow the flow of the liquid at all. In fact, it's messy and spills everywhere. It caused me great frustration until I just decided to stop trying. It is easier to pour neatly out of my 8 quart stock pot, off the straight sides, to be honest! I am very disappointed with this product and I'm sorry I tried to save money by getting an inferior product. I'm going with the 2 quart Pyrex instead.

However, I don't believe this item to be easy to use at all. My music is imported on itunes and I could not convert the files to MP3 format. We also had a hard time trying to figure out how to use the buttons and features. The item has many features, but it takes some time to figure out. If you don't have MP3 or WAV files of music, I suggest sticking with the ipod. A shuffle costs about 79 bucks, but so much easier to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, inexpensive, kid-friendly","review":"I bought this for my 7 year old nephew and he loved it.

I'm a big fan of World Jazz (or Jazz Beat), a true coming together of the jazz tradition and some authentic world/folk music, such as Afro-Cuban jazz, or Celtic jazz. Leon Parker has proved in the past that he can make effective records in this musical mode.The problem with this outing is that there just isn't enough of musical substance here. While the formula is similar to his previous records, the results are inferior. Things are so stripped down that on some of the cuts virtually nothing happens. Personally, I think he's milked the minimalist formula as far as it can go, to the point of diminishing returns. For a much more successful disk using a similar approach, check out either one of bandmate Sam Newsome's CD's with his his group Global Unity (one or both of which I'll be reviewing soon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kentucky Bluegrass Basketball (DVD) GREAT","review":"I bought this for my father, who is a UofK fan and was born and raised in eastern Kentucky.

When her mom is set to go on a tour of Europe, Colie goes to her Aunt Mira's for the summer. When getting there, after one day she dosen't think she will be able to survive the summer ahead of her. However, a run-in with the 2 girls working at the Last Chance Bar & Grill changes her whole summer. Suddenly, Colie finds herself with two great friends and a whole new outlook on life. Not being the most popular person in the world, Colie discovers, with the help of Isabel and Morgan, that she really has the confidence to be who she wants to be, and that she's had it all along.Go pick up this book and all of Sarah Dessen's other books.

A guy picking up a pink book just ain't right. But it WAS an assignment. So here we go:Girls: Lonely? Depressed? Just want to read a book out of total randomness? Then this is the book for you! This first-person novel is sure to enhance your knowledge and confidence in the world and life.Boys: Have some weird secret life you don't want your friends to know about? Then grab this book and get to the nearest bathroom stall...or closet. You might learn a thing or two about life.Personally, I enjoyed reading it (as long as nobody saw the pinkness).

It wasn't really a book made for a guy. It is the typical teen book with someone trying to fit in. I would recommend reading this book to females of the teen age.

I think that a teenage girl would really enjoy this book because it is about something that most girls can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping The Moon","review":"This is a really great book for many reasons. the first reason is that everyone can relate to the main character because everyone goes through the same things that she does. The second reason is that you start to root for the character to do the right thing.the main character is Colie, a girl who is sent to to live with her unique aunt in Colby while her mom, a fitness guru, is on a european tour. while in colby she gets a job as a watress and makes friends with two other waitresses and the fry cook. each of these people and her aunt help her realize things about herself that she never took the tiem to notice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Julia: one great summer","review":"When Colie comes to North Carolina to live with her Aunt Mira for the summer, because her mother, Kiki Sparks, exercise finatic, goes to Europe to tour, Colie thinks it is going to be the same in North Carolina as in her home town, but she has no clue.

Colie thinks her past will haunt her forever but she is simply surprised. Morgan and Isabl, Colie's first true friends, help her to see who she really is. Sure they have rough spots but they \\"survive.\\" I have to say this book is supurb.

Those memories haunt her day after day, even while she is fifty pounds lighter and spending a summer at her Aunt Mira's house. She meets unforgettable friends, Isabelle, Morgan, and Norman. They, even without knowing it themselves, touch her heart more than she could ever imagine.This novel was deep and really casued me to think.

There is a unique feeling to sitting down in a reading chair with a Dessen book you haven't read, knowing that at the end you will feel satisfied and happy that you were able to read such a great book.Keeping the Moon deals with body image, which is a good staple plot to have to recommend to younger girls going through their teenage years. Colie may be harder to connect with than some of Dessen's other protagonists, but this didn't affect my opinion of the book at all - just something worth mentioning.Not my favorite of the Dessen books, but still a very solid contemporary that I would have no hesitation in recommending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Keeping the Moon, by Sarah Dessen, is one of the best books I have ever read. It tells the story of Colie Sparks, a fifteen year old \\"former fat girl\\" who is the daughter of world-famous Kiki Sparks, a fitness trainer and weight-loss inspirationist. Keeping the Moon chronicles a summer in Colie's life- the summer that Colie spends in Colby, North Carolina with her eccentric Aunt Mira. Along the way, Colie meets characters like Morgan and Isabel, two twenty-something waitresses who befriend her and help her through the summer, and Norman, the cook and art student who lives downstairs.But Keeping the Moon is more than just the ordinary chronicle of a teenage summer. It's not all fluffy and romantic. It's inspirational. During the summer, the character of Colie completely changes and matures. It tells of her becoming beautiful, of her understanding Mira, Norman, Isabel, Morgan, and herself.

That level of terrible performance is simply unacceptable.Then, about 4 months after I bought it, it up and broke.Don't waste your money on this terrible, terrible piece of equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved my posture, not too uncomfortable","review":"This posture garment helped my back, but can sometimes be a little uncomfortable -- it tugs on my shoulders at times.

I know this might sound very cliche but I had a head knowledge of this and no heart revelation so, I only heard noise and not what the Spirit was saying. It has stirred me to wanting the anointing of the Holy Spirit even more because without it we will be defeated. It has also given me understanding of what being persecuted really means and a greater appreciation for the Bible because I now know what it really cost the disciplies for us to have it - THEIR LIVES - I will never take the Bible for granted again.

Its nothing like the Hawk's Way series and, to my mind, I read for enjoyment and stress reduction. Reading about dead children, brain damaged children, a cold blooded murderer without a conscious, a drowning and comatose child, and alcoholism is just not my idea of a relaxing read. And what happened to the breathtaking romance Joan Johnston created in prior novels? You will not find it here. I say skip this one in favor of the Hawk's Way novels if you are seeking a romance read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"HMB is my new stand-by. it seems to prevent the body from breaking down muscle for energy, and encourages the use of body fat for energy. it also apparently leads to improved cardiovascular health. take 3 g per day for optimal results."},{"rating":"2","title":"HMB works for me","review":"Works well if you are not a regular weight lifter or out of shape it will help you retain muscle.

I developed a persistent allergic reaction with swollen skin and itchy rash on my thighs, waist and shoulders. Contrary to another reviewer's coment, there is plenty of information about HMB side effects: Breathing problems; or tightness in your throat or chest; Chest pain; Skin hives, rash, or itchy or swollen skin.

Beyond its many virtues -well-researched, well-written, well-presented, relevant - is a simple principle: present the best technical knowledge currently around, but know that technical knowledge is not enough. It challenges us all to think critically about what we want and how to get it. This book says that digitisation is all about decisions. By laying before us a wealth of approaches, insight, and wisdom, it stimulates us to recognise the decisions we have to make, while helping us to think them through. -Colin Webb, Director, Preservation Services Branch, National Library of Australia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good - so long as you don't think about it","review":"Less of an academic work than an ideological manifesto for adolescent and angry 'feminists'.

He's already got some ideas about what makes a place livable, and doesn't set out to challenge them in the least. He visits a handful of cities and towns, talks to some people he meets in bars, and moves on. He doesn't consider any large cities.

In fact, I was living there at the time the author made his visit(s), and I can honestly say that his research was sloppy at best.

I was also particularly impressed with the primary source material used and referenced, so that the interested reader can dig more deeply into those particular lives of interest (and perhaps come to conclusions different from those of the author!)

This does make me sad but i got the album anyway. It has some really really awesome stuff on it. Stand out track I would say is Good Morning Anya. It's definitely worth getting because Jaco's writing is amazing on it. Think of it like seeing the Mingus Big Band after Mingus died. Sure, Mingus isn't playing bass but it's the composition that you are listening to. The genius in the writing not just bass playing. It would've been better if Jaco were the one playing bass but get this cd because you love jaco's compositional work and not just his bass playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars If I Could.","review":"This album was never intended to have any bass playing on it. It was really a showcase for Jaco's skills as an arranger (his bass chops were long gone by this time), and a showcase for Jaco's long-time jam partner and friend Othello Molineaux, a stellar drummer. After Jaco's death, the idiot who possessed these tapes got some flake to play bass tracks over Othello and put it out. Jaco's family has gotten legal proceedings worked out to block this album from ever being heard (and rightly so). This guy doesn't have a blessed thing on Jaco, and even if he did, he isn't.

The text itself, though short, is remarkably balanced and sober, and the battle comes to life in an almost day-by-day account once it is kicked off. Meanwhile, we get short looks at the opposing armies, strategies, leaders, and weaponry, as well as the general grand strategic situation during the summer of 1943.For a short treatment, this volume does an excellent job of getting the reader to understand generally what went on, and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiller does it again!","review":"I wish I knew more about this group!

I picked up this book but soon found the \\"traditional\\" in the title to be a little misleading.The information on Reiki's origins is very much the standard myth that was first spread by Hawayo Takata when Reiki was first taught in the United States. It has since been debunked by modern Reiki practitioners who traveled to Japan to get the real story.Overall, I found Amy Rowland's book to contain not much more information than you'd get from your average Reiki I class. This may not mean anything regarding Ms. Rowland as a Reiki teacher, but if you're looking for a more in-depth overview of Reiki's history, practice and spirit, I would recommend \\"The Spirit of Reiki,\\" by three of the foremost Western Reiki teachers.

The first time I washed this it turned my hair downright moldy-looking. Although, this could probably be the fact that it is turquoise.

And then you wash it and boom, it's faint to the point of being invisible. I re-dyed it the day after but it didn't hold any better...Recommended only if you're interested incredibley temporary dye. Also, I was only doing 2 - 3 chunks of hair, so get multiples. You have to really slop it on so if you're doing your whole head, you'll definietly need more than 1.

Ultraviolet (also left in overnight) turned out a lovely dark blue-purple, but unfortunately it is fading much faster than the pink did, and it fades to a greyish blue instead of orangey brown.

So then I bleached the hair again, had it VERY light, and tried again with the other half of the jar. Left it in for over 40 minutes again, and even applied heat, but got the same exact results.

I have never had a problem with any color until recently, when I purchased Rockabilly Blue. It was the worst! It doesn't come off of the skin easily, it turned EVERYTHING blue, and it comes off on your hands when you run it through your hair! It stained all kinds of things- my pillowcases, my couch, my clothes... The worst part is that it didn't come out after two bleachings... Also you cannot cover it with other colors. For whatever reason, this color sticks very well to bleached hair and doesn't allow other colors to absorb, either. So, when I bleached all of that hair again, including the roots, and put purple in, the roots were the only thing that turned purple- even the bleached blue didn't allow purple to stay! :( I am very, very upset with this product. It was very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing products!!!!!! but....","review":"I could go on for days about how much I loved this product.

However, Rockabilly Blue (Another Favourite) and Raven Black weren't so great.. the blue got EVERYWHERE. My towels, face, neck, hands, everything was stained for days. It was unreal. Most likely wont be buying blue from them until they fix this problem. Raven Black wasn't at all black... it was GREEN. On Halloween I used Purple Haze and then Raven Black for my perimeter. I looked like a witch! My hair is STILL stained green after three bleach baths. Oh well.

She has had many shades of blue and this one looked like it would be the brightest yet. The color is stunningly blue. HOWEVER, the bleeding is horrendous. Her face, neck, ears, hands, and shoulders are BLUE!! Even after several shampoos, the color continues to bleed out everywhere. We have to spend 30 minutes in the bathroom every morning just cleaning up her face. Then it just returns in an hour, anywhere her hair has touched. I have never experienced anything like this. This product needs to be pulled from the shelves and reformulated to reduce the bleeding. I regret ever using this on my poor daughter.

The top of her head came out close to right, but the length didn't take the color hardly at all, and actually came out looking greyish purple. From a distance it actually looked grey.

I did as I usually do with hair dye and applied it generously, using about 75% of the bottle. It got everywhere, I turn blue every time I step in the shower and I even turn blue when I try to do my hair. I CANNOT TOUCH MY HEAD WITHOUT STAINING MY HANDS. I dyed my hair on Tuesday. It's still like this after several showers. I honestly don't know what to do anymore and when I found out I wasn't the only one who was having this problem, I was relieved. I have to sleep with an old t-shirt over my pillow so it won't stain. Next time when I use Manic Panic I will stick to using Atomic Turquoise because I've never had any problems with that on.

I spent more than half an hour scrubbing and my hands and feet are still VERY blue.My hair, by the way is also very blue. Not green. It's navy blue. My hair was bleached to a light blonde when I applied the dye, so I honestly don't know why the color is so off.

I get a ton of compliments when it's freshly dyed, but otherwise it gets called a green color. It's an ugly green color too. I can't wait until I can dye over this with some Special Effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Litterally the worst hair dye I've ever used, ever, and I dye my hair A LOT.","review":"I put this in, expecting it to work since it cost so much. Alas, not only did it hardly dye any of my hair, the portion that it did dye came out a hideous color nothing like it was supposed to. I even took the extra measure of leaving it in twice as long as I needed too, just to make sure the color soaked in, since i always do that when I dye my hair and it works incredibly well. I have dyed my hair various colors at least 10 times, and it has never turned out so badly. Even the time I had to mix 6 different hair dyes and some water together to get enough to cover my whole head turned out better than this. I will never be buying anything from manic panic ever again. They have ruined my Halloween costume with their horrible product. I just hope I can find a way to cover this up before school tomorrow so I don't have to break my arm to get out of going to school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Manic Panic","review":"Ive been using Manic Panic dyes for a couple years now and I have to say the blue is a little harder to work with only because it fades so quickly.

I've seen other reviewers say it has a greenish tint, I wouldn't go that far, but with a fresh application when you're outdoors (UV reactive can mean sunlight too) it glows highlighter yellow. It does fade a lot with the first wash to just a regular yellow, but the first day people were literally stopping me on the street to ask about my hair.I applied it on top of varying highlights and got a great effect on my auburn hair, I get a ton of compliments.

If you would like to find recipes that support this lifestyle, Italian Cooking For Dummies has detailed explanation of ingredients as well as recipes and Lidia's Family Table has some wonderful recipes in it. Most ethnic cookbooks of the region will work, keeping in mind that portion control and quality ingredients are the cornerstone of this diet as well as the ratio of Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids.

Total waste of money and of an hour assembling this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and switch.","review":"These are not the same stairs they sell in stores such as Petsmart and such. I have one of the petsmart ones and I needed another due to a little weiner dog with a bad back. Amazon shows the box, and the lambswool cover with the little purple tag on the top. The petsmart one is made well and has rubber stoppers to prevent slippage on the bottom, and elastic bands on the bottom to attatch to each of the lower corners. This is a cheap knock off. No rubber stoppers, elastic doesn't hold tight to the bottom, and what supposed to be lambswool, is a crappy piece of a look alike cloth in white and is a little small. I can't wait to see what happens when I wash it. I could not return it because my little dog needs it now. She cannot jump on and off anything, so I had to put it in place right away. Besides that, I probably would get the same one just thrown in pieces in an amazon box. Go to the store if you want this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful doggy steps","review":"The doggy steps arrived very quickly. I recommend these to every pet owner, especially those with older pets.

He is now working on getting down on his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"I bought this before all the negative reviews were posted below. I have to agree with them. This is a piece of garbage and a rip off. You have to pay another 14.98 (if you include shipping) to get the fourth step. It looks like it will fall apart any minute. And even worse, it comes with a large bright purple slogan across the top step (not depicted in the picture) that you can't remove and that is hideous so it doesn't even blend in with your furniture.

I bought two of these steps for my Mini Schnauzer who has Arthritis in her rear leg. Thinking this was going to be a plush, solid cushion design that would be comfortable for my dog to walk up was my first mistake. This item has a nine piece, hard-plastic, internal skeleton that snaps together and then you drape the cover over it. But the pieces kept coming apart as I tried to put on the cover, so I ended up having to tape all the joints with heavy-duty strapping tape. And it's a very rigid frame, with no give to it.

They use the other three without a problem and have learned to love them no matter where we place them, but these steps may be difficult for them to use. Please be sure you want short steps and be aware the steps themselves are narrow!Edited to add: Well, thus far they won't use them, will report back later.

I put it on a piece of carpet (we have tile in the house) ... I placed ruber under the four pieces of rubber that are already attached while it was on the tile and on the carpet ...

We're buying more for grandma's house, etc. Our dogs use these steps many, many times a day and we're pleased how well the product holds up to what has to be called 'excessive' use by our two one-year-olds playing tag hours on end, using these steps.

Well, unfortunately, the people who usually try to put these things together know nothing about how techno music is really done, and, I know this sounds weird because I am american myself, but it's usually americans who are doing these projects and failing. In America, there are very few people who do techno and do it right, but those few people happen to be very unknown. Techno was born in Europe/the UK, and all the best stuff comes from there.

It isn't flashy, its very comfortable and it tells great time. I wear it to work it goes with almost anything because it is black and white, it looks elegant if you want it to, and also sporty as well with the band. You can wear this watch with any type of clothes and it fits all occasions. The face isn't huge so if you have a big wrist it will look small and might not want it. Its a great watch and it works perfectly, really satisfied with it and I am thinking about getting a different model.

I recommend this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"For under $10 it seems great.","review":"Comparing this to most of the stuff I see at Wal Mart for under $10 its much better. It is easy to read. However, I made a mistake and didn't measure out the bezel size in the description. I find it to be small on my wrist, and I have very small wrists. I would recommend measuring out the size in the description first.I actually bought this watch to use on a timed exam where I have to re-adjust the watch every 35 mins when taking the exam. During practice I found it a bit tough to pull out the crown, and for that only I give it 4 stars. However, most people will probably not have to regularly adjust the time so they probably will not find this as much of an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light-weight, water proof, and very cheap!","review":"This watch is worth more than its price. First, it is very light, not heavy at all, doesn't put pressure on your wrist. Also it is quiet. There is no ticking sounds or anything. Also it is water proof, and the design is simple and clean. It's the best watch you can get with a price so cheap! Only problem for me was the wrist strap. Wrist strap was in plastic-kind of material, and it's smooth but it doesn't feel good on the wrist"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Buy","review":"I've bought two of these watches over the past three years and I have been really happy with them. The plastic cover does get scratched up after a while, but both watches still work perfectly. The design is minimal, so I can wear it anywhere without feeling under- or over-dressed. I like how the face of the watch is white too, as it is easy to see in low-light situations. Buy this watch! For the price, it can't be beat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive, Simple, Classic Watch","review":"For $10 bucks you really can't beat this. It's simple, functional, looks nice and works well with my personal style. If you need a watch with a light to be able to see it at night, don't buy this one.

Others were less obvious until I read other sources that contradicted this book. In other words, I thought I knew the topic until someone else corrected me.

While this book is fairly comprehensive in its coverage of developing J2EE applications on WebLogic Server, it appears to be thrown together. It looks like no one proof read the book.

Today the website appears to be gone.You will be much better off buying Monson-Haefel's Enterprise Javabeans 3rd edition and downloading the Weblogic 6.1 workbook from his website than buying this book now.

This book covers all areas of fear and anxiety, including Fear of Death, Fear of Failure, Fear of Man, Panic Disorder, Anxious Thinking and worrying among others. This book points the believer toward Christ through prayer, building up of ones faith, and biblical scripture in an effort to break the stongholds of fear and/or anxiety over his/her life by building a stronghold of faith in Christ.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is dealing with strongholds of anxiety and/or fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book disappointed me","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Bondage Breaker, is a book chock full of godly and spiritual. I would recommend that book for panic attacks and anxiety moreso than Freedom From Fear. This book totally misses the mark. Neil and the other guy's attitude towards people with panic disorder is condescending and dismissive, to say the least. He even seems like he's blaming people with this disorder for bringing it on themselves with sin. That's so far off the mark I couldn't believe he would say something like that. I was very dissapointed, especially after reading The Bondage Breaker, which was wonderful. And in case you're wondering, I'm a born again Christian. I have panic disorder and I want to get out of this God's way, not the world's way, which is why I was so disappointed when I read this.

In acts we start with 11 scared men who only 43 days earlier watched Christ killed. They hid in FEAR of losing their own lives. But once they were blessed with the Holy Spirit, they were transformed into bold, fearless men who carried the message of the gospel until their deaths.

So, the references to Catalans probably must be changed for example to Californians (very rich and self-sufficient), and to Basque people to any other State of the United States. In other words, Mr. Clancy ignores the reality concerning cultures in Spain, and only could be excused so that he introduces this book as a good exercise of fiction and negative sense to the real panorama in the world.Notwithstanding, I am a full supporter of this author, and it means that I estimate no fault in his work so the controversy between Catalans and the rest of Spain is in force now promoted by some politicians in our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure it is fiction... and only fiction :-(","review":"T.C. usually means accurate information and a lot of research work.

This is for the political trends presented in this book.Then, there's at least 100 innacurate facts and descriptions provided in the book that are, at least, wrong. Either spelling of spanish words, behaviours, etc.The biggest fumble is identifying mexican life-style (from food habits to words) with spanish life-style.

His lack of understanding (& ignorance) of the present political/social situation in Spain is incredible, to say nothing about the totally unrealistic plot of the book - laughable. It is obvious to this reader that the author has never spent any time in Spain. As a Spanish reader, I found his characterization of Spaniards one dimensional & totally demeaning. As for his use of the Spanish language, I suggest he use a proper Spanish dictionary. Personally, I think Tom Clancy has confused the situation in Yugoslavia or maybe Russia & tried to apply it to modern day Spain.In conclusion, Balance of Power is a badly written book (where was the editor? ), with an unrealistic plot.

In Europe, people usually have the feeling that Americans are ignorants in many matters as long as these don't relate to the US.

Yes it happened in the 1930's but many things happened in the 1930's a time of insanity and hate.Also the pyschobabble was just plain annoying to me. \\"She was there when Martha was killed, the guilt is going to put her into shock and paralize her!\\" Right and that is why whole armies stop fighting when they lose comrades. Stupid and not even close to human reality and just plain annoying to read.I will stay away from Clancy and the techno-thriller crap. Bring back some good old cold war novels those were his master pieces. This sucks will not bother picking anymore up when I see them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"Is one of the most riduculous books I have ever read. I used to enjoy Clancy books and Red Storm Rising and The Hunt for the Red October are still between my favorites. But in this case I can\`t stop myself from writing this. I hope Mr. Clancy will ever come to Spain to meet the people and the society of this country. Or at least next time he will read something about modern Spain. Maybe he thinks we are a poor South American country!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointing.","review":"An Op-Centre attempt to stop a new Spanish civil war from occurring, with its attendant bloodshed, betrayal, and other problems' seems to be an ideal setting for a tense action-packed read. However, this novel doesn't live up to it's cover blurb. The action sequences (for want of a better term) are a little disjointed and frankly unbelievable. The other scenes are lacklustre and boring. Balance of Power seems to be written to a standard formula which requires little imagination for the reader to absorb. The Op-Centre series, and this novel in particular, does not meet the expectations of Tom Clancy's fans. I suspect that Mr. Clancy regrets lending his name to this embarrassing series, which he probably no longer has creative control over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distorted Reality","review":"For those people who enjoy reading this kind of literature, this may be a gripping, can't-put-it-down kind of book. But for anybody who has any idea about Spain and its people, it is a complete joke...I know it is fiction, but the author didn't bother to write a note explaining that, like serious authors do. And I'm afraid that many readers are going to believe all the absurdities that are said about Spain in this book. True facts and names are mixed with fiction in a dangerous way. The American president's name is Lawrence, but the Spanish prime minister and king keep their real names, why?..I have to admit though, that I had some good laughs with this book. It is evident that a computer translation program was used to make the characters speak Spanish. The result is hilarious: not even the Spanish characters can speak Spanish! And no wonder the Op-Center diplomat is shot to death at the beginning of the novel: \\"Fusilar!\\" doesn't mean \\"gunman!\\"; it means \\"shoot!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Read between the lines","review":"Did any one of the people bashing the book, note the bottom of the cover, where it ISN'T WRITTEN BY TOM CLANCY. Tom Clancy's Op Center is the name of the series, originally by Tom Clancy. This literary abortion was not written by him, but by another no name contracted. Learn to recognize who wrote a book before you write off an author wholesale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a clever story teller","review":"This is the first TC's book I read and maybe I'll give him a second chance. But someone can tell me where's the plot? Spain is willing to have an upheaval, so what? Nobody there want the CIA involved so they make some kind of gore war. I've had read awfully better books than this one.Query: Did the CIA thwarted a revolution in Spain?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed Stinker -- Gets a 9 on the Sominex scale","review":"This is my last Op-Center purchase. They have slid downhill since the first, and Balance of Power is by far the worst technothriller I've ever attempted to read. The cast is large and hard to follow since there appear to be numerous political groups at work to bring down the Spanish government. For all of that, there is the infuriating trademark conference between Op-Center regulars that drones on and on trying to set up and explain the plot and the political premise and background. These conference meetings between protagonist Paul Hood and his staff have a very strong preachy tone about them of which (I infer) it seems the authors wish the reader to become aware of these horrible socio-political injustices that make up the plot, as if they exist. I stopped trying to fathom this book on page 269 and literally threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Clancy's standards","review":"Clancy's books are usually well paced, gripping and built on plausible facts, but the Op-Center series is generally sub-standard. This one is sub-sub-standard. I feel thoroughly cheated. The action is spasmodic and the lack of knowledge of Spain downright pitiful. Clancy, haven't you ever been to Spain? The interplay of Spanish political forces is less than primary, the knowledge of Spanish people nil. The names are sometimes ridiculous and the characters can't even speak Spanish! Who wants my copy? I won't keep this one for a second reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"catalans are not serbs","review":"Even in a fiction book, the comparison between catalans and serbs is hateful. Specially since we feel much more like the Croatians or Slovenians: the rich Nation of the State, paying lots of money to the other parts of the State, with some basic rights in the edge of discrimination against us; and still being hated and/or missunderstood by most of the other people. I just think the author doesn't know anything about what he's writting. Very unfortunated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy shows no knowledge or respect for Spain","review":"I was astonished how a well-reputed researcher as Tom Clancy could just mess up so bad when talking about the character of the Spaniards and political scene of Spain. It is a so respectless towards any Spanish speaking person, not only Spaniards. Plus, it shows no knowledge or interest at all on our country. American novelists should create fantastic countries that fit their misconcepts and desires, like Banania, Antiamerica or whatever. Check out \\"Digital fortress\\" by Dan Brown or the movie \\"Mission : Impossible 2\\" by John Woo. Exactly the same disdain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed in the quality (?) of this production.","review":"This DVD is compiled of a visit to the countryside of West Virginia followed by an outdoor 4th of July concert. Hosted by The Nashville Network's \\"Crook and Chase\\" gives the disk a lively yet monotonous atmosphere. The outdoor concert has terrible video quality...in fact on some shots one can hardly make out the picture. The song selection is an excellent choice of Statler Brothers gold. I seriously doubt that we will ever witness a quartet like the Statlers again. Their vocal range is as pure and impeccable as ever with soul touching lyrics that generates continual applause from the large audience. Although the audio quality is very good, I must admit disappointment in this production. The Statlers had some excellent production in their last TV series. A compilation of these hits under a better production would have been much better value. Maybe next time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I have the Sarah Walker recording of Berio's Folksongs, but I wanted to hear Berberian's interpretation, as the songs were arranged for her. What a shock: terribly annoying voice, intrusive accent in the English numbers, embarrassing pronunciation of Italian and Russian, and shallow, formulaic over-acting. Berberian fans would do well to check out Sarah Walker: gorgeous voice, careful and elegant pronunciation, exquisite phrasing -- and, in dramatic numbers, powerful acting. In addition, for all those who appreciate Berio, Henze, and other \\"modern\\" music composers, Walker has done her share, not only Berio and Henze, but also Maw, Tippett, Taverner -- and the older composers from Monteverdi through Wagner (she has the best hoy-yo-to-jo of them all.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Series Worthy of Better DVD Release","review":"Presumably if you're considering this DVD you already know something about the series. It's a good miniseries -- much more realistic than your typical Latin American telenovela. The problem is the DVDs -- one disk we can't get to play at all (on several different players). Other disks have problems with certain chapters, or will play up to a point then stop. As it was, I was annoyed, but if I had not seen the whole series on TV when it first played in the US, it would have made it impossible to follow. Even though this showed on Telemundo with subtitles in English, they are missing here. Considering that plenty of the dialogue is in colloquial, Colombian narco-slang, that makes it hard to follow for non-native speakers. There is a disk with some \\"extras\\" but nothing like what you would get with a US (or most foreign) films on DVD.It's a good series worth watching, but it deserves a better quality DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT PLOT!

I was a member of the church that R. Nathan pastors at, when I left it was to take a staff position at the church I currently am at. When at Nathan's church, I became very trusting of him because of his preaching the Truth in humility. Therefore, as a result of my deep appreciation for Nathan's faith in Christ, I may be a bit bias in my review. The book gives sincere examination of both classes, Evangelicals, and Charismatics. The examination is performed with the purpose of unifying the body of Christ. A kind of \\"best of both worlds\\" approach. My friends, Jesus desires much more unity among believers, and this book is a service to that desire. I reccomend this book to all. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus Exodus to unlikely Arthur","review":"The first half of the book is good. It is an educating introduction to dendrochronology for the novice. I liked it. The author is an expert in this field. The material is well presented and easy to read. In the second part, unfortunately, the author writes on issues in which he is ill informed, including the history and archeology of Egypt, Israel, and Ireland. The second part of the book is repetitive, boring, and misguiding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you wonder !","review":"A bit repetitive and hard to follow but still a must read. Although all dates provided may be subject to review and/or revision, the author provides a strong relationship between a catastrophic event and mythologies description of unexplained events. I believe this book has served two purposes: number one, it increases our awareness of possible meteor impacts on the Earth in the future; and number two, it provides an alternative interpretation of world mythology and the Bible itself.

Secondly, large number of conjectures written in this book (in my opinion) are very questionable in there very nature or poorly presented.With the exception of the first 50 or so pages, this book put me to sleep every time I attempted to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Impressions: What You Don't Know About How Others See","review":"This is an excellent basic beginning book on this extremely important subject. This is NOT a self-help book, it is an awakening. The book states: these are things you need to be told. No one gets this information unless they are being coached as an employee of a Fortune 500 Company or in a psychiatric ward. You will start putting the suggestions to use immediately even if it is subconsciously. The book emphasis the major importance of a first impression - often made in a few seconds. The suggestions within the contents can teach you to suceed, whether with clients, dates, friends or just people you pass in your everday life. Reading this book will make you realize things that never entered your mind before - and you will benefit greatly from this information. Personally, I could not stop turning the pages craving what new insights and lessons would be next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Written Book","review":"I bought this book after listening to Dr. Demarais on NPR. This is a very well written and easy to read book with good concepts that you need to put into practice. Therefore, I wish the authors come out with an abridged audio version to listen to again and again because you need to get these ideas ingrained inside you and become second nature. Even though this book is geared towards creating impressions on a date, I highly recommend this book to anyone whose job involves dealing with people."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this book","review":"I bought this book as an afterthought, so I was probably helped a bit by not having overly high expectations. High expectations or not, I found it a very interesting and informative read. It was much more than just a shallow \\"Dress for Success\\" kind of book- I felt it delved into a lot of waters for social interaction that while seemingly simple and obvious can often go overlooked. I also liked the use of research and studies to support some of the theories of the authors and give the book more credibility. A lot of the ideas about being a more unselfish listener, showing interest in others, being warm and smiling and making eye contact probably are instinctive for most people, but even people with pretty solid social skills can glean some good affirmation and inspiration from this book. It will do more than just help you make a better first impression, it will help you feel more equipped for about any impression in the early stages of friendship and relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY interesting -- not as insightful as I'd hoped","review":"Very good review of the basics -- excellent for young adults/early career types\\"what you don't know about how others see you\\" gave me the impression that it would be more insightful than it really was ---book is EXCELLENT for base-knowledge"},{"rating":"1","title":"I found it boring and useless...","review":"I didn't get all the way through or even more than partially through, it just bored me too much in the beginning and seemed to just state common sense.

Very funny, if it were not downright idiotic!I say: let us be more mature, form our judgments of others rationally, be more tolerant and willing to accept others.

Another great asset is the book's explanation of ho revisionists change the education of our youth, and the corrupted revision of historical documents and quotes.

The story reassures children that what goes \\"bump in the night,\\" may be nothing more than your window shade!"},{"rating":"1","title":"evil pictures","review":"I like the construction and the idea, even the story, but there are 3 of the pages that are pretty evil looking. The jackle has sharp teeth and hair standing on the back of its neck. The page with the other animals in the forest following the crow, looks like ghost images. I read the reviews and some even said it was good for 3 year olds. Well, it makes me feel a little uncomfortable reading this to my 3 year old.

On other tests thiswould indicate a positive result, but I couldn't be sure with this test. About 6 hours later I took the other test. The digital screen told me I am \\"not pregnant\\". Feeling now that I couldn't trust the digital screen, I popped open the test to check the strip. Again, 2 lines. A day of testing and $15 later I still have no idea if I'm pregnant.

After speaking with customer service, I was told that either the holder was defective or the battery was dead. After paying close to $20.00 for this product, I must say I am very disappointed.

It covers trapping and hunting game, and a whole section on knots. Grant it, depending on your level of know how, it may still behoove you to get more in-depth book on some of certain topics.

Some very imaginative ideas were interspersed into this plot, which offers glimpses of \\"Minority Report\\"'s futuristic crime solving, but Denzel Washington gives a performance a step (or two) above Tom Cruise's version. The sequence of events peaks the imagination in DejaVu, and supplies well enough camoflaged leads, that makes the production a progression of links into the climax, transitions that are as smooth as possible, with only a minimal amount of fragmentational scenes which never seem to add-up. Its a difficult theme to digest, even after the movie. The whole idea tooses back and forth from being Far-fetched, to anything's possible, and Denzel is a key ingredient for making DejaVu's mysterious premis as believable as it could ever get.

I love thew sci-fi principle of time travel in this film... what I have a problem with is the tremendously flawed logic that the characters have. The chief flaw is the centering on a single character, played by Denzel Washington of course, to thwart a horrific terrorist attack.

This film has those elements, but the plot is what sells the movie. It is an innovative movie not only in terms of the effects, but also in terms of how time is portrayed (I won't spoil it with an explanation). The Blu-ray version looks very nice. You can see every pore on Denzel's face. Some of the shots are very gritty, which I think Tony Scott intended on. Despite that, the colors really pop and the sound is crisp and clear. As a Blu-ray title, it's one of the best I've seen (Corpse Bride is still the absolute best transfer I've seen). With shipping included, I paid less for this than I would for a regular DVD, so it was a great value. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja-Crap","review":"This movie had me going right up until the final act, and then I watched it spiral out of control, as story and acting took a terrible u-turn and crashed on landing.Now I'm not a big Denzel fan, but for the first 2/3rd of the film, he actually did a pretty good job. But whether it was the writer or the director(horrid want-to-be as good as my brother, Tony Scott), the last 30 minutes left me and my girlfriend shouting at the screen, \\"Move your butt, aren't there people to save!\\".It's been awhile since I've viewed a movie where you can actually pinpoint the moment where everything derails, and all concept of time and logic is lost in the ashes.Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEJAVU","review":"I HAVE A WIDESCREEN TV,BUT IT IS LETTERBOX AND HARD TO WATCH, SO ONLY WATCHED ABOUT 5 MINUTES AND TURNED IT OFF,GLAD I ONLY RENTED IT.

THE WORST OF ALL IS THE SEVERAL GOOD REVIEWS THAT THIS MOVIE HAD, ITS LIKE A COMPLETE DIFFERENT MOVIE ANALYSIS. WHAT A WASTE OF FILM REEL AND ACTORAL WORK (DENZEL WASHINGTON).[...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is AWFUL!!!","review":"this movie is terrible. I imagine this will be the new form of torture, being forced to watch really stupid movies. Yet a lot of people actually like this film. HAHAHA sheep."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been a while since I saw something as bad","review":"This is a really bad movie.I love movies and I have giving bad reviews, but this one deserves it.D. Washington gave a standard performance. He acts pretty much the same in every movie.The time machine related stuff.. dunno, I am no physicist, but the explanations just didn't seem believable. And in this particular movie believability is important.And then scripting and rhytm.. it has ups and downs, coupld of times it comes down to a standstill. Its an action movie, shouldn't get boring, ever.And it was boring. Too bad, cuz the idea is not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I expected","review":"Denzel plays an ATF officer assigned to a special squad looking for a terrorist bomber. The squad uses some new technology, which allows the investigation to move through different video and audio perspectives and through time. Gradually, Denzel's character becomes convinced he can communicate through time, and if so, he may be able to stop-before-the-act a terrorist who's blown up a crowded New Orleans ferry. Motivating Denzel's character, in part, is his desire to save the beautiful woman the terrorist used as a torch to in essence light the bomb. Gradually, Denzel's character becomes convinced that maybe he too can cross the time barrier and take matters into his own hands.This was an extremely good movie, with science fiction that made sense, good action scenes and attractive characters. The only flaw IMHO was that there was an easier path to the outcome which would have enhanced the credibility and satisfaction level of the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Phew","review":"Deja Vu is about a man who is on this mission to get facts about a bombing that takes place in some remote dock out. There is time travel involved in the film. There is a lot of detective work and dragging storylines around this film. There is little or nothing \\"cool\\" about this film. I almost slept shortly before the intermission. I know there are a gazillion Denzel Washington fans and all; I can respect that but seriously, guys, WHAT A BAD FILM. This film reminded me of XXX 2. And readers, Van Helsing was a better film than Deja Vu and that is saying a lot without saying much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the movie","review":"This is an example of a great movie on HD but I didn't notice so much of a change in Blue ray version. If you already have the HD you don't really need to get blue ray. This movie is a five. I gave it four stars because if you already have it in HD then you could save the money. On the other hand if you have no version at all and are looking to buy for the first time the movie is a five and I would get blue ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denzel in the past or the present is perfection","review":"I love Denzel Washington and I watched this movie twice over the past 24 hours.It's tough to get the first time around. Even twice is not enough. It remindedme of the movie \\"Memento\\" with Guy Pierce, but this one is better. Paula Pattonwas fine in it, as were some of the other supporting cast. Watch it or have youwatched it and forgotten, deja vu???"},{"rating":"2","title":"DejaVu all over again - Really great story","review":"I first ordered another Denzel Washington movie, Out of Time, and realized I wanted Deja Vu. He is great in both movies and always plays a neat police role. Not sure why he needs to get shot or blown up in his roles but it does provide for an interesting plot. Then there are the attractive women in his movies.With TV quality going down, I am more inclined to add to my video library and this is a movie I can watch again and again. If you like action movies with requiring some intelligence you will enjoy this one a lot.Deja Vu [Blu-ray]Deja VuI bought the Blu-ray version"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Too Far Fetched","review":"When a New Orleans ferryboat is destroyed by a terrorist bomb, killing most of the people onboard, ATF agent Doug Carling (played by Denzil Washington), is sent to investigate. The mystery deepens when a young womans body is found, near the scene of the crime, yet the evidence indicates she died a few hours before the explosion.I thought this movie started off quite interesting, as Carling gets his teeth into the investigation, but once the technological parts of film 'kicked in', it got a bit too far fetched for my liking. As the movie progressed it got more and more ridiculous, and I feel the 'technology' bits would have worked better, if it had of been set a few years into the future. Not even Denzil can save this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"Denzel Washington is his usual excellent self in this suspenseful movie of whether or not he can change the events of the recent past. Through super-technological advances, Washington is able to view the recent past to try to determine who was responsible for blowing up a ferry.While viewing the past, Washington begins to get very interesting in a woman that seems to be connected to the bomber. As he views her in the past, he realizes that he is able to affect what she is doing so he gets the idea that maybe he can go back to the past and prevent the bombing from happening.The suspense towards the end of the film is unreal. A top-notch thriller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and Trite","review":"I like Denzel a lot, but I wish he would recognize a poor script and pass it by. This movie starts with a great opening scene and then steadily descends into a confused tangle of hopeless science fiction and comical references to the \\"Einstein-Rosen Bridge.\\" Overly melodramatic and entirely predictable, the story is saved by the always convincing work of Jim Caviezel as the villian. On the other hand, Washington's acting is unfortunately stereotypical. He really needs to get a new persona - it's no fun to see him adopt the same sly, intense, smirking image that we have seen so many times. Maybe Clint could do it and we loved it, but DW? I don't think so. Ultimately this flick succumbs to its convoluted plot and instead of a gripping movie full of surprises we get a dismal bit of sci-fi confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Denzel vs Jesus Caviezel + Val","review":"This movie stunk. It was full of time travel and all the twist and turns that come with the possibilities. But of course we have seen it all before a million times (can you say 12 Monkey's?). The movie has a great cast and it is a shame to see Denzel, Jesus Caviezel and Val 'I am washed up and not even trying anymore' Kilmer wasted in this stinky doo doo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amongst all the good, it really just asks for too much...","review":"Okay, look, I agree if you stick it through \\"everything does pull together\\" in the end and there is the usual fine and polished acting from Denzel, but did anyone really believe the time travel? You know, the part where Denzel, whom I respect so much, was sitting in what looked like a sewer pipe with a oversized torpedo hatch-like door waiting to go be bop back in time. I'm all about cashing in my suspension of disbelief at the movies, but this bending time rubbish was handed to the audience like it was no big deal. Like, hello, doesn't all law enforcement bend time via their uber-secret projects when needed to solve terrible crimes? Overall not my cup of tea, extra star for Denzel 'cause I like him. I'd guess others will like this movie better, because it's really not terribly crafted overall, if they're will to buy the comic book parts of the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEESE!!!","review":"Who would ever believe that there's technology out there that can look back in time 4 days, then add to that, you can hear the person too?? Then later get into a machine and travel back???The love story didn't work for me either.I was very disappointed in this movie. The only reason I gave it two stars is because...it's Denzel and James Caviezel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intriguing premise. Very entertaining movie.","review":"This film has more to it than initially meets the eye. What seems on its face to be a high-tech crime thriller is so much more. You'll find a suspenseful, intermittently action-packed story line filled with mind-bending twists (a few of which are admittedly predictable), along with an exceptional balance between gritty realism and sci-fi imagination.Denzel Washington did a somewhat better-than-okay job as ATF agent Doug Carlen. His character was not especially deep, but he had some great support, including Val Kilmer, Adam Goldberg, and a wonderfully psychotic Jim Caviezel. The ending was a bit surprising, but pleasantly so. The little twist when the last shoe dropped was not something I had expected. Overall I was moderately impressed with the quality of this effort, and have no trouble recommending it to others for their viewing pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"this is an awesome movie denzel' performance was awesome. i recomend this movie for everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, interesting premise","review":"I enjoy movies with interesting subject matter, believeable or not. I like to be entertained and this movie did just that. Thought provoking. The blu-ray video was good quality but not the best. Audio is PCM with use of surrounds but most of the sound does seem to come from the front speakers. Good LFE."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you could change the future would you?","review":"I seemed to get caught up in the subtle complexities of time travel films, and there are plenty of those in Deja Vu. Given the cast, great performances are a given, leaving the unfolding of the story and issues of traveling through time to keep you guessing until the end.Very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and visually stunning","review":"This is not a serious movie but it is fun as hell and very, very beautifully made. It looks fantastic on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Movie From Star To Finish!","review":"Wasn't quite sure what to expect when I rented this movie.... It was a lot better than I anticipated as I thought it would be some cheesy suspense movie, but it wasn't.It was a combination action/suspense, science-fiction, time travel, and a bit of romance thrown in at the end kind of movie. The acting was superb as well as the storyline.... With the created/fabricated technology and time travel used in movie, I wasn't sure how it all was going to fit together! But everything worked itself into a neat tightly fit package by the end of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bend your mind","review":"Hey, for love? I would say the same thing, bend your mind. Excellent work by Denzel, I missed its theatrical release and am glad I bought and watched, howsoever late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This is a great action adventure with a little bit of scifi mixed in. Good cast. Edge of your seat suspense keeps you interested and guessing. Overall just a terrific movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique idea","review":"I really liked this movie, it wasn't easy to predict where it was going to go and it made you pay attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja Vu. Deja Vu, I thought I said that.","review":"If you love Denzel (one of the best actors of our time), this is another action packed, mind bender of a movie. The idea of the story is better than the story itself. Technical wizardry abounds and those into space-time theory will be amused by the concepts. Not Denzel's best movie, but once again, Denzel is great and makes the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Dumb","review":"Wow, what a daring approach to terrorism they must have spent countless hrs to work that in so that it doesn't - god forbid - offend anybody. A lonesom guy with no affiliation or believes that would explain that motivation, just another faceless cookie cutter villain.My main beef however is that time machine movies rarely work (with maybe the exception of Orson Wells classic) because there are no consequences that stick and it becomes painfully ovious when you get to see the same scene for the second or third time (especially when it wasn't particulary interesting the first time around).Denzel might have tried this 100 times like groundhog day before he got it right and it doesn't matter, because its not a compelling story and the car chase gave me a royal headache"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could go back in time and rent some other movie","review":"Now, I have never given one star to a movie before. But this movie is _that_ bad. It's so absurd that it insults the viewer's intelligence. Denzel is decent, but then the movie started getting so ridiculous at one point that I gave up.. right when Denzel went back in time by four days and started chasing the bomber... go figure! Oh, it also seemed like he was falling in love with the girl who is already dead (or is she?) by watching videos of her taking shower and changing clothes. I guess by the end of the movie, she will get back to life again and fall in love with Denzel.This movie is plain stupid. I'm surprised it has a 4 stars rating on amazon. If you want to watch a good time-travel, sci-fi movie, I recommend12 Monkeys (Special Edition)"},{"rating":"1","title":"By the numbers - predictable","review":"I'd sum up the experience of seeing this mediocre film as: predictable, you have seen it all before, and it's a thin story idea. The actors had all of the correct facial expressions at all times, to match the dialogue - hopefully they weren't paid too much for doing this. That's about it. (A friend lent this to me, so I'm glad I didn't buy it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"very very predictable and painfully unbelievable plot","review":"This movie is very predictable and has a painfully unbelivable plot. Nicolas Cages movie, called \\"Next\\", is a far far better time travel movie. I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie. I mean, who would believe that you could not only see backwards in time through an LCD screen TV but that you could also alter time through that screen? I gave up on this movie 20 minutes into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"grabs you and keeps on going","review":"The start to this movie is a little rough, but it grabs you by the seat of your pants and really doesn't let go until the end. Well writtten and well acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"I just sat down to watch this, with family.What we expected: a typical Hollywood action-packed blockbuster with a great idea, destroyed in all ways possible.What we got: an interesting somewhat plausible - still a little predictable - script, decent actors (no Oscar nominations here), great action, and a clever twist.Fun entertainment, but if you pay attention to the details from the start, you'll have the ending figured all out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one of Denzel's best, which means it is still better than most","review":"Deja Vu is a typical story that follows someone trying to change something in the past to alter the future...or so that is what they want you to think. The film has some breathtaking action scenes combined with a performance by Denzel Washington that is as usual, nothing short of spectacular. The twisted sci-fi style of virtual lab work that allows you to actually SEE the past/future on a monitor and be able to navigate around like it is some fancy architecture program was really, really cool. This is a movie I would not hesistate to perhaps watch again down the road, and the price on Amazon is fair."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],N={key:0},W={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",W,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-b8b70bc4"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/6.md","filePath":"quotes/6.md"}'),R={name:"quotes/6.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
