It has always been hard to get TV reception in North Phoenix and this antenna got most the main stations right out of the box.With a little configuration, such as pointing the HD antenna in the correction direction and calibrating the correct signal amplification, you should be able to dial in almost every channel. To get the best possible reception with this antenna, try and position it someplace high inside, free from obstruction.Since you will probably end up testing a couple different of products before giving up, make sure to give this one a whirl first to avoid as much frustration as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even as good as 15 year old rabbit ears","review":"I was hoping for some improvement for one TV where there is no cable outlet on which I receive several channels reasonably well with some old rabbit ears.

I kept reading about how pure and uncompressed HDTV reception was via antenna... so i decided to take a gamble in the interests of technololgy.Well. I lost that gamble. The thing stinks. The antenna cannot catch on to a single broadcast flawlessly. There is No HD reception at all. There is Snow and wavy lines all over the picture. The worst part is.... my best channel.. reception-wise is Channel 8 news in Connecticut with Dan Petriw.

The RCA's were very disappointing, but this baby pulled in 11 HD stations and so far is alive and well and living in Park City !!My only complaint is it's footprint. I also wish as HD channels are on UHF, I really don't need the VHF rabbit ears that come with this, it's a shame they are not removable for someone who simply wants this for HD.All in all, this is the best of 6 Indoor HD antennas that I have tried.If you have an HD signal, this has proved to be the best of the bunch at pulling it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE Does not work on Digital Transmission","review":"If you'll notice almost all of the positive reviews of this antenna are from 2007, before Digital TV became the standard.

The old antenna, which is just a 6-7\\" circle with 2 telescoping antennas, picks up 5 channels, plus the .x channels which piggyback on the main signal. It is possible to orient the old antenna to pick all these signals without adjustments.The new antenna won't pick up *anything*. The LEDs come on, and the level adjusters work (it's kind of cool how they made the LEDs fade), but the antenna doesn't work for TV. I tried it for FM, and it does an okay job. It doesn't seem to make a difference whether 2 LEDs are lit, or all of them are. (If =<1 LED is lit, the FM receiver doesn't pick up anything, the TV STB won't pick up anything regardless.)I'm confident that the antenna was hooked up correctly, and that the switch was set to \\"ant\\" instead of cable, so.. mine just doesn't work, or it's a really bad antenna."},{"rating":"1","title":"high performance?","review":"Although the product is very easy to attach,to me, the product is overrated in the performance area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I bought this antenna on ebay. The quality of the actual antenna is very poor. The rabbit ears literally broke off when I was opening one of them. And im not la big clumsy football player or anything...I am a girl and don't have very strong arms at all. Then when I was hooking it up to my Dtv box with the cord (the one with the long pin) it literally fell out of the socket!!! (from the antenna). So the rabbit ears broke off and the socket where you plug the cord that goes into your dtv box just broke. The reception that I got from it when it had only one rabbit ear was still good, and I tried just regular rabbit ear antenna and I am getting a few less channels. So the reception WHEN IT ISN'T FALLING APART is pretty good. I am returning it and am going to try the TERK antenna now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made/Mine was defective","review":"I purchased this based on positive reviews. I can't say whether it was just a bad item or if all of them have this problem. When it arrived, I was dismayed to find that it was cheaply made. There are two connectors for your cables on the back- standard attachments for coaxial cable. They were so poorly attached that one came out of the antenna when I tried to remove the protective plastic cap! The other one snapped out when I tried to attach a cable. I returned it as defective. Now, the whole reason I had purchased it was to see So You THink You Can Dance, and I didn't want to miss the season premier, so I decided to see if it would work even broken. And I have to say, it did get good reception, even though it wasn't attached properly. I imagine if it was in good shape, I would have been happy. So I'd suggest seeing if other reviewers had the same problem I did before deciding whether or not to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely perfect!!!","review":"It fits absolutely perfectly into that small space in the back of my closet.I got better reception with the cheapo, non-powered rabbit ears, that are re-hooked to my TV.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Antenna","review":"After I finally figured out how to connect it to my 50\\" Plasma TV and then to run a search from the TV for the channels the antenna will pick up, I was pleasantly surprised to get a few local channels in HD or digital service that looked much better than what the local Dish Network channel looked like. I couldn't get all of the majors (fox, abc, nbc, cbs) at one time however due to antenna positioning. You have to play around with the antenna positioning as well as the number of red lights to have going on the tuner. (signal strength) You can have anywhere from 0 to 5 lights going. I have 3 stations going well right now (local channel 3, abc, cbs and fox) NBC in hd won't come in with those set and when i adjust to get it, then I lose fox or abc. I'm still hoping to find one setting/position where I can get them all, but I'm not complaining b/c I don't have to pay for these local hd stations. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product ok, but not sure it is truly better than old rabit ear","review":"I ended up with returning this product, though product itself might be ok.Compare with old rabbit ear, it does not do any better, in receiving analog signals.

I found this antenna to be significantly worse than ordinary cheap rabbit ears. Using the product got me only 3 channels. Using my rabbit ears I get 11 channels. Both antennas and TV remained in the same place in the house.I thought this antenna was a \\"smart antenna\\". It is not. It is a rather stupid antenna of marginal value. As many techies know, you cannot make a TV signal if you do not have a signal to start with. Gain and amplification are not important if there is no signal. Catch 22. You can't fool nature. If you are not getting good reception with indoor rabbit ears you need to move stuff or move period. An outdoor antenna might help.

Seeing him listed as one of the authors of \\"BusinessThink\\" I bought it. Only then did I discover that Khalsa appears to have had very little to do with \\"BusinessThink\\" (in a long list of acknowledgements he doesn't even feature) and, more seriously, that \\"BusinessThink\\" is essentially just a rewrite of \\"Let's get Real\\" - indeed whole swathes of \\"BusinessThink\\" consists of word for word plagarism of \\"Let's Get Real\\". Had there been some acknowledgement of this fact by the authors or Franklin Covey this practice might, just, have been okay. But there is no hint in the introduction, or elsewhere, that \\"BusinessThink\\" is just a slightly reworked \\"Let's Get Real\\". Shame on the authors, on FranklinCovey, and on the publishers for this exercise in cynicism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the Special Edition of a DVD, without the special","review":"I bought this book becuase I read Lets Get Real or Lets Not Play by Mahan Khalsa and was very intruiged by it. Lets Get Real is a TERRIFIC book. Little did I know that BusinessThink is basicly the coles notes version of Lets Get Real with two other names plunked above his. There is little additional value added here. If you want to get the same material but more of it and better presented, buy Lets Get Real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer - this book amounts to a marketing shill and nothing more.To paraphrase the commercial from the 80's - \\"Where's the Beef?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on Marketing Short on Substance","review":"The book says that the heart and soul of business is thinking and this is nothing but hogwash! Action makes business not philosophers, deep thinkers or wise old men. There are lots of thinking problems in the book and page after page is concerned with thinking matters. Tell me, did Bill Gates think about Windows or did he go out and sell something? Action not thinking about it is going to make your business.

These two authors don't seem very creative and most everything covered in the book is Mahan's. Mahan's name is in smaller print in the book than Marcum and Smith when it should have been the other way around.I am surprised that the Franklin Covey corporation has authorized this book.With that said, the book has some good ideas that could be of value although they must not be easy to implement since the authors have not helped their company, Franklin Covey become profitable as reported in a USA Today article."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking differently","review":"Through eight simple rules, I learned not only how to do business differently, but how to see business differently-to think in a way that maximizes the innate resourcefulness of everyone I lead.

I really enjoyed the Steven Covey book \\"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\" and the book was marketed as the next Steven Covey book. How could I resist. I am almost done with the last chapter and I keep hoping that it will somehow redeem itself. So far, I am only glad that I don't work for any of the corporations described in the book. This is not a book that I would recommend to other entrepreneurs, but maybe corporate america with it's unique problems somehow can benefit from the ideas in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE book for the 21st century successful businessperson","review":"This is one of the few books that provides the stick to pull people from the quagmire of decision making in today's corporations. That \\"stick\\" is thinking and the ability to make the right decision at the right time. The 8 rules in businessThink have given me skills for thinking through decisions and the issues those decisions address.The tone of the authors adds to the real-ness and relevance of their ideas. They don't mince words; they incorporate humor; and you get a sense that these authors care about what they're writing--and care about helping others to businessThink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty fluff","review":"I always read the books I buy right through. This one was really tough to finish. I bought the book because of the Stephen Covey endorsement but I was very disappointed. Perhaps it was the picture of the young (and green) looking authors that tainted my thinking (\\"how much could they know?\\") but there was little or no substance. No depth. Nothing powerful or memorable. Examples seemed to be restricted to their own business failings. The most annoying thing was the \\"BusinessThink\\" references right through as if they had invented this type of thinking. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a solid model for business decision making!","review":"I'm a business owner who is tired of personal opinions, personal agendas and general guessing when it comes to making crucial business decisions. I'm not sure how to put into words what this book has meant to my rapidly changing business. Now everyone in our company is a decision maker- the only criterion is 1- Check your ego At the door and 2- identify the hard evidence. As we get better at using the model in Business Think we are becoming more and more profitable. We no longer have to spend countless meetings guessing and reguessing to achive the desired result. Thank you for taking the time to business think outside the box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy again.","review":"This product was not at all what I expected. You have to add 4-5 tablets just to get a little bit of color. I have used the crayola tablets before and only had to use one or two to get the color I wanted. I would recommend that instead. Cost more but you get more tablets that are bigger and will give you really bright colors.

The movie itself remains one of my all-time favorites. You simply cannot watch it and not be moved.

Goldsmith does a wonderful job (as usual) weaving the theme in and out of this CD. I put it on to relax at the end of a hard day to wind down. The movie was so well photographed that the images still come to me as I shut my eyes and listen to Jerry work his magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting as the movie!","review":"If you love the score then listen to Sarah Brightman sing the theme song on her \\"Time to say goodbye\\" CD.

Sentimental pap blown up to ludicrously Tragic proportions with a musty Big Theme wheezed out in a 19th Century Romantic style that doesn't convince for a second for all the calculated emotionalism.

With a \\"lacking\\" technique you cannot sing Armida, the Proch-Variations (!), Abigaille and Amina to perfection as she did. In later years (I'd say after 1958) her voice was very burned out and had a wobble sometimes. That is what might be problematic. I agree very much though that comparing the two makes no sense. But Callas was not only a performer, she was much more than that. That is why her CDs are still so loved and praised by critics. Bottom-Line: Two sopranos who did what they did very well. Both deserve respect and admiration. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time !!","review":"This is one of the most obscure reading I have ever gone through, I will recommend to read the publication at the end of the chapters, which will save you money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firefox","review":"The book fell apart when I read it.

I just wanted more of the book, more character development, more detail on the spy tradecraft. The story is great, the detail is there, and I just wanted maybe 50 more pages. The book moves very fast and because it does not have volume it is easily a weekend book. I would recommend the book; I just thought it needed more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitch Gant--the flying Rambo","review":"Unlike the original Rambo, author Craig Thomas has brought his troubled Air Force Nam vet through four stories--this book, a sequel \\"Firefox Down\\" that continues the journey of Gant's stolen MiG out of Soviet airspace into Scandinavia, \\"Winterhawk\\" in which Gant uses a MiL chopper that the Israelis stole for the US to rescue a deep cover agent from their Baikonur rocket base, and \\"A Different War\\" which was never published for US release (I bagged a used copy of that one courtesy of rare book site Alibris). In that one, Gant is called upon to investigate an airline tragedy that ends up having corporate skulduggery at its roots--thus its title. The Gant of the printed page is a bit different from the Gant on the screen--in action roles, Eastwood always plays his characters as laconic and menacing. This Gant is more intense, more of an envelope-pusher. As such, he's a lot like David Morrell's Rambo--you'd never make the connection on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillsong Kids DVD","review":"I never got my order of this video, so I'm going to tell others that this place is not all that reliable.

I gave my cd to a 10 year old boy at VBS and he was so excited, many kids flip their noses up at music unless it's \\"cool\\"...i love this because it keeps the main thing [God], as the main thing and it's fun. some of the songs are \\"out there\\" as one review said, but ask your teenager, and you'll get a different response (however, some songs are more suited for youth nights, camps, vbs......anywhere there are lots of kids)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the sprouting begin!","review":"Very easy process: Use a mason jar.

Now swish the water aroundto get all the seeds wet and dump the water out through the nylon.Kind of shake the jar to spread out the seeds on the bottom (actually,the side) of the mason jar.

Starts out with a brief introduction, then a bit of yoga, and a lovely meditation practice. The drawback is that there are no submenus designating different start points, so you have to fast forward to bypass the spoken introduction and/or the yoga. Beautful scenery, but you really don't notice it unless you peek ;o) At the end of Rodney's am practice they show a closeup of his face and have you open your eyes. It would be much nicer to see a beautiful sunrise during the time when your eyes are open. Other then those slight flaws, the content is very good.

If the batteries go dead, just put new ones in, no waiting for a recharge. I stopped using it because the spring that holds the battery cover on broke. It will still work if you push on it really hard, but it is on the bottom of the razor, so you cannot do this and use it.My husband used it once on a trip when he for got his razor.

My guess is that most readers don't bother to look at the historical facts and cowards like Ben Ami count on that. But, what motivates a miserable self hating Jew like Ben Ami to spread lies? Probably the money he gets from selling a controvercial book.

I ran right out and bought the soundtrack, and it's one of the treasures of my collection. Newman builds his music with unusual instruments like zithers, a pedal steel guitar, and an Indian banjo, along with more conventional ones like piano and flute, and produces a sound that's unlike anything I've ever heard. I will confess, though, that when I play it for my friends, they ask me \\"Do you actually listen to this stuff?\\" When it's filled with life, energy, and such beauty, I certainly do.The movie is about a family of misfits, some of whom are somewhat disturbed, and you may think the music was written to take us into those dark places, but that's not where it takes me. To me, it feels like a celebration of the character's quirky obsessions, fears, and ultimately discovers their warmth. This sound track isn't for everyone, but I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF CAL CAMP & AMAZON","review":"CALCAMP AND AMAZON ARE CROOKS. I ORDERED TWO LAMPS THAT WERE ADVERTIZED AT $60.00.

The National Army War College spent years gathering propaganda evidence to keep the Tuskegee airmen out of the sky. This blasphemous research kept the men out of the sky for years, when they were really needed in Europe. Living in a time of great animosity and hatred, The Tuskegee Airmen chose to rise above the bigotry and prove themselves as tough soldiers. They risked their lives for the men that discriminated against them, yet the fighters were still separated and regarded as inferior. The film really captures the struggle and the conquering of prejudice that the men faced during a time that the country should have been united and working together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tuskgee Airmen","review":"This movie clearly shows the dedication, determination and persistence of the Red tail Angel even with much racism and prejudice. The Red tail Airmen were the first black airmen. They were an experiment by the government called, \\"The Tuskegee Experiment\\". The entire experiment was done to prove that the African American did not possess the characteristics that airmen needed. They were trained at the Tuskegee Alabama Institute. There were 926 pilots in the experiment, including General Daniel \\"Chappie\\" James, General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., Major General Lucius Theus, Colonel Charles Cooper, Colonel Hannibal Cox, Colonel Charles McGee, Lt. Colonel Herbert E. Carter, Lt. Colonel George Hardy, Lt. Colonel Bill Holloman, and Lt. Colonel John. They flew P-40s, P-39s, which were painted with a red tail. They were told not go shoot down other planes, but only to guard the bombers. The Tuskegee Airmen never lost a bomber, while escorting over 200 bombing missions. - Shannon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Art of Segovia-2 CD pack","review":"Art of SegoviaI purchased the CD's in May of 2011.

The beauty about an album like this is that us old guys buy it because we dug Lennon in the sixties and suddenly we leapfrog to discovering all these current bands.

Working Class hero is also an outstanding track and I had never heard of Screaming Trees.

Big payoff.","review":"I recently bought this book in anticipation of attending a close friend's wedding in Norway. It is a great course - with a good mix of grammar, vocabulary, cultural notes, and pronunciation help (using the tapes). The course proceeds rather quickly and covers more ground than similar language courses. And surprisingly, the course does not \\"feel\\" dense.Overall, this is a great buy. Nonetheless, I gave it only four stars because of the formatting. The book contains lots of little sections. You'll see an average of two to three quick exercises/dialogs/explanations/vocabulary-keys per page. It's all great information, but it bumps around rather quickly. It is a personal preference of mine to have a slightly slower pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely great for beginner....","review":"when i started using this book i kew nothing - i have now finaly finished the book (i took my time) and can speak norwegian with my husband its a great book - i have purchased a numbe rof books but this by far is the best and is soo easy to follow and practice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bente and John and Kari rule","review":"The book is good but what makes this really unique is the cassettes because you listen to Bente and John and Kari having these entertaining conversations in Norwegian.

Jazz musicians can learn a lot from this type of music, as can electronic musicians. Perfect blends of \\"real\\" music with surreal, but solid mood gets this cd an easy 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 % Sermon","review":"I expect a near death experience to be about nearly dying. A description of Heaven and God's purpose or plan is subjective. If it wasn't, they would all match, wouldn't they? It's not that i don't appreciate there would be a spiritual aspect to this experience. Devoting some of the book (10 to 20% to your unique perspective is fine.) But don't spend the whole book giving me your Sunday morning sermon. Spend the book telling me WHY DYING CONVINCED YOU there is a hereafter; not how I need to perceive it. Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Conversion Story!","review":"I chose to read this story to find out what would convince or influence an Atheist to believe in God.

This is exactly what I was looking for. It was very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I loved this book and thought it was insightful. It presents Jesus in a down to earth, honest way that I find very appealing. There are also a many things that Howard says in the book that I feel are true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneasy View of Heaven","review":"The book is entertaining and frightening in places, but it's quite a bit different from other NDEs. In Storm's account, God is not a personal being, but a nebulous light with lesser lights fluttering around above. There're no streets, roads, buildings or ancestors. Angels don't have human forms and I'm troubled that Storm's experience is so vividly different than those of others. Storm obviously experienced a life-changing event, but I'm troubled by his insistence that there will be no more world wars (there will be), nuclear detonations (there will be) and that man will become better until 200 years from now, man will reach a near perfect state.

Also Lance Richardson'sThe Message."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life.","review":"I was led to buy this book, I feel. I literally could not put this book down. I started reading it in the bookstore, purchased it, read for 20 minutes in the car before leaving the parking lot, came home,and did not put it down until I finished it. Since then, I have gone back and re-read the parts where Howard converses with the angelic beings and Christ. It is compelling, and rings true to me. I cried as I read his account of his life review. My heart changed during reading this book, and I am grateful that I still have time to change my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Account!","review":"I have read this book three times now, and each time I learn something more.

Seek Christ now!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing concepts to mull over and over . .","review":"I read this book a few years ago and still think about it. I had to read it in sections and contemplate each one for hours or days before moving on to the next section. As I did this, I realized that there was nothing here that went against any of my religious education and that it only served to exemplify what we were always taught, that God is love; pure, unbounded love.While some of this book is a bit far out, when you consider it in the context of a person who has just died and returned, maybe it's not so far out after all, especially when that person was an avowed atheist before this experience. As a caution, remind yourself as you read that this is not the Bible, just one man's recounting of what he believes to be true. True or not, his message is wonderful and his spiritual reawakening is a beauty to behold."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no death!","review":"I heard Howard speak on the radio (NPR) and didn't get to listen to the whole interview. But I became interested in NDE's and read Howard's NDE on line with hundreds of others and it changed my life forever. So I finally got around to reading his book and I am glad I did. I recommend this book to anyone who wants an idea what it's like to walk away from your body. What you experience is up to you. You define your next experience by the decisions that are made \\"NOW\\". It's refreshing to see that NDE's can make sense with today's various Christian doctrines. Howard became a minister. Not a bad choice! Not a bad choice at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Moving!!","review":"If you want to really get a better picture of Howard's story.

In sum, we liked the first part, but about two-thirds of the way through, the narrative crumbled.Everyone enjoyed the riveting story of his life-threatening situation in Paris, and the ordeal of his recovery. And we liked most of the parts when he's talking with the angels. But when the author stops telling his story and starts preaching, then people put the book down.Also, someone complained that he ties up all of the loose ends of his life before the ordeal, except for one, and that caused her to not to give the book any sort of recommendation. The first half and the second half are barely cohesive, and, as a result, we all felt that his editor failed in his or her responsibilities to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Bunch of Crap","review":"Parts of Mr. Storm's story don't hold up from the very beginning. Are we really supposed to believe that in \\"a large public hospital\\" in Paris in 1985 he had to be transported on a gurney \\"for several blocks\\" on the sidewalk outdoors in order to get from the emergency room to his hospital room? And that because it was the weekend there were no surgeons available in the entire city to perform the operation he needed? And that the diagnosis and severity of his condition wasn't communicated from the emergency room doctors to other hospital personnel? And that when hospital personnel didn't seem to understand the emergency nature of the situation it didn't occur to his wife or to the English-speaking patient in the next bed or to that patient's wife to contact the doctor who made the original diagnosis or the emergency room doctors and ask them to intervene? Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Decent into Death: A Second Chance at Life","review":"Excellent book! I have given it to several friends who found it very inspiring. An amazing story about a person's spiritual transformation."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Loves You As You Are!","review":"Howard Storm writes an honest and beautifully revealing account of his experiences after his near death episode. He reveals a God infinitely more complex, holy, and loving than the one taught to us in Sunday school. Our spiritual growth continues after death. Life here on earth is solely to do God's will and learn to love God and each other as Christ showed us in the Bible. What happens when we die? Is your religion the 'right' one? Does hell relly exist? Are there other worlds in the universe? These and many more questions are answered in Dr. Storms' riveting account. You won't put it down and then you'll read it again. A great gift to others on the search for truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot hot hot","review":"Breaking away from the pack of gay male erotica books, \\"Wired Hard 3\\" features a dozen steamy tales, all with fantasy and science fiction elements.

Michael Barnette gives us a high-tech hustler in \\"Zoner\\", while David MacMillan offers up the fantastic \\"Always\\" about the power of love. \\"Hidden Desires\\" by Chris Jones is steamy and intriguing sci fi, as is Jason Fortenbraugh's \\"You Can't See Me\\".

She likes to run ahead and then stop, which is really quite annoying if you don't have a retractable leash! And don't get me started on trying to run with her too! Geez, so this is just the most perfect leash! Makes my life and my dogs life so much easier. She can run ahead (23 feet still isn't enough for her sometimes but it has to do) and smell things etc, as I continue to walk to catch up, and then continue to pass her and usually just by the time I am almost 20 feet away she is done and she runs to catch up. And the cycle repeats. End result? She gets to stop and go and I get to have a smooth walk/run. The leash takes some getting used to and the switch at the top holds the leash at one length if you flip it up. I don't think I read the instructions so it took us a while to notice that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I've had this unit for about two years now and it's worked very well on my 20 pound Shiba Inu.

It worked great for the a month, then yesterday, as I was turning a corner, the cord caught on a post. It momentarily stopped my dog until I could unhook the cord from the post. The cord was fine, no cuts or abrasions at all, but the sudden stop must have knocked the cord off whatever mechanism's inside. Now it's very slow to recoil or stops recoiling completely. I have a 22 pound Pug that is well within the listed 26-pound limit, and the sudden \\"stop\\" wasn't so hard that it should break anything.So, I called Customer Service. The receptionist politely informed me that all leashes come with a one-year warranty and gave me the return address.Overall, I'm pretty disappointed.

This was important to my dog since he would feel little jerks from other leashes when they retracted. He thought the jerks were from me, asking him to stop. No problems like that with this leash!

I had it extended pretty far and my dog darted after a squirrel and the leash snapped. She ran into a nearby street and was hit by an SUV. She has permanent hip injuries that cost me more than 4k in vet bills. BE CAREFUL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly durable","review":"I've got a 60lb black lab puppy who can pretty excited, and this leash just takes it. It never ceases to amaze me how durable this leash is. I've had her take off at full speed and whether I lock the leash or she gets to the end of it, there is no crunching, grinding, or anything that sounds like it is cause damage, just a click or two and it stops her.I'm also impressed at how smooth the action on the reel is. It has a nice recoil and has never jammed or gotten tangled. It truly is a well-engineered product.26' also seems like the perfect size. Just enough room to let her get out and have her freedom, yet still light enough to take on runs. It has a nice handle and an overall nice design.Make sure you leave the leash extended when wet to dry and also be careful about the backlash like the book says, it's pretty spring-loaded. Overall a great product. Not a single complaint.Hope this was helpful.

I could not believe how heavy it was. At first, I was planning to buy a quickdraw to attach the leash and my pants so I wont have to hold it but this thing is pretty heavy so it'll pull my pants. My second thought was 'there's no way my dog can pull on this leash!'. The pull force is very strong and I have a small dog (Shih tzu). I wish they had listed somewhere in the product info the pull force or the minimum weight recommended. Compared to my previous leash, (by friends & family co) which was a joke to pull. The leash also came with an additional string with two round metals at the end, I still can't figure out what this is for...The product does feel solid and strong. Pushing the button to lock the leash is very natural and responsive.

I ordered the 23 ft leash, and I thought that's what I had gotten. I didn't even realize until a couple of months later that Amazon had sent me a shorter Flexi leash than what I ordered.

I ordered it, thinking it would give my dog more freedom to run a bit while we were on walks. When I received the item, I read the instructions and warnings on the package prior to opening it. The warnings talked about severed limbs, strangulation, and other bad things.Then I got to thinking that if we were on a street corner, and if I didn't have the leash in \\"lock\\" mode, and if my dog decided to run for something just as a car went by, then he could be run down by a car while on a leash!No thanks. I don't want to have to think about severed limbs, strangulation, or \\"do I have the leash locked at the proper times\\". I just want to walk my dog in peace.

It is so heavy my arm hurts after holding it for 3 minutes. True I am no bodybuilder and honestly I could not do a pull up to save my life. But my friend has a retractable leash that I have to trouble with at all, it feels like this one weighs about 5 times more.Also, if you try to leave the strap loose so the dog can run around, it has too much tension on it. Meaning, it is constantly pulling on my dog's neck, meaning he is constantly turning around trying to bite it instead of walking. Ok yes he is a puppy and needs more training (starting obedience school this weekend) but he walks just fine on his regular plain leash.Basically when I tried to use this it was the worst walk we ever had. The plain leash is better, the cheapo retractable my friend has is better, I think a rope would be better.I really want to return it but I'm sure the postage will be about half the price of the stupid thing, because it is so heavy.VERY disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!","review":"I have a 55 lb dog that ripped through this in less than 10 walks!

I would not recommend this product to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 3 months... useless.","review":"Bought this from Amazon 3 months ago. It was a fantastic price... 30-40% less than Petsmart. However I've only had it 3 months and the tape is frayed and about 10 millimeters from breaking. It is right up near where the tape attaches to the collar so it cannot be from chewing or rubbing up against anything. Amazon won't take it back so I have to buy a new one. Question is do I pay $40 at petsmart because they will take it back after 30 days or buy another one that only has a 30 day guarantee from Amazon? I am huge fan of Amazon but this return policy sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of the Worst","review":"I use this lead for my two big dogs (90lbs and 80lbs). I really hate the tape lead, and I miss the wire lead that Flexi used to sell in the 26' length. While the wire could definitely give you a burn if you were not careful, the tape leads do not last. The first 26' Flexi classic 3 wire lead I bought lasted for almost three years before it would not retract anymore and I had to replace it. I have to buy a tape lead every few months. The tape does not do well in the snow and rain. Anyway, all the other brands I have tried have been worse, so I am stuck using Flexi until I find a better alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is WAAAAY cheaper off Amazon!","review":"The 'Petstores' in our area charge about $50 for these leashes.... so, you're paying half that on Amazon for the same thing. I have 2 of these leashes, identical, one from Amazon & one from Petco. The one I got from Petco sometimes has some issues retracting, I think it gets twisted up & doesn't move as freely. Don't get these leashes wet (like, from snow or rain) or they get mildewy & gross smelling.The actual length of these leashes is 23 feet. I don't know whats going on cuz on the leash itself (both of them that I have) it says '16 feet'? & on the Title from Amazon it says 26 ft, & the product description says '23 feet'. So, FYI, this leash measures 23 feet long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Long Leash","review":"Leash works very well . I was looking for an extra long tape leash and this fits my needs.

On top of having Mary Steambergen, Jeff Goldbloom and Lance Henrickson who are all great, Sean Patrick Flanery (Powder) and Bradford Tatum (the school bully) play amazing characters.It's been said that this is a sad movie. This is a \\"glass half empty\\" way of looking at it. I felt that it showed (in multiple occasions) that in death, there is something else out there. There's no real end to life.

Powder is one of those personal treasures.The story is not new (see Forrest Gump, Being There and K-PAX). Take the \\"abnormal\\" personality that, without choice, maintains innocence into adulthood, insert it into a world of \\"normal\\" personalities, and watch the paradox unfold. What sets Powder apart from the others is the depth of emotions evoked from the talents of second tier actors (with the exception of Jeff Goldblum), especially Sean Patrick Flanery as the lead character, and the feeling that you have just witnessed the unbelievable transform into the believable. Isn't that what good movies do?Powder . . . one of the best I've seen in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powder hits all the right notes!","review":"Yeah, we've seen it all before.This time it is a man that is pale white, other times it's a fat kid with stupid glasses. But what makes this film so touching is that you feel for this character from the begining. It's kinda like you see this really hot girl. You fall in love with her looks, but then, after meeting her, you come to realize you love her. That's what it is like in this wonderfully made movie about fears, all of us fear, happening to one unique person. Wonderful! Great entertainment for all ages, and should be seen by all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Powder Review","review":"This movie,to me,was one of the greatest movies I've seen. I rated it a 5 star because the story is so amazing while heartbreaking. Some of the great \\"stunts\\" are just so mind-twisting to me that I stared in amazement while watching the movie. The true fact of him being an Albino in the movie just helps the person watching the movie look more closly at the unbelievable things he does. As my mom and I watched the movie we had to grab a box of tissues. I would recommend this movie to anyone because it shows how people act if you look different.In the movie,Jeremy,has to go to an orphanage.What he finds there are a lot of troubled people.The whole movie is based on this one guy,and what he does to change the people that are around him.I think that the story wants to help us,as humans,to try to accept people that may look different either by skin color or eye color or whatever.I am going to end this so Good-Bye.The End"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powder,The Greatest Movie Ever","review":"I am a teacher and I have seen this movie 8 times!

The story drags on and on and on until the end which also stunk. Over all the movie stunk but it did have a great message. The message is to not judge people on thier apperance and that nobody is, can, or ever will be normal.There, now after reading the message there is no point in watching the movie - lol.

This is an unusual movie in that I had no expectations going in and came out completely satisfied. A plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"HMMM....","review":"This is a cute picture about father and son rivalry that finally gets squashed by a game of soccer....Will Ferrell and Robert Duvall play father and son, who through the years cannot seem to get it together, Duvall's character (Bucky Weston) seems to find fault in everything that his son (Paul)does, and when the two have sons on the same day...it crosses over to the next generation!! Paul's son Sam plays on a soccer team that grandpa Buck coaches, only to be left as the bench warmer...then gets traded to the other team....by his own grandfather!When the other teams coach does not show up to a game, Paul takes over....watch the antics as the team with uncoordinated, goofy players run down the track to.....you figure it out!!Great movie about family and teamwork....:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicking and Screaming","review":"I really liked kicking and Screaming. I think it had a good message which was don't make the same mistakes others have. Its not your normal soccer movie where everyone on the team is good at soccer. Kicking and Screaming wasn't like that at all. No one on the team was really good at soccer that was what made it a really enjoyable movie. My favourite characters are Mark Avery and the two Italians. If the comedy wasn't there then it probably wouldn't be as enjoyable as it is!!Kicking and Screaming is by far my favourite movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of Will Will Like This Movie","review":"Like all of the other sports comedies about kids, this movie is up as one of the best. There were many moments in the movie that had me laughing out loud. The jokes are funny and are excellently executed by Will. Mike Ditka is also in this movie and he is surprisingly a pretty good actor. Duvall did well in his role as Ferrell's dad, but this isn't the kind of movie I would have expected him in. If you are a fan of Will Ferrell and his movies, then you will enjoy this film 100%. Everything fans like about him are still here in this movie, he is the current king of physical comedy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Hollywood Sillyville Show with Bad Acting and Writing","review":"I don't understand how so many people reviewing this found it funny. I've never found Will F. to be very funny and this did not help. Why the hell someone like Duvall signed up for this gets me too. Perhaps his grandchildren were promised a spot. None of the kids were funny either. Just a ridiculous script altogether. I was a soccer coach too so I thought I might see something in this. So bottom line is don't waste your time. ( I feel better now .)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a Broke bad news bears","review":"I only was curious about this Film because Mike Ditka was in it.but upon sitting up watching this Snorefest it didn't hold my attention for too long.Will Ferrell is like a Broke Jim Carey. He had some cool moments like in \\"Old school\\" but on a whole there ain't alot going on with His brand of Comedy that you ain't already seen or will tolerate before it becomes boring.this film never gets going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid from start to finish..Same old Will Ferell","review":"When will people learn that Will Ferell is just bad at acting and almost all his movies are bad except Elf which was one of the funniest x-mas movies ever. The story is really stupid and predictable. The jokes are old and Will Ferell's humor is old. The movie is more of a kids film then for adults. This movie has been done lots in hollywood for example Little Giants which was way better. Overall bad really bad thank god I seen the movie for free one of the worse of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watcher beware!","review":"(I would have put 0 stars but the website would not allow it) I typically love Will Farrell but was highly disappointed in this movie. Of all the trailers I have seen, not one mentioned the gay/lesbian content in this movie. I watched it with my children and found myself cringing when Will Farrell's character said that the lesbian soccer parents were \\"better\\" than the other soccer parents on the team! This is not the kind of entertainment I want to bring into my home. It may be suitable for some families but I find the studio's neglect to inform us of this same-sex relationship is a sneaky way to get this product into the homes of conservative parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicking and Screaming","review":"Family dysfunction plays out on the soccer field in this lively comedy. When family man Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) takes a job coaching his 10-year-old son's talented soccer team, he winds up going head to head with his ultra-competitive father, Buck (Robert Duvall), who coaches an opposing team. With the league championship at stake, father and son reignite old battles and go to hilarious extremes as they compete for the shiny trophy. Not one of Will Ferrell's best movie but it has humor. It's definitely worth watching. Soccer fans will appreciate it. lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point???","review":"About half of this movie was enjoyable, then it quickly went downhill. The first part was a family movie, and the second was like a Saturday Night Live skit. Robert Duval and Mike Ditka were wonderful as the neighbors from hell, and dad from Hell (Duval). There are a lot of lessons in this movie that you don't want your kids to learn, as well as some choice swearing by Ditka in the bonus feature section. Why?? Did they think the kids needed more vocabulary words? Thanks, but no thanks.I'm not a fan of Will Farrell, especially after wasting good money seeing Anchor Man at a movie theatre, but I wanted to like this movie. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"a few laughs but that's it...","review":"As parents who have coached soccer before and having a son currently on a team, we rented this one. Will Ferrell usually delivers. This movie had a few laughs in it but that's about it.To me a lot of it just seemed disjointed. The stuff with the coffee-obcession seemed a bit forced and out of place. We never got to know much about most of the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you people talkin about?","review":"Oh my god why would you give this movie a five star rating? This movie was horrible. I mean Will Farrell use to be funny back a few years ago and it looks like he tries hard to be funny. Old School is probably one of his best movies but the new movies like Elf, Bewitched, and Kicking and Screaming are bad. This movie almost looks like a rip off of Little Giants. Don't waste your time. It's not a funny movie at all. The jokes are lameless. I walked out of the theater in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The preview must have contained every minute of decent footage from this movie.

The movie was pretty lame and not funny otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and bring the whole family.","review":"I was originally worried that this movie would be a little \\"corny\\" for its PG rating. But, boy was I wrong! This film was funny from start to finish. Will Ferrell is equally talented at family humor and R-rated humor. For an actor to make me laugh that much at both is very acceptable in my book.But the real treasure of this film lies with Mike Ditka. Do not underestimate him! He is the funniest thing of the movie. Its like he's playing himself in real life by seeing the way he coaches the kids. I must say there is just something funny about guys yelling at kids. Great comedy for the start of the summer movie season!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kicking and Screaming...the whole movie!","review":"Unless you think it's funny to watch a grown man scream at little children for an entire movie, I wouldn't recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I started taking this a couple of years ago when my liver tests were getting high due to some perscrisptions I was on.

Still, sell by is not the same as use by, and all of that dating business is not required or regulated and doesn't mean that much. So I tried them. The first container was pretty tasty and the cashews were HUGE. Then a couple of the others had issues with the plastic \\"seal\\" underneath the snap-on lid. So I won't be buying these again, since the ones I could use ended up being as expensive as the ones I can get at the local store.

The variety of songs ranges from meltingly romantic to playful and flippant. My Italian is not very good but his diction is so perfect I feel like I understand every word. Bergonzi's big, athletic voice gives the illusion of being barely under control. But of course it is under complete contol, never bellowing. John Wustman's supple, slender accompaniment is perfect, each introduction whets the listener's appetite for the song, which he then gently frames and supports. He does get to shine on \\"La Daza\\".

His technique of Neapolitan singing is all his own. He sings with full passion and power that include fire striking high notes and fantastic phrasing. Tosti's \\"L'alba separa dalla luce lombra\\" is the best I have ever heard and that includes Di Stefano's & Carreras' versions. Only Pavarotti sings a better \\"Non ti scordar di me\\".

Performances are flawless, but what truly seduces you about the music is not its precision as much as its cohesive vibe, an overwhelming sense of passion and serenity that makes the Camilo/Tomatito collaboration outclass a lot of the jazz and world-beat discs you'll come across.

As the other reviewers have pointed out, the book glosses over any 911 made after 1977, and doesn't give any instruction on activities that the home mechanic might want to do, such as removing the airbox or changing the sparkplugs or filters. If you're serious about working on your 911, pony up the cash and buy the factory manuals. They're expensive, but worth the price you pay for them, especially if you factor in the money you're saving on labor costs.

The 1978 through 1989 (the SC and Carrera model) cars are given one chapter at the end, so apparently they wrote the book in 1978 and then just tried to update it with the later models.I guess it's true that you can't judge a book by it's cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I bought this book with the hope I could perform some of the maintainence on my 911. I was not familiar with the 911, but I had done many repairs on previous cars such as a tune up, replacing an alternator, starter, power steering pump, and master cylinder.

I was close to realize how wrong I was about that after 2 minutes of playing the game. The graphic detail of the game was lackluster and it just doesn't compare to any decent game of today. At first, I thought that perhaps it was the settings. After I changed the settings of the game, the detail was only slightly better. I was for sure it was not my video card or my computer (nVidia TNT2 Ultra card running on a Pentium III 450), I tried it on several of my floormates computers' in the hall. The same occurred on their computers. I took the game back the following week, very disappointed.

Even though my criticisms had mostly to do with the tempo of the piece, it left such a bad taste in my mouth that I had serious doubts when it came to Lenny playing piano. But then I came across this title, and because of Amazon's editorial review and its selection as an \\"essential recording,\\" I decided to get over myself and purchase this CD. Well, I couldn't have asked for a better performance of Mozart's 15th and 17th Piano Concertos than the ones L.B. has provided here.

The animation is okay if you compare it to cartoons from the 80's like He-Man and GI Joe, but terrible in comparison to the likes of Appleseed 2004 or Samurai X (which are more recently released titles, chronologically).If you like the comic and want to watch it, then I would recommend you rent this and invest your money on other more worthwhile titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One Hurt","review":"You might think I don't have a right to review this film, since I never finished watching it. But I spent nearly twenty dollars on this turd of a film, and I feel obligated to prevent others from wasting their valuable money.To start, it's published by ADV Films, which will throw you off since it's an American style animation done by a Korean studio. Now, I've seen some animation produced in Korea, and I can say that none of them looked this bad. Lady Death reminded me a lot of Thundercats (sorry Thundercats) in style, only in today's world that's unacceptable. The story, at least as far as I got into it, is about a young girl banished to hell by Lucifer where she gains strength and returns as the Lady of Death. Controversial, sure, but in a way that has already been done (remember Spawn).I'd recommend anything else over this. If you truly want something animated, buy the Spawn series that started on HBO, or get Thundercats, which are available now on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady D @ Sc-Fi London 2005 : Boo=Hoo","review":"Despite being plugged by the ADV top man, this lame excuse for an anime draw wave upon wave of derision at today's anime all-nighter at the Sci-Fi London Festival 2005.

The animation is terrible, and the voice acting is craptastic. When the devil is speaking you cant even hear what he is saying. The audio on his voice is way lower then the rest of the cast.

I am not very fussy with animation as I am a big fan of the genre but I highly doubt this will remain in my collection. The cover art is soooooo good you just can't wait to get home and watch it but the animation is actually very poor (for a motion picture) and lacks that detail and shading you enjoy in most anime's. It is of the quality of your saturday morning cartoons (I have seen some with better). I also found a lot of the action sequences very repetitive. The story moves too fast and you feel no connection with any of the characters introduced. This is a real shame as I can see potential in these characters.In regard to the dvd the sound and picture quality are fine and it has a couple of extra's.In conclusion don't waste your money unless it's super cheap!!

Based on the comic by Brian Pulido (who co-wrote the script), the film centers on the daughter of a Swedish warlord--actually Lucifer in disguise--who challenges her father after taking the rap for his rampage on Earth. One of the movie's selling points (besides the obvious) is the solid plot that it could've had. But Lady Death spends so much time sword-sparring, sleeping, and dragging around severed heads, that it makes her hour-and-a-half run feel much longer. Add to that the stiff animation and endless bloodshed and by the film's climax, you just stop caring. It feels like you've lost years of your life, and that's how I'll remember this.This film contains graphic violence and is recommended for mature audiences only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploring Office 2007","review":"I received the wrong product from the customer.

I've read it so many times the pages are dog-eared, the cover is grubby but it is still the first novel I reach for when I have the flu/stomach ache/blues to make me feel better.

It's basically Sam Bush talking about whatever comes into his head and a lot of time is wasted with just talking and not teaching.

Bernstein's hot and energetic performance was completely magnificent all from the beginning ominous brass theme to the final stroke of the strings. And teh solo violin done by John Corigliano Sr. was absolutely beautiful. If only there wasn't this single BIG error (even a non-musician can feel something is wrong); one crash on the cymbal was really out of timing during the shipwreck scene at the fourth movement. This single \\"Oops!\\" really killed the perfection Bernstein and the listeners could have fully appreciated! (Sob...)If you want a really good AND perfectly played recording, tough luck finding it.

And I REALLY wanted to like this book, as I think of myself as a fan of pulp sci-fi... But this was just SO bad I couldnt find anything redeeming about it. The science was of course badly dated, and embellished badly, even for the time it was written in. The fiction was wooden and uninteresting. The dialogue was so over wrought with gitchy dated phrasing as to make you reread some parts to figure WTF he was talking about. OH! And I think I got my fill of \\"All X\\" (or some minor variant) by page 50, but it didnt keep it from showing up 3 times a page till the end.

I've heard from other officers that this book was nonsense, but I approached the book with an open mind and read it anyways.It was a very tough read for me, because it was just a bunch of war stories about the author telling the reader how awesome he is.There are a lot of good things in the book that I agreed with. However these practices have been done in law enforcement before Jack Maple was even a police officer, and he steals the credit for these accomplishments.Because this is the latest trend in law enforcement, every politician and police administrator must have this book.

I hesitate to say more, because I don't want to give anything away. Suffice it to say that we learn more about the Masked Fighter, good triumphs enough to make it to Round Three, and evil is punished.As the Dark Tournament progresses, Yusuke's team is suffering an increasing number of injuries, and is getting worn down. There are at least six more episodes of Dark Tournament after this DVD, so there should be some challenging fights ahead. In this way, this DVD is exactly like every other YYH release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda fun","review":"This game is not really fun. The movies that you make are kinda like slide shows.

It rarely works, the scences stop, it locks up, the charecters go all weird - plus you certainly cannont make anything close to a sensible movie with this. You can't make the settings move, do cloeups, make charecters talk, or add any drama or action to your film. You can't make the charecters move in any way other than walking.

I have a few older Austin videos that I enjoy, so don't think that I'm opposed to using those. I'm not. I found myself getting very impatient with Denise, as the warm-up seemed to drag on, and the stretches were very dated. More current videos seem to be so much more effective. The workout itself is longer than many of her tapes, but again, it didn't impress me as being very motivating. I do like her 30 Minute Fat Burning workout(1989), and the Fit and Fat Free(1991) tapes.

Stitt's sound is glorious, especially on a memorable version of \\"Confirmation\\" and a stirring resurrection of the only ballad that most of the original beboppers knew: \\"Lover Man.\\"The session was made by Swedes on their Sonet label (they also came to the rescue with some fine Art Blakey in the 70s).

It's a rambling, not-very-sensible mystery and oddly written in some parts. The Holmes-themed party occurs early on and is not really that important. And I never did figure out all that rigamarole about the Hound. Not recommended for general mystery lovers or those who enjoy a Mrs. Bradley story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction into Cultural Studies","review":"For some time now, Douglas Kellner has been arguing for the importance of media and culture in today's politics. This book is a great introduction for students into why he has placed such an emphasis on this issue. Kellner pulls together Marxism, postmodern theory, and British Cultural Studies in conrete analyses of media culture. The downside to this book is that the objects it analyzes are a bit dated now, but nonetheless theoretically relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent material","review":"After going through 5 courses in Brazilian Portuguese: Portuguese in 10 minutes a day, Pimsleur, Rosetta Stone, Manuela Cook and this, I consider this a fine addition to the long slog to acquire the language. It is well produced and entertaining. However, if you are short of cash and a complete beginner, I'd go for Portuguese in 10 minutes a day. It is a lot cheaper and also fun. The Semantica course is expensive on Amazon and can be bought from the Semantica website for $50 less (if you have a Paypal account or your visa card is verified by Paypal. I have a Paypal account but security on that system is so tight, it shuts me out of my own account. That's why I bought from Amazon at the much higher price.)I still consider the Pimsleur 90-lesson Portuguese course to be the best. I would still recommend that over the Semantica or any other course mentioned above. Pimsleur, however, is very expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Learning Tool!","review":"I've been working in Brasil for 3 months now & have been listening to Pimsleur's Phase 1 & 2 audio courses (very good.)I've also been using the book \\"Portuguese in 10 Minutes a Day (also very good.)The videos in this package are a fantastic adjunct to the materials I've been using.I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to learn Brasilian Portuguese!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good budget hookah.","review":"It is great for what you pay for it.

As such they are far from disappointing. As what is left of Dai Kaio in the good buu faces off against the raw madness of Bibidis original creation, Vegeta uses his tactical expertise to both revive the earth and its inhabitants. Now it is left in the hands of humans to save themselves. Quite harrowing when most people would rather get icecream and watch movies instead. Meanwhile good buu gets pretty beaten up. Goku realizes that SS3 is a little harder when you actually have a body so of course lets build a spirit bomb. Kid Buu saga marks the final form of the last nemesis in Dragon Ball Z.

In so doing, it provides an interesting glimpse at the lives of the people, the economy, and the Punic and Roman ruins that dot the landscape (Carthage among others). It's a pleasant program, intelligently narrated.There are two problems with the video: (1) it begins with an unattractive couple singing a folk song about railroads (Hit Fast Forward as soon as it comes on), and (2) the DVD itself is poorly produced, so that the controls on your player may not work (including Fast Forward).If you're thinking about taking a beach vacation in the country (Its beaches are very popular with Europeans, similar to Cancun with American), look elsewhere.

HE was great, story a little flawed.","review":"I LOVED this book! I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't! Sure, it has flaws, and yes, Brenna should have been ashamed for complaining about her looks when in fact in real life, she'd probably outshine most women. I don't think she was unhappy with herself at all, she just needed someone to confirm she was perfectly shaped, and whined doing it. This gal's got ego problems. She knows she looks great, but needs others to confirm it.Now, Connor was great. Handsome, witty, and an all around great warrior.I thought the prologue boring, and if they'd chased that pig a second longer, I'd have thrown the book out the window! Overall, the story was very good, in true Garwood fashion. Brenna and Connor's love story is a 5 star, but with that prologue, it loses a star. Is it just me, or are all JG's prologues too long and boring?Alec & Jamie were great in this. Alec and his daughter Grace nearly stole the show, though. This book is certainly well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming.....kept me up till the wee hours...","review":"This was really a delightful book...I adored Brenna...she was so much fun, and the sparks were flying off the page when she and Connor were together!! It was also nice to see Alec and Jamie back from \\" The Bride\\". I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

That may not seem like a great feat, but I'm working full time with a 3 month old baby! Conner and Brenna are both strong, multi-dimensional characters.

I thought the part when she was little was [bad] because it had no relevance anywhere else in the story. It read as if she was forced to put it in there. And I did NOT like the going on and on about the piglet she was trying to catch.The rest of the story though?? A TREASURE. It was a great sequel to The Bride. But then, I didn't like the part where she kept on trying to suck up to the stepmom. It was a bit excessive and I was surprised that she never spoke up, since J.G.'s heroines are usually very outspoken. And I thought Connor should have taken care of his stepbrother. I really wanted [him] suffer...Need I say more? Go read it now. And I really hope J.G. gives us a book about Quinlan and Faith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I loved this book.

She was supposed to be so smart but I had to keep reminding myself how old she was. How boring.The story had a decent plot with the villain (Rein) ...

When she turned sixteen, Brenna is sent to Scotland to marry MacNare, the same man who killed Conner's father. Conner decides to kill two birds with one stone. He would kidnap Brenna and marry her, thereby rescuing her and getting one over on MacNare. Although, this was a good story and seeing Jamie and Alec again were nice, I wished that Conner and Brenna had more going on between them. There was a lot of separation with these two characters. Also, Brenna did have some good qualities and was portrayed a innocent, but she often came off as a \\"ditz.\\" Not quite up to par with some of Garwood's other books, this story still managed a 4-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"CDs are a rip off!!","review":"I live in europe and wanted to continue to improve my German.

No hints on pronunciation, no cultural advice, no music, no enthusiasm, *nothing* except these two voices.

Interestingly it has just been shown this week on the Australian free to air ABC2 digital channel. The quality was obviously of a DVD standard, so even though it is still listed as unavailable, at least one broadcaster has it! The content was very basic, with no introduction or commentary...just the Rock Masters logo, three brief clips from the concert, and then the concert itself. The vision was excellent, although in 4:3 as you would expect in a 1977 TV production.

(Well, I can't, for one. But I know it's there!)One of the best things about the MST series was its unrelentingly positive worldview. Even in the midst of cheap and obvious movies like this one, M&TB riff their little hearts out and come out winners.

The best lines that Mike & the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says. Unfortunately, the feature's horrible pacing, slow dialogue scenes, and atrocious acting are not enough, and it seems like the writers took a break on this one. Of course, even weak MST3K is better than pretty much any other show, but I must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season 5 and at times feels like a Season 1 episode (the riffing is sparse and not really funny).

The package came from Target; it looked worn and beaten as though it had been moved around quite a bit. It also didn't seem to have the type of packing that Amazon uses. I'm going to buy a lamp now off the shelf at a store where I can inspect it before I buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One funny book","review":"I've recommended this book to my friends for decades as a comic history, in fictional form, of a tragic episode in American Hisstory.

Terrible Transfer","review":"I love Roy Orbison. This show sounded very good. However, Image Entertainment didn't properly transfer this video. Often times, you see color separation in the video and it looks very primative. Yes, it is a very old video but New West Records has done a much better with Austin City Limits transfers delivering superior sound and picture quality. It looks like Image Entertainment didn't work on this dvd at all. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"Ordinarily it would have been a pleasure to watch and listen to this release. But having just watched 'Black & White Night' this newly purchased DVD 'Live at Austin City Limits' is a big let down.

This album is going to the garage sale.Save your $ and buy 'Black & White Night'-it's as good as 'Live at Austin City Limits' is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Foundational Video","review":"This video does a great job of explaining the basis of perspective drawing. Mr. Robertson starts with simple 1, 2 and 3 point perspective and systematically walks us through mapping out a perspective grid in space.

No, that's not very interesting.","review":"Don't let the quirky title of this trivia book fool you. This is not a very interesting read. Typically, I find that the most interesting trivia books are the ones that either ask really off the wall questions or those that have some kind of game component to it. This book tries to be the former and fails quite miserably at it. Practically none of the questions are all that quirky or funny, nor does Mr. McLain's writing make the answers interesting or funny. This is a book of straight up useless information. Not only that, but having been written 10 years ago, this book also has many inaccuracies (ex. the Titanic was sunk by a 200 foot gash in the hull rather than the currently accepted \\"morse code\\" hull punctures). Still, there are some interesting nuggets of information that you can throw around at your local cocktail party.

So his research is sloppy. \\"Do Fish Drink Water\\" is a collection of miscellaneous facts, which was once a popular type of reference book.

Make Your Mama Proud really goes back to the roots of the band and although some songs may not strike your fancy, overall it comes together as one BEAUTIFUL work of art! Yes, this is more punkish than their other albums, and yes there is a little foul language. However, I am not a very \\"punkish\\" person and I still think that this is one of their best cds. Buy it! It's worth it! What's not to like?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic","review":"Different from their second album, which offers catchy guitar-driven pop and a greater variety of sounds. This album is more one-dimensional, raw, and straight-forward (with the exception of \\"Fallout\\" which is the only song that sounds as though it belongs on All the Pain Money Can Buy). At the same time, this album is still catchy and memorable in its own right. The songs here offer driving beats that end only two soon and the two lead singers switching off for many of the songs does lend some additional sense of depth and creativity. A few of the knock-out tunes on here are \\"Human Torch\\", \\"Make Your Mama Proud\\", and, quite possibly the best (and the shortest) piece on the album, \\"Nothing\\". All in all a worthwhile purchase for hardcore Fastball fans or for punk-oriented fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"There are a lot of interesting songs. They all have good rhythms and beats, but the CD is way to short. It's barely 35 minutes long. But \\"Are you Ready For the Fallout\\" and \\"Nothing\\" make up for it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud, Catchy, But Lacking In Depth","review":"'Make Your Mama Proud' is fast, loud, and at times downright addictive. This album is far from being a let down, but at the same time you kind of feel like Fastball has more to offer than this. It's nothing less than expectation, yet on some tracks nothing more either. Don't get me wrong, songs such as \\"Nothing\\", \\"Emily\\", and \\"Telephone Calls\\" will crawl inside your brain and have you humming it all night long, the album does not lack that finger snappin' feel. However, there is a lack of depth. Hooks along with decent songwriting about life in the slow lane are about all the album has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, bad CD","review":"After \\"all the pain\\" I tried this one.

And why were other songs like \\"Under Pressure\\" and \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" chopped up as well? The other problem I have with this collection is that it's missing \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" and \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" (the only thing that Hollywood did right was include them on \\"Classic Queen\\").Putting those two things aside, I would recommend anyone who wants to get into Queen's music to start with this 2 CD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing - simply the best.","review":"If your looking to purchase your first Queen cd or are a Queen lover without this set, this is MUST.

The first one I tried making was the chicken kebabs which came out tasteless. I love Afghani rice, it is so flavorful so I tried the basic pilau recipe which came out bland and undercooked even though I followed the directions exactly. I am not encouraged to try out the other recipes after such terrible results. I don't think the author has really tested these recipes to make sure the measurements and instructions will produce the intended results. There are no pictures and the format of the book is bound more like a novel than a cookbook making it hard to refer to while cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Afghan food, minus spices.","review":"Why on earth would you write an Afghan cookbook and leave out the spices?

I've tried only a few of the hundreds of recipes in it so far, but its inspiring presence on my tabletop brings a sense of excitement to each of my weekends, when I will venture to try yet another one of Sabri's culinary treasures.

The four Tommy Dorsey tracks include two from the horrible 1947 movie \\"The Fabulous Dorsey's\\" and the other two are from the 1950's TV show that brought the Dorsey brothers together. The remaining 14 tracks are of a strange assortment of other performers that range from awful to just OK. The producers do not do their homework. The liner notes are unreliable. In one case Helen Forrest is listed on an Artie Shaw track - but she's nowhere to be seen. Another track lists Bob Eberly as his brother Ray.

Lots of cool vintage footage too, which I really like to see. And good interviews with current builders and restorers of wooden powerboats. A good mix of the old and the new, but all focused on wood. My only complaint, and the reason I don't give four stars, is that this film is way too short. I would like to see at least an hour, preferably more. The filmakers barely touched the surface. What they did is nice to look at, but there's a world of wealth waiting beyond this. If you're into this kind of thing, this video is one of the only ones of its kind. So you might as well get it.

The set was fine. The acting passable (except for the little kid who was obviously NOT an actor!). The dialog, stiff. The story... was actually good. So, in spite of the awful music, the slow moving plot, some of the bad acting and stiff dialog, I'm glad I watched it all the way to the end. I liked the message.

BUT I have dropped one of them twice and it is now beyond repair and headed for the recycle bin.The bottle doesn't stand up when you set it on a flat surface because the trough is rounded on the end. The belt clip is useless, which is why it dropped on the floor the second time for its final break. (the first time was just my own clumsiness) The plastic of the trough is SO weak, it broke after a drop onto a wood floor from waist-height.I agree - rubberized plastic, or the stuff nalgenes are made of would be the answer to the breaking issue. From now on, I'll just make sure I have a Porta-Bowl clipped to a Nalgene - it holds a lot more anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRODUCT NOT AS SHOWN","review":"If you're thinking about ordering this item, be aware that the description notes \\"Colors may vary.\\" I overlooked that, so I expected to receive the cute pink water dispenser that's shown, but instead, I got an ugly blue one.

I carry it in my car and take it on long walks. It is so easy to give my pet water - no more wet palms. I have not found it to leak at all, but you do need to remember to dump out any remaining water in the trough when they are done drinking. Since I have a small dog, I wish they had it in a smaller size. Also, when I hook it to my jeans the trough opens when I walk but this can be fixed with a rubber band.

They drink from the plastic trough like they normally would a bowl and I squeeze the bottle to speed the water going into the trough, as they drink quickly. I keep the second in the car in a small cooler for them to cool down when the hike ius over. This is the best way I have found to keep the 3 of them hydrated in warm or any temperature, for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gulpy's are the best!","review":"We walk our two black and tan coonhounds everyday at an off leash dog park. Being hounds they do alot more bunny hunting and chasing fox etc. than actual walking. At the end of an hour they are tired and thirsty! When they meet up with us they drain the Gulpy's. I have two! Then they walk to the parking lot where there is a community dog bowl (with holes in the bottom for draining) and a faucet for fresh well water. They have another big drink and are ready for the ride home. I have seen other types of dog bottles at the park and none are as big or well made.

I used to have to unscrew a jug of water and pour it into a bowl for him. This water bottle is very cool. Just flip down the flange and squeeze the bottle, and presto, a little bowl of water for him.

I had previously been using a small plastic bowl and my own water but decided to try something a little easier to carry and where I would be able to save the unused water.This product was definitely easier to carry, but that was about the only criteria it met. The drinking vessel is quite narrow, even for my small dog and the plastic is quite flimsy. The bottle itself is not much better. The bottle is not 100% leak-proof, so be sure to avoid leaving it on its side or turning it upside-down. There is also no way to return the unused water back into the bottle so some will inevitably go to waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and useful","review":"I love the Gulpy. It's easy to use, and my dog took to it with no instruction necessary. Rarely leaks if you make sure to screw it tightly. If you have a small dog, you might consider getting the smaller size, because it is easier to throw in a bag (I wish I'd done this).

It's called hearsay and this book is filled with it. He also has a romanticized version of the US justice system. Perhaps he needs to spend more time with the relatives of those who go missing every day in the US and are never found and see if they think the US system is any better. All throughout the book, he constantly refers to the sex slave trade and how prolific it is, yet he cannot name one name of one other person that has disappeared from Aruba.

Seventy-Five days, Dave searched for Natalee regardless of how undaunting the task. He searched through garbage in the heat and stench looking to return his daughter's remains to America.How sick that Aruba would now bring people here to write false reviews of his book just to be ugly and hateful.Parents and anyone traveling abroad needs to read this book and understand that countries such as Aruba care about your dollars, not investigating a crime committed against you.

I bought the book with the hopes that a\\" portion of the proceeds will go to the Natalee Holloway foundation for missing persons\\" but as of yet I can find no specifics that such a foundation exists. Save your money until a book with credible references is available.

The tragedy of losing a child is indeed a difficult one. However Dave & Beth are not the first, nor the last to lose a child. The book only rehashed the same things we have heard on Cable news over and over for the past 10 months. Corruption with no real proof of what was or who was corrupt. Now with a new arrest it appears the only thing that ruined this investigation were Natalees parents, but applying tunnel vision and not looking at other suspects.I hope every parent uses this book when deciding whether or not to send their child to another country on an all inclusive trip. Remember, youre buying a trip that allows them to do the things we tell them not to at home. Poor Natalee, seems to have been another ever so tragic teen loss to drug and alcohol abuse, along with bad decision making skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"LXReview","review":"I was severly disappointed in this book.

This loving book allows the reader to see Natalee as she was right up to the day she left for the anticipated graduation trip to Aruba. It then allows us to witness the heartbreaking events that have puzzled many and deceived many more. This family's ability to survive the tragic events is shown in the book to be due to their faith in God, the support of the friends that they had before Natalee was taken from them, the support of millions of people around the world whose hearts were touched by Natalee's story, and by Internet friends who have bonded through chat rooms, discussion forums, and prayer chains. Even if you were not intrigued by this ongoing story before, just read the first paragraph, and you, too, will find yourself praying nightly \\"God, please bless Natalee, her friends, and family and let this be the day she is discovered and Justice is served. Amen.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"This book will tug at your emotions and take you from outrage to tears. If you've been a casual viewer of the news coverage around Natalee Holloway's disappearance, you have only the preface to a travisty. The more serious follower of the case will learn that there's far more to the story than what has been reported. Dave Holloway's humble character permeates each page and perhaps for the first time, the reader meets Natalee. I finished the book with a deep appreciation for living in a country where crime and corruption unfortunatly exist, but no one is above the values we hold dear, not even our President. This should be required reading for anyone considering travel to Aruba, and a guide for alternate plans. Substantial proceeds from the book go for a fund to help find missing persons abroad. A real page turner, and a tragic reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"I read this over the weekend. There is nothing new here nor is it particularly well written. It's basically the same thing I've heard over and over again on FOX News Channel and such. Lots of speculation and precious little new info. A picture of Natalee being a near saint is painted for the reader. Sorry to say this but many times the parents are the last to know the truth of what their children may be into. No one deserves what happened to this young lady and her family but, that being said, there are many, many cases in the States that should have this much attention focused on them too. I hope the money made from the sale of this book are being given to non-profits that help find missing children or something similiar. I certainly hope that Mr. Holloway is not keeping any of the profits for personal gain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little miss I'm NOT an angel","review":"This book doesn't give one specific theory about what happened.

I found that the so-called facts that he presented were 100% inaccurate.He was inconsistent with many of the details. There isn't any basis for many of the claims he made. He states that he doesn't know what happened to Natalee, or if she is alive or dead, but then contradicts himself by saying that Joran harmed her in some way. Just as he and Natalee's mother and stepfather have done in the numerous interviews that they have given. They can't seem to tell the same story twice.

Don't let that scare you.This is a tale of heroism based on nothing more and nothing less than faith in God.It has led me to have questions of the Church of Thyatira in Revelation 2:18. The church is described as suffering Jezebel, the Queen who used charges of blasphemy to steal lands for her husband King Ahab in 1 Kings 21.

At times this becomes maddening. You are not going to understand a good part of this book unless you read both English and French very well.The stories are fairly interesting.

If these reviews were here before I bought the book quite a number of months ago, I would not have gotten it. It is indeed a rehash of Solaris 9 ideas. It would have been very helpful if there was some discussion on how to control your own inet connections by modifying an XML template -- but alas there is no mention of this in the book.

Very disppointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful...","review":"This is the first time I've ever been motivated to write a bad review. But this book is just awful for Solaris 10. It's not a book on Solaris 10, it's a book on old Solaris. You'd be better off Googling your version 10 issues than reading this book. It will steer you off in the wrong direction.

It still refers to /etc/init.d/ scripts (some are still there but most, such as the various nfs and automount services are not).This isn't a linux or general unix book - the book has 'SOLARIS' on the cover and should reflect Solaris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's SMF?","review":"I bought this book because it was the most appropriate book on Solaris 10 that I could find at the bookstore. I am a long time Solaris system administrator, but I wanted a book that specifically talked about the new features of Solaris 10.I didn't know about SMF when I bought the book, but it's a pretty important feature that replaced previous methods of system management in Solaris. I just can't believe that this book does not even mention it. I see other people have complained about the same thing.I also noticed that the book did not give a good overview of the installation. I had to go online to look up anything I didn't know about in regards to the install since the book just didn't discuss it.I gave this book a two star rating because it's an okay general Solaris reference book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you want to learn 5.10","review":"No solaris 5.10 stuff.

Here's one good example: Solaris 10introduces a completely new administration tool for administeringinetd. This book is a reprint of the old methods from Solaris2.6/7/8/9. It's completely worthless.

It is bad enough that the book is simply the old Solaris 8/9 book with a Solaris 10 cover. What makes it worse is that in many cases it cannot (should not) be used to administer Solaris 10. The information is wrong! /etc/rc.2d startup scripts are no longer used. The book discusses /etc/inetd.conf but it is no longer used. Nothing is mentioned about the new Solaris 10 features, especially the ones all system admins MUST know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even 1 star","review":"Why does a book on Solaris 10 need to cover the history of Unix, BSD origins, the shell, the kernel, USENET, mailing list, etc ... useless!

Rather, it introduces Solaris 7-9 to a novice Unix user with only a few references to Solaris 10 features. And even on those few Solaris 10 items, there are not enough examples or configuration ideas. Based on the paucity of relevant information, one could not even use this book to determine if an upgrade to Solaris 10 is warranted.The purchase of this book was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The other reviews pretty much hit it. This book sucks. Lots of pages are wasted on networking concepts and things like Zones, D-Trace and SMF are never talked about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty poor","review":"There is basically nothing on the new Solaris 10 features. There's nothing on Service Management Facility, basically nothing on zones, no ZFS, and nothing usable about containers, just to start the list.It's also a bit dated. How dated? Check out this sentence on page 9: \\"In recent years, a number of threats have emerged to the market dominance of UNIX systems: Microsoft's enterprise computing products and frameworks...\\" Microsoft is an emerging threat???

It goes into no detail whatsoever on the new Solaris 10 features... ZFS, SMF, Partitioning, etc... Newcomers to solaris who read this book would have no idea about milestones, smf, etc, and would assume Solaris 10 still uses just the RC scripts to boot.From the binding: \\"Includes FULL DETAILS on all the new features\\"... this is completely FALSE!I'm thoroughly disappointed with this book, especially considering the author's previous releases..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! The only book in town (literally)...","review":"I would give this book 5 stars because it is the only book which has consistently covered Solaris throughout its previous releases. This book gives a very sold introduction to all of the Solaris core topics like networking, security (VERY EXTENSIVE COVERAGE), process models and so forth. It avoids the current marketing hype over Sun's \\"pretend\\" grid technology (the Solaris \\"grid\\" is NOT the same as Globus). Keep up the good work to the author I say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Solaris 10","review":"I fully agree with the other reviews. This book doesn't cover Solaris 10. I also noticed the lack of coverage of SMF along with a lot of other legacy coverage that has changed in Solaris 10. I even tried to email the author about some of my concerns, but the email address given in the book wouldn't accept emails. I then emailed McGraw-Hill and they emailed me back stating that I really needed to send a hand written letter to the author. So, instead, I will write this review warning any potential buyers of this book to go elsewhere. McGraw-Hill and the author should be sued over this book, as it is false advertisement and fails to address Solaris 10, which in my mind shows both the publisher and the author failed to put any effort whatsoever into this book and just wanted to make a quick buck. It is extremely obvious neither has touched Solaris 10!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This book is by no means \\"The Complete Reference\\" for Solaris 10, it is barely a guide to administration. It looks like they threw in a few changes for 10 but didn't even review to find out what went away or changed. The clue was in the very beginning when it still used a 'df -k' instead of the 'df -h' that was part of Solaris 9. Then it reference old hardware. Skipping to the networking, it referenced inetd.conf which is no longer directly used to configure inetd. This book is terrible. I am glad I used a coupon that covered most of the cost of this book. I can not and will not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much detail on Solaris 10","review":"While this book was a good review of Solaris, it was NOT specific enough at all with regard to administering Solaris 10. I bought this book because it was the only one available to prepare for a Solaris 10 System Admin (beta exam). I found much more useful information from the SUN website. See for yourself. Use the \\"search in this book\\" feature on this webpage. Type in \\"zoneadm\\" or \\"zonecfg\\". These are two commands used to congfigure zones in Solaris 10. One of the trumpeted new features of this version, yet the book says NOTHING about this. Amazon also messed up my credit order, I was supposed to get $30.00 credit on the order and that never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solaris or Unix in general CR?","review":"If gentle reader is looking for a generalised book on Unix with a slant towards Solaris 10, then this is okay. If however, you are looking for something more specific this would not be a good choice.It reads as more of an overview with some technical points rather than a complete reference. That is an overview that does not cover any of the new features of Solaris 10 as previously stated by another."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"If you're a UNIX newbie interested in learning the basics about Solaris & UNIX in general (not Solaris 10 specifically), then you might learn something from this book. But, there are tens of other books that are more informative and better written than this one.If you're already familiar with Solaris and want to learn about the new features in Solaris 10, don't expect this book to tell you much about them. This book should have been called something like 'Solaris 8: Third Edition'. This book is obviously a rehashed update of a previous book.In short, I'd wait for more Solaris 10 books to hit the shelves before breaking-down and buying this book as I did...I should have read the reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really for solaris 10?","review":"Solaris 10 has new features like dtrace,svcadm,zones but none of this is covered in the book??

The excitement of having \\"Playin To Win\\" on CD quickly vanished upon listening to it.

Papmers and Luvs are one the same brand - P&G (Procter and Gamble) so of course they will be worth nothing :)!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These diapers are horrible!!!","review":"These are the worst diapers ever! Did you know the ingredients in these diapers are unsafe? They are not even allowed to put the same ingredients in maxi-pads, so why would you want that on your baby's sensative skin? PLEASE, if you must use disposable diapers, do your research. Do not put your childs welfare at risk for a 'name' brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE VERY BEST DIAPERS","review":"These are the best diapers ever. They are soft, smell good; and have flexible stretchy sides, plus no leaks. They are also not bulky, but slim-fitting. They just seem much more comfortable than the other Huggies and Luvs we tried. I wish they only went above Size 2. I have a big baby, and outgrowing the Swaddlers was very disappointing. However, if you're looking for the next best thing, I recommend the Pampers Cruisers in Size 3. Even though my baby isn't crawling yet, these diapers are very similar to the Swaddlers and fit well. They have the soft/stretchy sides like the Swaddlers. We did not like the regular Pampers as they didn't have the stretchy sides and seemed bulkier. For your Newborn, there's no subsitute for the Swaddlers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swaddlers are the best for new borns","review":"We loved these swaddlers when my little one was a newborn and infant. The overlapping really helped keep things in and not all over the place. They were also more obsorbant and softer then the cheaper brands and other major brands. I highly recommend the swaddlers. Pampers also has a great promotional points program now. We used the swaddlers until we couldn't get them in her size anymore. Love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"we love this !!!","review":"compared to huggies. the strechable part is wonderful !!!!no leaks at all. the only question is why amazon's price is $2 more than target's down the street ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Again, No U-shape Cut","review":"When we ordered the swaddlers there was a picture clearly showed the cut. On the second day, the order was back-ordered. Then we got swaddlers without cut. Of course, now there is no picture shown on the website anymore. What makes it even worse is that they somehow was able to put a packing slip to Switzerland into my box.I have to return the order.The price is really competitive at 7.49 though."},{"rating":"1","title":"not our favorite","review":"We used these when we first brought our baby home from the hospital, and they just never fit her right! She was 9lbs when she was born, and the diapers just never fit her legs well. We switched to huggies and haven't looked back. They work much better and don't have that weird smell the pampers have."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO UMBILICAL CORD CUT-OUT! ADVERTISEMENT LIED!","review":"I was extremely upset when I received the package and their was no cut-out. I specifically baught these diapers because the ad said they were. Horrible experience with amazon! For all of those who are looking for the umbilical cord cut-out do not buy from amazon, for they do not have any! Their advertisement is not up to date!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks, leaks, leaks","review":"I can't believe Pampers are selling these diapers for our tinest consumers and put them through misery, Pampers should have withdrawn it from the market. I bought these diapers for my newborn son and now I'm so sorry for him. The diaper leaks through his back and every time I change him, I have to change his clothes, his blanket and his sheet. I have to buy Huggies and they seem to be doing a better job in keeping my son dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only diaper that fit my newborn...","review":"I didn't expect my daughter to be so small when she was born. She was 6lbs 3oz and was tiny! We had to buy preemie clothes for her because nothing else fit.. especially diapers. I loved these, they wrapped around her perfectly and came up higher in the back, never had a problem with them leaking EVER and she was breastfed in the beginning. She's now gone through the size 1's and are about to start the size 2. I am just sad that they don't make them past size 2. Great diapers. Love the stretchy sides too. I didn't find the problem with folding them down for the umbilical cord either- it falls off so quickly anyway, what's the big deal? And I REALLY love the cloth-like feeling. I hate hate hate \\"papery\\" diapers. Really wish they made them to a much bigger size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Diapers for Newborns","review":"We love Pampers diapers and are using them now because of their superior absorbancy, but I have to tell you that when our two children were newborns that the Pampers Size \\"N\\" did not fit them very well. My daughter was on the tubby side while my son was on the skinny side and neither was serviced well by these diapers.It was not so much a poopy problem for us, but a leak at night time problem which, lets face it, is no fun.My advice is to try Huggies first for your newborn, and to use Pampers for every size 1 and above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly diapers","review":"I'm not sure if it's just my son but whenever we use these dipers he smells bad, like chemicals. We don't have the problem with any other dipers. But at the same time We never had a problem with the swaddlers leaking"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky, leaky, leaky","review":"We bought in bulk...BIG MISTAKE. These diapers leaked from day one and our baby was well within the size/weight range. About every other day there is at least one or two bowel movements that this diaper just does not hold in... Baby is soiled up the back, on the legs and sides, never to mind the ruined clothes, etc. We are very disappointed with these and considering they are the most expensive ones out there, it is really displeasing. We have since used Huggies, Luvs and even the Babies R Us/Toys R Us store brand (at $5.99 on sale for a 40 pack compared to the $11 plus for the pampers) with excellent results-- I mean it - no leaks at all with the other diapers. What a shame that these pampers really stink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry that transcends time and culture","review":"The translation appears highly contemporized but the beauty of the sentiment comes through.

To my knowledge, the rest of the episodes on this tape are NOT directed by Miyazaki, but are still a lot of fun.

That set the alarm bells ringing.Then the DVD has been filmed on a low resolution camera buy someone on the balcony of the show.The picture is grainy, you cant see the peoples faces its so unclear and the music does not match the movements.All in all this looks like a private person who video'd and thought they would sell it on Amazon. If its an official production as it says then it is the single worst dance DVD I have ever seen.I have not exaggerated this review. Do yourself a favour and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overview of ABA therapy","review":"A very well written book which is easy to read and is good value. I would recommend it be used in conjunction with \\" A Work in Progress\\" by Leaf and McEachlin to understand ABA therapy for Autism. \\"The ABA Program Companion\\" book gives an overview of what ABA is, rather than a specific program. A \\"Work in Progress\\" gives a specific comprehensive program especially suited for a younger child.As a parent (and qualified school teacher), I have used the book to give my son therapy whilst waiting for Professional Services to become available and found it most useful.You may want to borrow a copy instead of buying it, if you are a parent as it mainly provides background information."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Invaluable Godsend!","review":"This excellent book is well written and presents information in a clear and direact way. Readers learn about Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy and what it is rather than about programs using it. Instead, readers learn about the concept of ABA and how ABA can be helpful in working with chldren who have autism. Parents of children with autism will most likely make their book a close friend because of the factual information it provides and also use it in working with their children. Teachers also will get a lot out of this book. The background information is invaluable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless if you own a mac","review":"Included CD is not mac compatible.

The book also gives the reader an insight into the seediness of boxing and the personalities.Very good read for the fight fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Lisa Wheeler Delight!","review":"\\"Sailor Moo: Cow at Sea\\" is another delightful picture book by Lisa Wheeler. This wonderful flowing rhyme tells a wonderful story of the pursuit of dreams, adventure, pirates and romance. Like Lisa's other books \\"Turk and Runt\\" and \\"Wool Gathering, A Sheep Family Reunion\\", she catches you up in her rhyme and makes you believe it is so. Lisa's sense of humor will make the adults giggle. This book is a must read for everyone young and old.

THis book is awful. The reproductions are poor quality. The colors look faded. You cannot read the text in the paintings!!!!!! It looks like (and i think it is) printed using [...] or something. I actually returned my book, and i almost never do that. Don't waste your money.

And I am glad I did.Following one day in the life of a number of people in New York, Diana and her daughter Isabel in particular [everyone else is linked to them], while the plot is nothing too unusual, the performances by all are simply so superb and heartfelt [showing forth and recalling the passion Diana demanded of her acting class at the beginning], that I was hooked.

Very similar except that there was no plot and only one of the story lines gets an ending in this film.

I would take out the gas canister, press it manually a few times, then reinsert it. The gun would shoot well for a while, then nothing again. I found that the problem was with the Hitachi brand gas. For some reason the gas metering valve would stick or clog, and not supply enough gas for each shot. The solution? Red canister Paslode gas. I so far have gone thorough 3 of them with no hiccups from full to empty canister. This thing is a great tool, no regrets as long as I use Paslode gas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty woman","review":"Purchase experience from Amazon - 4.I have put five strips of Hitachi 3x.120 ring shank HDG nails through my new NR90GR.

Two of them have (exploded) and broken in half, and one has multiple parts broken. I dislike the difficulty in actually using this gun above your head or in a position where you can't use both hands to press the gun down HARD enough to activate it. It has a very small magazine and trigger pull is atrociously hard. I would not buy one of these guns for my own use, it needs a lot of improvement. It is great not to have to drag a hose around but its still not worth it yet with this gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for awhile, then the housing broke..","review":"I've had this nailer for over a year and put about 500 nails through it.

Big waste of money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doing the Hitachi name wrong","review":"I've been a framing contractor in Ca for over 18 years and I have never been dissappointed with Hitachi. It's notorious for great, dependable products. Not so with the NR90GR nailer. Terrible! The gun had been a bust right out of the box. It didn't even get through one strip of nails. It just won't shoot. If you have the skills and the timing of a jungle cat that's been trained by a ninja, you might get it to fire! I thought this was going to be a sweet little tool that could save me a lot of time on the job. I was wrong and as a consequence very dissappointed. I've replaced the gas rod multiple times, I've charged the battery, I've taken it to a tool repair twice, and it still doesn't work.

I think im going to leave it there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very disappointed","review":"I had hoped this would be a great tool for small projects, but it turned out to be a great disappointment. I was able to drive 8 (eight) nails in standard 2x4x8 after which the tool stopped working.With a fully charged battery I thought the fuel cell might have been from a bad stock, so I replaced it, but with the same result. Being optimistic, I bought a new set of Hitachi fuel cells, but that didn't change anything.I have followed the procedures outlined in the Troubleshooting section of the Manual but the tool refuses to work.I have been using power, and pneumatic tools for a long time, but this one got me :(Probably Hitachi should revise their testing procedure, at least for this tool, to ensure its reliability.I hope Amazon will accept a return for the nailer, but I ended up with a box of nails and two sets of fuel cells for a total of almost $100 lost money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard","review":"I've only had the nailer about a week, and haven't used it alot other than just trying it out- 'bout 1 strip of nails. So far it seems to work pretty good. It hits really hard and is well balanced. Not too much heavier than an air nailer. The cons: really could use a tooless depth adjustment. You really have to push hard with the nose to fire a nail. Cleaning instructions and maintenance are not in the users manual, you have to go to Hitachi's website and download a pdf file for the instructions and recommended schedule. It doesn't have a bump fire feature so you won't be firing nails as fast as a pnuematic gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitachi NR90GR","review":"No complaints! I recently helped a friend tear down and rebuild a 8 x 16 mudroom on his house. We pre-built the walls in his garage with the nailer and put it up in a short amount of time. I've used a Paslode nailer before and this nailer seems lighter and better balanced. I've shot about 1500 3 1/4 and 2 3/8 nails and I switched out my first fuel cell acouple hundred nails ago.

I can hear the gas chamber's fan turn on but no nail comes out. I tried a new battery and new gas cartridges all to no avail.I am building a barn and will be walking around in rafters.

All you get is basically a limited tour through Alaska with a few songs thrown in. I have no problem with great documentaries but this doesn't come close. Through out the entire length of this video there is this overall \\"blah\\" feeling generated from the band as if they were really thinking : \\" OK, can we go get trashed now?\\" I was really bummed out because of this video and honestly, I wish I could get my money back.

Riveting reading even if you don't care about your own skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"An American Apoligist","review":"Through this ambitious book, James Carroll has established himself as the undisputed captain of American apologists. In this tedious and sometimes uneven narration he manages to ascribe a dark purpose to even the most benevolent acts of American charity. Can anyone consent to the notion, as Carroll argues, that the Marshall Plan that followed World War II was an over act of aggression against the Soviet Union?In order to agree with Carroll one must subscribe to the author's bizarre belief that every American administration from the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt was corrupted by the Pentagon and that America has, for the last sixty years, represented the dark side of the universe. This is a lesson in revisionist history."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEMO ONLY!!! BUYER BEWARE!","review":"The four stars are for the inspirational quality of Anna Forrest's yoga practice.

It is only 28 minutes long and not very high quality. Worse yet it cost 16 dollars. There is no instruction or voice over of any kind. It consists of a woman wearing tights and a long ponytail doing incredibly difficult yoga positions. For me it was a waste of time and money. For most of us we will never be able to do this kind of exercise routine and the lack of commentary makes it beyond the limit of inspiration. It is too far out for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like these hats.","review":"Great look, fair pricing, good fit. This is my 4th Enzyme Regular Solid Cap. Have the black, grey and khaki.

The text is written at a management level of discussion. You do not need to be in IT hardware or software to benefit from the book's explanations.The authors discuss the business implications of RFID deployment. Not just in the background of a supply chain, but also at a mass consumer level. To wit, there is a careful airing of the privacy issues that might arise if RFID tags can be used for tracking people and their purchases. And different countries have different policies towards these issues.The conclusion is broadly positive for an eventual ubiquitous deployment. Prudently, the authors desist from suggesting when that might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than EVER!!!!","review":"I Must Say This Gorgeous Album Has NEVER Sounded BETTER!!!!

She has a great voice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"By far my favorite Christmas album","review":"This is one of the few albums for which I'd ever use the term \\"inspired,\\" but it very much deserves that term. There's nothing amiss here--it's a great mix of traditional and new, fast and slow, upbeat and sentimental. Musically, the album offers something for everyone without alienating anyone from track to track, and it includes none of the silly \\"filler\\" songs that ruin so many other Christmas albums (Amy's insipid versions of \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" and \\"Mr. Santa\\" on her third Christmas album are good examples). We sometimes hit play again after the album has finished, listening to it all again, it's that strong. I appreciate having an album like this to play at Christmas time, as the reverence and love of the season are captured perfectly in music. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will put you in the Christmas spirit!!!","review":"Of the 3 different Christmas albums Amy Grant has released since 1983, I believe this to be her very best. Not only are the arrangements perfectly fitting for an evening by the fireplace, but her voice has never sounded better. Instead of trying too hard to \\"redo\\" old favorites like other artists often do, she pays tribute to these songs by keeping them true to the way we have all grown up hearing them. The newly written songs such as \\"The Night Before Christmas\\" and \\"Breath of Heaven\\" fit perfectly in between the old favorites. Listening to this album year after year has been a treat; it doesn't sound dated at all. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes traditional (Nat King Cole,etc) sounding Christmas tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newman captures what's important.","review":"Thomas Newman's score for \\"Up Close and Personal\\" captures everything that is needed for such a romantic movie: the emotion. To call the movie a romantic comedy is to shortchange it: it's so much more than that, and the music plays a large part in bringing out that heartfelt emotion and feeling that the story breathes. With sweeping moments of score that practically scream tears, Newman gets everything in place, every emotion down, every feeling within each new chord and flow. This, along with his work on \\"The Green Mile,\\" is definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Thomas Newman Score","review":"I just love this score and when I lost my original copy I was very sad. Then I discovered Amazon and it was part of my first purchase. How amazing it was that I could find something that wasn't terribly recent and be able to get it. I was so happy and I have come back to Amazon several times since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a few sound cues","review":"I love Thomas Newman's work. This music may have worked in the movie, but not as a soundtrack CD. The cues are short, and once you've listened to three tracks on the CD you've heard them all. If you have his Welcome Home Roxy Carmichael CD and the American Beauty ST you don't really need this one. Only for the most diehard soundtrack collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This book remains by far one of the worst textbooks I have ever read. The authors' choice of words obscure the writing entirely, and the computer generated tests that go along with this book remain nearly impossible to pass without cheating. Once you hit the middle of the book, not a single person can get an \\"A\\", let alone only two people are able to pass with a low to (occasionally) mid \\"B\\"; the overwhelming majority score in the 50s. I have never been in a class in which so many hard-working (10 hours of studying a week for me, if not more) and bright kids cannot even get an \\"A\\" or a \\"B\\". Do not listen to this review. I am a student and I speak for many, many students who feel the same way; by the way, among those students whom I am referring to are one who has published his own book already, another who nearly scored a perfect score on the SAT, and another who has his own business: these are not ordinary kids.

It uses roundabout language instead of giving you the facts (for instance, saying \\"every elected occupant of the White House\\" instead of \\"every president\\").

Not only is every paragraph injected with strong adjectives, and often extreme opinions(demonizing the whole German state? I think not), but there is false information too. It clearly states that the Berlin Wall first came down in December 1989 and didn't fully fall for another few months when the actual date recognized by people the world over is November 9, 1989. I knew this for a fact, but what about all of the other facts I don't know quite as well?

We pulled out this book every once in a while just to look at the pretty pictures and maps in it, and to make fun of its \\"superfluous glory\\" - because that's what it is. Superfluous.

It does contain alot of information and is rather comprehensive for a high school class, but it makes you sleepy and forces you to take a nap, which is a waste of valuable time. It takes about an hour to read each chapter. It may seem that it takes more since the book is very boring and lacking any spark. Don't take me as a history basher since i love history and may major in history at college.

No wonder why our youth in this country are so liberal.God help us all with books like this in the classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE book to read if you want to learn U.S. History","review":"The American Pageant does more than provide the reader with a dry recital of the facts and figures of U.S. History. It addresses the way our ancestors lived and died in all its human foibles. It presents a holistic approach to history, never forgetting how events in other areas of the world have both benefited and harmed our country. I first became acquainted with the book in the 1970s while in high school, having been given a copy of the 1958 edition of the book by my mother (a high school history teacher!). I found myself reading it strictly for entertainment sake! Later, while in college, I took the CLEP tests in U.S. History, and the book proved invaluable! I easily passed both directly as a result of my exposure to The American Pageant. Now, I find myself with a son about to take high school history, and this is the ONLY book I'd recommend to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly inadequate","review":"I'm using this book right now for my APUSH class. I usually enjoy reading about history, but this book makes it terrible. The constant \\"witticisms\\" seem to trivialize what the book describes, and even worse, it seems to be not nearly in-depth enough to provide any decent insight into what happened, as if it were not even skimming the surface, merely looking upon it. (The writing style has rubbed off on me.) It leaves me very unsatisfied, and my understanding of the concepts is left with huge holes that my teacher constantly has to clarify in class. If you really care about learning the material well, find another textbook that actually gives the details with thoughtful analysis rather than an overgeneralized, almost fictionalized \\"account\\" of the basic events."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL GREAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS","review":"I read Baily's American Pagaent many years ago while an undergraduate. It made me really appreciate and love American History. I still thumb through the book I had all those years ago when a trivia question comes up. I taught American History for a year in high school before going on to law school. It's been a long, long time, but I recently saw the movie U-571 and I could still remembered Baily's comments about German U-boat captains reluctance to surface to identify ships, as required by international law at that time. \\"Shoot first and worry about the consequences later\\" was the paraphrase.Thanks, Tom.

The preface brags about compressing the real history in this edition and expanding coverage of \\"immigrants, slaves, the environment and women\\". The text takes every oppurtunity to deride Europeans for cruelty, but when mentioning other races, no such words are attributed to them. For example, the Aztecs' human sacrifice, etc. is presented matter-of-factly. When the discovery of America is described, parentheses are placed around the word \\"discovery\\". It waxes about the authors's morals and ethics more than it does a presentation of history. In fact, several times when a massacre against Europeans is described, or the spread of native diseases to Europeans, the phrase \\"poetic justice\\" is used. I don't recommend this book unless you're interested in reading a demonization of American history and culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst History Book Ever!!!","review":"I have loved history ever since I was born.

No alternatives-- take it or leave it. So, the quality of the print may be great, but if you are looking for something other than a snapshot printer, look elsewhere.

The bag clip has about a 30 degree or more angle, so won't fit at all. So, I tried it on my mountain bike, the rails on that saddle are too close. I tried it on my Brooks saddle, their too far apart, I tried it on the Scott saddle, again, it won't fit. So, what saddle will it fit? I suggest taking your saddle in to the shop to see what will fit before you buy one. I'm going back to the strap and hook, simple system, no worries about if it will fit.

Yes, you build your documentation to prepare you for future stages, but you start with trying to work with the school district as a team member. It's more of a carrot and stick approach.

What an absolute waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"My son and I had great expectations for this game; our expectations quickly turned in to disappointment. This \\"game\\" is really hard to call a game. It's more like one long reading exercise. Unlike many of the other L-Max games, wherein you learn the modules through interactive play, with this one you have to read and read and read the same story over again. Once you complete the story, you can then go to another area to \\"unlock\\" the game. Then in order to play the \\"game\\" you have to read some more. This is not the type of game where you can standby and provide guidance when needed, I found myself reading page, after page, after page, just to figure out for myself the objective of the \\"game\\" and then try to explain it to my son. I felt the money I paid for this game was a waste, no wonder when I went to purchase it, it was the only one in stock.

I'll give the Major the benefit of the doubt here and guess it's his first acting attempt. Some of the camo is geared toward hunting since anyone watching the intro would shoot his hookie camo wrap thing.

Feliciano's voice is terrific, but the arrangements are very slick, \\"saccharine\\", especially if, like me, you have developed a taste for the Cuban bolero.

As luck would have it, I have a recording of \\"Como Fue\\" by the great Beny More. Jose sounds like an amateur by comparison. In fact, Jose does not sound as good as Ibrahim Ferrer, who came out with his own version of \\"Como Fue\\" a couple of years ago. Jose's voice and guitar playing sound as good as ever. The album notes provide the lyrics and translations.

Then make the right decision and avoid this waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swingers definitely does 'not' swing ...","review":"While I usually agree with the prevailing ratings by our fellow Amazonians, and admittedly the 4.5 average rating was a factor in purchasing this video, it was a big let down. The two main characters in this movie were simply 'swinger' wannabes; one thought himself way cooler than he was, by far, and the other was a hapless complainer. My wife and I endured the first 45mins before I started fast-forwarding, first 30secs at a time, then 1min, then 2mins, then by chapters. It was just awful, from beginning to end. And for those of you hoping to catch a glimpse of a younger Heather Graham, you'll have to wait until the last 15mins of the movie. This movie may have been viewed as 'hip' 10yrs ago but it clearly has not withstood the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny, witty, touching movie","review":"A great movie! Kudos to Vince Vaughn in his breakout role as the fast-talking Trent. Extra Kudos to Jon Favreau who not only starred, but wrote the script and co-produced as well.

HA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie of ALL TIME! (ITS NOT ABOUT SWING!)","review":"This movie was a great movie. I first saw pieces of it on HBO and was entertained. But the first time I completly saw the movie I truly got to appriciate it.Unfortunately and fortunately, the apperance of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy in the end of the movie has caused some mis-informed people to make unfair judgements. THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT SWING DANCING! The ill-timed launch of the swing fad made everyone think that this was another Swing Kids. ITS NOT! Its a great movie on many levels from its comedic dialouge to its truths about men and women. A must see for all guys! This movie even has great dating advice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a nightlife with Swingers!","review":"This has got to be the best commedy of the 90's! I've never met anyone who's seen this flick and hasn't loved it. Girls dig it, but guys RELATE to it. Nothing's better than to see your best friend, roomate, and old flings portrayed in a commedy so real it's hilarious. Get this movie, grab a beer, and ride shotgun with the coolest guys outta Hollywood. Buy this baby, it's money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vince Vaughn is the money, baby!","review":"After watching this great movie I immediatally fell in love with Vaughn's acting (not to mention his looks). He has this sassy, classy, sexy, charming, smurky way about him that makes the movie worth watching by itself. Throw in some great dialogue and interesting characters and you get Swingers. Although the ending comes kind of slowly, the film is just plain, old-fashioned cool! Worth seeing if you're looking for some new expressions to baffle your friends with. It's the money, Baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Babies and Money","review":"This film has the same to-the-minute trendy feel that Kevin Smith's \\"Clerks\\" did, and is equally blessed in a largely unknown but very talented cast. The plot, if that is the right word, revolves around the adventures of a group of 20 something wasters and their attempts to get laid. The film is rich with beautifully observed dialogue, much of which is the funny quick fire banter you fondly imagine you and your mates do down the pub. But you don't. The soundtrack is a wonderfully eclectic mix, it's like you hear the male lead's entire record collection. If there is a criticism it is that the cinematography is nothing special, but run of the mill camera work does not at the end of the day spoil a movie you will want to watch again and again, in the hope that some of it's style will rub off on you"},{"rating":"2","title":"your so money and you don't even know it","review":"This movie is a must-see. I've seen it I don't know how many times, because its all about a guy being depressed over his ex-girlfriend and trying to get back into the dating game but can't quite do it, somewhere most guys have been at some point. It's got a classy soundtrack, and tons of cool little one-liners. The best thing about it is that the dialogue is probably exactly like the dialogue most people in or just out of college have. Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money","review":"This movie is so money you dont even know it...Great movie, it really shows how gifted Vince Vaughn is as a comedic actor, and even at a young age..\\"We'll be up five hunny by midnight..\\"CT"},{"rating":"2","title":"they're so young!","review":"Vince and Jon are so young in this movie, it's weird to see after watching their recent movies. But it is a classic, and its a great movie, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I remembered. It was good, but it didn't have much too it. It was just a story, a relatable, fun story, but nothing really happened. But its a good movie about girls, love, gambling, and most of all going out and having fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds up well","review":"I rented this after hearing an interview with Jon Favreau.

It will keep you laughing from start to finish. Swingers is a great movie about a group of guys that love to have a good time. These five guys take getting dates as a science.

Jon Favreau really taps into the \\"do's and don'ts\\" of dating. Behind the backdrop of the L.A. club scene, this movie explores the difficulties of commitment and relationships. Of course, putting Big Bad Voodoo Daddy in the movie was such a great idea.+"},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is Money...","review":"Want a movie that will strike a strong comedy blend yet also have deeper meaning? Try Swingers. It is the most ingenious movie I have ever seen on any screen. The first time I saw it, I went out and bought it. I would say I have seen it about 50 times and it never gets old. If you have the extra 15 bucks, buy this movie! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD picture quality on this DVD","review":"I recently bought it because I found it to be one of the best films I have come across in years only to find that the DVD version of the movie was horrible. I have over 60 DVDs in my collection and I have to say this is the worst one I have EVER bought. The picture quality is just unbelievably bad... and to think that this movie was so good. What a wasted opportunity. Please pass this info on to other prospective buyers of this DVD.

This is not just a guy movie! It's a film that can be appreciated by anyone who's tackled a major city dating scene post-college. It's also a great movie for people recovering from the breakup of a long-term relationship. Personally I loved watching a guy go through what I was going through as a woman, and it's a hoot seeing his more \\"masculine\\" friends' points of view on his situation. Be the bear! Don't be the bunny! You are so money and you don't even know it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta love it","review":"The first time I watched this movie, I couldn't understand all of the hype. I laughed a few times and that was about it. Then I watched it again, and again, and again.... Finally I realized what was so great about this movie. The fact that everyone can relate to one of the characters. If you can't, you've either been dateless your entire life or are too busy trying to be trendy to acknowledge your own feelings. I must say though, THIS IS A GUY FLICK!!! All of the women that I have watched it with haven't understood it, all of the guys have. You can't help but scream when Mike calls Nikki. It's hilarious, but heart-wrenching. There is my opinion on the movie, so do yourself a favor and buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will either absolutely love or hate this film","review":"'Swingers' documents the social lives of five guys in their twenties living in Southern California. The main characters in this movie fancy themselves as cool cats living lives adjunct to the 90's swing revival.The first twenty minutes of the movie are a bit slow, but are essential for character development. This slow beginning may explain why viewers either love or revile it. If you can get past the first twenty minutes, you will laugh hysterically.(This film also has a great soundtrack and is immensely quotable.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This movie was incredibly boring! There was really no plot, it had so many uneccessary scenes in it, and some of the actors gave me a feeling that the only reason they were in it was because they were doing it as a favor or because they were extremely desperate! The only \\"money\\" thing about it was the appearance of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell asleep","review":"Had to shut this one off after watching about half of it.

Did I fall into some twisted ass star trek logic time trap? 2 years ago it was available on Amazon and NOW IT IS NOT YET RELEASED?? I mean it's not like I was looking for a new special version or anything.. I just wanted the Swingers that I had before.Fortunately, I moved sideways and checked out Barnes & Noble (bn.com). Being a loyal amazon fan I didn't want to do it but I had no choice. And what did I find there??

There is hardly a character to like in this to-hip-for-its-own-good piece of filth, but you can't fault them for trying. The hero is a sad little boy who misses his girlfriend and cries over how lonely he is in his nice clothes with his pretty friends and fast cars. Poor guy. He is his own worst enemy, as is the film. The \\"homages\\" to other films sreve as the best examples of how the movie confuses the joke to the point where it becomes the joke. This movie is lousy. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie without a Meaning","review":"I had to watch this movie because my friends rented and made me watch it. I have no idea why anyone likes this movie, the movie has no plot what so ever!

I saw this once because my friend was begging me to see it. So, I went and rented it. You can go rent any \\"guy\\" movie and get more substance than this movie. I got really sick of hearing \\"You're so money\\" (okay, funny the first time, that's it). It's basically good cop-bad cop at a nightclub, Vince Vaughn being the \\"bad cop\\" trying to get his buddy over a bad relationship by giving him the \\"rules\\" of women and the night scene. There is nothing refreshing or unique about this movie; this premise has been covered before. Just a stereotypical depiction of single guys. I know that some who rated this movie think that all guys act this way, but I think that is kind of a misrepresentation. If you want to go see a better movie, go rent Animal House."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely awful.","review":"I rented this movie in hopes of the two great people who are in it. I wish I hadn't! It was the worst movie ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swingers is suprisingly entertaining for all","review":"When I first sat down to watch Swingers, I had no idea how smart and sexy it would be. Although it may seem like yet another teen movie, Swingers uses incredible young actors, boundless under-the-surface humor and an amazing sound track to give two hours of entertainment that actually doesn't put your brain in a coma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doug Liman is God","review":"Talk about the Cinderella of American Cinema, Doug Liman and the crew from Swingers showed that a great movie will sell itself and that you don't need a big budget to make it big. Everything pretty much had it against this film: it had practically no budget, no really big stars, barely any promotion. But what it did have was a great dialogue, a true-to-life plot, and a jackpot of a cast of talented then-unknowns, all backed by the genius that is Doug Liman. This is by far one of the best independent films in the past few years, if not one of the best films of all time. Rarely ever does a movie get better and better each time you watch it, and Swingers definitely fills that role. If you have not seen this movie yet, you are definitely missing out.Also, Liman's new movie Go is also a classic and a definite must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"The early VINCE!!","review":"Vince is as funny - it is nice to see his early and breakthrough work.

I'll never throw away a receipt again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fair treatise on the random order of Life","review":"The turbulence, despair, and despondency of navigating the multiple persons that occupy the space between significant relationships is obvious in this film. Although the production of this movie is fair, the arbitrary chance at play in meeting someone of significance is painfully well-represented here. Although I think this movie gets better with a second view, and it is a possible \\"sleeper\\", I would not consider it as part of a \\"Collector's Series\\" - seems like a stretch, an overzealous marketing effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"If U dont get this movie, you haven't lived!","review":"The great thing about this movie is being able to identify yourself and your friends as one of the many male characters, whether you are the sexist T-Bone, or the sweet and honest Mike.

This movie hits all of us single guys right in the face! In fact, anyone with experience of the combination between a prior relationship, serious nightclubbing and career ambitions at the same time will enjoy this movie. As many other reviewers have stated, this movie reflects a period of one's life that is so recognizable and true. The movie gets 4 stars from me; the only reason a fifth star is lacking is that I feel the personalities are a bit too extreme. For example, Mike is at times such a looser to an extent that is not very believable. All in all however, this is a highly entertaining movie and a good alternative to all of those stupid although enjoyable college-spring break-road trip movies out there...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best comedy ever!","review":"When I bought my dvd player(s) this was the first dvd I bought. I can't imagine not seeing this movie. All males will be familiar with at least one of the characters, and females will gain a new perspective on men.

I would only recommend this book to a couple who is new to sexor to those so afraid to try new things that you simply are having a hard time doing anythingbut missionary sex.In fact I am not sure the author has much experience at all. Nothing in this book is naughtyand I found the authors promotion of passive/aggressive sexual communication theoriesa bit repressed as well. This book takes little time to read as it's a small book and should wasteno more than 2-3 hours of a normal readers time.If you are a guy looking to be a better lover I would recommend you read a book about women'ssexuality or a book about lesbian lovemaking as you will have much better information on whatreally gets the ladies going.

Abbey is no Horowitz or Janis, but he is a sensitive musician with a beautiful touch and give haunting renditions of these works. Even though there are more thrilling 3rds out there, I find this one staying with me. The contribution by the St. Louis Symphony is exceptional, outshining a lot of the bigger orchestras: they bring freshness, stunning discipline, positively glowing string tone, and make music with Simon, not just accompany him. I guess I'd best sum up this recording as one to cozy up to rather to put me through the emotional treadmill. Both kinds of performances are necessary in my collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inexpensive recording","review":"This is one of the best recorings for the money I have heard.

Since then, everyone I introduce this CD remarks on its uniqueness and asks where to find their own copy. Although tricky to find most anyplace but online, this Christmas CD remains a joyful surprise to rediscover each holiday season. The familiar melodys are laid down with a peaceful mix of elegant vocals and graceful accompaniment. Give this CD a listen, and I'm sure you'll become an instant fan. Only one VERY MINOR complaint about this album: The third and eleventh tracks are mislabeled, which may leave some first-time listeners initially confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"For novice or master--","review":"If you only have one tarot book in your library, this is the one to have! The pages are alive--rich pearls of wisdom and cosmic truth have been woven into them. Each card is presented in such an organized fashion that readers can easily find the specific information wanted--whether a simple \\"yes/no/maybe\\" or an in-depth journey into the symbolism and meaning. The writing of this book was obviously guided and it is a gift for those who are inspired to open it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible clarity and insight","review":"I've been looking at tarot from a distance for a number of years, and have always shied away from going deeper because of the apparent complexity. Suzanne presents the basic concepts of the tarot in a way that I was able to use very quickly. In particular, I have appreciated her nuanced approach to the flow of the Major Arcana, and have learned a great deal from her wise, balanced methodology in interpreting the cards. Suzanne presents the facets of tarot in a way that does not overwhelm the reader, but allows the reader to delve as deeply as is appropriate at the moment. This book is a gift to the community. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about tarot as a reflection of the human experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen Durtschi","review":"This book has the clearest interpretations I have ever used for the Thoth deck. It has an entire section in the back about each of the symbols in the cards which is tremendously useful. Another great feature is the quick reading \\"Yes/No\\" information for each card. The multiple level information on the trumps is great for understanding how a particular one could come up in a reading. And my favorite part of all is the \\"Questions to Ask\\" section, because they illuminate the cards so thoroughly. Simply a superb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Insights","review":"Suzanne's insights are magical and yet surprisingly simplistic. She bridges the gap of understanding between all belief systems by explaining how the inner workings of the soul can be understood thru the beauty of the Tarot."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 25 years, the BEST Tarot book I've ever read!","review":"This book is excellent and everyone interested in Tarot needs to read it. Although it is written for the Thoth Crowley deck with specific references to symbols as they appear on the cards in that deck, I find it quite applicable to most other decks, as well. The discussion of each card is thorough and well written so that beginners will have an easy time with this book and yet be able to give themselves advanced readings through the use of the multi-leveled interpretations offered in the text.I've been a professional Reader for over 25 years and am very well-read in the field. I can say with all sincerity that this is by far the BEST book on Tarot that I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's get personal, shall we.","review":"FINALLY- an uncomplicated, straight forward, multi level with depth and feeling for the \\"journeyer\\" guide to the mysterious tarot.

The theme is simply one of the great themes out there and the best part is that it sounds just like a Zimmer score.

I paid twenty bucks to see something different and I feel let down. I would like to see actual interviews with the designers and carpenters. I would like to know more about the departure of Alex (and Des). I want to know how to put together some of the more beautiful armoirs and shelves that Ty and Amy Wynn built. I want to see shopping lists so when I try to recreate some of the rooms in my own home, I know what to get at the store and which store to look through.I don't get any of that on this DVD.

Don't waste your money.","review":"What a let down! This DVD is a major disappointment if you are a Trading Spaces fan. They showcased the worst of the room re-dos, and barely highlighted some of the best work, especially that of Laurie and Vern. Very few of their rooms were showcased. Anyone watching this DVD would most likely never want to participate in the show, much less spend their time watching an hour of it on television. Short segments with little entertainment value. Even the bloopers were horribly boring. I wish I could get my money back. For a better investment, buy the book. Unlike the DVD, it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"This DVD was such a disappointment. There wasn't that much \\"never-before-seen footage\\", and the bloopers were very disappointing. The Meet the Crew section was just outtakes from the show. And some sections were just text.

Have you looked at the faces of people who walk into the new rooms?!?! The vast majority are stricken, feeling ill.Where do they find these designers? They sure aren't \\"Christopher Lowell\\".

Not having a classical education, but being interested in substantive issues that deal with my spiritual growth, this book has guided me for over four decades. I have discovered small, charming stories that have uplifted my soul(e.g. Comrade Don Camillo), as well as deep personal spiritual needs(Karl Rahner). Although the book is over fourty years old, I still carry it with me to search for authors and titles to help me on my spiritual quest.

Many prayers have been sent to heaven as a result of the recommended author's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent material","review":"I bought this book in 2004 and I read it from cover to cover. I had no intention of ever doing any of the ritual or evocations. But I suddenly found myself in an emergency situation where I had been told that I had lost a property. Without proper preparation I went and summoned an Angel who would help in matters of properties (I also referenced the Dictionary of Angels also). I did the ritual with the corresponding sigil.

To get the most out of this practice, you also must be able to astrally travel, and have solid meditation/visualization skills. I could see this being a minor irritation to beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed and fascinating but. . .","review":"I loved this book and really appreciate the way the author presented ceremony in such a detailed manner. Many aspects of this art are clearer to me now. The use of magic mirrors is going to aid me greatly in my own evocations. The angels and spirits are presented in a detailed manner. The only problem I have with this book is that some of the spirits are demons. I would never evoke a demonic entity and suggest anyone using this book research all non angelic spirits prior to evocation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would be astonished if you managed to summon a spirit with this book...","review":"...because the author doesn't tell you the most important fact about the summoning of spirits, and that is astrological timing. You cannot summon a spirit every night, but this is what the author pretends. The Goetia clearly states that spirits can only be evoked in the first two weeks after new moon, and only every second day. You can try to conjure a spirit due to the instructions in this book if you want (what I did several times), but I don't believe that you'll be successful. Konstantinos is an armchair theorist, not a practicing magician! By the way: If you write an e-mail to the author in order to ask questions on this book, I tell you that he won't answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Evocation Book on Spirits","review":"I have read a good many Occult books. I am a big Paul Huson fan as well as Scott Cunningham.This book is a great instructional book on evocation and summoning spirits BUT I would caution beginner's against doing this first. I don't agree with all his info and methods though he does a good job of explaining everything in ways other books overlook. Attention to detail is a must esp in Occult and Wicca.Definately worth getting, studing and moving on to gain more experience before attempting to DO anything in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm, not quite what I expected","review":"Ok, SO I just wanted to touch on a few things that he really lacks on letting you know.First of all, If invoking was as easy as he makes it out to be, then we would not need books to do it. 2nd of all, The way he \\"uses\\" the Angels and such goetic spirits, I think is for pure selfish reasons, and I just got a terrible feeling from the book almost right away, But I usually give things a chance, but this book is just a great way to really get hurt in allot of ways if your really not careful, I would do the LBRP before and after reading the thing, Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be called, \\"Evoking Spirits for Dummies...\\"","review":"A very thin book (physically), with a shallow style of writing. ..Apparently (according to the author), evoking spirits is a VERY VERY EASY affair.

The author borrows from so many other sources that the ones of you with a firm occult base will find nothing new, much over-simplification and all understated.

I have a real jerry can dated to the early 1950's. The original gasket is dried out and I tried this one. It does not work. It is too narrow to cover the small vent hole that is under the cap - so when the the lid or cap is screwed in the cap leaks. The idea is the vent hole is covered by the gasket when the cap is screwed in, but uncovered when the filler spout is screwed on. Whomever produced these gaskets donesn't know how the Jerry can works. The orginal gasket is more than twice as wide to make a tight seal over the vent hole with the cap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the original sponge roller","review":"This replacement roller is very firm and non-absorbent, unlike the original gray sponge roller.

Also the feature that allows you to switch to still photos saved me a lot of time switching to a separate camera.

The experience of reading the book is similar to finding the occasional mouse photo, there's some interesting stuff but every once in a while there's some jarringly bad info (like the suggestion of cedar chips for bedding). It will be hard for a first time rat owner to tell which is which. More recent offerings by Debbie Duccomun or Ginger Cardinal are much better choices for your first rat care book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for beginners.","review":"As a complete beginner to the world of rat keeping, I found this book to be useful regarding practically every aspect of rat keeping.

Approximately 80%-85% of the book is information about proper care for a pet rat and diagnosing possible diseases. The book contains little information about rats as a species that is not commonly found in an encyclopaedia; if you are looking for a general book, this one will probably leave you unsatisfied. However, if you are looking for a guide to keeping rats as pets, I can say that the book is quite useful. When I've kept rats, I have particularly found the section on ailments to be valuable. For people who are new to raising rats, the book is an excellent place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I hate to complain, but Susan Fox did not do a very good job with the book.

The first CD is material by The Nice and should've continued for CD two. Instead Emerson brings out a different band to play ELP material, which suffers from the lack of Greg Lake's voice. There was enough quality music produced by The Nice that they shouldn't have been pushed aside to play ELP music with other musicians. As a result, the project lacks focus and the energy that ELP produced.The production seems to be rather stilted, as if they simply set up the mixing board and walked away. Keith's keyboards always remain on the left and Dave's guitar is always on the right. Two words: Bor ing.CD1 is worth having, the remaining two are throwaways, which makes this overpriced.

Yes, you have the ability to connect two hmdi components and yes, the receiver has XM support.But.... The receiver does not have the ability to upconvert signals. This is, imho, critical for any home theatre system. With upconversion you only need to make one or maybe two connections between your tv/monitor and the receiver. Any receiver lacking this ability is a waste.Also, there are only two digital connections available.

I was initially worried that she had ventured into the world of Patricia Cornwall, Tess Gerritsen, Michael Connolly, etc. (all of which are perfectly fine reads, don't get me wrong), but this is serial murderer thriller Mo Hayder style, like you've never seen it. Dark, dark, and more dark is all I can say. She has such an unabashed fear of writing about dark material - necrophilia, rape, murder, incest, pedophilia. There are scenes from this book that still haunt me. Incredible!As a plus, Jack Caffery, the DI protagonist, is a wonderful hero. He's tortured and incredibly sexy.

Its set in a contemporary environment, refreshingly in London, ( after so many set in NYC) and is pacy, fast, with twists that delight. It also tries to lay out what makes the killer the wierdo he is. This was my first foray into the genre. Most, with King the worst, scare me witless, and I just want to be entertained. This book does it, and does it beautifully, and I think it crosses the genres between horror and procedural police seemlessly. Hayder is good. Her characters are real, the relationship between the hero and his self centred martyr guilt tripping girlfriend is superb that gave me flashes of 'I've been there'. I wish I had written this. Buy it. Read it. This is a book not for the true horror reader but for those who want some weirdo stuff, but within a real world setting. Its more Ed McBain than Thomas Harris, but its better for it.

Her descriptions of character, crimescene and victims are chilling real. To consider this is her writing debuut, promises a lot for the future.

Loved the cover and bought the book. It was so good, I finished it off in 2 nights and since there was nothing else out by Hayder at the time, I quickly forgot about it--until I bought a copy of Gone for my smart phone. I finished it off in 10 hours and began to scour Amazon used books for more by Hayder and that is when I saw this one and was suddenly transported back to the day I picked up Birdman in the Bookworm in Mobile, AL. I couldn't believe that I had forgotten the book or that I had forgotten Jack Caffery. Okay, Hayder is blunt in her prose and some people might be put off by the very nature of what the Birdman does to his victims--but if you don't have a weak stomach--this book is great. And to be honest, Caffery might come off a bit vague in her later books if you don't read this one. I kept thinking while reading Gone that he seemed so familiar--and it turns out he was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I stuck with it!!!","review":"I purchased this book after reading the synopsis on the back and it sounded like a good read. While it did get off to a slow start, (introducing way too many characters at once!!!) I did stick with it because I thought I should give it a chance. I'm glad I did!!! It was a little gory and graphic but I expected that-I was repulsed a few times but all in all, I definitely recommend this book-not for the squeamish, though!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Birdman","review":"Very intriguing suspenseful book.

I've just ordered Mo Hayder's second novel, which the reviews indicate maybe even better than the first. So we'll see what happens to Jack this time. Hopefully my stomach can handle it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic and fast paced","review":"I have been waiting and waiting for this book. I finally finished it in 2 days. It was a great book. Mo Hayder made a fantastic debut with this novel.I must warn you though, you need a strong stomach for some of the very very graphic scenes that Hayder's describes. In fact one was so awful, I actually felt nauseous. Nonetheless the plot is fantastic and well constructed.I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves to be a bestseller","review":"Considering what makes it to the best sellers list, Birdman definitely deserves the sales more.

Yes it is gory but that's this particular reader's preference. Sure it is ugly and I read to be shocked. And I was. I found it took me a little while to get into this book, hence my decision to give it 4 stars. However, once the author had grabbed my attention, she had it - I couldn't put the damn thing down! Halfway through, a major plot change happened and left me thinking \\"What the heck?\\" and I couldn't wait to finish it. I loved this book. I gave it to a friend of mine - and she too has the same opinion. If you want background and thorough reasoning to why killers kill - keep with true crime, if you want a great fast-paced interesting fiction story about killing, then this is it. I can't wait to read another of this author's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly away Birdman.","review":"Yipes. What an ugly little book this is. Not that the gruesomeness affected me so much but the fact that someone has not only tried to stake out Thomas Harris' territory but also his terse, diamond-like prose.

This is an excellent writer and the personal details of the hero's life are much more fascinating than the murder mystery.

Michael Ponti, after showing off excessively in the Romantic Piano Concerto Series by VoxBox, burns these Russian heavy-chords repretoires right out of the bat. Tchaikovsky's composition ideas tend to drag a bit with long orchestration, but the robust speed of this recording make it not a drag at all.This is an excellent recording for those rare concertos of Tchaikovsky, while the piano concerto 1, which has been recorded to death, was well performed as well. The recording quality is slightly off due to it is a relatively older one (ADD), but it is defintely worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's something wrong with this.....","review":"I agree with a few other reviewers - there is something different about this.

Furthermore, I am a federally certified court interpreter for Spanish and have become acquainted with the speech patterns of all Spanish-speaking countries without exception.Now Ms. Berger clearly is unable to construct a correct sentence in Spanish. Much of her pseudo-Spanish is a crude translation from French and/or Italian. She does get some things right, but spoils it by failing to specify where such words and phrases are used. Cusswords are among the terms which most vary from country to country. A Spaniard curses completely differently from a Mexican or Argentine.All in all, a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book consists of what its title suggests: Mierda","review":"This form does not allow a rating of NO STARS, so I had to give it one, even though it doesn't deserve it.

I suspect playing slide guitar really freed up his expression and he brought that to his regular playing.

The thought of my little guys growing up so fast makes me sad for me; but excited at the prospect of what they'll be when they grow up...all the possibilities life will offer them. Bottom line this book says it all, exactly what any parent would wish for their children, the simple joys of life and to let them know how deeply they are loved.

After the first chapter, I was completely involved with the caracters and story. The author draws you into the story by presenting fantastic alien caracters and societies while at the same time, relaying the most basic of human needs; freedome. This is a definate page-turner.

The alien characters are a good blend of human and animal characteristics. The story of The Golden One, who was kidnapped, found and raised by the princess, discredited and exiled, is an alien Moses. There's also a subplot of a young thief. Although the story left me with a feeling of satisfaction and some resolution, I almost wish I had waited for the rest of the trilogy to come out. The cliffhanger ending only leaves the heroine disillusioned about the Viis, swearing vengence on her former friend, the Vir princess, and sold to a gladiator trainer. The whole point of this book seems to be preparing her for a rebellion. It left me asking, \\"What happened to the rest.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, boring, and it aint SF.","review":"This book really sucked.1. It is not science fiction, and hardly even fantasy.2. The story is not compelling even a little.3. The characters are not interesting, and I felt no compassion for them.I can't believe that they think that they can squeak another 8 books out of this no-brainer. The entire tri-triology is completely predictable from the opening paragraphs of the book. The story is nothing but a cheap rehash of the same story told much better many times. Ever heard of Ben-Hur. Call the slave races moors and turks instead of dogs and cats and it's the same thing only of much lesser quality.In the future I will be careful of the following, and I recommend to all to do the same:1. Don't buy a book that tells you it's the first of nine. They've already decided that there is some merit in a story that no one has read yet.2. Don't buy anything that is labelled a \\"collaboration\\".3. A book by a movie studio?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Once in a great while","review":"a book comes along that really inspires you... to vomit. Of the many books of sci-fi schlock I've poured through in my lifetime, this one is one of the worst.

It seems by the 170th page of boring melodrama the author was in such a hurry to cut it short to fufill \\"trilogy\\" requirements she railroaded the characters into confusing and counter-intuitive behavior. I re-read the last part of the book to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and I wasn't. I haven't bothered to read the next two books in the saga. Usually, a first installment of a saga is supposed to grip you, not repulse you. And this did such a wonderful job of repulsing me I refused to even continue with the series.

It's just another book about a race of people who have slaves and one of them decides to break free from thier evil ways.

This book is not just Star Wars in sheep's clothing, despite the word Lucasfilm's in the title. But, if you like Star Wars (especially Young Jedi Knights) chances are you'll like this, too. And I have indeed read that this trilogy, too, is supposed to be part of a trilogy-of-trilogies. But it is NOT another Star Wars.

Still a great martial arts shoe.I bought my first pair at Brandon Lai's kung fu store in SF. The white with stripes are kind of funky looking but make for a great alternative to Chuck Taylors.

However, when I did receive my shoes they were a bit big on me so I had to return them. I had to pay another $15 to UPS to exchange them for a size 44 - 10.5 US. I got the new shoes, but they were still a bit big on me to the point that I could easily slip my index finger in the back of the shoe even while I'm wearing socks and shoe inserts.

The low backs make it easy to do lower stances without the shoe getting in the way (I found to be the case with other work out shoes). Plus they're comfortable enough you'd want to wear them around regularly.

Admittedly, you feel every thing as you're walking, running, etc and that's great.

My Kickboxing instructor has a shoes policy, and he didn't care for my more hiking style of shoes. Well, I got these, and they cover all the bases. Not great for driving, or if you want a lot of traction, but they are exactly what you need for working a heavy bag, or just simple in gym work. You could run in them, but it's not worth it unless it's in the middle of class. In all, it's the right price for a great pair of shoes. BTW, you may want to order a little small on these, as mine are just on the loose side of things, and there's limited overlap of the sides.

And I must say, I have not been disappointed in the least.

They're very comfortable and seem well made, for the price. I use them mostly in an indoor, padded floor training environment and they work well for that. Also nice for just casual weekend wear.

The only thing that I don't like about it is that if you stand to much on your tippie toes, they tend to actually open up a hole in the sole after some time. That happen with the last 2 pairs I've had. But otherwise, they are comfy and they look cool too, so I can use them casually as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shoe For the Price","review":"I've owned 3 or 4 pairs of these shoes. They are great shoes to slide for just walking around, going to the gym, or running. The thick rubber that surrounds most of the top part of the shoe does great against the rain. The only caveat I have against these shoes is the sole of the shoe. The bottoms of these shoes wear out fast. After a few months of constant use the traction will be completely gone and stepping on wet tile will be akin to ice skating. If you continue to wear the shoes after the traction is gone you will sooner or later wear a hole through the bottom of the shoes. This has happened to the last three pairs I have had. Obviously this is not a huge deterrent from buying these shoes for me. The shoes are great and they give you that barefoot feeling for next to nothing. I originally got these to replace my Vans and have never gone back to wearing Vans. These guys might not last as long but for the price it doesn't matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be better","review":"I bought these because they were recommended as good freerunning shoes, and as it turns out they were also recommended by the Wushu team. I like them as a whole, they serve their purpose as very light and sensitive footwear. They are also very cheap, which is great. However, they don't really feel that comfortable, and the material is as you would expect for the low price. They are durable, which is nice. What bothers me most is that it feels unnatural when worn outside, on concrete and whatnot, which is where I'd like to be able to use them. The sizing was one larger than it should have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence","review":"These shoes are simple, well made, and fairly priced. My feet are wide and they fit them comfortably. Walking around town, biking in the city, climbing trees, or running about anywhere is pleasant with these form-fitted shoes.

Cheap price, cheap shoes. The Seller was supportive. The first pair was way too large. I contacted the Seller and he sent a smaller size on a fairly quick turn-around based on the regular shoe info I gave him. The second pair was a closer fit from heel through the arch of the shoe, but still too wide from the ball to the toe. The soles also have a funny feel to them. They have an uneven feel that is kind of diagonal to the shoe when you're standing in them. I was expecting to use these while doing P90X, especially Yoga X. I tried them out and went back to my regular sneakers about 1/3 the way through the routines. When I buy the replacement for these I'll actually go to a store where I can try them on.

Otherwise, awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT Western - one of the best ever","review":"It was hard for me, as a country music hater, to find any interest in Willie Nelson, but in complete contrast to his music, I think he makes a fantastic character in a western. He can actually act and act very well, portraying a crusty outlaw who serves as the unwilling mentor of a goofy country boy, played by Gary Busey. This movie develops the classic master-apprentice theme and crafts a very exciting, well thought story. This is every bit as good as The Magnificent Seven or The Outlaw Josey Wales.

That's too bad, because William D. Wittliff's literate, poetic script shows genuine feeling for -- and an insider's knowledge of -- the American West. With memorable performances from Willie Nelson and Gary Busey, \\"Barbarosa\\" is worth seeing. Unfortunately, the full-frame video transfer here is awful.

While I agree, and that is the reason I am buying this collection, in defense of Mill Creek, they have been using 9 Gigabyte discs for some time in their multiple movies per disc collections, although I can't say for sure that was done in the other collection he mentions. Many dvd players have in the on screen display a reading of the megabytes per second the disc is putting out. One can tell the quality by the amount it is reading. 5 megabytes per second and higher is optimum quality, and you will know you are getting the best possible by that reading, although length of the movie also determines this somewhat, and if you have a movie that is over 90 minutes, a reading of around 4 megabytes per second is still optimum quality.

I showed my husband how it worked when he came home, and he was amazed how something so simple in design could do the peeling of garlic so effortlessly. I used to pound on the garlic clove with the side of a knife as the chefs teach you to do, and managed to cut myself on the knife, being the klutz that I am, so this is the answer to my garlic peeling problems. In fact, I ordered one for my daughter and my BFF...I know they will just love it! If you use a lot of fresh garlic, my recommendation is to buy this peeler...you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kt","review":"Love how this little gadget makes it easy to peel fresh garlic for dinner.

Hatsuhary and Momiji start at her school, and she meets the dreaded Akito face to face for the first time. Later, Tohru meets Yuki's older brother, a man so full of himself he overflows and drowns everyone in range. Ayame is hilarious--imagine Shigure with five times the ego, five times the enthusiasm, and none of the wisdom. Shigure, Ayame and Hatori (who all went to school together) play off one another brilliantly. Fun and sadness both on this disc, as the anniversary of her mother's death approaches, Momiji confides his own troubles to Tohru, and Hana begins to realize the idea that Tohru is growing apart from her. Tohru also meets Kisa, a Sohma child whose problems come from outside the family (for a change.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Gift","review":"This was a gift for my 14 year old niece who loves \\"anime\\".

The book appears to be just a compilation of the journal articles earlier published by the author. As a result, the book lacks integrity, and many parts have been unnecessary duplicated in most chapters.The book doesn't provide any serious theoretical background that would support and help to interpret most experimental results. Since most experiments described in the book have been performed on very specific samples, the book would be of some interest for a limited audience only.

The section on him alone is almost unreadable as spelling mistakes abound. Crassus is often spelled as Orassus and Ckassus not just once or twice, but literally throughout. The order of mistakes is random yet regular. This leads me to believe the contents of a printed book were scanned and uploaded to a program that takes lifts characters off an image, in which certain characters were not properly electronically transmitted. Rivalry is spelled Eivalry, Rome is spelled Eome (Romans become Eomans), Gaius is Oaius. This is a real shame, as this is a good, concise work that deserves better than this. Too laborious to get through, and a waste of $3 (we're not all as well-to-do as Crassus!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic set","review":"So many the world over have latched onto this Slatkin set for so many years, that it's of classic status...and there are good reasons.First, the St. Louis Symphony is a jewel with technique at full service of the music. Slatkin's control and insight is imparted to the orchestra so fully that they all disappear and the spirit of the composer is quite simply summoned before the listener. The result is engulfing and absorbing. No greater accolade can be given to conductor and orchestra for accomplishment in the recording arts.Marc Aubort and Joanna Nickrenz deserve kudos for their careful engineering of the sonic picture and sensitivity to the character of the congenial venue. Their work has survived the innumerable issues of these performances...and while it might be at its best on clean vinyl, it's commendable here, too.Quite simply a classic release that sets itself apart, despite the laudatory accomplishments of Ormandy, DeWaart, Previn among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is the tits","review":"Love it.

This game didn't even bother to have all your characters request your help in a dungeon which I enjoyed in the other games. You are pretty much stuck with Black rose in this game and I liked other characters much better. One good point about this game is once you have SAVED \\"The World\\" you do get to continue to play and get item completion with some side dungeon quests added in. The problem is I kind of lost interest as I was no longer playing to complete a story but just for fun. After 4 games of the same fighting, this doesn't add much interest to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for price, not game","review":"I give this one star for its price, not the game itself.

It really is quite a different beast than what most people would consider Spaghetti. It tastes more like a pungent herbal version that is as to spaghetti what a veggie burger is to a hamburger. In a similar fashion, opinions are going to vary widely and I've found that many people recoil a bit because they simply weren't expecting it to taste so different. That doesn't make it bad, by any means, but I would suggest that you don't start with a whole case.

I have to say I was really disappointed in the flavor. It wasn't really a tangy flavor but rather a strong and somewhat bitter flavor. The noodles were very sub par as well. My husband and children wouldn't eat this and I ended up making sandwiches for dinner. I would not recommend this product unless you have that nostalgia for it.

The love and lust could be felt. a good quick easy read"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was one of those couldn't put down","review":"I probably should read it again before commenting. I can over look grammar errors as long as the story flows and makes me feel good. This is that story. I still have it in my library. I go back and forth between BDSM, Paranormal, and to good ole fashion romance stories. The one thing that I all must have is a Hero and Heroine what they do in between is what makes it spicy and can't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Was Hooked...","review":"I do admit that one of the reason I downloaded this e-book was because of the hot cover! But what kept me hooked was this budding romance between Cole and Elinor. One thing that was a bit disappointing was how soon it ended. Great job to Carol Rose for such a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always....","review":"Title says it all. Pretty good book. This book kept my interest and made me want to continue reading it even when I should have been busy doing other things."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really loved this book","review":"I really loved this book, it has a really good story which I loved very much. I. Could not put it down till I finished reading it.Thank you very much for writing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocky & Bullwinkle","review":"I wanted to start with first season. Don't remember why I chose the 3rd Season first. I usually catch this show when it's half over.Now it's available to watch any time. I only watched the first dvd so far. Cute show."},{"rating":"2","title":"My boyfriend loved it.","review":"I purchased all three for my boyfriend because he LOVES rocky & bullwinkle. He loves it and watches it at least 2-3 times a month. In watching it with him (every now and then of course) it takes us back and makes us laugh. Enjoy folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocky and Bullwinkle DVDs","review":"Great Rocky and Bullwinkle memories. Extremely happy with this purchase in every way! Hope Moose and Squirrel seasons 4 and 5 will be made available soon.Note: Due to a power failure during the data entering process this purchase received only two stars. We purchased all three seasons and they are all FIVE STARS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saturday Morning Cartoon Junkie part 3","review":"They have done it again. Good work Sony. Hope to see Season 4 & 5 soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullwinkle all the way","review":"I fondly remember Bullwinkle and Rocky, but as I watch them now I understand all the jokes that obviously went over my head as a child, kind of like SpongeBob does today - (watch the Spongebob episode where Sandy's bosses come to see her inventions and Patrick and Spongebob show him the \\"Hair-cutting, back rubbing, nose picking, ukulele tuner\\" and you'll see what I mean!! (\\"it's now feeding me this delicious pudding!\\") Anyway, I question Amazon's dating. They have all three seasons of Bullwinkle dated 1959, this can't be correct can it? If the first season was '59, then season two should be 1960, three 1961 etc. Also, was there only three years of Bullwinkle? Seems to me there was more, or maybe I was just in the re-run stage! At any rate, a top notch show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the best cartoons","review":"These cartoons, included with the Rocky and Bulwinkle show are just the best, funniest cartoon ever on tv and even at my age I still laugh at them. Glad I made the purchase of the DVDs. And I recommend buying them via Amazon, as the price is surely the best you will find. Forget your age, these cartoons are great, for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic design flaw","review":"This is a great idea, but this particular item has a design flaw. The first three days I used this, it worked perfectly. On the fourth day, it uploaded only 30% of the steps I had logged that day. When I contacted tech support, they informed me that \\"sort of external interference that caused it to reset and loose data\\". They listed many possible causes: airport x-rays, cellular phones, wireless routers, speakers, and -yes!- treadmills. Be aware that this device may not work around computers and treadmills because it was designed without shielding. This seems a foolish thing to overlook in a device meant to measure walking and then be connected to a computer to upload data. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good products, bad company support","review":"I purchased the similar iStep X2 around a year and a half ago. It worked great, as described by other reviewers, with a fairly accurate step count, good upload capability, and many more features than I ever needed.However, the initial unit died within the first 6 months, and the warranty replacement died at about one and a half years. At this point SportBrain is saying since it only has a 1 year limited warranty they won't repair it, replace it, nor sell me a refurbished unit at a discount.If you are happy with having to replace it every year or two its a good product, but I expect a bit more longevity out of my purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"SportBran iStep X Pedometer","review":"The concept for the pedometer is great. That is, a pedometer that allows you to keep track of your activity on a computer. The downside is that you are limited to the SportBrain Web site. It would be great if someone would produce a pedometer that has software that can be used on a computer without enrolling on a specialized Web site. Other than that, the pedometer is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Libro desconocido (por no decir inventado)","review":"Digamos que conozco personalmente toda la obra de mi compatriota Conny Méndez... y a éste título NO LO CONOZCO.Como están las cosas en el mundo editorial actualmente, no me sorprendería que estén haciendo con Conny lo mismo que hacen con Saint Germain: usan sus nombres para publicar material de autoría de otros... por motivos comerciales, por supuesto!A pesar de que no me gusta hablar mal de nada ni de nadie, toda vez que rechazo tanto la piratería como el engaño, en esta ocasión hago una excepción."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK soundtrack","review":"This is an OK soundtrack. I just wish the songs were longer. And I was disappointed that \\"Silent Worship\\" wasn't on there either. Other than that, I think the music is heavenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"GORGEOUS MUSIC!","review":"I abosolutelt loved the movie, and I love this soundtrack! The songs are all so peaceful and well orchestrated. I can't really explain how beautiful this music is! I'll just say that if you liked the movie, you'll like this soundtrack. Or even if you didn't like the movie (how could you?), you will like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Butter-Yellow Mischief for your Tea and Scones","review":"Although I've qualms with the movie's distributor, I cannot deny that the soundtrack for \\"Emma\\" is one of the most charming, delightful, mischievous, bright, skipping, tripping, happy CD's out there. From the windblown main theme, to the plucked strings of Emma's many schemes, to the Christmas carriage ride, to Regency Dance music (sans Sir Beveridge's Maggot - alas!), Ms. Portman has done an excellent job capturing the spirit of Jane Austen's classic novel. An excellent addition to anyone's musical library, a must for lovers of soundtracks - Austen ones in particular, and a great CD for both the office and the arbor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashback!","review":"The second deepest well of retrospective humor is the emploee/employer relationship. My dad worked on the Hanford Project in the Tri-Cities and I remember seeing some of these cartoons later, still as a child. It was great to see and savor them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's funny!","review":"Here we have another cheap horror picture with a predictable ending about a mad killer who dons a mask and runs loose killing college coeds. So, what else is new?Flat, emotionless, and wooden. These are only a few of the words I can come up with to describe whatever it was that the players in this flick were trying to pull off. The acting was so bad, in fact, that I think it gives lousy acting a bad rap. Such films are good to watch once in a while, I suppose, for research. That is, so that one can see just how bad bad acting can get. It can make one appreciate the slightly better films a little bit more. Flicks like \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" and \\"Halloween\\" look like \\"Gone With The Wind\\" in comparison to this crap. It deserves the one star, however, for the simple fact that it kept me laughing my tail-end off the whole way through. It was clearly intended to be serious, and frightening, but came off as just being a comedy of moviemaking errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"a taste of africa.","review":"the album is a mix of african and themes. the music is interesting and stays in your mind. however it is not quite as good as a stand alone cd, but it suits the movie very well. if you are looking for something diferent then give it go. if you loved the movie then you will probobly enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Catch Theme","review":"This score is one of my favourites now. The Main Theme is one of the more hummable, and the Irish dance works well with the African drums and vocals. Reminds me a little of Congo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey","review":"Good music, but the price is out of this world. Selling at the low price of $75. How many soundtracks cost this much?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad it's no longer in stock . . .","review":". . . because this is one of the most astounding film soundtracks I've ever heard. The late Jerry Goldsmith mixes Celtic sounds with Kenyan melodies, and it works perfectly in the film. The action sequences are intense, the slow movements are lyrical, and the main theme is pretty catchy. I would recommend this to every Goldsmith fan . . . if they bring it back in stock.Grade: A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gundams, Gundams, and more Gundams!!!","review":"This game has just what I like. Alot of Gundams!! Over 70 models to be exact. You heard me over 70!!(and yes this includes Gundam Seed, G Gundam, and Gundam Wing). Now to the gameplay. yep you guessed it all the battles are in space. This game also features a bunch of storyline's and cutscenes from the anime including a Gundam story exclusive to the game called Thourouhbread.(I know I spelled that wrong). Anyways supurb graphics, hours of gameplay, and over 70 gundams is the reason why Gundam Encounter's in space is one of the best Mecha based games ever made!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great game for gundam fans","review":"This is a great game to put it simply, its a must have for a gundam fan. Once you get used to the controls its fun to play but its a little diffucult at times.The redone anime scenes are great. Its best to do everything at least once in this game, I say this because you will earn more things. This game isn't like federation vs. zeon you will not be doing all those fancy moves. But it has more mobile armors and this is all space and one level with some air combat in the texas colony.Heres a tip for the battle of solomon in white base modeyou will be told to protect two salamis cruisers but instead of quickly destoying enemy mobile suits to protect them, let them be destroyed or help destroy them, doing this will make the mission longer allowing you to earn an S.And i know this is a horrible review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is Gundam so popular in U.S?","review":"Gundam's been around since the 70's. What is with all the hype about this game? I bet people who likes this are geeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Children's Books Ever","review":"As a student of children's literature, I must say the Friends-4-Ever books are some of the best i have ever read. They put The Babbysitters Club to shame. These books deal with real issues important to real girls. Many life lessons can be learned from these books, and I recommend them to every girl. Scholastic MUST bring these books back."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Your horse soon leaves Asfaloth far behind\\"","review":"This book was never actually published. Along with several other planned books in the \\"Middle-earth Quest\\" series, it was cancelled for legal reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dealing wit the devil","review":"I first read this book shortly after being saved, I would strongly recomend it for new and old Christians . This book gives you a practical insight to the warfare that we are in and helps you to recognize the enemy before there is a crisis.Reading this book gave me the tools I needed to fight the devil and win because it taught me how to use God's word and to depend more on the power of God and less on myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book for beginning to intermediate drummers.","review":"This is a well written book with great advice. Having been a drummer for a few years, I thought this book would be a joke but was pleasantly surprised. Not only does the author cover the technical aspects of percussion (i.e. standard rudiments, rock and jazz grooves, tuning tips, etc..) but the interviews are wonderful too. It's a treat to get advice from a legendary drummer such as Hal Blain. Don't pass this little gem up. Michael Miller did his homework and offers great advice for the novice (I'm not a novice and learned a thing or two). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I got the Dummies title first, which is usually the case. However, it was very disappointing. I then checked out the Idiot's Guide title. It was just what I was looking for.It has all the necessary information and is not too sparse or too thick on any areas. Definitely recommended for people wanting to get started in drumming."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for awesome info minus 1 for the bad music pages","review":"this book gives you some awesome info for reading if you are a beganning drummer, but the music in the book that the author provides is not. it's better to learn music with a professional teacher, then from a book. if you want some good reading for your beginning drummer then get this book it has everything from: buying your first set, cleaning your set, taking care of it, changing heads, it covers other parts of the percussion family besides drumset ect. get this today you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motsenbocker Lift Off #3 Stain Remover","review":"Product is absolutely 100% WORTHLESS - simply does not workTried it on a number of items - waste of time"},{"rating":"2","title":"A work in progress","review":"I got this cleaner for my daughter to use on her daughter's artwork with a black permanent marker on the carpet. She used several other cleaners and then this one. She said it definitely helped but will repeat the cleaning of the carpet to see if it will clean even more of the stain. She was please with thejob it did do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to appreciate","review":"Mongolia is a beautiful, sparsely populated country with many incredible scenes. It is way off most people's radar, isn't that why we refer to it to describe something unusual or far away? Things you know little to nothing about are always mysterious. It is far away, exotic and people think and act differently than the average Westerner. Dark and muddy as these photos portray isn't how it is.There are people who find beauty in this type of photographs, I am not one of them. I would not recommend this book, either for the photos or any information or insight into Mongolia or the people."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sent it back","review":"The photos were blurry, maybe that was done on purpose to make the subject more mysterious. I have read all of the books on Mongolia and this is the only one I sent back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun AND Educational","review":"Out of the 6 games we purchased, this is definitely my 4-year old's favorite game. He got it 2 months ago for Christmas and still plays it for literally hours at a time. The great thing about most of the Leapster games is that they are fun as well as educational, and this game is one of the best in my opinon as far as teaching kids educational things while still being entertaining enough for them to keep an interest in it.3 Levels of difficulty is a nice option, because it allows the child to get more use out of the game. Once they've mastered learning the digits and counting single digits, they can move on to double-digits and adding, subtracting, etc. Also teaches how to write the numbers which I thought was a nice bonus.GREAT educational and FUN game, especially for children who normally lose interest in things rather quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good learning tool for preschoolers","review":"I bought this game for my daughter who just turned 5 and got the L-Max for Christmas. She loves playing this game, and in addition to helping her master number recognition, this game helps her motor skills and hand/eye coordination. My daughter (who is very active) will sit quietly and play this game for long stretches at a time, allowing me to finish whatever project I'm working on. I feel good knowing she's learning and not just being babysat by technology. This was a really good purchase for my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Game","review":"My 4 yo daughter has had this game for nearly a month and she loves it. She rarely plays with her other games now. She loves to talk about it and tell me all about \\"Counting on Zero\\" and how he \\"saves the day\\". This was a smart buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Numbers on the Run Leapster L-Max Game","review":"This game was purchased for our 4 yr. old son, and he's really enjoyed playing it. It is a little difficult- but, in my mind, it should be- it means he has something to learn! There's learning number sequences, recognizing numbers, adding, etc..it's great. I really like that it includes learning to write the numbers, too. Parents will have to help their kids out some, but isn't that part of being a parent? It's fun, educational, and well made. I'm very pleased with this game, and will purchase more like it, definitely! Oh, and by the way, it is a game that I believe a child will be able to enjoy up until they're around 5 or 6 years old, so it's one that will be played more than a year, if your child is between 4 and 5 yrs. old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for two door BMW.","review":"Definitely cool product for holding jacket or coat...until you put the seat back and it falls to the floor. Perhaps useful for a four door...but not for a two door. I would not purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product and great price","review":"It was exactly what I was looking for and could not get a better price . Sturdy and durable. We used it for around our pool to keep the stone in place.It was at our door in less than a week after ordering it, with regular shipping. I would buy this again and highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad.","review":"I would heartily recommend skipping this book. I feel obligated to read a book through to its conclusion (to give the author every chance to make the point he's trying to make). This was a torturous experience for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate ghost story collection","review":"To my mind, this is the ultimate ghost story collection by the ultimate ghost story writer. Every story in this book is a masterpiece of M.R. James' art -- these are classics of their genre. If you like British Edwardian ghost stories, track this book down and read it -- it's the perfect companion for a dark night by the fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very nice for the price! One critical note.","review":"Overall, an OK flashlight. One button for white, one button for red is more intuitive than a single button that cycles through four modes (white, red, white + red, off). Three LEDs each for red and white. Decent illumination for two AA batteries. Nice shape and balance when using, seemingly solid construction. Included sheath has side pocket for two additional batteries.However ... one huge design flaw is no lanyard anchor point. A flashlight of this size really needs a wrist lanyard.Update: another huge design flaw is the rubber membrane button covers. The rubber splits and the plastic button plunger falls out. This is on two units after very moderate use.(Quite frankly, I would recommend looking at the Coast 1106 here. Similar in size and build. Metal buttons. Significantly brighter. Close to just half the price. This is what I am using now and I'm quite happy with it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice flashlight","review":"Bought this for use while stargazing, to look at star maps and not ruin my night vision. Nicely constructed, very bright light ((white or red). Carrying case with belt loop and compartment for extra batteries is also helpful. Size is nice too - thin, not bulky like some red beam lights. Very pleased so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"I bought this for my new rental home with 4 other roommates. The red light option is great to avoid disturbing others, for maintaining night vision, and for not attracting insects. Red lights are often used for night boating, so this flashlight would also be very useful for that as well. I love the Smith & Season brand. This adds to my collection: .38 revolver, protective lenses, and mini ear plugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed.","review":"I bought this to use while stargazing. It is the perfect accessory for setting up my telescope. It gives me the versatility of both white and red light."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best LED flashlights","review":"I love this flashlight, I always make sure to have one handy. The red is great for when you want to see something in the dark but don't want a high powered light and obviously the white is awesome for lighting up large areas. The build feels very durable so I don't think it will be breaking anytime soon. I liked it so much I have one for each of my vehicles and one in the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for astronomy","review":"This is great for astronomy. White flashlight for setting up and taking down equipment -- red for looking at star charts -- all in one inexpensive package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flashlight","review":"I bought this for my husband who is a pilot.He says it has:Good battery lifeVery brightPortableGreat for reading maps while flying at nightCame with caseIt was a good buy for the price. He's very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So-so for astronomy","review":"Bought this flash light specifically for reading star charts at night. Can't really comment on the white light, but the red light was much too bright. Couldn't figure out how to disemble it to remove/downgrade the LEDs. I just took a black sharpie to the lens and that significantly dimmed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Up","review":"Obviously the viewer is making a leap of faith when he/she decides to believe Jonas is telling us the truth about any of this. I felt we watched an interesting, heart-warming movie about his life of late, but I couldn't help feeling a bit 'off' about it all. I wanted to be convinced, but he rung false to me, I got that vibe D:If I'm wrong, I wish him and his family all the best. And regardless of any powers, working on spirituality is brave and important.The fact that he was a film maker before anything happened to him also made me put my guard up. Getting J.Z Knight in the film only made things worse, she's so dicey, and finding that out is only a google search away... did he do that?I did enjoy the segments with the energy healer, and the sufi mystic, they had some interesting contributions to make.I give the film 5/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"good title because you will sleep through it","review":"What a huge disappointment! We thought this was to be more informative. It was just a whining girlfriend ( no point to her being part of this dvd) the experts in this dvd was the only reason to watch it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Was disappointed. All it was was how he came to see things that others don't see. Also showed him running all over the country trying to get a handle on his situation. I got the feeling this guy needed money so he made a \\"documentary.\\" The DVD was hyped as something different than what it contained. Don't know exactly what I was expecting, but that wasn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack luster","review":"The worst DVD purchase I've made in years! A big waste of money. If you're embarking upon a truthseeking journey I recommend \\"Down The Rabbit Hole, What the Bleep Do We Know\\" or \\"Something Unknown Is Doing We Don't Know What\\" instead. Persevere"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will not be disappointed","review":"I own a lot of music and listen to a number of different genres, and this album ranks in the top 10 albums in my collection.

Its the type of music that transcends taste and age to appeal to anyone who likes quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"I like Greyboy's style very much.The music moves and is cool. I listen to it while I am walking I the city ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Access 2000 Programming - A Crashed Course","review":"I was very disappointed in this book! Within the Preface, Acknowledgements and the First Session alone there were miss-spelled and missing words, and references to applications that didn't work. Granted, it does say it that you must have Access 2000, but even with Access 2000 this book is more of a crash than a crash course. My recommendation.... look for information on Access 2000 elsewhere! You get what you pay for here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your time on this book.","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this book. The authors should hang their heads in shame. This book WILL NOT teach you programming in 15 hours.Even the CD-Rom that accompanies the books is a waste of time. The sample CheckWriter program didn't work correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"weekend crash course???","review":"This book is totally useless. It's more of a \\"I wrote a checkwriter program, you wanna see some of my code?\\" than a useful training manual. I understand a 15 hour book can't cover everything extensively but come on. It says it has 30 focused lessons. Well a focused lesson to me means the book says \\"go here and do this and now look at the results\\". I'm over a third way through the book and I'm still looking for something that says \\"Here is an exercise and let's do it\\". If you want a book where you can look at someone else's code get this one, but if you want a book that starts with the basics and helps you learn to apply the fundamentals don't waste your money. Oh well, back to the book store!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Book & CD","review":"I received my book and was so excited about reading up on programming in Access2000. I know a bit about about programming and I know Access2000 somewhat, however, this book jumps around too much. Their are NO instructions on setting up the CD-Rom, so your on your own their. When you finally figure out how to get the files off the CD they do not come up. You have to keep digging until you find the files shown in the dialog box at the top of the illustrations. The book never says what file to retrieve. Once you do find the files they do not match the book. The idea of a book like this is to TEACH me programming, not have me trying to figure out what the author is doing and debugging this book. Didn't learn much. In fact, I may return the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"Learn Access in 15 hours? No way. The authors sound more like consultants trying to sell you a product than instructing you on the basic building blocks. I use Access 2000 for plenty of database development and wanted to delve deeper into the programming aspect. This book falls well short of the what the title presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content doesn't deliver what title promises","review":"I'm an MIS professional. From this book's title and a quick browse at the bookstore, I thought it would be just what I needed to quickly come up on Access VBA, given my experience (including Access database design and Word VBA). Wrong! There's no way you could spend a weekend with this book and come away with anything more than theoretical knowledge, because there's no chance to apply anything.Incredibly, there are no step-by-step exercises in the book and no practice databases on the CD. What looked, at first glance, to be exercises actually turned out to be just explanations in numeric form. Apparently, connecting the book's explanations with the CD's finished code (a time-consuming exercise in itself) is supposed to teach you all you need to know about Access VBA. I've taught enough computer courses to know it just doesn't work that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Book & CD","review":"I was disappointed in the book and CD. They did not go together and your on your own when it comes to figuring out which file to use as an example. I spent more time trying to figure out what to do with the files than actually learning. Not much help here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soho Decor","review":"Outstanding product and service. Could not promise Christmas delivery but came right on time.

I use the Kindle app on my iPad and Macbook and my only compaint is that the page numbers in the software don't match the page numbers in the physical copy of the book. This was an optional book for a class I was taking, so there was a little difficulty in matching the recommended page numbers on the syllabus with those of the version I was attempting to read. I don't fault the book, this is a software issue - just wanted to make sure that potential buyers are aware of the fact. Anyway, on to the substance: this is a good book. It really makes some of the dry opinions that you read in the textbook come to life with lots of well written and researched background and history of the cases. You get a much better picture of the litigation strategies and social/cultural climate that surrounded these cases. I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Music, but Terrible Recording Quality","review":"This is my second attempt to obtain a playable copy of this 2 CD set. Maurice Abravenel and the Utah Symphony did a good job of interpeting this fantastic music, but VOX did not do their part. The first set of CD's bombed shortly after starting CD no. 1. I notified Amazon and they promptly sent me a second sealed set. The first time through was okay, but on the third playing, CD no. 1 again failed. It is not playable.

This is an exceptional story illustrating what Vietnam War POW's had to endure. Mr Dengler is a hero and a credit to the Navy and our Armed Services. Awesome!! His determination to escape from his captors and return home was truly inspirational. I hope to meet this man and shake his hand someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"just get an LED flashlight","review":"I got this since I had a smaller version of it that I liked.

The Improvement in Halo was incredible, and all the three major graphics (specular, shadows, decals) became available. This card also features Hardware T&L so games like KOTOR, Call of Duty, and Rainbow Six 3 became playable when on the integrated graphics they were not. However when you are upgrading from integrated graphics you must think ahead! Before shutting down to install the card, disable the onboard graphics in the device manager, and make sure you have the latest drivers (it is a 10 meg download so if you have 56K get it ahead of time). one final thing: do not have any cards under this one because the fan will reverberate and make an extremely annoying sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but problems","review":"I recently bought one of these cards.

It sets out in plain English some of the common legal pitfalls landlords run into and how to avoid them. The books cites examples - some quite frightening - of how these pitfalls occur and the appropriate action to take. The book clearly outlines the differences in particular laws between the states. It explains all aspects of landlord law from finding goods tenants to dismissing bad tenants. The book makes a great desk reference and it's cheaper than a lawyer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but enjoyable and cost-effective nonetheless.","review":"I first bought this title mainly because of my interests in Mozart's 3 Wind Serenades. This is one of the few titles out there that actually include all three (serenades 10, 11, and 12). Most other recordings only include 11 and 12, the two smaller serenades. When I first bought this CD, I half-way expected mediocrity because of its low price. However, I soon discovered that, while this is not exactly the definitive recording of the 3 serenades out on the market, it is nevertheless quite a jewel. The execution is precise for the most part, and the musicality is good. To top it all off, arrangements of \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" and \\"Cosi fan tutti\\" for a wind ensemble are also included. Familiar with the \\"real\\" versions of both pieces, I nevertheless enjoyed the alternative arrangements. These lighter, \\"cuter\\" arrangements of the two famous operas are simply wonderful. This double CD set is truly a bargain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trot along with this lively duo!","review":"This book was a delightful surprise!

I think that it is a wonderful CD to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Edited Version?","review":"This book was advertised as \\"exciting historical fiction,\\" and the author has an interesting way of interjecting his real-life characters into actual historical events ala James Michener. But unlike a Michener novel, these stories left me wanting more. I don't need to know how the Texas hills were created by volcanic upheaval, or how the dinosaurs turned into oil deposits, to enjoy a story about Texas oilmen.I did find myself wishing a few of the events, such as the double murder that goes along with the oilmens' story, had gotten a little more play. But all in all, this book was very much like reading the abridged version of a Michener novel, which was very appealing for me. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning to read Spanish","review":"This book just happens to fit my reading level on my road to learning Spanish. I also went to Audible.com and purchased the audio-book version to assist in my 'hearing' Spanish. The book is interesting and has a varied vocabulary and is on an adolescent or adult level.

But, why is not included the Academy Awards nominated song \\"How Do I Live?\\" (with music and lyrics by Diane Warren) sung by the outstanding Trisha Yearwood??. I'm really dissapointed in this sense. In my personal opinion, this song deserved to win the Oscar, instead of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" (from \\"Titanic\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the score - not a soundtrack!","review":"I had hoped that this CD would contain all the wonderful songs that were in the movie - songs from the '70s, and of course Trisha Yearwood's hit, \\"How Can I Live\\". I was disappointed to find that the entire CD is instrumental - a score, if you will. Then I tried to find an actual soundtrack, but I don't think one was ever made. Too bad. It would have made great listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb soundtrack don't have \\"How Do I Live\\"?","review":"I heard an alternate version for this song in the movie but nothing - not even the original version is found here on the soundtrack. I am not talking about one version being by Leann Rimes and the other by Trish Yearwood. I am aware that Trisha's version is the one in the movie. The alternate version heard in the movie is during the beginning. It has a saxophone solo."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sountrack is Average","review":"Hey, what can you expect from a former rock producer and a guitarist. Con Air is a great soundtrack if you really want to sit down and listen to both heavey and light guitar for an hour (?). If you dislike the guitar songs this album isn't for you. My advice is to borrow the soundtrack from a friend and record Track 8 (The Discharge). This is not the the best Soundtrack I have heard. For its type it is one of the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cd sucked because the only good song was The Discharge.","review":"I haven't really grown onto this CD because I don't really like any of the songs except for the Discharge of course because that's when they take out Garland \\"The Marietta Mangler\\" Greene (played by the very fine actor, Steve Buscemi). The other songs aren't that great but I guess that they are okay. I like the rock music in The Discharge (no particular reason of course). So in conclusion buy the CD but only for the song The Discharge. Thank You. Oh, Yeah no to mention that the pamphlet was nothing but a white piece of paper with only a few credits, NO PICTURES OF STEVE BUSCEMI! so all you Steve fans will be disappointed but you can always buy the movie, so I guess that's the up side to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This is one of the best soundtrack I've ever heard.

Professional presentation design is an illusive goal for most companies. Finkelstein's book delivers a good balance of thorough, well-illustrated description, pages full of 4-color examples and contributions from professionals in the field, which add a real world perspective to the textbook instructions. It's my experience that most presentation designers only get a handle on a small fraction of PowerPoint's capability. Books like this one will propel you well beyond the basics. I would recommend it highly.

But the Skinny is a weak movie. Too many of the conversations revolve around sexual matters, as if young gay people have nothing else to discuss. The plot is generally not creative and does not explore some of the potential issues it raises. This should really have been several films: 1) an education film to inform young people about the importance of safe sex, of staying off drugs, of taking care of each other and practicing good hygiene; 2) a reunion pic about people who stay friends although they have moved on in various ways; 3) an examination of the class conflict and questions of promiscuity and fidelity in Black Gay Culture; 4)a rom-com about two friends who rarely get laid. Good idea to call it \\"The Skinny\\" because it's a mighty thin movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved watching this!","review":"I was so glad all the characters were very appealing and kept my interest. I think the more I watch movies with different life styles I will be more excepting to it. I know these are just movies, but you can get the questions answered without putting people on the spot.

Some reviewers even claim to be anthropology students! None seemed to notice that the Pliocene was actually 3 million years long, a period of climate cooling, and a period from which many homonid fossils have been found; rather than a 12 million year long heat wave from which NO homonid fossils have been found, as presented as the only scientific \\"fact\\" upon which the book's major conclusions are based. All else is selective, slanted and foggy thought with no actual evidence even pretended by the author.This book belongs on the same shelf as \\"Chariot of the Gods,\\" another interesting story of entirely possible events presented with extremely questionable evidence. I am sure that \\"The Descent of Woman\\" makes women feel better, but I am equally sure that it is not a respected ahthropological work and not, as it claims to be, \\"the classic study of evolution.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Text offers little if any scientific merit...","review":"The book was an interesting enough read to keep in my library, but I would not consider it a legitimate argument for the Aquatic Ape Theory - nor, specifically, for the aquatically influenced evolution of the human female and the proceeding ramifications. It approaches the issue in a simplistic, unscientific manner that is not at all convincing. Keeping in mind that this book is dated (having been first published in 1972) could not save it's argument either. The Descent of Woman left just me as I was before and I'll be looking further still for writings on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Descent of Woman","review":"an interesting book. She addresses some of the problems that evolutionists blow off - such as why do women have breasts, and comes up with a logical answer that has nothing to do with \\"because that's what the men wanted\\".It takes a bit to get to the subject, but once there, she is coherent and consice, simply presenting the evidence and letting you make your own decsions about the question.Anyone who believes in evolution and is not satisfied with 6ft Homo Erectus sttod to see over the grass while 3ft Baboon did not, they moved to the ground filled with predators to make it easier to find food, this book will get you thinking.And it appears to have spawned an entire controversy as well as 4 sequels (maybe there're more)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Beverage handling capacity","review":"This cooler is great.

Because I have attended Saddleback Church for nearly 10 years, know Rick Warren personally, have listened to hundreds of his sermons, and I have even had dinner with not only he and his wife, but his father, Jimmy.Believe me, this book is no biography of Rick Warren.

This is one of the most comprehensive YET affordable WWE DVDs I've seen in a long time. Most of the other reviewers have made remarks about the poor packaging (basically they put 3 DVD's in a case made for 1) but if cheap packaging is the difference between a $22 and $35 price tag I applaud the WWE for taking the more cost effective option. Besides it's what is ON the DVDs that really counts anyway. I won't list all of the matches but there are 21 (most with entrances and pre-match remarks at least from Taker if not both wrestlers; gives a good idea of the context of the match). The only thing I would have added would be interviews with Taker regarding the different points in his career. This set is a must have for even casual wrestling fans!! Bring on the Stone Cold, Rock and Bret Hart sets!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABOUT ONE THIRD","review":"21 fights means that you've got your money's worth if you buy that 3 dvd set.Don't miss the extras on disc 1 and 3 featuring two of the UNDERTAKER's best matches against BRET HART and KURT ANGLE.Those attest to the fact that MARK is a hell of a wrestler when given the chance.The interference of BROCK LESNAR during the championship fight against ANGLE is so frustrating.I could have done without MANKIND and the stupid gimmick of the buried alive concept.KANE was certainly his greatest rival.The HELL IN A CELL fights against SHAWN MICHAELS and BROCK LESNAR are also impressive.What is missing is a bio and also the promos who are weak because THE UNDERTAKER is not the greatest speaker,but that's not very important anyway.Wrestling fans should enjoy this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!! Sweet!!!! Bout Time!!!! UT Rulz UT Rulz!!!!","review":"I have got no idea what this set is going to contain, I do however think it is going to be the absolute best WWE Bio that has ever been released and chances are that will ever be released. I do hope to see some pre-Undertaker stuff such as his matches when he worked for Jerry \\"the King\\" Lawler in Memphis as Mean Mark Calaway and the Old WCW days. His First Match in the WWF with the Million Dollar Team at Survivor Series 90, his First WWF Championship Title win over Hulk Hogan at Survivor Series 91, and all of his other WWF/WWE Title wins. His Casket Match History, His Hell in the Cell History, and his 13-0 Wrestle Mania Record. We should get to see some of his biggest rivalries such as Hogan, Yoko, HBK, Mandkind, Kane, and The Only Big Thing Brock Lesnar. This 3 Disc DVD set should have all of the elements to be the best DVD Set there is, the Best DVD Set there was, and the Best DVD Set there ever will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is how you repay the phenom??","review":"The Undertaker, one of Vince McMahons MOST LOYAL Wrestlers. Mark Callaway deserved much more of a history then what they gave him. But if I go that far than so does Hulk Hogan (Hulk Still Rules could have been longer). They also Rushed through the casing and put them all stacked on top of eachother, Ric Flair got something of a box set.

She is a joy and a hoot at the same time.What I found most fascinating was a different perspective on fidelity from other romance novels I have read, so I hesitate to call this a romance. I don't want to give any plot points away but it was so interesting that adultery is not only tolerated, it is actually encouraged and celebrated by those surrounding one of the couples.The writing is terrific and the whole novel is laden with humor and passion.

Not only is this annoying, it's just plain unacceptable.If you're a Watson fan who thinks he can do no wrong, you'll probably be happy with this.

(Although my babies are too old for chewing and that might destroy them). They have survived for 6 months at this point so well worth the money. They also come in a cute little zipper bag with a mesh bottom so he can put them into the bag in the bath and they dry out without me having to do anything.As with all squirting toys I am always concerned about the water being left inside them becoming nasty and them having them squirt it back into the tub.

Instead I ended up with one of the biggest disappointments in my DVD collection to which none of the aforementioned adjectives can be used to describe.I also just totally don't get it overall...is this an animated Web series? Why is the main episode here animated, while the extras are all live-action? It just doesn't add up.By the way, the \\"XXX\\" bonus feature (which is anything but...although it does have some actual nice-bodied women in bikinis) is far and away better than the main feature.

So many errors in sample codes and explanation, which takes a lot of time to figure out for a biginner like me. 2. From around the array/pointer, samples get suddenly difficult, and they are provided as a function. Since these functions are linked to teh main program in various ways using pointers, the absent of main program really hurts. 3. The structure gets more and more disorganized as topics get more complicated.In short, it is almost impossible for a biginner to learn C++ from this book. I readup to a half, after spending much more than weekend, but had to give up eventually. I got another non-crash book and now finally in a right track.

I started this book having no previous programming experience, and it doesn't explain things nearly well enough. Nothing is explained clearly enough for the newbie to understand.

After reading several other books on C++, I can honestly say that this book was dissapointing at best. In a beginner's eyes, it is easy to imagine how this book might seem handy. It is informative and helpful on elementary topics, and also was helpful in the respect that I had no idea where to get a compiler or how to use it. However, once the book delves into more advanced topics, it becomes apparent that1.) the author never bothered to debug and test his programs and2.) that the author is inadequate at explanations.If you have plenty of money to burn, buy this book. Otherwise, try to get a book that doesn't have some sort of false \\"in a weekend!\\" or \\"in 21 days\\" or \\"for idiots!\\" promise.

Kevin wrote all but three of the songs. On Max Stalling's \\"Freedom for Mary,\\" Kevin takes a slower approach on this classic outlaw track. Al Kooper & Ronnie VanZant wrote \\"Mississippi Kid\\" that bounces joyfully in Kevin's country rock style.

On the contrary, his music is modern, dense, complex, often atonal, but ultimately worth listening to. I immediately liked the First symphony. It is sparse, but intense. The Second symphony is more easy to understand, and the use of folk-like material more obvious. The Third and Fourth are built on motifs, which are treated unequally, and are freely varied. They need to be listened to a number of times to be rewarding, although some listeners with a musical background may think otherwise. The remaining symphonies have a neo-clasical feel with a clearer couterpoint.This is highly original music for the most part, and the only qualification I found is the playing of the LSO, while satisfying in ensemble, they seem less \\"free\\" than they could be in this music. For the price, this set is worth considering, especially for those who want to get off the beaten track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for those who don't cling to the hegemony of XVIII and XIX centuries.","review":"The only work of Chavez I knew before buying this CD set was his Toccata for percussion instruments. Now after exploring his symphonic music I don't really find that ''nationalistic'' inspiration most people relate him to but a rather more eclectic orientation as a 20th century composer he was. In these symphonies there's that mesmeric mixture of thesis that seem more acceptable to form a more modernist style, a thing I don't doubt on him now that I know he was a self-taught composer. It is Chavez' sense of orchestration what makes his musical language interesting, I specially liked the 1st, 2nd and 5th of these symphonies. I don't doubt Chavez is among the best composers of 20th century's changing classical music. I think it was worth buying this 2-CD set but let me say I've heard better interpretations of Chavez symphonies by other world orchestras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless on dried bugs","review":"I haven't had to use a bug/tar remover in many years.

For some reason, I couldn't find one on 9 year olds by that series, so I thought I'd try this 9 year old book in this series (I'd never read anything by the Tavistock Clinic). I was really disappointed! The book gave few actual characteristics of 9 year olds, but said a lot of \\"9-year olds vary greatly in this area\\" kinds of things. I found it to be very unhelpful in dealing with my 9 year old.

Organ-driven instrumentals, dub chanting, high-energy funk, a hopped-up soul number or two, a percussion maelstrom--the collection runs the organic/electric funk-jazz gamut. And I think that's a good thing. A very good thing.I'd also recommend No. 10 in the series, which has some of the same artists as No. 1: Snowboy, Mother Earth and Gregory Isaacs.

I did replace the spigot with a high end stainless steel one to attach 3/4 inch tubing to it. It was very easy to both remove the old spigot and put a new one on.

His shaggy, slightly surfer-style haircut reminds you of Duran Duran. Very cute in silly medieval costume.

It's usually rated lower than his first two, but I enjoy it more. The covers (including one of My Wife) hint John was short of material here, but they are well chosen and performed thoughtfully. The sound is an improvement over the previous two releases, particularly Whistle Rymes. Best of all, there is a fun bass solo.

It was far to short, however it seemed to drag on endlessly. There is only one action scene in the documentary at the very end, which is it's highpoint...as low as it was. I found it quite pointless to film a platoon in vietnam and then say, this person died two weeks from now...this person died four days from now...\\" I know that people died in vietnam, unfortunately, I still don't know how they fought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Exactly a Documentary","review":"Indeed, as a \\"This is what the entire Vietnam Intervention was like in its entirety\\" documentary, this falls far short. However, remove the \\"entirety\\" part, (which was probably never the goal, anyway) and \\"The Anderson Platoon\\" is revealed to be a brilliantly straightforward and nonjudgemental microscopic view of \\"a pawn in a much larger game.\\" If one is beginning a collection of Vietnam Intervention nonfiction, don't start here; still, make sure to include this before the finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I ordered this video based on the overwhelmingly high marks other viewers gave, but I cannot concur. Although some of the action scenes were enough to evoke strong emotion, overall the video is replete with irrelevant scenes like the ankle-level footage of the soldier's footsteps; bad music and nearly indecipherable narration. English subtitles would be a plus.

This cd on Vox, was originally part of the famed Vox Box series and in this case the Vox Box contained the complete Beethoven Sonatas. It won a Grand Prix de Disc when it was first released. It was a worthy recipient. Although Brendel has re-recorded the sonatas for the Philips label, this set has a freshness and vitality about it, an excitement of discovery, something missing from the Philips set. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strait forward and well executed","review":"Many consider Alfred Brendel to be one of the greatest interpreters of Beethoven's piano music. His level of accomplishment is truly amazing when you consider that he has had very little formal education and is primarily self-taught.Only the last 3 volumes of this 4 volume set address this very nice collection of the entire piano sonatas by Beethoven, played by Brendel, and well worth owning. My reasoning for only giving 4 stars is that, although I greatly enjoy and appreciate his playing, I have personal favorites of these played by others which are more endearing to my personal taste. But overall, these pieces are beautifully performed. He is consistently good and as a complete set, I would give them a 5 star. I think you would be hard pressed to find any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST","review":"One man's viewpoint: I always love Brendel's light, agile touch. Yet there's a passion here that's hard to describe. Kind of sneaks up on you. He articulates every note cleanly in these pieces too. Amazing. And ALL the LVB sonatas have something wonderful to offer. Suggest you buy all four of AB's VOX renderings. And his Diabelli's. Then I'd suggest Arrau and O'Conor. All rewarding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prehistory of Australia","review":"This was an interesting introduction to Australian prehistory. I'd not come across a similar general text on the subject before this one, although I've read some of the data as passing references in other books on prehistory. Some of the discussion on the flint technology was a little slow-going because the differences in technique, stone sources, and styles among the various periods and regions were less apparent and less engrossing to me than they obviously are to the authors. In other respects the book is an excellant starting point for anyone with an interest in Austrilia or in prehistoric culture in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Debut","review":"I loved this book.

After research on the internet, I figured out how to fix the item myself. I went to the local hardware store and bought a new touch-lamp sensor and replaced it.

Therefore Artie decides to stick up the drug dealer responsible for Diroma's death and use the money to buy a big house where he can live with the children.Is he supposed to be a 'good' cop? A bad cop isn't necessarily Harvey Keitel in Ferrara's 'Bad Lieutenant'. Innocent people get killed due to his smart idea but he gets away with it because his colleagues cover some things up.

Still, I personally kinda liked Canonball Run when it came out....But I digress. Circle Track Summer is an instant indie-movie masterpiece that is actually on par - in terms of its fast-moving, hilarious script; solid acting; and deft cinematography - with any film in its genre, big-budget or no.And did I mention there was lots of bikinis and big bosums??!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to be mistaken...","review":"..for the Godspeed side project, which was my problem when receiving this completely lukewarm sampler reeking, though perhaps not stinking, of stale techno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I first heard Curiosity on spinner (online radio) and I fell in love with it's simplistic beauty and incredible depth.

I love older movies, but just just because something is in black-and-white doesn't mean it's a classic. While Novak and Harvey- like most old time movie stars- have a certain sophistication and maturity that is lacking in today's actors, this movie fails because nothing happens to their very uninteresting characters. A medical student falls in love with a lower-class whore, who betrays him and then comes crawling back several times.

Walton tells how he met the sportscaster Marty Glickman who took him aside and told him that he had to overcome his lack of speech problem. Glickman told him how to create a working program to do this, the same way his basketball coach constructed a working program for how to win at basketball games. Walton did as Glickman asked, overcame his stuttering and became , what he is at the time of the interview, a professional sports broadcast.Much of the interview is devoted to talking basketball.

I was prepared to toss it aside as a late night \\"B\\" flick- but I was immediately swept into the story line. I was so engrossed, I hardly noticed the length of the film, and was disappointed when the credits began to roll. The sheer artistry of the movie is enough to grip even the most non-musical person. Fosse's choreography is intense and beautiful every step of the way, and it is riveting. It is easy to get wrapped up in the story, and you find yourself unsure of whether you want Joe Gideon to live or die.

The finale to which Maltin refers above is notable for its distasteful feeling, which wouldn't be forgiveable except that it's Fosse's statement about himself- and in that way it's remarkable. Few filmmakers outside Woody Allen have ever been so revealing, or so caustic.

He's never too loud, never too soft, never too harsh (even with this composer). In all the lyrical sections of these early sonatas, I find this disciplined sense of moderation to be soothing yet intense. For example in the first movement of the \\"Moonlight\\" Sonata, the soft and double soft marking are observed with assiduousness. It's subtle and not overly dramatic.Brendel's technique is more than adequate. I wonder why he is not more of a perfectionist when he plays (as he has said about his playing- \\"I am not a perfectionist.\\")All the dynamic and phrasing markings are observed diligently. He's very true to the intentions of the composer even in the little pieces such as these. And as always, he puts the composer before himself when playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMONG THE BEST!","review":"One man's viewpoint: Brendel again shows his wonderful, steady sense of rhythm. The miracle is that he can keep it rock-steady or slow it a bit for dramatic effect - only if he wants to. He has control and a clarity of vision/purpose with each piece. So of course he transmits this to us. I also notice the lightness of touch he has. And his limber agility (hard-won, no doubt).I suggest picking up on all four of Mr. Brendel's Vox recordings of the LVB sonatas. Absolutely wonderful stuff. Also consider his fine, fine Diabelli Variations on Vox. Also I suggest checking out John O'Conor's set. Fantastic! Also Claude Frank has a highly praised set; I may buy this one next (a real bargain).There are many fine players, so enjoy the search through these piano pieces of such incredible character, nobility, beauty, and boldness.

What it did not like was the ultra slow progress since the end of season 2. My favorite characters in the show were Apollo and the Number 8 who shot Adama. In the end it was Apollo who took the bull by the horns and saved Adama and Tigh. And the number 8 who shot Adama saved their bacon to many times to count.

Even if you don't agree with it, you can't argue that the performances from the actors in the end was exceptional. Such a wonderful cast, sad to see them part ways.This is one of the best series to grace television in a very long time. A true gem, even if it has some rough edges here and there.If anything about the end (or the series in general) confuses you, I suggest heading over to the BSG Wiki.

All too often it seems that it\`s the story line that is wondering in the wilderness instead of the characters.While the over all story and the main plot line are not bad, it is rather drawn out.

Though it is based on her adaptation of her own story as a play, no one in the book is likable and there is probably not one word of comedy anywhere. If you don't care about what Miss Christy originally wrote you will enjoy this film as it is fun with many well known actors.The Russian version, with terrible titles, can be found and it is one of the great mystery films.

But all of them may surprise...For Christie buffs: the movie follows the book closely - up to the end, which was a little too depressing for moviegoers of the era.

I have played and beaten both the computer and Wii games based on this. On top of that, I have seen several play renditions. This original movie, the 1945 \\"And then there were none,\\" is just different enough from the book that it confused a fan as big as myself in the best of ways. At the same time, the movie followed the book loyalty, including small details such as interactions and object placement to dialogue...I am young, I admit, and I have never watched a black & white movie that truly interested me. Well, now I have. This was well written, dark and humorous, suspenseful and changed in just the right places.

One night a mysterious record accuses each guest murdered someone long ago. Although they try to prove tier innocence, thier mysterious host \\"Mr. Owen\\" has found a great deal about them.

The movie did not compare to my imagination while reading the book. If other movies based on Christie's books are like this, I would strictly stick to reading, and not watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"I did not like this movie adaptation of Agatha Christie's \\"And Then There Were None\\" at all.

The acting was horrible! I know some home movies that are more suspenseful. Overall we see character after character die while we the viewer could care less. One can only wonder, what would this movie have been in the hands of Hitchcock.

It should be noted that the film simply adopts the ending from Dame Agatha's own *play* version of the story, and therefore is equally authentic. Which is \\"better\\" is, of course, purely a matter of taste. Indeed, given that the film turns the mystery on a comic edge, I feel that retaining the book's original ending would have destroyed the film's own internal consistency.

The movie isn't a bad movie, if you don't consider that it is supposed to be based on this book.

The invitation tricks them to come onto an island far from the British mainland with boat service only twice a week.The home is large with a grand dining area has a statue centerpiece of the \\"Ten Little Indians\\" which slowly disappear one by one as the guests are mysteriously murdered one by one. The murders weapons mimic the old nursery rhyme of \\"Ten Little Indians\\". The guests deduct the murderer is one of them and paranoia and suspense rise high.

It did not stay true to the story, and Agatha Christie's work should not have been interpreeted differently. We have a feeling she would not approve.

The other reviews said this version follows the book closely but it does'nt. What made the book such a classic is that all ten people die on the island leaving only a note in a bottle to explain to the reader how it was done and by whom. When will Hollywood finally make a real version of Ten little indians? I really don't want to see Vera and Lombard team up to take out the villain like in every version of the film I've seen.

All in all, not an overwhemllingly suspensful movie, but an enjoyable one nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine adaptation","review":"This is a classic whodunnit based on the Agatha Christie book of the same name. Its well acted by the whole cast and has a nice touch of humour thrown in as well. The opening scene, in particular is one of the wittier moments as the guests travel to the island on a boat.There are some pretty good suspense moments and you'll be hard-pushed to workout who is the murderer the first time you see it. My only concern about the film is whether it would stand up to repeated viewings. This will probably be of little concern to ardent Agatha Christie fans, but I'm not sure that I'd want to see over and over.

I feel he is one of the funniest comedians out there. However I didn't find this movie funny at all. And I really tried, but I only could take the first 20 minutes before turing it off. It just wasn't funny, and it was really offensive to women. I understand that the secondary characters are supposed to act that way to counteract Steve Carrels character, but I just could'nt get through it.The only redeemable quality of this movie is Steve Carrels performance as a loveable dork."},{"rating":"1","title":"An uninspired performance","review":"Walter Kraft's playing is technically advanced but unimaginative. Most pieces are just played along either too fast or too slowly, with virtually no climaxes. I was especially upset by his rendition of the Toccata, Adagio and Fugue in C (BWV 564). Adagio was ok, but Toccata sounded like a race just to get it over with. In the Fugue, whose very music commands it to be crystal-sharp and dance-like, the pedal registration was so heavy and muddy that it pulled the manuals down with it.I wouldn't recommend this CD to a serious music lover. However, it presents a good lesson in how to keep a steady tempo throughout a piece and could be useful as an educational tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the finest bargains for Bach lovers","review":"A long-overdue CD remake of part, but only a small part, of Kraft's 1960's LP \\"Complete Organ Works of Bach, performed on a variety of superb Central and Northern European organs.

I don't usually write reviews, but Izolda is an independent artist and I wanted to let folks know that if you like beautiful, melodic music, check this album out. I bought the album after I saw a live performance and I'm delighted! It's hard to explain, but if I had to associate words to describe how I feel when listening to this album I'd say these songs are haunting, inspiring, hypnotic, powerful, peaceful, spiritual and fun.

Strange visions and dreams lead her to the truth about herself, a goverment conspiracy, and other-world creatures.This book is spooky, and somewhat macabre, every part filled with detail and description. It's well constructed, and it will keep you interested, leaving you longing to unravel the mystery as it unfolds!

These must have been nearly two or three sizes too small in every dimension. I ended up selling them to a friend, because I'm pretty sure I couldn't return them once opened.I still need new jeans, but I'm afraid to buy anything from Levi's anymore for fear that I'll get something that isn't even close to fitting me and be unable to return it.

It seems like all of the women's jeans that I've bought hike down in the back on me. Levi's 511's don't hike down on me, even the ones with the 1% elastine in them (Clean Dark is 99% cotton, 1% elastine). They sit below the waist on me so they aren't lame looking. I was positively THRILLED to get the Magno wash and find that they are 100% cotton, like the ones I bought in '05 and '06!

They fit great on arrival, but by the time they were washed (cold water) and dried (low temp) they had shrunk to high waters. Would not order them again. I suppose companies think its great, expecting you'll buy them frequently. Forget it. I'll go back to tried and true every time. What is so difficult about pre-washing and drying the material to prevent shrinkage after fabrication? Isn't quality worth customer satisfaction? Of note, as a woman I have not bought a pair of Levi's in years. At 5'9\\", 135 lbs. and needing a 33\\" inseam, I cannot find a pair in stores or online that fits. Plenty of shorts and mediums out there but forget finding talls.

Of course; first published some 20 years ago, this book is valuable for the insights into the history of population issue environmentalism almost as much as it is for its content. By far the easiest criticism to make of the book is, with the benefit of hindsight, of the atempt to \\"crystal-ball gaze\\" made by the author. It's also the most trivial criticism to make as, on the one hand, 20 years of hindsight always makes it easy to criticise anothers' atempted projections; while on the other hand, the likelihood that the projections were entirely accurate, but were averted thanks to this book and others of its ilk being published, can never be known.

How long can we continue this increase? Can we, or rather should we, increase ad infinitum? Is there any connection between our population's number & destruction of the environment?

I became very interested in the environmental issues that Ehrlich helped make popular. However, upon studying the subject in greater detail I realized that a free society is best prepared to deal with any environmental issues. The facts and research uncovered by Julian Simon convinced me that wealth created by human being helps the environment. Poverty (which is caused by government regulation and totalitarian states) is the biggest threat to the environment. All of Ehrlich's predictions have been shown to be shortsighted and wrong.

Ehrlich has never been right and people keep on listening to him.Had Ehrlich's 1968 predictions in \\"The Population Bomb\\" been right, we would now be stumbling around in a sea of smog killing one another for the few scraps of food we could find. On the other hand, had we adopted the draconian measures Ehrlich proposed in \\"The Population Bomb\\", the environment might be as good as it is now and Ehrlich would be declaring victory. However, the price we would have paid in individual liberty and standard of living would have made it a hollow victory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehrlich fails to see that technology innovation isn't static","review":"In the predictable style of most misanthropic environmental doomsayers, Ehrlich conveniently forgets that humans are capable of confronting pressing problems with technological and social innovation, as though we're all doomed to live in the 1970s (or the present) forever. People who think Earth is about to be depleted of its resources might want to check out books like \\"Mining the Sky\\" by John Lewis.

Ehrlich is never clear about what he believes, and moves from one emotional position to another, never realizing that he has no idea what he is talking about.Writing in 1969 he predicted massive famines starting in 1984. Of course this didn't happen. So did Ehrlich question his assumptions? No, he simply reisses an extremely flawed work.

If so, it has more to do with prejudices and uninformed--uninformable--paranoia than with scientific or logical merit. Ehrlich, in this seasoned tome, preserves for the ages some of his greatest nonsensical howlers about the catastrophic growth of human population in the face of vanishing resources and inadequate food. None of them was remotely close to the mark, but that doesn't stop people who so desperately _want_ our evil, soulless modern world to be brought down for its sins, that they cast aside failure of his models and predictions, and refuse to see that the world has debunked him.Ehrlich's fatal flaw is easy to see and sum up. Sure, he was a biologist who studied populations, but populations of _insects_. And human beings--get ready for a shock--are not insects. We can innovate, invent, learn, and improve.

I was looking for a pattern on Cathedral and that is shown on a bowl that has the pattern going underneath. No way can you see what the entire pattern looks like. In the front of the book, they describe the shapes of the glassware. They list 20 shapes, but in the price guide, they list many more. What is the difference between a milk pitcher and a pitcher? a tumbler and a goblet? What size and shape is a sauce? What is a wastebowl? They never show or describe the bottom pattern.

The author seems to be undecided between delivering an advanced excursus in most important mathematical application and presenting a collection of mathematical trivia-jokes-games. I don't think the mix works well. Besides, in line with this contradiction, sometimes the author dwells into explanations of elementary concepts, but then he takes for granted that the reader is familiar with integrates and calculus. Only to make things worse, some mathematical puzzles (perhaps the most interesting) are given without the solution.

Hopefully it is my last. The construction of the applicator is a lot better than I expected. the handle is a much stronger plastic than others had described. The weakest point would appear to be where the handle attaches to the applicator, however, I don't imagine this being a problem because you don't need force to apply the lotion. My initial concern was that this would be a nasty, lotion mess and that I would get way too much lotion all over my back, but it works like a charm and only allows out the perfect amount. I will admit it's nice getting rid of that nasty dry, scaly, itch, spot right in the middle of my back.

It worked fine for just a few months. Then the clear plastic cover started cracking and I had to hold it together with tape. As a result of the cover not being well secured to the applicator, the applicator was exposed to too much air and the lotion inside the applicator would dry out over the course of a day or two. I then just started applying a little lotion directly to the roller balls, which was better. However, within the last month, the little roller balls started falling out. Today I received a new (and different) lotion applicator and dumped this one in the trash. The plastic is brittle and the quality poor. I do not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one!","review":"This thing is horribly made!

The first 2 months it worked beautifully, I was super impressed because it mixed smoothly and quietly in little time compared to other mixers, and everything went right into the washer. After that period, the machine started sounding funny, it was still working so I thought maybe it was there all along and I didn't notice. Fast forward to 10 mos after purchase and the machine died, just turned off and that was that. I sent it to repair under warranty and it takes about a month to fix because the repair shop is in Detroit. I had a KitchenAid, never had a problem, I was stupid to sell it because I wanted a bigger capacity machine...I DO NOT RECOMMEND this mixer! I bought an extra warranty for it, but didn't use it since it was still under factory warranty, but given how long it takes to get a repair from Viking that was a mistake too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as its predecessors, but still amazing!","review":"This book wasn't as good as I expected it to be, and by Banker's standards, it was definitely below his usual talent. I especially didn't like the description of Hanuman as a scrawny, small vanar without any confidence. I also expected a mace fight between the exiled vanar king Sugriva and the evil usurper Vali. But no, instead, Sugriva never encounters Vali in a one-on-one, and the usurper is killed in a different fashion (how I will not tell you). However, that is not to say that the book is bad. In fact, if you did not have as high of expectations as I did, you will really enjoy it. The book starts off with the riveting conclusion to the Battle of Janasthana (which goes on for seven, awesome chapters). The abduction of Sita is superbly written, and I could read that part over and over again and still get chills. All in all, this book is highly recommended, but keep in mind (for those Ramayana fans) that this book does have its flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful 20's sheer elegance!","review":"Quite, quite fascinating, strange, and sad. As we follow the hedonistic, somewhat dangerous pursuits of our Bright Young set from one costume party to another, we watch them scale a ladder of sensational thrills to an extent where they become so detatched from the basic emotions of reality that they lose touch, and their worlds come whirling back down.I sensed a slight touch of sarcasm in the title of the ultimate chapter, 'a happy ending', as it is not so much an ending, as another day in their hollow lives, and as for it being 'happy', we see them slowly try to piece together the remains of their lonely lives as the jazz fades out, the champagne runs dry and the war comes as a harsh reality check to the Bright Young People of 1920's party scene.Beautifully written and quite captivating to read, 'Vile Bodies' is an intriguing masterpiece that should be in everyone's library, if not their top 10 favourites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Kindle edition","review":"The moment I saw the 'unjustified' text on the Kindle edition, I was disinclined to read it.

I found myself dancing in the music store. \\"Tu Amor Me Hace Bien,\\" \\"Volando Entre Tus Brazos,\\" \\"Amigo\\" and \\"Se Esfuma Tu Amor\\" were definitely danceable and \\"Ahora Quien\\" was so much better as a salsa song than a pop ballad.

Luckily, my morbid curiosity took over and I began flipping through it. Before I knew it, I had read the entire book backwards to front.

These \\"Case Histories\\" stand as the stronger section of Fuchs's book. To have this information collected in such a convenient method is invaluable.Bad Blood sports some odd typos resultant of translation from German to English but they're easy to overlook.

Instead, it focused on what practitioners of these medical arts can do for the patient and what to expect when visiting a practitioner.While the book does provide descriptions of points that can be stimulated on one's body to alleviate selected conditions as well as visuals in the form of pictures, these are quite limited and not easy to follow.Also, as I read the book, I was annoyed by the poor editing of the text.

The coffee tastes fine but I can't trust it or have it set to turn on, because after a few minutes, it shuts off and doesn't finish making all of the coffee until I push the start button again and again until all of the water is extracted.

If you try pouring water into the reservoir from the carafe without the lid on, it just spills everywhere. I was then told to use a spring water bottle or a separate cup to fill the reservoir with water. This is just not practical and the lines inside the reservoir that tell you how much water you are measuring are very difficult to see. It's like you would need a flashlight to see how much you were pouring in. There are no water indication lines inside the carafe.

In fact you just need to pair the devices for the first time, and you can reconnect any time after that. I called tech support and told them my story, they said that I have a defective unit.

Many complained about the fit and I agree that it is some what uncomfortable at first. I've got medium sized hands and find that a tight fit is better for me. For those with large hands, use of the 2nd finger to manipulate the zoom probably would work better. The camera is light and although I have a slight hand tremor, I've been able to achieve steady films without undue blur or shakiness. Those that complain about poor low light capability are not being realistic.

But I found out (too late) that the *only* way to get the video recorded to the MiniDV cassete is through firewire. That great. I don't have a MAC on hand and none of my laptops (bought in the last year) have firewire. So no joy.When I researched this camera, no where, and I mean no where, was it mentioned that the video from the MiniDV could only be transferred via Firewire. I might not have bought it if I had known that. Now I have to return it and fight to not pay a restocking fee.Btw, the manual shows that you can use a USB cable, but it doesn't even say that video from the MiniDV cassette can not be transferred over USB.Oh, and no video editing software? For $1000, Canon couldn't put something on the DVD. Sure, I can use Microsoft Movie Maker, but I can't say that I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great video!! Absolutely horrible sound!!","review":"No doubt about it, the Canon HV20 has a great picture. The ability to shoot in HDV and 24p is amazing considering the cost of this camera (right around $1000). Unfortunately, nobody mentioned the subpar sound. The microphone picks up the noise from the motor and tape. I'm sure I could find a way to take out the hiss/whirr sounds in post production, but good grief, nobody wants that headache. I haven't seen it mentioned here on Amazon, but many other boards/forms have many other users who have experienced the same problem. The only solution I have seen is to buy an external microphone ($150-$500), but that still doesn't eliminate the noise from this camera. If there is a fix for this, let me know as I would rather keep the camera than give it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great camera","review":"We purchased this camera before taking a Northern European cruise. The picture quality is excellent. It is small enough to carry very comfortably in a purse. We are delighted with the videos (except for photographer errors). We left it on the cinematic mode for the trip. Before leaving home, we compared the regular HDV mode and the cinematic mode and it was difficult to tell much difference. My only complaint (and this is a small one) is that it is a little awkward to hold and operate with one hand.

Thinking the battery had run out, I left it to charge overnight. The next day and for a couple of days afterwards I tried a combination of things to try and get the camera to power-up, but nothing worked. Finally, I gave up and called Canon tech support. Tech support told me that I had to send the camera in for repair. I sent the camera in for repair paying $42 out of my own pocket to do so. Hopefully, it will be repaired and come back soon.

I can's see why Canon would make a lens cover motorized given that most other camera types, such as digital SLR's have manual lens covers.

I installed it in my (warmed up) tractor and plugged the unit in. The following day after the storm subsided, I went out to see if it was working. It was ice cold and I could see by the discoloration that it had indeed heated up and shorted out. I ordered a replacement and I am hoping that I will get the proper 3-PRONG grounded unit.Just an update: Amazon sent me a replacement. It also was another ungrounded heater.

I bent it to fit the shelf we have, and then put one--yes, one--roll of foil in the basket. The back part of the basket leaned down and the roll fell out. I was going to put about five or six rolls in that basket...obviously not.Definitely not worth the purchase for even $.01."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Metal...Not worth the money","review":"The back of the rack has no support, so it sags leaving me with less room in my cabinets than without it. Product was also so flimsy one of the handles already broke. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the picture - you won't get one like it","review":"The pictured rack looks quite sturdy, and holds four rolls of wrap without sagging away from the shelf. The rack I received was made of flimsy wire, and it drooped significantly when I put a roll of aluminum foil in the rack to test it out. The whole point of the rack is to keep the wrap above items on the shelf below it - this fails that test. It's not worth the hassle to return, but I may have to use it to hold light weight items, and not the wrap it's supposedly designed to contain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for saving space poor quality","review":"I only put 4 containers of foil and plastic wrap and the back bent down. I had to prop it up with soup cans. Definitely doesn't work like shown in the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great.","review":"I bought this for my mom who is a professional home baker. She uses lots of papers, foils and wraps. She said it was great for keeping them organized in her cabinet. The only con I noticed is it doesn't go too far back so if you have deep cabinets as she does it is easy for things to fall behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not high quality","review":"Not impressed with the initial quality. When the shelf was received there were a few welds broken. I did not contact the seller since I liked the size of the shelf. I modified it to make it stronger and work where I want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really doesn't hold weight","review":"I just have 2 aluminum foil rolls and it doesn't hold it well... I think the holders are not strong enough.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Mine doesn't look a lot like the picture. The metal at the top is cheap and can't hold the basket. It wobbles around. If it was sturdy it would be great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"It works for what I need it for - holding all the tin foil and other type of products. The ends were a little rough feeling either they rusted or never smoothed out and just painted over. Not a big deal though."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made item. not very practical","review":"Even if you get your measurements correctly, the item doesn't hold up that well. The end started sagging quite a bit once you loaded it up with heavier warp like aluminum foil. Would not recommend getting this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, be sure to measure before you purchase","review":"The product is well made.I did not measure my shelf where I wanted to hang the Under Shelf Wrap Rack from and it sticks out.That is totally my fault.I am still using it because it is handy to put my foil and saran wrap on, it adds more shelf room for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This is extremely flimsy and doesn't work at all. They must have used empty boxes for the photo. The arms to support it on the shelf are too short, so as soon as you put in one box of aluminum foil, the rack hangs down on top of whatever is below it. I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"I kept it because it was not worth the money to return it but it is rather flimsy. The back end flops down when the wrap containers are placed inside. I could duct tape the back part to the underside of the cabinet, but I'm not going to bother. When this falls apart I'll just trash it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable!","review":"I loved this at first, but it lasted at most a month. I contacted the seller and they offered to send me a new one. Over a month later I hadn't received yet and ended up getting a refund since they couldn't tell me when they would be in again. I'd recomend against this and go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's okay","review":"The under shelf rack is exactly as it is stated and does exactly what it is suppose to do. However, it does not fit snuggly against the shelf, the back of it droops thus making it difficult to remove the wraps from the rack. This is of course annoying and causes some frustration when you are holding something and trying to get the wrap box out of the rack. Would I bu another one I don't think so, not unless they can make it where it doesn't droop on the back and the boxes of wraps don't slide backwards and get stuck trying to get them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"say no...don't do it....poor design","review":"This was really just a waste of money. It's too wide and flimsy. Wont hold under any of my shelves. It's a good design THOUGHT...but not thought out good enough. The handles should be adjustable to fit any size shelf. Guess I just donated the money because I didn't receive an item of any quality or substance. Walk away...walk away...until you find something that will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it stinks...","review":"This thing just didn't work well with any of my shelves. Without a screw mount on the top to drill down into the shelf the unit kind of stinks. It sags a ton at the bag if you load it up as pictured and really is a pain in the butt for the shelf below. Becuase of the cost of the product and my laziness I think I just jammed it down in my basement. However, I should have never purchased in the first place. Just trim down the junk in your drawer and get better rated and reviewed organization products."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't fit shelf","review":"This is a great idea for saving storage space, and it doesn't require you to drill holes in your cabinets like other wrap racks. However, it doesn't fit my cabinet shelves (about an inch too long) and they are regulation size. Just measure before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"I liked the idea of the product. But I will buy something that has better quality. This one is so flimsy and just one roll an it hangs."},{"rating":"1","title":"got damaged item","review":"As many of them mentioned you need to measure your shelf before ordering this. This did not fit my cabinets so for me its useless and got damage piece. :((((((((((((("},{"rating":"1","title":"two different versions - one good, one garbage","review":"I ordered one of these. It was well made. The back was open so that longer items could stick out the back instead of the front. It was made of sturdy round wire including the arms that set on top of the shelf it hangs from. I liked it so well I ordered another one.The second one has a closed in back and the arms that set on top of the shelf are flat. The arms on the second one are weak and if you place anything heavier than boxes of tin foil or sandwich bags on it the back of the rack will sag down, due to the weak arms sagging.The one with the round wire arms and open back is great. The one with the flat arms and enclosed back is cheap junk. If you order this, you are gambling on which version you will receive."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made and no back...","review":"Not the strongest made piece. But an even bigger problem is that there isn't a vertical piece in the back to stop the foil or wax paper from falling out the back. I may throw this out and get another. Also, wobbles when you put something in or take something out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy metal","review":"Very flimsy metal that bends easily and was not able to hold up 1 freezer bag package and 1 sandwich bag package. I'll be returning this poorly made shelf rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy","review":"we ended up not using this because it wasn't sturdy enough. we threw it away. The wire that holds it on the shelf is way too weak so with weight it bends"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy!","review":"I bought two of these and they are super flimsy! I don't know how they are holding the weight of the wraps in the photo, unless they are just empty boxes. Mine bend with just a few things in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I had to put this in several different cabinets until I found one it would work in; the shelf depth has to be a little shallower than that of the cabinet or the door will not shut. I ended up putting this in my garage for my husband to use. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied - does not fit","review":"Product shown in picture as nicely fitting inside cabinet. However, shelf length is longer than std. cabinet depth. Had to scrap since it was useless. Also, bracket holding cabinet divider fits loose."},{"rating":"1","title":"1983W is FLIMSY, CHEAPLY MADE, JUNK!!!","review":"First, there is no way the product pictured is the same one sent. The picture shows the rack neatly level with the shelf. The product I received SAGs to an alarming degree. So much so that you would have to put something under the back to prop it up, or you would have to tack it to the underside of your shelf.Second, the positive reviews have to be either shill reviews, or for similar products. The garbage I purchased is \\"Under Shelf Wrap Rack in WHITE model 1983W from Organize It All.\\" It isn't sturdy, and as mentioned above, without support, you aren't getting anything under the rack, so it isn't saving any space.I bought a competing 'Rubbermaid' branded product at my local WalMart that is just fine, so it's not the concept, it's the second rate material used here.Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This product is worthless. The basket I received is different from the one in the picture. The gap between where it should slide onto the shelf and hang is much wider than shown. It seems sturdy but when you put things in it becomes very flimsy. Hopefully you have a better experience than I had with it but I would not recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a space saver","review":"While it does its job, I found it to take up more space. I have those very large cabinets which go from the counter top all the way to the sealing (old school). The shelves are evenly spaced & are almost 2 1/2 feet a part. More then enough space to fit something. This thing took up 1/2 of my shelf (up to down). But it is solid and does hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating","review":"The Under Shelf Wrap Rack in WHITE model 1983W from Organize It All does not stay in place. It shifts very easily when removing items from the rack or putting items on the rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design and quality","review":"Please be aware that the far end of the shelf bends down, even without load. The hooks are too weak. Returned for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works but has some wiggle","review":"It works. I use it for boxes of jello and pudding mixes under a shelf in out pantry closet. The distance between the arms and the rack is not adjustable. Despite the good width of our shelves, it wiggles. For this reason I would not use it inside the kitchen cabinets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Quality but of Limited Utility","review":"Just too small to really help organize. Quality is OK, but not very helpful in keeping things in order. Functions as avertized. I wouldn't buy this product again because it just wasn't as effective as I wanted it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came broken","review":"So cheaply made, came broken and I didn't even bother to return it. I wouldn't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might have been my favorite Christmas present...","review":"I've been wanting this for awhile, but didn't want to actually buy it. So I left it on my wishlist and it got passed up time and again. Every time I saw it still sitting on there, I'd quietly whine about it. My boyfriend finally took the hint and got it for my for Christmas.I HATE the pantry. I hate that everything is always toppling over and in the back and you just can't find a thing. I love organization, and no matter what my pantry was a mess.This has helped me in the steps towards happiness. It fit perfectly and slides right onto a shelf. It's so much nicer to be able to grab the tinfoil without getting a flashlight first! I like it so much, I might buy another! Just measure first to make sure it will fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it says","review":"This is exactly what you see in the picture. Fits under a cabinet, doesn't take up too much space inside the cabinet (mine shuts almost all the way even with this on it) and holds two cartons of eggs just right. Good price, sturdy, shipped out quickly and well packaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great space saver!","review":"I loved it! It did not oly organize my pantry it also saved me so much space. I just wished it was a little longer by half inch, but it was great nevertheless. I might buy another one - I wish there was a discount on the shipping then I could buy more stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible toner.

An example is the notion that Jews represented a majority population in historic Palestine throughout the last few centuries. Another is that Arab and British propananda have been more greatly at work that Zionist propaganda in skewing international opinion surrounding the current conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a true follower of French design & architecture, I was disappointed.

This movie has it all. The drive and passion of an \\"over the hill player\\" on his way out who befriends a young black player trying to enter the big leagues in the 1950's, is the focus of this film.

It was hard to put down. I guess I need to see where the story goes from here."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TAPE!","review":"This movie lacks the suspense and terror needed to make a movie. The sequel to The Stepfather sucks. The acting is lousy, the movie is predictable and it lacks originality.

Follow the advice above and DONT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Stepfather 1???","review":"This sequel is horrible. The first Stepfather movie is soooo good and original and NOT on dvd??? Why would they release part two on dvd and not the original?

It gets one star just because I like Terry O'Quinn, now on TV's LOST."},{"rating":"1","title":"INFERIOR IN EVERY WAY TO THE ORIGINAL!","review":"I've always enjoyed the 80's horror film known as The Stepfather, it had wit, charm and suspense with a couple of splashes of blood and gore. This sequel seems to lose sight of what made the first film so likable and aside from O'Quinn giving a decent performance this film offers little else. It's a watered down version of the first film with no where near the wit, charm, suspense or gore, so why bother? Unless you want to see Stepfather III....Oh brother! ;-b"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Sequel","review":"Some sequels fail to live up to the expectations set by their successful predecessors but Stepfather II does great in giving background and picking up where he left off"},{"rating":"2","title":"stepfather 2","review":"Well, I love the stepfather trilogy, but I am unable to get the 3rd one as it is not available.

In typical Baker style, he examines minutia with elucidating commentary. This, in itself, is worth reading the novel; however, the quality that makes it transcend happens to be his ability to unite the entire book with its central theme: Breath. From the comma, to the mobile in his child's room, to tuba lessons, breath pervades - breath as its metaphor to remember to cherish every moment.I have never seen a novel so effortlessly and imperceptibly weave a central idea throughout a book. Read this novel for both it compelling insight but also for the extraordinary literary technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore Jinx","review":"A major disappointment after The Mezzanine. Baker goes to the well once too often by trying to recreate that excellent book here. That first book seemed to avoid crossing over into pretentiousness by giving us a self-deprecating narrator and by simply pouring on the wit and intelligent observations and forcing you to laugh. Here, pretentiousness and self-indulgence abound. The subject matter is just far too personal to connect with the reader and, simply, it seems that Nick didn't try as hard the second time around. If you enjoyed the pretentious and turgid essay \\"Lumber,\\" then this might be for you, but if you were drawn to this book after reading more engaging Baker fare such as U and I, The Mezzanine or Vox, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$$","review":"This is a complete waste of money...for only one page of information that is mostly taken up by a list of the authors works.

This is bubbly, joyous music that must have the spirit before everything. And this set provides that in great quantity. Just listen to 'Le Boeuf sur le Toit': the Orchestra of Radio Luxembourg are not the finest band in the world, the ensemble isn't everything it should be, but they are utterly inside this music. And it works perfectly- it completely evokes the atmosphere of the slightly seedy Brazilian boite du nuit. And I challenge anyone to listen to the whole piece without raising a smile. Add the pieces which are under the baton of Milhaud himself, and you have a set that's well-nigh indispensible for lovers of 20th century French music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soviet Sunken Nuclear Weapons in Canadian Waters","review":"In today's world ideas like this capture our attention. Jim Karch has woven an intriguing mystery with many twists and turns. It has the same believability and suspense of the most popular mystery novels written today. The story takes place in the waters of British Columbia. The authors knowledge of this area and the problems encountered in these and similar waters, brings a level of authenticity that anyone who has done any boating will appreciate. The attention to technical details and the depth of character development kept my interest throughout the book. The author introduces many characters but the story is written in a simple style that is easy to read and follow. The similarities to world events that have happened recently make certain parts especially chilling. I know I've read a good story when I can't stop till I find out what happens in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, Gritty, and Shockingly Real","review":"This book is my favorite book of all tme. Antsy's unique vocabulary and quirky narrative kept me hooked from page 1. This book had me sobbing and laughing at the same time. The Schwa is a deeply real character that is impossible not to connect to. Shushterman has a unique talent to mae the impossible seem immensely realistic. The plot is tangible and hits home with every reader. Anthony Bonano will tell yu things how he sees them, without editing or polishing, and Shushterman weaves a powerful tale of friendship, forgiveness, and finally being seen. A must-read book for people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Adventure, Friendship","review":"This book was awesome. It has an effect on all young adults, and can relate to anyone. This book, in the beginning was so interesting. Mr.Shusterman has made such an amazing story of this book. I really hope every teacher will introduce this into their classrooms, because every student needs help in their lives. Many people have to worry about the question, why does no one notice me, and this book shows that there is someone out there for everyone. I did actually learn a lot from this book, too. I learned that no one can put you down, life is nothing without friendship, and sometimes people like to exaggerate the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Selleck Drama","review":"I always like Tom Selleck movies. Some are actually very entertaining. This is by far his best dramatic role. I was very impressed how well he played the part of a framed Airline crew chief Jimmie Rainwood. F. Murray Abraham gives a great performance as one of the prison inmates, Virgil Cane, that befriends him. It has all the elements for some good drama, bad cops, drugs, decent and really bad convicts, attractive loving wife, and motive for revenge.David Rasche and Richard Young do a fine job as the crooked detectives that frame him. I have recommended this to many people since many Selleck fans are not even aware of it.

He transitioned from a happy-go-lucky guy who was framed to become a hardened ex-con well. I don't like strong language in a movie, but crooked cops and prison life seem to merit it in this movie.

First decided to use it to transport 2 beach chairs and 2 beach umbrellas down to SC from CT. I attached everything securely as instructed. Everything looked good, felt tight and appropriate. Still not sure exactly what happened, but once I reached 60 mph on the highway (approximately 5 miles into our trip), the whole thing gave way and flew off the car causing huge dents and scratches on my car.

(looks funny going down the road with a canoe on the roof that is bigger than the car) The rack goes on easy and quick and then I strap the canoe onto the rack and the bumpers. It does have rubber feet but will still scratch the roof a little. Its an older car so I'm not as concerned about it. If your car is new or a lease I might think twice.

The gutters that the clips hang on to are slanted, so I worried about the rack popping off while I was traveling, but after cinching down my load and traveling 5 hours at high speed, I can tell you the rack performed marvelously! When I arrived at my destination, it was a breeze to take the rack off the car and toss it into the back seat. While the first-time setup took ~20 minutes, subsequent setups took <5 mins.There was one notable drawback when traveling at speed. It was deafeningly loud til I covered the holes...The unused holes that are used to mount the bar to the rack's feet (there are 3 options on each end of the bar so it can accommodate narrow or wide cars) basically turned the whole rack into a giant flute! By the time I reached 50mph, I couldn't hear anything! A little packing tape over the unused holes cut the noise right out...I love this rack, and it works well with both of my vehicles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Box arrived busted & parts missing","review":"I recieved this via a freight forwarder who noted the package was open/taped, however the four feet that raise the bar off the roof are missing from the box rendering the product useless.

I've never experienced this problem with Amazon before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works pretty well as a kayak carrier","review":"I bought this bar carrier as an alternative to a very expensive and more permanent Yakima kayak carrier. This carrier worked like a charm once it was attached to the car. The hooks that are supposed to catch something on the door frame did not work with my Ford Taurus. There was nothing on my particular car I could tie the straps to, so I ended up improvising by using heavier tie downs, taking them through both doors, which left straps on the inside of the car, but it worked. The system seemed very secure on top of my car, and I attached foam blocks to the bars, loaded my kayak, and strapped it down. The kayak held securely with just the two straps-I didn't have to tie down the bow and stern to the front and back of the car. In summary, the bar carrier is a fairly quick, inexpensive, and secure way to transport a kayak (I'm sure it would work with lots of other things too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look out behind!","review":"The very first time I used the carrier, I went on a 6 hour round trip with a rooftop bag attached. The first three hours went fine, but I stopped and tightened the straps midway through. About on hour through the trip home, I stopped and checked it again and everything seemed fine. Then a short distance down the road, one clip let go and the whole system (both bars and the bag went airborn) and landed in the middle of the highway. The feet shattered and all four rubber pads went missing. The bag was ruined, but managed to protect my belongings. Very disappointed that there is no safety set up in case one of the clips lets go. VERY DANGEROUS."},{"rating":"2","title":"To install do the following","review":"you dont need rain gutters to install this.

Specifically;* The supports are plastic, they should mention this in the description, I assumed that the bar supports would be metal.* The gripping feet that come in contact with the car roof are smooth and slippery so even when the straps are as tight as I can pull them and the assembly will not move side to side, they still slip on the roof front to back.* The lip holding the foot onto the plastic support is also rather flimsy.''All in all it's cheap made in China crap, you definitely get what you pay for.

It worked like a CHARM. We did stop to check it out a few times, finding that it was secure each time. It's a bit complicated at first to get the straps threaded properly, and I'd definately recommend Super Gluing the rubber feet on after having threaded the straps.

About a minute after hitting 60 mph, the kayak fell off of the roof and into the middle of the highway.

It was on the roof of a '97 Dodge Stratus. I only had to tighten the rack down once. It wasn't in danger of coming loose; it just shifted slightly. For the ~$20 I paid for it, it worked amazingly well.The only minor problems were a few drops of water during a downpour where the hooks pin the weather stripping down, and that was only on one door, so it wasn't a big problem.

None of the trashiness or criminal bent of the family is portrayed, and Jesco is alive and well today--unlike the Jesco of the movie. The casting and acting are poor. Just an awful film"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is one of my favorite films. Edward Hogg is in the same league as Dinero and Brando. One of the most amazing performances I have ever seen in my fifty-six years. The strange editing and filming adds to the movie as much as the weird soundtrack. I first saw the film on the Sundance Chanel and as I watched it unfold, each minute became more and more enthralling. Carrie Fisher's role is nothing less than incredible. I was not sure at first it was her. I thought she had given up acting. I can't wait until the director's cut is made available because the Sundance channel showed an edited version of the film. The asylum scene is more real than the one in \\"One Flew Over The Cucoos Nest\\" as far as it's depiction of such a hospital. I have seen this movie at least five times and I am blown away by it each time. They still make 'em like they use to."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT about Jesco","review":"Terrible portrayal of beloved Jesco. I wonder what he thinks of this portrayal of himself, because it is more of a betrayal in my mind. I don't know why they felt they had to base it on Jesco. Why not give it another name and leave Jesco out of it. If you love the dancing outlaw, DON'T waste your time on this. You will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!","review":"This movie is horrible. The only thing about Jesco White that is truly portrayed in this movie is his name!! They have how his fater was killed wrong and the ending well all I have to say is wow what the hell is that about?? Horrible horrible movie. I say if your a fan of Jesco White then watch the Dancing Outlaw Documentaries and The Wild and Wonderfull Whites of West Virginia if you want the TRUE story of Jesco White. This movie was a waste of 2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Molly: Young, Strong, and Filled with Fire","review":"Have you ever dreamed of living in a small town on the coast of Maine? I have. This book takes me there, to the World War II era when fathers flew off on gallant missions, perhaps never to return. Each family member who was left behind had to work out private griefs in individual ways. Molly is a teenager who was left behind. She is one of the strongest young female characters you're likely to meet in a young adult novel. Her strength and \\"fire\\" make me wish I were one of Molly's friends. She reminds me of Scout in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" If I were Molly's friend, then I could be there with her, walking along the cliff edge overlooking the Atlantic, exploring ruins of an old church, and getting into tense and desperate adventures. Molly's strong fire, her passion, is that she must prove her father is still alive and is coming back home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"As a teacher and avid reader, I enthusiastically recommend Molly's Fire, by Janet Lee Carey. I grew emotionally attached to the main character, Molly, and held her hope as my own as I read her struggles to keep that hope alive. Many can identify with Molly, who is going through common issues for her age, such as first love, voicing her opinion, the (apparent) loss of a parent, and a prospective new parent. The details surrounding this historical fiction book add to the depth, especially the quote from one of FDR's fireside chats and the rationing of goods. Many scenes in the book spoke powerfully to me through the poetic description that was used, especially the scene on VE-day. Finally, the children in this book were protrayed authentically. They were not little adults, but reacted to situations as children do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a good read.","review":"Story of a girl who \\"keeps the faith\\" when her father is MIA during WW II. Brings out some little-known details of World War II history, including the use of German POWs in logging camps in New England. Starts a little slow, but by the end I was completely engrossed. Although the protaganist is a girl, both girls and boys (men and women?) will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeps & Oozes Like Sap","review":"While the 3 songs off of their split CD with Church Of Misery are my favorites, this CD is startling in it's complexity and ability to really get deep into my psyche. Effective use of feedback and their trademark vocals heighten the disturbing experience, as the growls and screams and sounds of anger and agony penetrate your brain. So heavy at times I wanna rip my own throat out, and when the pace starts to build....oh my! If you're new to Iron Monkey, the vox, while only slightly, compare to A.C. (but clearer) or possibly Flesh Parade. Wicked Stuff You Won't Forget, And Will Want To Expose Others To. With all the angst of Buzzov*en and the torment of EyeHateGod, Iron Monkey really has their own sound and defy categorization. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 is 'cuz of some redundancy in the rhythms, even though I know it's deliberate. Doesn't effect listening pleasure one iota, though. Astounding Release!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of a Feminist","review":"The book examines many women's perspectives, but never once examines the sons' perspective and the obvious question of the negative impact of feminist male bashing on sons. I was \\"orphaned\\" by feminism as it lead my Mom not only to divorce my Dad, but also to champion women at every turn over even me, her own flesh and blood. Now at 53 I see the hollowness of my Mom's assertions that men always have advantages and that there is some male conspiracy out there to ensure my success over women. My Mom's feminist teachings merely made me a tool for women's agendas, which could never include my own success since I was a man. My Mom's feminism not only separated me from my father, it separated me from her and set me up for a life of exploitation by less deserving but more politically savy feminists in the academy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best preschool game I have found","review":"I rarely review, but I wanted to sing the praises of this game. I often play this game with my 3- and 4-year-old. The game can take a long time, but each turn is relatively short and we have fun \\"helping\\" each other, especially help for my 3-year-old remembering the color or shape, or finding the correct piece. To pass the time between turns, we create imaginary items out of our pieces, like houses, people or trucks. And at the end, we each count our own pieces for another dimension of learning.We tweaked it a bit so a double clown roll lets us pick TWO of any piece, so we always do some extra cheering when we get the coveted double clown roll.I keep searching for a game that is as entertaining for both my kids and me. But for now, we return to this game over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun toy for preschooler","review":"Colorama is a great first game for preschooler! This game teaches colors, shapes, and turn-taking. Will use it with my next child too."},{"rating":"2","title":"shapes and colors","review":"A great toy to teach little ones shapes and colors. No reading required. My son got it for his second birthday and still enjoys playing it. There are only 5 shapes and 4 colors, which is probably the only limitation of the game. My son learned the shapes and colors within a week so it would have been nice to have more variety. Otherwise a really nice first game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"What a waste of money. This book tells you nothing you don't already know, or just has information in it that's already feely available on the internet. Put away your wallet, folks.Anyone giving this book a review like the ones above are probably people related to the author in some way, like his mom or his girlfriend. What a load of bologna... There's nothing in this book you can't find out for free anyways, so save the 20 bucks and take your kid to Burger King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have Beethoven works, well recorded","review":"I highly recommend these two CD's, especially at this price. Vox Box has some excellent recordings, such as this one. If you always thought there was more to Beethoven's symphonic repertoire than his symphonies and overtures, you were right. His incidental music is awesome. I LOVE the Turkish March from the Ruins of Athens, almost a symphonic equivalent of Mozart's Rondo alla turca. While my favorite recording of the Egmont overture remains Kurt Masur, these recordings are also very good, and the sound from the 1970's is still fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great place to start","review":"After reading most of the reviews here I was rather skeptical about purchasing this series. I was fortunate enough to find the comic books and have not read the TPB version of this series. This comic pleasantly surprised me. I've read some really awful stuff by Dark Horse \\"Infinity's End\\" for example, but this is not like that in any way. In the context of the grand Star Wars universe this fits in very nicely and addresses many things not mentioned anywhere else such as: who were the Sith, pre-lightsaber era, discovery of hyperspace routes and a bit more. The Jedi are portrayed much as they were in The Phantom Menace as ambassadors and peacemakers not as \\"wimpy whiners\\" as was mentioned in another review. The artwork is easy to quibble about and the starships look like something an Ewok would have designed, but it was nice to see Korriban, and get the back-story on Naga Sadow, and to see a developing Coruscant. All in all a very good read worthy of purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful...","review":"This book is really only worth one star, but it got two only due to the fact that it is so much better than its sequel. The art is very cluttered and drab, the script horrible, corny and with many grammatical mistakes. The artists seemed to have a lot of trouble drawing the Odan-Urr character. The plot is stupid and pointless, the characters uninteresting, and too much time is wasted on plot points which really have no consequence. The Jedi are kinda wimpy whiners, and their lightsaber external power supplies were silly. The Sith were a bunch of stupid, bickering idiots, as were Jori and Gav, who desperately need to get a life.This is one of the very worst SW comics available on the market, and I recommend that you stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting SW history, but hard to like","review":"'Golden Age of the Sith', as the other Tales of the Jedi books, is a bit of a hard sell for fans and non fans. Fans of Star Wars will buy this book to complete their collections, and just might enjoy it for it's historic tale set in the far past of the Star Wars continuity. However, the tale is so bizarre that it bears almost no resemblance to the current Star Wars universe. For some it might be a drawing point, but I think others will be turned off by this. Non fans will turn away, as the story isn't particularly intriguing and the art is sub-par. The rest of the 'Tales of the jedi' stories are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not the best in the serier","review":"The Golden Age of the Sith was an OK book. The artwork was functional and the storyline was interesting. Also, the information on the Sith Empire makes it a good read. However, it does suffer from a few problems, mainly that the two main characters needed to be more involved in the story. As it is, they were just kind of \\"there,\\" stumbling into major events at random. Other than that, this is book was pretty good, but there are better ones in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"CONSPIRACYS......DEATH..............ACTION ITS GOT IT ALL!","review":"GOLDEN AGE OF SITH WAS VERY INTERESTING AND EXITING IT DOESNT REALLY STAR GAV AND JORI DARAGON BUT STARS NAGA SADOW AS HE CHEATS HIS WAY TO BEING THE DARK LORD OF SITH.

The reality that it's a 1980's VHS tape that has been transferred to a DVD and sold as something new and different. Whoever designed the cover sure knew how to use photoshop.

The cover of the DVD looks compelling and might lead you to think it had a high production value, really though it looks as if it was converted from VHS to DVD. The content is at best a smattering of techniques that were quickly glossed over, never really getting into indepth instruction. This reminds me of some of the Self Defense tapes that were flooding the market in the mid 80s when VHS instruction was booming. Anyone with a VHS recorder and what they thought was an expertise sent out teaser ads to get you to buy thier \\"stop any attack\\" BS.

This is a good reference tool in wing chun fundamentals for all beginning practitioners. It instructed well and piqued my interest. This DVD and Sil Lum Tao are both very utilitous and will be helpful in preparing one in finding and participating with a good wing chun instructor/club. In my opinion, if one wants to learn about Wing Chun, this DVD is an excellent resource. Well worth the purchase.I had purchased two books that promised Sil Lum Tao. Wing Chun Kung Fu by Ip Chun had pictures for the entire form but it's difficult to learn from static pictures. I recommend this book as a good supplement to this DVD.

Most of the breakfasts are either omelets or yogurt & cottage cheese with different combinations of fruit and nuts. Big whoop.This book was a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Illicit relationship between marrieds pulls you in.","review":"The initial casual chance meeting of two marrieds is not believable.

My friend recommended it; she said it was one of her favorite movies in high school (many moons ago). I've only caught bits and pieces of it, but in short, Katherine Heigl goes on vacation with her father, Gerard Depardieu, and she leads everyone at the vacation resort to believe that her Dad is her lover, in order to catch the attention of a young and handsome hottie at the resort. Katherine Heigl's character is also a compulsive liar in the movie; it doesn't seem to bother her that everyone at the resort thinks her Dad is a pervert (because they think they are a couple). My daughter likes this movie and asks to watch it frequently, but I'm not very fond of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"mY Father The Hero","review":"We were unable to watch the dvd, it was not formated for the United States!

Very cute movie, with some funny moments as initially everyone except Depardieu knows about Nicole's little ploys. Katherine Heigl is a good choice for Nicole, a teenager embarrassed by her father and anxious to make her summer vacation memorable. Not exactly thought provoking material, but pleasant and enjoyable all around. Sure to please its intended audience, based on other reviews here. Maurice Chevalier would be glad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katherine Heigl Primo","review":"There is only one reason to buy this film. It's the pool side scene with Katherine and her dad.

The footage is great, lots of interesting clips I've never seen before, but this is the only redeeming quality. The narrator speaks fluent english, however it appears that whoever wrote the script had only been speaking english for 2 weeks whenever this was written. Upon reading the credits, it appears that it was indeed translated, which explains a lot. There are also several factual errors throughout the documentary.Its a shame, because any decent english speaker could have corrected the errors, and made this 1000x better. Its almost humorous, because at times it seems that the narrator is actually struggling to accurately reproduce the incorrect english on the script!!

This mini-series is one story arc and delves deeply into the darker side of human nature. You may find a few continuity errors in the back-story of Captain Jack Harkness but not enough to get worked up about. The remnants of Torchwood are back (though on the run) to save the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bloody mess...","review":"As a diehard fan of 'Torchwood', Captain Jack Harkness, and John Barrowman, I found 'Miracle Day' to be a monotonous mess of a... whatever it was. I don't think even its writers and producers know what it was supposed to be. Were they trying for sci-fi/horror? Drama? Allegory?The only interesting piece of the whole thing was the fleshing out of Jack's character with a failed romance in his past. But even then, the writers had a terrific opportunity to connect it more clearly and importantly with the main plot, and they just screwed it up so terribly.And might I mention that Mekhi Phifer is just terrible? How he got a role in this project is beyond me. (Well, not really--thank you, Starz!)'Miracle Day' isn't worth owning. If you're a collector who hasn't completed his collection yet, stop with 'Children of Earth' and pretend that this bad excuse of a miniseries (which should have been half as long) never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Terrible... I mean wow!... this was bad. What a let down, especially considering how excellent \\"Children of Earth\\" was. As good as \\"Children of Earth\\" was, that's how bad \\"Miracle Day\\" is.

And as far as I can tell from the packaging it is--but still it won't play on either of my two Blu Ray machines.The pity is I loved this series when I viewed it on TV, so I guess I'll have to try the DVD version and see if it will play.Bottom line: Buyer Beware of Compatibility Issues. TRULY DISAPPOINTED & UNHAPPY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, gloomy, and not worth watching","review":"As much as I adore John Barrowman, I loved Torchwood for its campy humor and the storylines that although dark, had some element of hope in them. Miracle Day was the extension of the hopelessness that ended Children of Earth, and if I could give this zero stars, I would. Some of the scenes (in particular the camps) are very triggering and in my opinion, senseless horror and badly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"The torch was dropped.","review":"I give the BBC Torchwood four stars. At least two of those stars fell on it's way to the states. What a stripped down impotent version Maricle Day was! Flat characters, one horse story that was bad (I'd say stupid) on it's own and had a 'who cares' ending that was hard to buy even for a sci-fi fan. Get The Doctor to fix time and get us home to Wales and re-animate Ianto."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the way the world ends,Not with a bang but a whimper.","review":"Torchwood: Miracle Day starts off with such promise. The first episode is undoubtedly the best by far and you keep waiting patiently through all the episodes for them to get back to that quality, but it never does. Sure they have you trying to figure it out only to do an end-run via flash backs to sneak in the answer around ep 7&8. Anyone who has ever taken a writing class can tell you this is a cheat.The miniseries does pose some great philosophical and social questions but they are buried in a boring drawn out story. This Mini would have been better even shorter. It's like they stretched a 4 part miniseries into 10. Dear Mr Davies, remember sometimes less is more.I do hope there is another series, which allows the show to redeem itself, because it would be sad to end with a whimper like this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Torchwood","review":"Excellent plot, performance, and production.

The only thing that made it Torchwood was the name. Jack and Gwen were background characters in an American show. How anyone who has enjoyed the previous 3 series likes this as Torchwood is beyond my understanding. It doesn't have the Torchwood feel.The best way to understand what I mean would be to watch the previous seasons. Even watching only Children of Earth would give an idea of what Torchwood's mission is suppose to be about. It's hard to believe the writers of Miracle Day ever watched the previous shows. If you are a true Torchwood fan, don't waste your money if you haven't seen Miracle day previously. Find a way to see it before choosing to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed. Torchwood should have stayed with BBC","review":"I am a tremendous fan of Torchwood. Or to put it more aptly, I am a tremendous fan of BBC's Torchwood. I loved the first season, was blown away by the second season, and Children of Earth left me in awe.. I admit, I had a high expectation of Judgment Day.

Rand was not original. Every one of her ideas was said by other philosophers many times before. Reading Rand, you realize that she is ignorant about this fact. A few graduate courses in the history of philosophy would have humbled her as all she did was to re-invent the wheel. It must come as a shock to her followers when they read the truly great philosophers and find out that Rand was unoriginal - and a lightweight.What Rand was, though, was a good writer. Her essays show her ability to make philosophy understandable. She was a lively writer. It is too bad that she couldn't be happy with just being a philosophical popularizer (being to philosophy what Sagan and Asimov were to science)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great intro into the epistemological world of ayn rand","review":"all kinds of topics/subjects covered here (alphabetically listed)to cross reference her ideas or to get you started if you dont yet have time to pour into her novels. i suggest starting with 'altruism' (and all the related topics in it's section footer) for those new to her work. you will quickly ask yourself, \\"how long have i been shoveling other people's shit instead of developing myself\\"?dont be too horrified when you find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent look into the mind of an original thinker","review":"Ayn Rand held so many unconventional views it is hard to remember them all. There are times when you hear some politician or college professor speaking or read some writer who is writing on a subject as if there can be no other valid point of view, and it will occur to you to wonder what Ayn Rand had to say on the subject. By no means is this a reference to all of her works, but it does contain the some of the topics which she wrote on with insight and with passion. Reason, pride, love and sex are there as are sacrifice, abortion, socialism and religion. The thing that makes reading her thoughts so valuable is that she is so clear in her explanation of _why_ she believes what she does and her views are often exactly opposite what everyone in the mainstream is saying and writing. One good insight gleaned from this book is worth more than the purchase price--and I have personally gained much by referring to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good starting place","review":"I started reading this book, but it is about as interesting or informative as a dictionary or encyclopedia.Because I didn't have a full view of what Ayn Rand was defining, it was too disjointed to make much sense to me.However, that is more because I have just started reading her writings than because the book has no value.It has a lot of value, but not without understanding/knowing what each item is within the Philosophy of Objectivism. As I progress through her other writings, this book becomes a valuable aid, but I wouldn't recommend it for a stand alone volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to understand Rand and objectivism","review":"A lot of great quotes and interesting info about Rand and objectivism. Gets to the spirit of her work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Objectivists Who Need To Be Told What To Think","review":"There are only two reasons to buy this book. If you are an Objectivist you can save yourself a lot of time and money by simply looking up the idea or issue for which you have no opinion and Rand and her grovelling \\"intellectual heir\\", Leonard Peikoff, will provide you with the appropriate one. From then on anyone who challenges you can be referred to as a collectivist, a communist, a fascist or superstitious and you will walk away from all arguments with a feeling of superiority. The second reason to buy this book is if you are studying psuedo-philosophies and cults of the 20th Century and want one book about Objectivism to reference. For the second reason I give this book two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"erects straw men","review":"i was surprised at ayn rands ignorance at many philosophersnietzche is described as a primitive poet who replaced reason with the primitive idea of willany seroius look to nietzche will show this to be false and recongize him as one of earliest depth pyschologists.rand also makes a straw man of out of socialism describing it as all individuals sacrificing themselves for the govermentalthough some socialists hold that view most aim at redistributing society to each individual the greatest possiblity of paths.ayn rand is at heart a pseodo philosopher with economic concepts of a 10 year old.any objectivists wonder why ayn rand is absent in university teachings or recongized as anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Telling omissions indeed","review":"The omission of references on family and childrearing in this volume is indeed telling - especially since a substantial section on 'abortion' is included (wherein she makes several *negative* comments on parenthood).Rand was not interested in parenthood - in fact she thought it was such a tremendous inconvenience that she defended the 'right' of women to destroy their unborn children entirely at will in order to avoid such inconvenience. Was there any other subject on which she thought whim was paramount and responsibility for one's actions could be evaded at the cost of a life? Considering her personal history, is it entirely unreasonable to suspect she may have been rationalising away some guilt on this topic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting in its omissions","review":"Open this volume of topical excerpts from the writings of Ayn Rand and read the passages under the headings Family, Parenthood, Children, and Childrearing.. . . Oooooops! There aren't any.Tell you anything?"},{"rating":"2","title":"where can you find the real deal","review":"I love the way Linda goes on in the epilogue to paint a picture of Zane and Barrie's lives after marriage. To stop without telling us what happens next was to much to bear. Now, I can't wait until we get a chance to read about Chance, the Mackenzie boys and espeacially about Nick. She's a feisty one and the guy for her...well...only Linda knows. P/S: Does Linda have other fans in Malaysia? Get in touch...I'd love to hear from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book!","review":"This is the first book of Linda Howard that i have read and it won't be last!I liked that characters very much . Zane was just great! A sensitive and strong man........ every woman's dream! story was great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"One virgin is enough","review":"Linda Howard loves to minimize her female characters into nothing more then sex objects. All of her female main characters are virgins. Quite frankly I am sick of reading about how super important that really is. All of her female characters make love for the first time like insatiable beasts ignoring their physical response to having been made love to for the first time. These characters are so fake and I am really getting sick of them. This novel really hit the bottom because her virgin girls theme I have just described to you, that has been a consistent theme in all of her other books in the Mackenzie line repeated the same ridiculous line. Why can't someone write about a beautiful woman who isn't a virgin and who really does enjoy sex for sex...without having to write an erotica?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mackenzie's Pleasure","review":"I have loved the Mackenzie's since they came into being and was so thrilled to finally get them in large print as well as hard back novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old-School Romance And Very Outdated","review":"I bought this book because it was by Linda Howard, whom I enjoy in her current novels, but this one was awful. As soon as the main character (SPOILER ALERT) was aroused by the kidnap victim whom he found lying naked, bound and brutalized, I knew I was in trouble. I realize romance novels have changed in the years since this book was written, but still ... The only bright spot was the family of the main character, the MacKenzie clan. I think I'd like to know them.The Beverly Barton story wasn't better. This story was cliched to the extreme (single woman won't tell the father of her child that he IS the father of the child for some ridiculous reason) and the deception goes on and on and on well past when a reasonable person would give up on the lie.I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quest for True Self","review":"As the world is built upon the power of numbers, \\"Integral Numerology\\" by Suzanne Wagner, helps us: explore the meaning of numbers associated with astrological signs and planets, identify each soul's karmic destiny and fully realize the encrypted information within our own names.

Wagner's book gives clarity to all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic story about Andie Claibourne","review":"Christina Evans' debut novel Lucid is a fantastic story about Andie Claibourne, a woman who can travel to other places in her dreams. Andie has been unable to control or otherwise consciously direct her power, until the sudden death of her father changes everything and forces her to put her unusual abilities to the test in order to forestall terrible things. An engaging, entertaining, and gripping narrative, Lucid is recommended for those who enjoy well written speculative fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nora Roberts book.","review":"I read all of these books separately before purchasing the book that contained all three books in the trilogy.

As all Nora Roberts' books, specially her trilogies, keep you interested, entertained and make you to want more. Very recommendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No preparation here--just a high price tag","review":"This book is a real disappointment. It offers no discussion or preparatory materials for the FE exam, just a selection of problems from other books by the same publisher. The CDs appear to be repeats of the same problems in the book. No index at all. Many typos and error, starting with the table of contents and continuing on nearly every page. Hard to see how this would help anyone prepare for this exam, if you had any questions at all about the material. And if you don't have any questions, why bother to prepare, you know it already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Care...","review":"I ordered this book for my kids school project, even though I am a voracious reader, I don't care to know anything about mad man's crazy ideologies.

It was readable, interesting and informative. It is a good book to add to your library if you are interested in the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Greater Glory - Indeed!","review":"As a minister within the Denomination of one of the four Chaplains (Reformed Church in America), I always heard the story of these brave men from other sources. I truly appreciate Dan Kurzman's writing as it lays out not only the history of this tragic event, but it tells the story of each Chaplain and provides an amazing background of each man and his family.In fact, after reading this book, my interest in the four Chaplains has grown. Simply perform a google search on: \\"Four Chaplains\\" and you will find the volumes of information concerning them.If you love history from WWII or if you want to read an amazing story of sacrifice and love, this book is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Death in Jakarta","review":"I won't write nearly as detailed a review as the last person. But when you read this book you won't be sitting in your living room, you'll be sweating at a roadblock in Jakarta. The author can transport you to a time of turbulence and fear. The book is not only about Indonesia, anyone in any third world country has seen the same. Another great thing is that the events of the book were re enacted last year, with a less brutal climax. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third World Primer","review":"Keeping the politics of this book aside; I can really recommend it for anyone who wants to feel what it's like to live through a coup and martial law. No other book I've read can really make that smell of fear and random violence as alive as Mr. Koch.The movie is best avoided. The nearest parallel movie to rival the atmosphere of this book would be \\"Power Play\\" with Peter O'Toole.Funny thing, I'm yet to meet an Indonesian who's ever even heard of \\"The Year of Living Dangerously\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le Carré-like","review":"\\"The year of living dangerously\\" is the story of a group of foreign journalists (moslty one named Guy Hamilton) in the year of Sukarno's deposition in Indonesia. It is well written and the reader is given SOME of the facts of life in Indonesia back in the sixties.The good part of this book is that it resembles, in pace , thrilling and style, one of John LeCarré's spy books.The bad part of this book is that it seems to have no reason at all to exist. The book starts out of nowhere and finishes suddenly. I don't know if that's because the environment of the story is so alien to me, or any other reason, but that's how I felt.Grade 7.1 / 10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Not a bad read at all actually. The hero is a half-Chinese dwarf named Billy. The other characters treat him quite shabbily at times, but things never descend to the level of dwarf tossing. There is lots of atmospheric stuff about how hot and humid it is in Indonesia -- duh! -- which I could have done without. Otherwise, a pretty good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Year of Living-in-Fantasy?","review":"I have to say that I cannot agree with my fellow reviewers;this novel, while mechanically well-written, follows the same basic plot line that has become standard in any North American/European story about the 'Third World': heroic journalist-rebel/cultural outsider who becomes, with the aid of a loyal local sidekick, the reader's lens onto a supposedly unknowable and incomprehensible Third World of corruption, chaos, and crisis. 'Indonesia' in this story serves as little more than colorful background for the Western hero to do his thing. The story is predictable precisely because it has been told so often before (and continues to be told; witness the identical plotline in films being made about Bosnia). The film version in this case has done justice to the book's plot; both are heavy-handed stereotypes ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little item, but !","review":"This is a good durable functional plastic quick release key ring connector. I have two of them, one used for my photon micro light to easily snap it on and off my zipper pull and the other one I use to detach some keys off my main key ring.But the price of shipping is way too high, because these little things are not worth the shipping cost, and if you want to order more then one, the shipping cost doubles in price because they won't put both tiny items together into one shipping package. But instead they want to charge you twice for shipping and not put the items in just one shipping package, which makes no sense.I would order more then one of these if the items were put into the same shipping package, so I only got charged for shipping once. But being charged more then just once when ordering more then one of these little things is just outrageous, no deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as promissed","review":"I got the cd in perfect condition in the time estimated; definitely would buy items from this seller.About the cd; this is a world premier recording and the music.is so beautiful, singers are world-class.

Does anyone know who to contact about the missing steps?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Ever Seafood Gourmet Cookbook","review":"I love this cookbook!!!

I still cannot decide weather I deplore this book or like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Beyound Us","review":"I can think of no real words to describe this novel, but I was drawn to the depth of the writing. Even the shortest sentence would provoke a kind of moral battle of the mind. When some say it was confusing, they are right in a way, but beyound the confusion there was really a simpicity to all the philosophy being said. When you thought about it, suddenly the world would seem clearer. I highly reccommend this novel to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighthearted satire","review":"What appears ostensibly as a thinking man's satire of civilisation in the distamt future (in which humanity has evolved to the level of being able to occupy two planes in space at the same time) turns out to be a bland and forgettable combination of broad jokes and tepid puns. Though the satire is quite lighthearted (poking fun at such figures as Charles Dickens, the author of \\"Origin of Species\\" and Sigmund \\"Fraud\\") this is an inevitably forgettable novel, also let down by its pamphlet-size length."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reader on Guam, Mariana Islands","review":"I read a review about this book in The Economist magazine which was very positive, and so bought it as soon as it came out. I didn't find it very thought provoking, though it was a quick read (it is a very short book and took me about three hours to read, and I'm not a speed reader) Also, I didn't find it particularly witty or humorous. This is possibly because some of the references in the book refer to London and perhaps would be better understood by those familiar with that city. I do recommend Plato's (The Greek one) Apology and other dialogues of Socrates, which this book mimics in form. And Plato's works are available free on the net."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing changes right before your eyes!","review":"I am amazed at how Martha Thompson can teach you to take simple squares and turn them into these incredible quilts!
