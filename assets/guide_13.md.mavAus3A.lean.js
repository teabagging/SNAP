Hands down, this DVD is way better than any book and better than any of the \\"free\\" lessons you can find on YouTube.The lessons start with simple things like how to hold the guitar and tune it. From there, you'll learn some simple chords and strumming techniques. There's looped backing tracks you can play along with, so from the very first lesson you're actually \\"playing\\" guitar. It's a real feeling of accomplishment.A drawback is that the DVD doesn't come with any chord charts - it would have been nice to have a printed set of beginners chords to refer to as you play along (this is where the book I bought does have value).Definitely recommended for the beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Keith Wyatt, the instructor, obviously knows how to play a guitar, and has probably been playing for a lifetime.

Whoopi Goldberg had some of her locks printed in her square. Michael and Kirk Douglas are the only father and son team to have squares.Still, this work drags after awhile. It gets tired seeing Actor X make his mark, then Actor Y, then Z, ad infinitum. It is either thin on facts or the facts don't really take that much time to tell. The focus here is on old Hollywood.

She smoked, told dirty jokes and went out with college guys. When I saw her at the 30th reunion, she was dressed up and gorgeous with a younger guy on her arm - and she still smoked and told dirty jokes. The songs on this wonderful CD are like hearing bawdy stories about what she has been doing for the past decades. She still hangs out with music royalty like Graham Nash, Lee Sklar, and Russ Kunkel, who all lend a hand. The songs are like good short stories that touch on her Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, roots (including an homage to CF native and supercomputer pioneer Seymour Cray) and her adopted California home. They are spare musically, but full of wit and charm.(One of even suggests that fat guys can get lucky.) They are the musical equivalent of the snicker you share with a friend when someone else doesn't get your joke. I can't wait to see if she will be touring soon.

The voice of the author, Joya Pope, seems to overpower the voice of Michael, and I often doubted whether the information was accurately channeled. I disliked the tone, political correctness, and over-focus on the lives of celebrities. Many of the comments I have on this book also apply to Joya Pope's The World According to Michael.

The lights are really dim if you can actually keep the contacts from pushing into the body long enough to wire em.

Keith Wyatt is a great instructor, you immediately learn so much with the guitar that it's fun, and encouraging. The lessons are not confusing at all, it's simple and point blank.

I thought perhaps they were the minority. Then I reread the good reviews. They sound like advertisements. I highly suspect they are paid reviews (this is a common practice) and are from people who never even saw the DVD. I contacted the company and Amazon. If things are fixed I will amend this revew.

The instruction is clear and each section builds on the next. You clearly will understand what you are learning and the practice tracks give you a looped base upon which to practice what you are learning. This is a great starting guitar DVD and you can then take all that you have learned here and learn from other DVD's, magazines, etc. If I would have started with some of the other \\"beginner\\" DVD's I have expanded on to using, I may have given up because they ignore too much of the basics. With the learning from this DVD, the others make sense and I am able to absorb their lessons quickly and play with more understanding. This DVD is worth twice its cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"beginner player","review":"I feel the same way all the other one star reviewers felt.

These were one of the worst. They are round rather than oval or, you know, eye shaped, so they constantly leaked. There is only one strap (rather than the common two) which is not stretchy so it has to be very tight to even stay on, let alone keep the water out. Do not buy these goggles for your kids. Buy some with two straps in the back or one strap that splits and oval eye openings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another of Blossom's rare gems!","review":"This is one of two Verve recordings that is currently unavailable domestically and as I said of the other one, it is truly a shame! This album contains some of Blossom's most whimsical observations on living and loving! Sure to bring a smile to your face from beginning to end, my favorite track is definitely 'Rhode Island Is Famous For You'. Other standout tracks are 'Confession', 'To Keep My Love Alive', and 'Always True To You In My Fashion'. As another reviewer has said on this website, Blossom should be \\"selling out huge venues at $100 a ticket\\", but is still under-appreciated by a world that should be singing her praises and demanding every recording at their local music store!

Heck, the battery costs about that much. My primary circular is a PorterCable with lots of power and blade on the right. The DeWalt has blade on the other side, so I keep them both lying about when doing light framing and use one or the other depending on which end of the board I need to trim, as a right handed user. It is also very useful to run up a ladder and trim something quickly. Or to go to another floor in the house to do a quick job and not deal with hooking up an extension cord, etc. As others have said - if your expectations are grounded in reality, you will find it a useful tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Unit","review":"I love this saw.

Not only is it great by the standards of his martial arts action films, but is actually a cut above many action pictures.Norris plays a Chicago cop who finds himself caught between a turf war between the Mafia and a Colombian drug cartel. His standing on the force suffers at the same time because he testifies against two cops who are involved in a bad shooting. The Code of Silence ends up being double-pronged - one side being the Mafia's Code of Silence, and the other being the police force's Code of Silence against bad behavior by their own.Directed by Andrew Davis, who also directed Above The Law, Under Siege and The Fugitive, Code of Silence has great action sequences and a great villain in Henry Silva. This is Norris' finest film. Nothing he has done before or since has been anywhere near as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read, easy to follow and an excellent guide to yoga!","review":"I began practicing yoga over the summer with an instructor.

Not in this case. They did not spare any expense to make this \\"Essential Yoga\\" book a work of art. I addition to the expanded breathing exercises, the detailed yoga positions and even the mystical advice, you will enjoy reading a beautiful book, with an excellent choice of colors, fonts and graphics. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Hard to Read","review":"I agree with the other reviews about the book being thorough and high quality. I like the fact that the principle names of the asanas are in English, and the the Indian names are there if I need them. I mainly bought the book because of the excellent final section on routines, which a lot of yoga books lack. I've been doing yoga a long time and don't need a lot of instruction on the individual poses: I wanted some new routines and variations to check out.My one problem with the book is the small, light fonts, including the section headings. It makes it hard for me to read, and with all the empty space on each page, it would have been easy and helpful to use a larger font and darker print, as well as having more defined chapter headings. Otherwise, it is a great book and useful for beginners and intermediates alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise yet comprehensive resource...","review":"I received this book today, and was already inspired to try one of the recommended routines. Essential Yoga aims to be an interactive guide to Hatha yoga. As such, it consists of detailed instructions on over a hundred yoga poses, with sections on breathing and meditation as well. My favorite parts of the book are the recommended routines, which are either sequences geared towards specific activities: yoga for golfers, for knee pain, for runners, etc; or for times of day; or sequences for routine practice.I think this is a book which will grow with you as you increase in your knowledge and ability in yoga. It's practical as well. The lay-flat spine does indeed lay flat, the line drawings are informative and clear, and the layout of the book is intuitive and motivating. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"tight collection","review":"always been a huge fan of the bee gees and this collection is so cool, great songwriting and the harmony and music wins everytime. they are one of the greatest music acts ever to me and this collection is a friendly reminder of there vast talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guts to Try: The Untold Story of the Iran Hostage Rescue Mission by the On-Scene Desert Commander","review":"Colonel Kyle's detailed narrative of the tragic attempt at the hostage rescue is a very good read.

This book is just as good as Charlie Beckwith's \\"Delta Force,\\" but much less famous. It covers the overall planning of Eagle Claw at a joint-forces administrative level above Beckwith, and covers the joint-forces command of the actual mission, since Kyle was the overall commander at Desert One. The mechanical and personal failures of the helocopters and their crews are also discussed, as well as Kyle's conclusions on why the mission failed. Beckwith's book covers SFOD-Delta issues more closely, but Kyle's book examines why Eagle Claw failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Day the Earth Stood Still Gort 16-Inch Statue","review":"Well, first, you must be a fan of the 1951 TV Movie, The Day the Earth Stood Still to appreciate this statue. Gort in the 1951 movie was a simple figure back then, and this replicated statue is a simple one today. It is what it is, and my expectation of this statue was met when I received it. It does look well in the background of my other figure collectibles, as it hovers over them at being 16 inches tall. It's just a rememberance of yesteryear. If this all makes sense to you, then I suggest you buy it for the $30.00!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over priced","review":"This collectible is way overpriced for what you get. Cheap cardboard box that does not even have a window flap to view the figure, you have to open the box to see it which is not usually something people like to do with a collectible. The figure itself is a sold blob of plastic no articulation or paint apps to speak of.

So, the rare times that I view this dvd, I try to avoid looking at the screen. Unfortunately, I can still see the screen out of the corner of my eye. The music is of the ballet-piano variety, which I am not the biggest fan of. The instructor breezes a little too fast through the poses, and her voice sounds like Jenny Jones's--this I wish I had known before I bought the dvd.The core essentials portion of the dvd is strange--the instructor starts off with this weird speed floor aerobics. Then I realize that in order to do the workout, one needed to have purchased this weighted little ball (a catalog and order form is 'conveniently' included inside the dvd) from her store. Voight doesn't even suggest modifications in the event you do not have this ball, which I found annoying.There are much better yoga dvds out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is okay","review":"The strong point of this video is Karen's no-nonsense instruction.

Further credibility challenges come up surrounding the death of her children. Finally, the hero and heroine fall in love without any apparent reason. The author never shows the two falling in love, they merely do in the first couple of chapters of the book. The rest of the story centers around violence, murder, and rape.

The notation and tab seem accurate to my ears and I love the fact that you get guitar, bass, and drums. The big negative that you will find is the notation is limited to major themes/riffs of each song. You do not get complete versions of anything, which for me was a great disappointment.

Although he is a reluctant participant and aware of the political and power-hungry jealousies around him, St. Germain does his best to fulfill his mission, even making the \\"dark jewels\\" that seem to calm the mad Tsar's mind. As a \\"reward\\" he is ordered by the Tsar to marry a terrified young woman with a tragic past. Slowly and gently, St. Germain gains her trust. (Their scenes together are both humorous and tenderly erotic.) Despite the jealous hatred surrounding him in the dark mediveal Russian court, St. Germain also makes a few loyal friends who come to his rescue when he is finally ensnared by his enemies and horrifically tortured. The descriptions of life in mediveal Russia are well drawn and the story compellingly told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Let's see, how's this one go?

Gleick's treatment comes across as distressingly dry, seemingly focused on a few spats and grudges Newton carried for decades instead of his painstaking efforts and surmises that led to modern physics, optics, calculus, gravity and other immense elucidations. The book is also rather short on personal aspects of Newton's life aside from some pages devoted to his childhood and early collegiate years. At under 200 pages, perhaps I should have suspected as much. To say the least, the Notes, Sources and Index take up an additional 80 pages so this is no fault upon Mr. Gleick's scholarship but rather his story-telling. If you seek a driving narrative about one of the most fascinating humans to inhabit the Earth, I implore you to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for a big fan of Genius by Gleick","review":"I loved Gleick's biography of Richard Feynman, \\"Genius\\". So my expectations for this book on possibly the most important mathematical and scientific figure were very high. I was somewhat disappointed. This biography is a little short and seemed to need a little more meat. I did not feel that truly made the reader understand the importance of Newton's accomplishments. I thought there was a little too much on Newton's forays into other fields like philosophy, etc. Also a little too much on the political fights with other scientists and mathematicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a pleasure of a book to read","review":"I just finished reading a terrific book (Joel Hayward, FOR GOD AND GLORY) that conveyed the full richness of Lord Nelson's life in a mere 250 pages.

I wish all scholars learned this technique: say what's important, don't say what's not, give some original insights, and wrap up with a strong, even-handed and thoughtful conclusion.I applaud the author of this book, which has made science interesting and scienTISTS, widely considered boring and bookish, even more interesting. Newton's genius shines out from every well-written page. What a great man. Newton and Einstein are the Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing of science!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Newton light","review":"If you want a quick overview of Isaac Newton this book is okay.

According to other reviews, the struggles between Newton and the philosophy of Descartes, and the personality of Hooke, and the possible plagarism of Leibnitz, are not new or unknown. They were to me. Another thing that I didn't understand about the times that Newton lived in was how his society and culture was so steeped in mysticism and the occult. Newton set his philosophy apart from the rest by strictly defining all of the terms that he used. So, while religions and other faith philosophies thrive on the dishonesty of wordplay, science, as defined by Newton's approach, rules the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch sci-tech writing","review":"Gleik's book is an engaging synthesis of top-notch sci-tech writing and biography. But it lacks the same thing another genre best-seller--Galileo's Daughter-- does, at least for me. It gives no perspective on what might be called the moral status of Newton's ideas in light of the subsequent centuries of philosophical inquiry and scientific investigation.In recognizing Newton and Galileo as giants of science we should also understand them to be figures of enormous influence in the West's positivist, mechanistic, scientistic worldview. They each had a powerful moral impact on the West. It can be seen not only in positive scientific advances, but also in the worst excesses and errors of the scientific enterprise. A book that sheds light on this aspect of Galileo's genius and that I greatly enjoyed is Wade Rowland's Galileo's Mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"inexpensive buy","review":"consider the price, it is inexpensive, so far, I used it a couple of times, it's doing ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad idea if you are thinking cheesecakes","review":"I thought the four 4.5 inch springform pans would be equivalent to one 9.0 inch springform pan. After all, the areas are equal, i.e. 4 * 2.25 * 2.25 * pi == 4.5 * 4.5 * pi. I thought I could use the recipe for a 9-inch cheesecake and have 4 4.5-inch cheesecakes that tasted the same but were a more convenient size for giving as gifts.However, while the areas are the same, the volumes are not. The pans are not deep enough. While a 9-inch springform pan is 3 inches deep, these 4.5-inch springform pans are 1.5 inches deep. Therefore, if you use the recipe for a 9 inch cheese cake, you have a lot of batter left over. If you half the recipe, you produce baked goods that taste something like cheesecake but not as dense or as moist or as rich.I was very disappointed in these pans.

I must say it was one of the least enjoyable reading experiences I have ever had, reminding me of some of the obsolete literary styles I had to plow through in graduate school. The prose was mannered, self-conscious and pretentious, much I fear in the manner valued by her Transcendentalist contemporaries. When I read American Bloomsbury I found that Cheever appropriately described Fuller's writing as \\"turgid, quotation/ridden prose\\". I do not recommend it unless you are writing a thesis on mid-nineteenth century American thought or on the history of feminism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contents of this set","review":"This is not a review.

The book is very fun and I love how there is some advanced vocabulary. It is a great way to introduce new words in a very fun way! It's hardly like learning at all, but that's what happens. The poems are a lot of fun!I purchased the book with the intention of giving it to a three year old. Some of the poems do include sarcasm and/or negativity that I wouldnt read to her just because she wouldnt yet understand that it was a joke. But most of them are perfectly suitable for very young children.I highly recommend this book, and use your own judgement to decide whether each poem is appropriate for the age child you are reading it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"The book A Pizza the Size of the Sun by Jack Prelusty was just okay.

In the first lesson plan, I split the class into small groups and gave them a poem to act out for the class. The second, I gave them a poem about an amazing elephant and they had to use the details from the poem to illustrate what the elephant looked like! They enjoyed the lessons tons!

Recently, I saw this book in a store and immediately snatched it up (along with an \\"It's Raining Pigs and Noodles\\" umbrella). Reading through it again, I found that the poems aren't just for children. Granted the themes maybe be childish, the language itself is more sophisticated. Some poems are very adult (not in an obscene way, of course) such as \\"I'm Drifting Through Negative Space\\" and \\"When I Am Full of Silence.\\" I adore this book once again and I recommend it for all.

Installing was easy, though there were no screw-mount-holes to use on this item. Using it with a new Sirius Sportster5. The contrast between using the Fm-signal wire that comes with the Sportster5 versus this item is significant. The signal clarity sounds like we're listening to an FM station while parked next door to the station. Simply astounding.

It actually makes the sat radio come in stereo rather just single channel. Also areas of my commute where the radio interference was greatest is now gone. I get clear sat radio everywhere I go. Install was easy except for one thing. My factory installed radio used a different type of plug than the one that was on the unit. I had my stereo pulled out of the dash and disassembled (to properly install the wires in the dash) before I realized that I needed another piece.

The Audiovox FMDA 25 was what I needed for my second vehicle, and it did it's job with no problems.

I have used The SIRIUS FM Antenna Extension Cable and its instructions say to find a frequency with no station but I always got interference. This item, the Sirius Wired FM Relay, does what is supposed to do. I decided to try something as a test to see how good it really works. I set my radio on the most powerful FM station in my area and I set the modulator frequency to the same and it completely cancels out the over the air radio station with no static what so ever. Using a cassette adapter or a direct input cable are easier since you don't need to remove the radio to install them but if you do not have the option of a cassette player or direct input this unit works excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit vehicle","review":"Does not work in 2010 Saab 9-3 even though it is listed to fit.

Happy customer here both with amazon and audiovox.. Id recommend the unit if you dont have an aux in for audio on your stereo which I didnt. BTW there is a good pdf file on the web that covers removing the subaru outback radio which took a while. To save you time do some reseach on your radio and check if the standard connection to your radio is motorola or not.

If you are a woman and you have some hair to fit into it, I would definitely suggest the larger size. You also cannot really wear earrings when pulling this helmet on, as it quite tight at the bottom (As it should really by). The shield in the front is just what I was looking for, easily slides up and down, but locks nicely when all the way down. The strap is a bit cumbersome, but most are, and it is worth the safety you get from this helmet! Plus, it is DOT approved, which is great.

Paul Van Dyk gets hsi recognition as a very impressive mix of \\"for an Angel\\" is mixed in too. This CD was well thought and planned because since most the songs and artists are not familiar to the U.S. audiences, it incorporates some HUGE DANCE HITS that are familiar in the states. These are of course: Nalin and Kane's \\"Beachball\\", Faithless's \\"Insomnia\\", Wink's \\"Higher State of Consciousness\\", and BT's \\"Flaming June.\\" With these titles it shows you vast and wide array of sounds that this compilation holds.

It is not spectacular nor great but bad either.The camera has a good interface on screen and the flash does its job once you have figured out working around some standard settings.The view finder is useless as it is the size of a pin head. Canon could have got rid of that feature. Thankfully the display works well, also outside in the sun.Picture quality is as you would expect of Canon.I wonder when Canon improves on the battery indication level as now it only shows up when it is almost time to recharge/replace the battery. When you are out on a trip that can be a bit of a problem. The alternative is to charge it every time you are coming home afte rusing the camera but that again is not good for the lifespan of the battery.I am keeping the camera as a second one next to my bigger and much better Panasonic8 that I do not want to drag around every night and day whilst this one fits in your pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannon SD850","review":"Great camera!

Canon \\"customer care\\" says that the technicians found \\"water damage\\" even though the camera was never around water and worked fine up until the moment it stopped. Clearly, if they don't want to repair something a customer sends back they can just say \\"water damage\\" and they are off the hook.

The controls are well placed, and reduced to a minimal, or rather optimal, number. Although, the few controls on the back by no means limit the versatility of the camera. There are many functions one can play with, and I would encourage anyone who owns it to get acquainted with all of them. Pictures are excellent quality. True colors, and no visible optical defects.

Except for a corner softness in the shots that are taken at night, which of course can be removed to an extent in the manual settings, this camera is awesome.I would recommend this for people who are looking for a pocket camera and are not very keen in taking really amazing pictures that are compared to high end cameras.A family camera that is easy to operate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Easy with great photos too","review":"I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now, its fantastic.

I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a point and shoot in this price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Point and Shoot","review":"I have a Canon G6 which I love. However, I wanted something I could carry in my pocket so after some research I picked the Canon SD850 IS. I took it on a cruise with me so I could always have it with me. I took a lot of pictures with it and can say that outside in daylight it takes great pictures. Maybe even better than my G6. However, inside and in situations where you need a flash it leaves a bit to be desired. First the flash is on the upper left hand corner of the camera so it is easy to block the flash with your finger when taking pictures. Also as this is a smaller camera the flash is limited so don't expect any great pictures at any distance. The flash is just not strong enough to cover much area. Bottom line: I am satisfied with the camera. It serves the purpose that I bought it for. It a great point and shoot pocket camera with some good features on it. If I am going on a photo project I take both cameras in the event I need a good flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexperienced User","review":"I bought this camera before a trip to London. It has many features and icons that are a little overwhelming for a person who is looking for a point and shoot camera. Mainly I set it on auto and used it without the various bells and whistles available. The pics were good - not great - and seemed to be a little on the dark side. Maybe if I knew how to use it to its fullest capcity it would provide better photos. One other comment - the zoom dial is very senstive and sometimes difficult to get the precise range you are trying for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little point-and-shooter","review":"I love the video mode, captures clear and smooth video to be displayed on YouTube. Not trying to compare to videocam here, but its video capability is just enough for web broadcast. The auto mode is suitable for just about everything. Occasionally, needs to switch to manual mode to capture low light close up shoots. The scene/indoor mode is great for taking pictures at home. The \\"kids/pets\\" mode not very useful. Keep an eye on the flash when using scene mode, the auto setting might be too much light. The zoom is just 4x, enough for daily use but not great if far away from object. The battery life is excellent, been taking way too many pictures or videos and never run dry.The print outs are great, I have an Canon IP5000, everything is ver detailed and correct balance of color, and face is not too warm.If you just want something easy to use and don't have time to adjust exposure ....etc, this is a great camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera","review":"This is the second time I have purchased this camera, after my first one broke.

Unfortunataly the camera only lasted about 2 years before falling apart. On a trip to california the camera decided to give me a \\"lens error\\" and would no longer retract the lens. After looking closely at the camera body i noticed there were multiple screws missing as well. I did not consider this the top of the line but $250 bones is quite a bit too spend on a point and shoot. I purchased the camera after much online research and reading great reviews on about every site i visited, none of them mentioned I would be throwing it in the trash a few years later. At least with my old sony i sold it on ebay when i upgraded, fat chance with this one.

I was able to take photos hand held at a shutter speed of 1/4 sec. Relatively low noise at up to ISO 200. ISO 400 noise level and detail are good enough for snapshots. Because the camera is so small, controls are close together so care must be taken to not change settings inadvertently. In very bright daylight, the screen is usable for composing but you cannot see detail in it. In that case you can use the optical viewfinder.

After reading and re-reading the manual (and not just the quick start manual - the full version) We were both very confident that we had a good grasp of the camera and the functions. We set it to super fine quality and the pictures are just not very crisp. In fact, they are hazy and in very soft focus - as if we had it set to the lowest resolution.

I own a Canon Xti and have shot with a 30d, this camera in certain situations does a better job in Auto mode with shot exposure than either the 30d or the xti. I suspect that it is the new Digic III processor that does such a great job handling exposure. Can it do all that you can do with an xti? uhhh..no, not even close.

Well, I'm sorry to report that this camera, for the amount I paid, does not live up to its reputation. Low light pics are the noisiest I've ever seen and being I will be taking most of my pics at gigs and concerts, this camera will not do it for me. I tried every setting including all manual settings but who wants to fiddle around with manual controls if you're trying to capture a candid shot? If you are considering this cam for purchase, please note that it is a very poor low light performer and if you will be shooting in low light, you should probably keep on looking.

The only improvement could be to have a battery meter as this camera only warns when the battery is getting low.Also, the Amazon price seemed very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I like the Canon PowerShot so far. The face detection technology is a little wonky: sometimes it grabs a face, sometimes it ignores a face and goes for something else. Image stabilization seems to help a lot, although I still get an occasionally blurry photo if I move a bit too much.I am not wild about the port cover for the USB connection. It's very cheaply attached and will probably break in not much time. The included software (ZoomBrowser) is very good and transfers the pictures quickly.Ergonomically, the camera is comfortable and I don't have any trouble with the on/off button. I agree that it's disconcerting to have the lens stay out while reviewing photos, but as long as you're careful it's not a big issue.Overall, I'd give the camera an A-/B+. Indoor shots are still a little difficult due to overexposure with the flash, but this camera is still a huge improvement over my 7-yr. old Nikon Coolpix. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good point-and-shoot camera","review":"i am really satisfied with the overall quality of pictures taken using this camera.

But in light of my experience with the 850 IS, I'll be reluctant to do so again. My camera worked reasonably well for the first three years of ownership, although I never found the IS feature to work as consistently or as well as promoted in Canon's marketing of the product. But in the past year, my camera has developed the focusing problem others have reported. Whether or not I use the optical zoom, the camera fails to focus in auto or manual mode. As I take most of my shots indoors, this has rendered the shots useless. Meanwhile, my cell phone camera (an iPhone 4) manages to focus and take decent shots in similar settings with no trouble. A camera this expensive and this touted for its features should not last such a short time.

I really miss that.Also, the zoom button is completely in a silly place. It's next to impossible to use it the way it's designed. Should have been on the inside. It's also not easy to use for flipping through photos and zooming in and out.And you can't force the flash on only off in the automatic setting?

My next camera will be a Canon, but a cheaper one, and I'll basically be treating it as an 18mo disposable camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera @ a great price","review":"Great Camera @ a great priceCanon PowerShot SD850 IS 8.0 MP Digital Elph Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom"},{"rating":"2","title":"good camera","review":"Optical Image Stabilizer technology impressed me since my hands usually shake a lot when taking pictures. high resolution makes your great pictures 4X is not great, but as far as good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning toy!","review":"I never imagined how many truly educational toys are out there that are also very fun. My 3 yr old loves to color with this toy. He tends to be drawn toward the tv and I welcome anything that can boost his imagination and creativity. Its been a great buy for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unresponsive and Inaudible Toy","review":"My biggest complaint with the talking Leap Frog toys is that the words are often difficult to distinguish. I have the same complaint with this toy. However, my biggest complaint is the fact that you must bear down very hard when coloring in order for the toy to respond and identify what you are coloring. Our daughter colors very well but with a lighter stroke. The instructions indicate that a \\"medium pressure\\" on the surfact is required; however, I tried coloring with what I considered heavy pressure for an adult, and the toy frequently failed to respond. I am not all impressed or satisfied with this product. Unless you have a child with a heavy hand, I would recommend against purcahsing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renea (Kamryns Mommy)","review":"Leap Frog has done it again.

The purple piece that holds the coloring page indoesn't stay in very well. Also, it seems that the kidsreally have to press hard in order for the device to knowwhere they are. My son got this for Christmas and hardlyever plays with it, when he does, it turns itself off a lotbecause it can't sense that he is coloring. Anyway, it is abig disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A toy for every preschooler","review":"My three year old can't get enough of this learning toy. She sings, repeats letter noises and loves the different levels (ie. games, learning colors and music.) She really like having the two interchangable face plates for different activities (coloring plate and numbers with Leap and friends) The fact that it comes with three sets of the letter coloring sheets was great. I don't think I could have imagined the fun she is having. The positive feedback when correct numbers, colors or friends are found is great. If she can not find correct color or number it encourages her to keep trying by giving her little hints. (ie. the number 8 comes after 7 and is the color yellow.) The only problem- My 16 month old wants to play with it too!! I will be purchasing another one real soon. THIS TOY IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY PRESCHOOLER"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning but cheap materials","review":"My 2 1/2 year old son got this for Christmas. I was thrilled because I told his Grandma I wanted one for him. He has fun coloring and likes the songs and games, especially the number bus. The problems we are having are these: The cover for the crayon holder falls off everytime we open it, and the purple frame that holds the sheets also falls apart everytime we change sheets. I like the learning taking place, but am very disappointed in the product durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's alright,but not a must have","review":"Maybe my kids are just a little old- at 4 and 5, they have no interest in it what-so-ever. The 4 yr old likes the train, but for about 30 seconds once every 60 days or so. It is packed in our cupboard and only comes out when a child is trying to get a toy that is behind it.However- making copies of pages is not necessary- you can print more pages from the original coloring books online. Only if you want different pages ( like Pooh or whatever there are) do you need to buy the added things."},{"rating":"2","title":"incedible","review":"i bought this for my 4 year old son and he loves it my 2 year old also like it this toy is great the only thing is that i would recomend that anyone who buys this toy must buy a mind station it gives you so many options ans it also gives your little one a little variety"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmet Expectations","review":"I purchased this toy for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She has excellent fine motor skills, holds her writing instruments properly and has been coloring since she was just over year old. She would color the page but did not press hard enough to make the buttons underneath work. I thought maybe she wasn't pressing down hard enough and I told her to press harder. Well, she had to put the crayon in her fist and put her other hand on top to press hard enough-A POOR habit for a child to ge into. I tried to press and I had to press much harder than I would normally color to make the desk work.A person (especially a child!) should not have to work this hard to get a product to work. I am going to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think before you buy this....","review":"My 3 year old daughter has had this toy for a total of 5 days and we are already having problems. The batteries already need replaced, the cover to the crayon compartment will not stay on and the top purple plastic cover for the coloring pages keeps coming off the hinges and she cannot get it back on without help. Also, she was colring the letter \\"c\\" and the pad was telling her about the letter \\"u\\".

The toy responds inappropriately as you move the crayon and color it will stop what its saying and start all over again. I htink that leapfrog needs to get the bugs out. The counting train works fine and my son loves the song that goes along with it. All in all I don't think I would buy this toy again. Try the Leap top my son loved it for the same price and no glitches ( not as bulky either)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not completely satisfied","review":"We bought this for our two and a half year old for Christmas. He is was just beginning to learn his letters and numbers. I love the number train attachment, as does he. He responds to the questions and is beginning to learn the numbers with this. I do not like the coloring pages. I would prefer to buy a coloring book with these pages for three or four dollars instead. The sounds are too easily reset and Leap keeps changing the subject as my son colors. Also, my son may color in the wrong spot and Leap will be singing the A song while my son is coloring the B page. I wish I could have bought the number attachment separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much less than meets the eye","review":"I was greatly disappointed with this toy. My 2 1/2 year old received it as a gift and , considering all the hype surrounding this product , I expected more. It wastes an enormous quantity of paper. You can only use one side of each sheet and at one page page per letter the supply provided with the desk doesn't last very long. If the paper isn't lined up perfectly then your child may wind up hearing the info and song for another letter. This is not a good thing. If the crayon is not utilized in the just the right manner then the desk will not work properly or , even worse, the song just continually restarts. This toy has too many idiosyncrasies and too little educational value. A good alphabet or counting book will accomplish more and cost much less. There's plenty of software that works better if your more inclined to the hi-tech. This is not a toy that I would recommend . Also the mind station is not Mac compatible. Something else to keep in mind"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy this Christmas!","review":"My 4 1/2 year old son recieved a wide variety of toys for Christmas and I am most surprised by this toy!!

When her cousins came over (6 and 8) they loved playing with it too. It's been a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Hype For This Toy!","review":"My daughter received this toy as a gift. For this toy to work, your child will have to press down HARD with the crayon. But when he/she does so, the paper can slide out of position. To put the paper back the child has to open the frame (which is somewhat flimsy) and reset the page.For the money, the desk should be easier for a young child to operate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the money!","review":"This makes my second year owning this pool for a relativity inexpensive pool I am very pleased.

The pool held up nicely. We live in Montana so we drained the pool in the fall and left it up but empty all winter. When it got hot out again my son who is 8 and his friend got in the pool and cleaned it out. It was pretty easy with our shop vac and the mop. We filled it with water and again this year it as been used almost every day with around 10 kids. This pool is great. The pump also has been working wonderfully.

It's for my two small children, but they can't go in there alone so I do need to be in there with them so I'm not happy about this height. Also, the image is deceiving.

I'm sure the commentaries or interviews will claim this man was the \\"only one\\" who could play this part, but boy -- if they started off with a better actor in that central role and toned down the medical-marijuana-while-watching-Python-DVDs-in-the-background-and-pecking-at-Final-Draft screenwriting excesses they might have had something here. As it is, they have nothing. Avoid this terrible film and see films by directors doing something original and clever. You want Super 8mm? Go watch Guy Maddin movies. Support good art and let horrible crap like this get buried in your queue."},{"rating":"1","title":"No need to hit me over the head to make a point","review":"This movie is a dark comedy and involves eccentric characters, which is my favorite type of movie. But, most of the humor and characters are over the top. The acting and dialogue are very deliberate in trying to be funny and different. I'm not sure what the movie is trying to be. It seems more like it is mocking a Wes Anderson movie. I'd understand if that was the case, but I don't think it was. Overall, two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bittersweet finale","review":"A FAMILY AFFAIR is a bittersweet finish to Stout's wonderful series. One of Rusterman's waiters is killed in Wolfe's home and the resulting investigation heads down a path that lies very close to Wolfe and Archie. All the extended cast make an appearance; Cramer and Stebbins, Lily Rowan and even Theodore Horstman, Wolfe's orchid man, all have a moment in this farewell. The killer is revealed relatively early in this one as it leads to dark ending; an ending befitting the grim circumstances of this case. This is not the best of Stout's Wolfe mysteries but it certainly is a memorable one.The closing lines bring the series to an appropriate end:Wolfe said, \\"Will you bring brandy, Archie? And two glasses. If Fritz is up, bring him and three glasses. We'll try to get some sleep.\\" after forty years of wonderful adventures and possibly the most re-readable mysteries ever, they deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Dissapointing","review":"I love Rex Stout!

I will someday but with so many other books out there, I think I can live without knowing who killed the waiter."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this the same author?","review":"This story, unlike all the other Nero Wolfe stories that take place in the late 30s and early 40s, suddenly takes place in the 70s.

I usually just keep it on the last setting where you're supposed to \\"repeat\\" the song. The other settings get on my nerves too quickly. I think it's fun.

My one complaint is the voices that are used for this drum. They are high pitched children's voices and after awhile they drive me nuts. The lower educational rating reflects my belief that at this age (my son is 10 months old) I think toys should concentrate more on motor skills than advanced cognitive skills like ABCs and 123s.

My son is in a hitting things phase and it is a nice appropriate toy to hit, but it shuts itself off before he has a chance to hit it again and I have to reset it for him.In summary..

I never saw it before, but knew leap frog from the pre-school toys. It is the perfect size and he just loves it. I like that it will grow with him, unlike so many toys out there. Right now I put it on the music setting and he likes hitting it and hearing the music. He's discovered that it even works by hitting the sides and bottom of the drum! And another nice feature is that it turns itself off after a minute or so if my son crawls away to play with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"I bought this for my 9 month old. He loves it! Every morning he sits and hits the drum for at least 15 minutes - he smiles when he sees it. Once he gets a little older, he'll understrand the letters and numbers part, but for now, he loves the drum sound and singing! My 3 year old neice loves it when she comes to visit, she bangs and says letters and numbers along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother vs Daughter review","review":"My daughter would give this toy a 10 out of 5. She loves it that much. I'd give it a 4 on education, agreeing with the review that said that you have to learn to pause to hear each letter. I'd give it a 0 if I was rating annoyance. My daughter turns it on and will march into every room holding in the 'star' button that makes it do a demo song. She won't let the song get 5 secs and she hits it again. So it's like a broken record. I'd give it a 5 on durability as I would anything that lived through my daughter and nephews wrath. My daughter did learn some letters from this and learned how to count to ten, which is a blessing for us because she is a special needs child and we have problems getting through her 'wall' and into her world of learning. This way, she learns while having fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Drum","review":"My husband and my son play with this toy. It's durable and has a nice volume switch, so it's not too annoying. This toy seems to keep my sons interest very well. It has what seems to be a lot of different things that it does at each setting. I like the memory game that it has to offer. I would recommend this toy to any parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun but thats all","review":"This is a fun toy, but as for learning...I really dont see it. You have to pause for some time for them to really learn anything. And all my daughter wanted to do was wack it."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought is would really interest a 13 month old","review":"This is a cute toy. Everything works! It just didn't hold my 13 month old, son's attention. I thought that he would like hitting something, he didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thank you!","review":"This toy is loud and obnoxious. Anyone who buys this as a gift is sure to get mean thoughts from the child's parents. There is no educational value as the words are hard to hear over the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!!!","review":"My husband and I hated this toy!!! The music and sound is extememly annoying. Not to mention that my 7 month old was completely uninterested in it. It would have been a cool toy if you could just hit the drum and it would simply count or make a single drum noise. But it doesn't, with every single hit the sound goes on and on. Even if my daughter played with it she would never hear the extent of what the drum would do. Who just hits a drum once and then waits several seconds to hit it again? They made this way too comlicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"First grade Teacher loves it and recommends it highly","review":"I'm a teacher and just HAD to have it for my daughter. One of my friends got it for me for my \\"after the baby is born, shower\\". I purchased it for my nephew as well. It's great fun and highly enticing. I saw it on one of those late night tv shopping channels, two grown men were playing with it and demonstrating how it works. They too had a blast with it. My daughter has difficulty turning it on but once it's on she plays with it for a long time. I highly recommend it. The price is great and they can use it up until age 5 or so. It's a hit with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning drum","review":"This toy is actually quite annoying. No matter where you touch it, so much as move it a little, it starts to light up and make noise. I truly don't see the learning value in this toy. It make be cute for very young children, but it's annoying to their parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celena's Favorite!","review":"My 10 month old has had this toy since she was 6 months old and it is still her favorite. She wiggles (her form of dancing) whenever the music comes on and grins while she pounds on the drum. I take it from room to room with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice but loud","review":"Overall a nice toy, we are giving it two stars because of educational value. The thing we don't like is about the limited ability to control volume. There are only two volume control settings, Low and High and the Low seem to be more like medium or high. Preferably, there should be a variable type volume control, the type found on most AM/FM radios or there should be at least one more super low (actually low as low is medium) setting. Also there should be a way to turn volume off and still be able to play just the lights."},{"rating":"2","title":"good toy","review":"my son got this as a christmas present from is grammie and grampie. his grammie really likes to play with it too. my son loves it too. He will get it out every now and then. He will even move to the beat of the drum."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT","review":"I've purchased 6 of these so far and every child has enjoyed it. Kids love to hit things, so why not a learning drum. You can play with them and say the alphabets, numbers or just make some noise by using the drum. I love it and most importantly children love it - Thank you LeapFrog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable...but fun??","review":"I got this toy for my son when he was 9 mos...I found you had to pound it very hard to get it to do anything...he found it was best if he hit it with his binky. I found the talking to be very annoying...it would have been better with just an option for drum sounds or music. He still plays with it from time to time...but he likes the discovery ball much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"My childs favorite toy","review":"The Leapfrog drum is awesome. I bought it for my 8-month-old and she plays with it everyday when my four-year-old isn't. I love the variety from numbers to letters then music and rhythem. It is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic Children's Voices","review":"My daughter loves her learning drum. The only problem is the hypnotic children's voices that won't let her stop playing. As soon as she starts to crawl away, it says, \\"Hit the drum.\\" I do like that it goes into sleep mode so that I don't have to turn on the switch every time she's ready to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durable, but not much fun","review":"My child played with this toy very little compared to the other educational/activity type toys she has. She was bored with it very quickly. My daughter has a lot of the Leap Frog products, this one just doesn't compare to Leap Frog's other toys in the same age catagory. Keep shopping, there is something out there more fun for your little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"an okay toy","review":"I am the nursery director for my church and also a soon to be mom. I bought this toy b/c I had seen it being used by one of the children at their home. I must say that it's okay for children who like to just hit something. A lot of times, I find that the children don't hit it hard enough to make it change scenes. So, I would say that it's not very educational if they can't make it work, and it is annoying. I suggest, find something else if the child likes hitting things."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this drum!","review":"Our daughter loves to bang on items, so we bought this drum for her when whe was 7 months old. She is now 14 months old and she still loves it. This is one of only a few toys that will keep her attention for several minutes. If she walks away, the cheerful voices often recapture her attention. I also like it because it has an on/off switch and it is very portable..just throw it in the car and go. For the price, you can't beat this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holds attention for about two minutes.","review":"My son got this when he was 6 months old. After he banged on it for a few seconds, he lost interest in it. He's now 13 months old, and he'll bang on it for about a minute, but it doesn't hold his attention for much more than that.What he enjoys most is sliding the settings switch back and forth and hearing the sounds the drum makes on each setting. He reaches for all his books and most of his other toys before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasn't worth the money","review":"I thought this would be great for my son with all the banging. He played with it for about a minute and that was it. It has sat in his room in full view for about 6 months now and I don't ever remember him getting it out to play with. I donated it last week."},{"rating":"1","title":"My child is bored stiff","review":"I should have listened to the other reviewers who said that their kids became bored with this toy. I thought mine would be different since she seems really interested in the drums in her music class. Not so. This drum bores the heck out of her. At first, she hit it a few times, but the novelty wore off right away. I've had many play dates with lots of kids of different ages (my daughter is 12 months), and this toy holds no ones interest for very long. It doesn't matter if the age is 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, a year, or older. This toy is just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy is a waste of money","review":"Let me say that I brought this toy from Toy R Us and I thought this would be great for my son. I brought this when he was five months old and from day one, he was scared of this. I don't know why, but he would not touch it.Now I figured he would like it because he is older, but all he does is pick it up and throw it across the room.I played with toy and I have to say it is very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost two!!!","review":"I bought this for my son when he was turning one and he is still enjoying it almost a year later. It is one of the best toys I have ever bought. He is now almost counting with it and starting with his abc's. It is a wonderful toy and has been way worth the money paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"My ten month old daughter seems to enjoy this toy and will crawl over to it with the intention of banging on it. I suppose she loves the the fact that it responds when she gives it a good whack. I personally find it annoying. It's one of her more demanding toys. \\"Play with me!\\" it shouts. \\"HIT the drum!\\" I wish I could change the music. Actually, I wish it had a setting where it really sounded like a drum: no words, no letters, no numbers, no annoying music, just drum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for busy little hands!","review":"This is my #1 gift for all babies on my list. I even have fun playing it - they first hit it accidentally & get a reaction then the real fun begins. The letters (or number) appear with each hit & the sound isn't too loud that it scares them. I've gotten rave reviews from everyone I've given it to. They even have a Spanish version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for the parents","review":"I bought this toy for my 1-year old and she didn't like it as much as I did. She would hit a couple of times and the music would keep playing and then she became bored and left it alone. If you leave the toy idle for a few minutes, it just shuts off by itself. That was frustrating for my child and now she doesn't play with it at all.Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Banger","review":"Leapfrog never disappoints me. This drum is truly a hit with my daughter. All babies love to bang on things, so what toy better than a drum to bang on. It has different modes of play...numbers from 1-10, letters, plain old drumming and follow the beat. There is a button to change the music and volume control. The music is upbeat and not annoying at all...especially on the lower setting! It is durable and wipes down easily. Before my daughter knew to tap it she enjoyed it while I tapped. Now she's drumming away on her own. I doubt she understands the alphabet or numbers yet but I hope the constant repetition of these will help them stay in her memory. You never know what children will repeat. You can only hope it is something educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a dud","review":"this toy is really a dud. it would be fun if it worked properly, but if your child doesn't start using it w/in about 30 seconds, it switches itself off & can't be reactivated by the child by hitting the drum. this toy doesn't take into account the short attention span of children in the age range it's designed for. most toys for this age range can be reactivated any time the child starts using the toy. not this one! if mom isn't there to turn it on, my baby gets frustrated that it doesn't do anything & gives up on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Impressed...","review":"The sensor isn't really the drum top it seems, so even the slightest bump on the floor or with a foot registers a \\"tap\\" on the drum and progresses through the alphabet/numbers.By the time my one year old manages to turn it on (sideways) and than place it on the ground to start drumming, it's usually off into D, E, or F...Plus the music is constant, annoying, and detracts from the kid's ability to focus on the letters or numbers.It quickly switches from the letters/numbers to flashing lights and music if your child doesn't keep drumming - this seems like it would lower any kid's attention span.Interesting concept, poor execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little drummer boy","review":"My son got this for Christmas when he was 11 months old. He was fascinated by the lights on top and the voice that spoke when he hit it. He loved it! He is now almost 3 and we still bring this toy into the \\"rotation\\" every few weeks. He is hard on things...it has taken several hits on the hardwood floors without any problems. He also likes to beat on it with drumsticks and it has held up well. I love the volume control...a lifesaver after an afternoon of beating on a drum!The toy is still in great shape and we're about to introduce it to our 5 month old son if his brother will share! I am confident that it will hold up just as well for him. As a former teacher I place high value on educational toys. I only rated the value at 4 stars because I'm not sure my son ever learned the alphabet or numbers from playing with this. However, the combination of listening and touching together covers 2 different learning styles and reinforces language. All in all, a great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child interaction with drum","review":"We have this drum for our 7 month old. He has been playing with it for a few months now and one of the good things about it is just about anywhere you hit it- it responds (so you don't necessarily have to hit it on the top surface). My complaint with the toy is that it turns off automatically almost immediately if the child stops hitting it. It needs to stay on for like 10 minutes so when the child hits it again it will make the sounds! It doesn't give any time for hesitation (ok maybe 30 seconds...) As far as educational, it shows the numbers up to 10 and the A,B,C's in order as you hit it, of course when it turns off it goes back to the beginning so your child may never get to Z! Otherwise we have found it to be very durable and fun to bang on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"My son received this toy as a gift from a friend when he was about 5 months old. He has never been into it. There is even one at his daycare and he never plays with it there either. it is not really interactive. it never caught his attention. it is hard for 6 months old to hit the drum hard enough to make it light up or make noise. i thought maybe he would get into it when he was older, but he is 11 months now and every day he passes it by for other more interactive toys or books. very disappointing from leapfrog. i would not buy this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK!","review":"I got this for my nephew when he was about 6 months old and he only played with it for a month. It is extremely loud and gets annoying after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Toy","review":"Don't waste you money on this annoying toy with flashing lights and silly voices. You'll be much better off giving your baby a plastic bucket that he or she can put things in, put on his head, or use as a drum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be annoying","review":"This is the sort of gift that grandparents buy their grandchildren ... although I would imagine that banging on this drum would be better than banging on a glass table."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this thing!","review":"Just another useless noisy toy. It won't shut up when the child is done playing it. It annoys all others around it and plays obnoxious music. I dispise the person that gave this as a gift and can't wait to find a way to dispose of this when my son is not looking. He does like to bang on it but I'd rather give him a spoon and an upside down pot than this piece of . . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly not as much fun as I had hoped","review":"I purchased this toy for my daughter when she was 9 month. She didn't really play with it then and 3 months later, still doesn't. The drum noise is not distinct. I think I enjoyed the music option more than she did. My daughter loves music toys, just not this one. The drum needs to be hit rather hard, maybe this is better suited for a boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"great toy...if it works","review":"This is a great toy - my noise loving son has a blast with it! When you tap on the drum, it moves on to the next letter of the alphabet or number. However, after a month, our drum quit recognizing when you tap on it. It plays the background music and talks to you but that's all. It's worthless as a learning tool but my son still loves it for the music it plays. There is short warranty (I think 90 days), but I didn't realize this until 6 months later. I tried to see if I could fix it myself but that didn't work. There are many better quality toys out there - I would not recommend spending money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful educational toy for any toddler","review":"We bought this item for our daughter's first birthday because of her love of music.

Our three year old son even loves to practice his ABC's with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring to my 11mth old but 3 yr old loves it~","review":"My son recieved this toy for this past xmas. Because we have sooo many toys we waited to bring it out . This toy has been sitting w/ all the other toys in the livingroom and my son has only bothered w/ it maybe 3 times. And that is only usually when my 3 yr old daughter is playing w/ it. This toy seems like a better toy for slightly older kids who have started to learn how to count, and say their abc's. It's just not intresting to my son at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"My 18 month old daughter Veronica recieved this drum for Christmas last year (8 months old). She has always loved banging on things, but she'd rather push the button on the front than beating the drum. This is the worst present that we have ever bought her. She has played with it for a total of 10 minutes since we have had it. I think its a great idea for a toy, but it just won't keep my daughter's attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite!","review":"I bought this for my son when he was 9 months old. At 20 months old, he still is not interested in it. He likes to push the button to change the music, but the voice bothers him. He will not play with it without encouragement, and even then he only plays with it for a short while. He much prefers a plain non-talking drum with drumsticks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was so excited to get this neat-looking toy for my baby. What a disappointment. Though the concept is a good one, the Drum just does too much with too little imput. One pat from the child and it goes on and on... by the time it stops singing, he's lost interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a real small drum instead of this one...!","review":"I bought this toy for my then 11-month year old daughter based on the excellent rating from Amazon's customers. This is the right size toy drum for her, but she did not find it amusing. Instead of banging the drum, she preferred pressing the button that allows her to change the music. The music is a little bit \\"unusual\\" and the voice is so annoying. A couple of years later, this drum is still not interesting for my now 2-year old twins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Great","review":"A brought this for my daughter and she loves it. It helps her with her numbers and ABC's. The lights and sounds are great and it also has a volume control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"I bought this for my 18 month old for Christmas last year.

I think it's a great toy and made well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"16 months old, and she still likes it","review":"This one has been a big hit for our daughter. The music is good, but she loves the voices. It also applauds for her when she hits it. At first I thought twenty bucks was a lot for a drum, but now I'd happily spend it again for the hours of entertainment it's afforded her."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy, but the paint came off with little finger nails","review":"My 10-month old son loves this drum. He knows how to activate it by pushing the yellow star button and can play with it for a long time. My only concern is that when he scratches, and little ones love doing that, the paint on the surface of the drum came off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curtails free play... poor interactivity","review":"The behavior of this toy was baffling, until I sat down and played with it myself for a while. On the 'drum' settings [where you can supposedly 'free bang'], it is constantly interrupting with children's voices directing your child to mimic their brief pattern. And no matter if your child gets it correct or incorrect, it's feedback alternates between &quot;WONDERFUL!&quot; and &quot;YOU'RE GREAT!&quot; On 'music', everytime you bang on it, it plays the same notes of the same one short song.Letters and numbers are alright, but the subtlety of their readout on the drum head is surely lost on my one-year old. However she's extremely good at turning it on and off, as it's start up music is the best part as far as she's concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still love this toy","review":"I got this for my daughter when she was a year old. She is now 2 and still loves it. She repeats the alphabet as she beats the drum. It is very durable as she sometimes uses it as a stool. It is very much worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy for Babies and Parents.","review":"This is a great toy for babies and parents. I like that whenever you choose what you want whether it be the alphabet, numbers, or just the music that there is lights on the top so your child can learn to see and recognize the letters/numbers and also hear and recognize the letters/numbers. If your child hasn't hit the top of the drum in a certain amount of time the drum will shut down on its own and whenever your child is ready to play again they can press the star and the fun begins again. I find myself hitting the drum every now and then too. Great for the family and worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"still a favorite after 3 months","review":"My husband is a drummer - so, at first, he turned up his nose at this learning drum when our then 5 month old daughter received it as a gift. She had begun playing hand drums with daddy so she knew exactly what to do when the learning drum was turned on.... and did she go to town! Her favorite part is the applause she gets from anyone who's watching. It is now 3 months later and our daughter's day is not complete if she hasn't played her little drum at least once. (talk about durability - she bangs on it with her wooden blocks now and no problems) Her sense of rhythm is incredible for a baby her age, and I think the learning drum has a lot to with that. As she gets older, she will benefit from the alphabet and number counting options. I highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a 9 mos old","review":"This was the perfect gift for my friend's 9 mos old son! He is totally into banging things and discovering sounds. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies!","review":"My son is now seven months old, and he is starting to show a lot of interest in this toy. He can pat it while sitting or lying on his tummy. The drum responds to any jostling, so he doesn't have to \\"do it right\\" to make sounds. He likes the voices that encourage him to continue to play. The music is cheerful, without being obnoxious, and you can select different songs to play. Personally, I despise \\"La Cucaracha,\\" so I appreciate this feature.The only complaint I have about this toy is that it makes a lot of noise on its own. I don't know if [he] is getting a full understanding of cause and effect as a result.

The lights really get him but other than that he shows no interest.

It all really depends on your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stand this toy!","review":"My son got this toy when he was 10 months old. He loved it and started playing with it a lot, but at the same time we noticed that all of a sudden he started hitting US all the time!! The songs are absolutely annoying, and I can't imagine that he will learn the alphabet or the numbers from it, since the background noise can be incredibly distracting. This toy would be significantly improved if we could turn off the music to concentrate on the sounds of the letters and numbers. If that happened, I would be able to recommend it for older kids who already know they should not hit their parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"ditto: very annoying. Someone at leapfrog has ADD!","review":"I bought this based on the positive reviews, thinking it would be great for my daughter to learn the alphabet this way. However, although it does say \\"A, B, C...\\" as you hit it, the background music, which you cannot shut off, is so loud, you can't focus on the alphabet at all. There is just too much going on with this toy. I should have known; we bought the leapstart learning table at Christmas time and returned it for the same reason: too much going on at once. Give this one a miss. Our daughter has more fun (and more focus) banging on a cookie tin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit-n-play","review":"My 13-month old daughter loves this toy, only she plays with it in a very unconventonal way...she sits on it and bounces while it recites the ABC's or plays music.

She loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all ages","review":"This toy is fun for my babies as well as my 3 year old.

I so agree with the idea of breaking the rules (if they ever existed -- my mother, of all people actually says they didn't, and our home was a wild mix of styles and stuff). But I don't agree with creating a mess, which is what this book is. I'm as tired of the Pottery Barn look as everyone else, but that's no excuse for creating a cluttered mess of a room that is anything but stylish or harmonious or comforting to be in.

Reading reviews of this book, I see that we're playing a kind of 'emperor's new clothes game' in which few people are willing to stand up and say, 'Hello, people! This stuff is BAD.\\" It is bad, not cool and out of the box and chic and trend setting. Just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cluttered mess","review":"Just when the rest of the design world is cleaning up and ditching the clutter, this book comes along to show you how to clutter up your rooms again. What the book shows is junky and out of step with decorating today. I got this book by mistake awhile back. I hated it then and it still looks just as bad to me today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pad is Fab","review":"I enjoyed \\"Pad\\". The pictures of all these talented people's home decorating creations inspired me. The how to projects were a fun mix of bohemian, kitsch, and retro with endless possibilities. Some projects were on the easy side while others (like making and wiring your own lamp) were a bit more diffacult. Great if your looking to create, refurbish, or redecorate. Definatly worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love flea markets, foraging for cool stuff, and mixing the unexpected, so I thought I'd love this book. I don't. Mixing is one thing, but being tasteless is another. If you want to simply create a jumble of you-know-what, which is what this book shows, then you don't need this book at all. If want to be inspired to invest more taste and personality than money in your rooms and are a creative spirit, chances are you will prefer Flea Market Decorating, Flea Market Style, or American Junk. Personally, the new book, Flea Market Decorating, is my favorite -- fun, sophisticated, inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk. A mess.","review":"I agree with the point of the book, which seems to be that decorating should be fun and free and creative. But there are so many magazines and books around that do the job so much better than this one. If you want to end up with a tacky mishmash of a home, then this is the book for you. If you want the same \\"be yourself\\" message with some great ideas and solid design guidance along the way, you'd better look elsewhere. The rooms in this book look like ticky-tacky crammed stores more than homes. It would drive me crazy to spend much time in such cluttered rooms. Like many today, I am looking for peace and harmony at home versus a mess. I can't even think of anyone to give this book to, so it goes in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cluttered mess","review":"Yuk. This book is a cluttered mess. I like edgy design and doing my own thing, but what this book promotes is simply tasteless trash. It is a disservice to those readers who don't know any better. From what I could read about the author, this person operates a store of some sort, which explains the junk-store look of the featured rooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found a better book","review":"I wrote a review of this before. What PAD lacks is a grounding in good design. I found a much better book that gives the same freeing message but with more sound and sophisticated results. It's called Flea Market Decorating. The same idea of scrounging for cool stuff and using it in fresh news ways is in Flea Market Decorating. But Flea Market Decorating shows rooms you might actually want to live in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply bad design","review":"JUNK is cool. JUNKY is not. This book simply shows one junked-up place after another, missing the point that finding cool castoffs and so-called junk from the curb or flea market can produce really personal, really interesting living spaces. The places in this book disappoint because what are touted as real places to live come off as unedited junkyards, not to mention unlivable so-called \\"homes\\" created simply for effect and not for life. A stupid book on which I wasted my money. I'd give this a minus 2 if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disservice to consumers","review":"I am a designer, and what my customers need is not a book that encourages decorating anarchy. Being free from rigid rules and old-fashioned design ideas is great, but it is amazing how many times I see rooms that look like those in this book when I am called in on a job. People want help in pulling it all together,but this book simply shows how to throw it all around. It's a mess. Yuk. I can't even think of anyone to give my copy to."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the coolest design books out there!!","review":"As most of the previous reviewers have already said, this is a way cool book.

I ran across it in a shop that sold some retro items, but the price was a bit high. When I found it here, I snagged it quick. If your \\"pad\\" has a retro motif, this guide may help some. However, it's mostly just on recovery of junk. I found really no use for any of this, whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee-table Book","review":"I bought this book to come up with some unique deco ideas but came up flat.

The newly recorded and unrelased tracks has the same poor mix as on 'Negatron' and 'Phobos'. The live recordings on this album are terrible. I did not like the way Eric Forrest sings on the songs that Snake sang on the older Voivod albums. This album is also not a very good effort for Piggy and Away. True Voivodians would be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heed the Reviews for this Fidelio.","review":"And I mean the positive reviews. Maybe there are also negative comments about this Fidelio, but I didn't check that out. First of all, I'm not yet into opera, but I'm a fervent collector of Beethoven and his Fidelio was missing in my collection.I can clearly see what all the hype is about, as the singing here is divine, among other things. Also, I consider Klemperer to be a very fine conductor (and I can't shake off the feeling that he is often underrated; why that would be I don't know).And what a cast! Christa Ludwig to name but one. Superb.Well, I just add my recommendation on Amazon and it's up to you to decide whether or not to purchase this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FIDELIO","review":"If you like Fidelio - buy this. If you only want one Fidelio opera - then buy this. And if you love Fidelio already then I guess you will already have it. Some recordings have a few good \\"versions\\" which make it hard to choose the \\"best\\" version. Fidelio has a few good versions too. But it is unique in that this Klemperer is widely acknowledged as the version to get. It has remained at the top of the recommended list of Fidelio since it was released. It is \\"desert island\\" quality. Don't miss it at this incredible mid-price."},{"rating":"2","title":"VICKERS IS A WONDERFUL FIDELIO","review":"I LOVE THIS RECORDING OF FIDELIO - BUT THEN I AM A BIG BIG FAN OF JON VICKERS.

I'm 40 + and pretty much straight up and down -- not much curve, which is why I have to wear jr's jeans. I wear 7L, which only comes in a couple of styles. I really wish the the jean companies would make a few in solid colors instead of everything with the \\"worn\\" look, or make more in my size.I knew these jeans would be a little higher in the waist than the 524's and that was OK, but I still expected the same fit in the rear... wrong. I don't have a \\"granny-butt\\" yet, but I don't have the \\"boom-boom\\" either. If I had a little more filler they probably would have worked, but since I didn't, back they went.

I have worn this style for years. I know what size I wear, how they are supposed to fit, and which washes I prefer.What I received was much too small, had an entirely different cut, and was not the wash I chose. The \\"boot cut\\" was almost a bell bottom, flaring much more than the product pictures indicate. The Blue Rider pictured is an even medium blue. What I received was dark and heavily whiskered from crotch to hip which looks absolutely nothing like the pictures, which I studied before choosing. The pocket detailing and seams appear as a dirty yellow against that rough textured deep blue, which is not attractive at all.I will be returning these and will not buy again. The free return this is eligible for? It has a cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to good ole dark blue non faded denim?","review":"Color depicted as Blue Rider as a nice consistent dark blue denim.

These are the old deep pocket kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great jeans!","review":"The \\"valley blues\\" denim color is a slightly lighter weight denim than the \\"railer\\" color. The lighter weight fabric makes them more comfortable but they will probably wear out faster.

The fit is so close to perfect, but with the typical Levi's issue of not being designed for women that have any kind of shape at all. These fit great except for the waistband which seems to be made for women whose waists are the same size as their hips. If you're the sort that doesn't think jeans should be worn around your ankles, a belt is a must; and with the 'stretch up a size every ten minutes' tradition of Levi's, expect to tighten the belt a few times if you don't want your seat to sag like a full diaper by the end of the day.The \\"Superlow\\" isn't nearly as low as in previous years and the \\"Skinny\\" really only applies to the thigh area.All in all, I do love these 518s. They feel good and they look good (as long as you like belts)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pictures Are A Bit Misleading","review":"I have a pair of older Juniors Levis 518 Bootcut that I love but can't find anymore cause they've started making everything in stretch denim. So when I saw these on Amazon, I thought I'd order a pair. The new ones look different and the pictures featured are of the older pairs.

Note the small lettering - and friends. What this means is that most of these songs were not recorded by Barbara. Even if one or two did feature her voice, they were very early recordings and do not even sound like her earliest recognized recordings - those she did for Columbia.I love Barbara's music - she is one of my all-time favorites - but you won't find any of Barbara's music here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy! Not Barbara!","review":"Some say they think Barbara is on this , I say she is not. I consider my self a fan and know most everything she has ever recorded, these have never been by Barbara. Bootleg, they have released this many times under different covers. I have it on tape from 1985."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, but not his best","review":"In general this album is similar to Tyrannosaurus's debut (my people were fair...) but in my opinion it lacks the freshness of the former. \\"Deboraarobed\\" is simply their debora plays backward, and some fillers (e.g. friends)make this record a sub to its debut. Anyway, it's still full with mystic(if meaningless) lyrics, catchy melodies, brillant drumming, etc. Good track like \\"stacey grove\\" also save it from a forgettable work. Enjoy it if you like 60's psychedelic folk. Not bad, but comparatively weak among Tyrannosaurus Rex's albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for dandruff!","review":"My boyfriend has dandruff and has been using head & shoulders for years.

Granted, all that can't stop Nights In White Satin from being an incredibly powerful, lovely piece (other than the crappy stoner poem at the end). But even then, it doesn't strike me like the work of Yes (specifically Close to the Edge and Starship Trooper).

This album follows the course of a day starting with morning into night but sounding like a lifetime. Some could say this is more about the stages in our life than a day.

The poetry and the use of the orchestra by a rock band was considered pretentious in its time but there is no denying the fine songs (Tuesday Afternoon, Nights In White Satin, Evening Time To Get Away, Another Morning) which would have succeeded by themselves. After this, the Moody Blues tended to rely on gimmicks rather than the songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-Time Album","review":"This album is amazing. I was barely out of infancy when my mother bought this album-- she played it every day for awhile in '67 or '68. So it became imprinted. (And how glad am I that that was the kind of music to be imprinted with, back then). The first side is pleasant and creative, but the second side is a KILLER. I mean, any album side with bookends like \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and \\"Nights in White Satin\\" is bound to succeed (forgive the pun, double metaphor, or whatever!). But the in-between songs are wonderful, too-- \\"Evening Time to Get Away,\\" in particular, sounds deliciously haunting. And the songs segue into each other beautifully, like the classical movement it seeks to incorporate into a rock sensibility.

Good songs with ponderous words mix with long, lightweight orchestral interludes and awful poems. And yet, the whole thing is charming. It's easy enough to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of A Kind","review":"For some reason, The Moody Blues don't have the place in history they deserve. This is a landmark album, with the band recording with a full orchestra. That may sound common place now, but almost 40 years ago it was unheard of. The song lengths were highly unusual for the time period as well.Every song is great. What was side two when it was on vinyl is classic. Still waiting for the definitive CD on this one, because the CD's I've heard are very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tracks from Master are Missing!","review":"I couldn't believe my ears. The harmony on the last part of \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" is missing! Whoever remastered this from the original tapes FORGOT to mix in all the tracks and it sounds hollow. How incredibly annoying. The only way you're going to hear the real music is to turn on your record player and play the old vinyl. Maybe the SACD CD was remastered correctly, but the AAD CD was NOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album never gets old","review":"if you are looking for an essential album by the moody blues or a album that might get you into these guys, here it is. i can literally put this cd on repeat and listen to it all day. this album is a masterpiece and it has most definatly stood the test of time. get this cd now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden voyage","review":"An album of pop songs interspersed with orchestral segues is a dangerous idea that probably shouldn't be tried again, but the Moody Blues pulled it off fairly well. The first third of the album, where the orchestra is prominent, is tiresome, but once the suite of songs kicks into high gear with \\"Peak Hour\\" and \`Tuesday Afternoon\\", you are in the spell of one of the great and most unique bands of all time in a maiden voyage of uncommon beauty. An overlooked gem is \\"Twilight Time\\", one of Ray Thomas' best songs ever, a rocker pulsed by a hammering piano bass line, Justin Hayward's evocative backing vocal, and colorful imagery that really works. Unfortunately you can't sample this song here since it is coupled on the same track as the much less interesting \\"Sunset\\". \\"Nights in White Satin\\" is overplayed, and the Moodies' reputation is excessively connected to this song, so it is easy to forget that it once sounded fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic recording","review":"Never mind these reviewers who think they are experts on the career histories of all these bands.They dont know didley.Just buy the CD and enjoy!

Dissapointing.","review":"If you loved the original Gumby then don't buy this item. It will only break your heart. None of the original voices, music, or sound effects are used in this DVD. All the sound is re-recorded and has none of the charisma or excitement as the original sound I loved as a kid. I can still hear the original funky sound effects in my head, and when I heard the sound on this DVD, I was shocked and dissapointed that I had wasted my money. As far as I know, all the episodes are here and in good quality, however without the original sound it is not the Gumby I saw as a kid. DON'T BUY THIS ITEM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boomers beware ! Re-recorded audio track !","review":"These are the first Gumby shorts from about 1956/57, with all their weird surrealism and goofiness. Unfortunately (and it's a BIG unfortune), the collection here has the awful re-recorded soundtracks from the early 1990s TV reissue, with uniform voice \\"talent\\", brand new intros (no classic theme), and new, more \\"modern\\" music score.This is a fine introduction for the littlest kids, but grown up fans with grind their teeth to powder! Here's hoping Rhino re-issues this with corrections: WE WANT THE ORIGINAL 1950s SOUNDTRACKS (at least on a 2nd audio track)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible soundtrack remake","review":"It's ok... but the synthesizer track is a disgrace to Gumby fans. I don't understand why Rhino couldn't have used the original. It's very disappointing. THE ORIGINAL IS ALWAYS THE BEST. I would discourage Gumby fans from buying this release and to hunt down the older copies from Family Home Entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundtrack is NOT Original","review":"Unfortunately, cheap-sounding synthesizer music has replaced the original Gumby music. New voices and different sound effects also detract heavily from the audio experience. A new bright-red and oily-looking Pokey announces each new episode instead of the original \\"A Gumby Adventure\\" intro, which was also removed. This DVD is specifically \\"Not Recommended\\" until Rhino releases the original, complete version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hog Wash","review":"The picture quality is fine. These are 40 year old analog recordings how perfect do you expect them to be. They music is great. Funky and retro.

A MUST HAVE ITEM IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING WLS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mozart knew best","review":"Apparently, Klemperer thought he knew better than Mozart what should be included in this opera, as well as the correct pacing, irrespective of what the score might indicate. It's really tough to make Mozart boring, but this performance comes close. It drags when it should sparkle, and distorts when it should clarify. Example: it's hard for the Queen to sound angry when she practically has to gasp for breath due to the slow pacing. Others in the cast range from good to just OK, but the conductor (and lack of dialogue) really put this recording out of the running."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a sample.","review":"If you want a sample of BT than this is a kewl cd.

Her legs were almost touching the floor (this was on the horse). It has really nice outfit. It is very realistic.If you were to buy this doll to ride your Breyer horses then you may not want it. If you want a doll rider to fit the Breyer horses then the 6' Ashley doll rider would be good. If you are just collecting the Breyer riders and not the horses then it would be okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not here to disappoint you","review":"If electronic music and vocals were married in the 90s, this is now their exotic honeymoon.This album was by far the album I spun most in 2003. I got it in spring upon its release, and its now December, and I'm not close to tiring of it.Luomo's first album Vocalcity, was more mysterious, and used vocals as a predominant element- yet as a tool. The Present Lover, however, has vocals front and center, and every track is a \\"song\\" unlike Vocalcity (excluding Tessio). The lyrics are insane, the voices and electronic music are shimmering. No lie. This is it.

The stand is just that.. a stand.the tv just sits on it and can fall off with the slightest touch. Reception is ok at best and if you use a headset you only get mono.

I was actually looking a larger ones but my husband got me the Casio EV-4500 for Christmas last year. The pros and cons are both the same: it is small. Nice and small so it does not take up much counter space but too small for watching, say football games. But, for general weeknight news watching, it is fine.Two notes: it did not come with a power cord and I used rechargable batteries for several months but it got very tiring to replace the batteries every 2-3 days. So, I recommend you buy the optional wall plug, which I now have too.Also, the set did have to be returned for repair (the screen died) but they sent me a new one rather quickly. No problems so far with this one (knock wood)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 cents worth","review":"I bought this TV as a replacement for my 1990's style Sony Watchman, which was a black and white model. After 12+ years, it finally pooped out.The Casio is an OK substitute. Picture quality is better on some stations that others, but I guess that is to be expected on a small TV. At least, it is color.My biggest complaint, and it's something that drives me nuts, is that it does not stay on the same channel when you turn it off. This means, that each time you turn the darn thing on, you must reset it to your favorite channel. I didn't think that this would be bothersome, but it is.The other issue is that it does not come with the wall adapter cord. The batteries only last about 2 hours, well maybe 3, but the last hour you only get the sound. So the adapter is a must. The adapter is a huge box thing, so you cannot use the outlet for anything else, while the TV is plugged in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Opera Appearance by a Young Anna Moffo","review":"Here is an opera by Respighi, generally unknown by Americans, in a live performance with Anna Moffo in a supporting role. The recording (which has excellent sound) was made in the late 50s while she was studying in Italy on a Fullbright. Her character only appears in Act I, but her singing is superb and her acting is impressive.

I learned a lot from it and would happily read it again several more times. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with this purchase!","review":"I bought this for my five year old daughter who will be entering kindergarten in a few months. She had a sudden interest in math, so I went to the store hoping to find something to encourage her. Needless to say, I came home with this toy and was quite happy to see how many functions it provides. She can count using the sliding beads along the top, addition & subtraction problems are displayed on the electronic face and read aloud, and it also provides her an erasable area to practice writing the numbers. It keeps her busy and happy while reinforcing her newly acquired math skills. I would not hesitate to recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"durability an issue on this one","review":"Even though I bought this toy ~ 2 yrs back, it was barely used until about 6 months ago, when my younger child discovered it. It's been treated really gently-- he's not a \\"chuck it\\" type-- but all of a sudden the 2nd row buttons began to call out the 3rd row numbers. It's not a battery issue. SO I contacted Leap Frog, because these things aren't exactly cheap, and asked if it was fixable. That was 3 weeks ago, so I can safely say their 48 hr turnaround time is a bunch of bull. I also had one of the First leap Pad units for my first child, and I was never impressed with the performance of that, either. So it might be just mediocre engineering in general with them, which is just unacceptable given the prices they charge. SO I guess unless I want my son to believe that 9 and 14 are the same number, I gotta chuck the math desk and go buy some flash cards! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're gonna buy ONE of their live CDs...","review":"This disc is more rich and varied than BIG HEART and has no weak cuts on it, unlike the OTHER Berlin live disc, which wastes a ton of time on a total throwaway, \\"Mr. Stinky's Blues.\\" But be warned -- as I say in my review of the other Berlin disc -- the colors and numbers of these discs change occasionally. Sometimes 2 is 1, 1 is 2, and either can appear in red or black. I dunno why. Anyhow, this is live stuff from the period between VOICE OF CHUNK and QUEEN OF ALL EARS. \\"Tibet\\" is actually a VOICE OF CHUNK number under a different name, but I forget which. \\"A Paper Bag and the Sun,\\" maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"the title is apt","review":"this book was boring. it read like a reality show, lots of irrelavant detail instead of meaningful development. characters were not engaging and their motivations unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD of The Nutcracker Ballet by Tchaikovsky","review":"If you love ballet, you will love the Nutcracker Ballet as performed by San Francisco Ballet.

It is certainly a holiday favorite, but can be enjoyed any time of the year because it is so delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Watch and Enjoyable","review":"This version of The Nutcracker is very enjoyable. No performance is perfect. However, this version shouldn't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Nutcracker","review":"This new SF Ballet production of the Tchaikovsky warhorse is a real treat for dance fans and novices alike. The physical mounting's sumptuous, witty, and the San Francisco references seem playful, not forced. There are moments of such stunning beauty in this performance, the music, design, dance and storytelling combine to transport the viewer instantly to a happy, marvelling state of childhood. Would serve as an ideal introduction to the NUTCRACKER for young viewers, and there's plenty for their parents to enjoy, too. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Frankly speaking, this DVD is a disaster. Sorry to say, but film director Matthew Diamond and his cameramen explicitly ruin the show.You can see the whole stage for only a few seconds in every scene. You see the whole stage, and say \\"wow, what a wonderful decoration, oops..\\", then the camera zooms in, you see the smiling faces of dancers. Not their feet, not their body, but their faces. I can say that, Chinese snow queen is a beautiful woman, but I could not appreciate her dance. I'm not exaggerating, camera does not stand still more than 3 seconds. When 3 seconds pass, camera moves, or zooms in, after an additional 2 seconds, then another camera is in action. What a technology!?I saw many choreograhies of Nutcracker, I think this was a very good one, good dancers, good orchestra, but extremely disappointing film. Not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fine performance, but not inspiring.","review":"It's a fine performance, while I enjoyed some of the scenes, the Christmas tree is in good size and nicely decorated, and the changing of the size of toys & boxes to make Clara appear smaller is quite dramatic, the Arabian dancer is pretty good, and the Russians way of popping out of the Easter eggs is fun to watch.However I felt a let down in some area:There is no chorus in waltz of the flowers, too sad. The beautiful chorus is one of my favorite in that scene.The main characters seem to more focus on technical excellence, while less on emotion.The final Pas de deux isn't that exciting, Elizabeth Powell's dance is fine but not exceptional.Overall it's not as good as the Bolshoi version (danced by amazing Nina Kaptsova and Artem Ovcharenko), the set, dance and orchestra are close to perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hijacked ballet vis a vis radical science","review":"This is not a ballet.

And Kim's dilemma--even though I haven't been through what she is going through, the story is so vivid and so moving, I feel that I have lived through it myself.

I've never tired of listening to it.It being well over 30 years since I first heard this album (on a cassette boom box in military barracks), I realize now more than then that the title was chosen with utmost care.

It's 100 percent quality rock-n-soul! This album has such POWER and ELEGANCE. It's SO ALIVE with roiling jazz rhythms, pan-the-piper flute lines, awesome guitar work, elegant vocals, electronic alchemy and bombastic bass, percussion and poetry that only the mundane is sacrificed in the perfect quest for soul artifaction! TOCCC is an ongoing artifact of soul and music metamorphosizing from the inside to the outside - and 'Beyond' - which, incidentally is an episodic, space odyssey-type electronic instrumental that, had it been played in the Star Wars bar-room scene, would have created a positively different universe!

My fave tracks here are: Eyes Of A Child I & II, Floating, Gipsy, Eternity Road, Sun Still Shining and mainly, Candle Of Life. After listening to this album, and with 4 great conceptual albums, I became totally connected to their music and they have become my fave classic rock band. Thanks guys for giving us too much joy through your music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy","review":"My boys (8 and 6) love this toy. They have a blast setting it up near me and dad and running away. Lots of fun.

They fly pretty far and can get lost easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"wild planet toys","review":"This toy was advertised as having foam/or soft balls.

This Maxpedition CACOON POUCH is perfect for that. It is small and holds everything you will need. I use the military take apart rod and include a nylon brush, patches, oil and brush and it all fits with room to spare. I like it so well I just ordered another two, for my sons. It attaches to tacticle straps on rifle or shotgun cases or in or on your range bag. This could also be used for First Aid bag or anything else, without taking up much room. Great price on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical pencil case!","review":"I bought two of these for carrying small assorted items (EDC stuff). I found that you can fit 50 feet of paracord along with pens, a sharpie, small folding knife, basic first aid stuff, and a small flashlight into them without having to really work on the zipper to close the thing. Nice little packs. They are also big enough to hold a smaller MP3 player with all of its charging cords, headphones, USB cable, and such.. Lot's of uses for this pouch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utensil holder","review":"I have the Alpha light utensil set and this is the perfect holder for them.

One has to look at the small print to see that the recordings are not the originals. However, these re-recordings aren't even worthy of a listen because of the God awful production value. The recording of HELLO WALLS is live, recorded it appears at one of those supper clubs or maybe in a studio with a hand full of people. Upon first hearing, i thought it was recorded off AM radio, since there is static over the recording!! The sound is muddy, amateurish, and the reason i'm so upset is because the company that put this CD out took advantage of the lack of Faron Young music on the market and released this...you are better off to buy his box set that's sold here on Amazon that chronicles his Capitol years. Also, the Millennium Collection series is another CD to grab. This CD, plus THE ESSENTIAL FARON YOUNG 2-CD set which sports a younger picture of Faron but contains nearly the same bad produced re-recordings, are a disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are amazing.","review":"I purchased thise album for my mother in law.

However, although dieting has been well-established as a problem, especially for women - this book offers no new insight or guidance for those seeking relief from obsession with eating, starving, or overeating. There are platitudes about \\"enjoying the moment\\", but the author never addresses core issues in anything other than a superficial manner, and it seems criminal that with the VAST majority of case histories being those of women, that feminist thought is never touched upon. This is the worst-type of self-help book - full of ephemeral platitudes and vague \\"assurances\\" (and a PhD credential!) to encourage the reader to trust the author - but nothing solid to build on.

He probably can build, and has knowledge, but his estimates on cost are really a joke based on my experience. I know many contractors and I've had many bids over the last several years on two homes.

It seems that majority of the time the good out weighed the bad but in this case they were wrong. It started out really slow and I just knew that the scenes would get more intense and more horrific. Out of 30 scenes only 5, at the most, were even worth watching. There were more car crashes in the scenes, involving people that actually took the risk, than anything. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone nor will I be purchasing anymore Banned from Television DVDs. Please don't waste your money on this garbage.

Such classic footage as the guy jumping from the burning building, the sniper defacing the guy holding the woman hostage, and the skier plummenting down the mountain were just ill. This one had a lot of drama as well. Scenes were constructed not just to show hideous accidents but unfolded in a way that made each scene suspenseful. Watching the scenes unfold, not knowing what was going to happen and then seeing it happen, was unfortunately, VERY entertaining. For all those who say watching this is sick, I say I wouldn't put myself in these predicaments for the most part so it doesn't bother me to watch.

This version is even more fun! With its lively tunes and bedtime songs, Baby Tad is perfect for car or crib. He's soft and cuddly too.Each time you press the Bedtime song hand, it sets Tad to play for one minute (5 presses, 5 minutes) so it's a nice toy for baby to fall asleep to with it's soothing music and soft lights.I would highly recommend this toy. Baby Tad will become your child's friend for many years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Grandparents!","review":"I purchased this to have at my house for my grandchildren. My 7 month old grandson loves this toy. He is not a \\"sleeper\\" and often wakes up during the night. Whenever I play the \\"nighttime\\" selections (usually all 6 minutes!), he falls back to sleep.

She is know 16 1/2 months old and goes to sleep with Baby Tad every night. She calls him by name and loves to go \\"night-night\\" to Tad's muscial countdown. Plus, the added bonus is, she entertains herself for over 30 minutes every morning playing with him, so I get more rest. I would definately recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best!!!","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was two. Beleive it or not I got if for $40 at ----RUS...can't hardly believe the price now **Ridiculous**Anyway,I can honestly say she had this in bed with her every night for probably 7 years. She loved the lullabies and when she finally learned how to turn them on she would keep replaying them till she fell asleep. She's 9 now and to this day she still has it and uses it every now and then and it still works great. Great investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love Baby Tad!!!!","review":"This was one of my baby's first gifts, and he just loves it! He is only 5 months old, but enjoys his Baby Tad already.

I also like that the nightime button(on his hand) let you choose how many minutes for \\"night-night\\", before music cuts off - it goes from one to six.This is a great toy, a must have - and I am sure our baby will enjoy it for quite a while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Tad","review":"I gave my granddaughter this toy on her first birthday, hoping it was not too young for her Every time I have seen her, she has been playing with it.

We exchanged it for something much cooler!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great buy","review":"My main problem with Tad is that he has no on/off switch. So when you are cleaning up all your baby's toys (usually at nap time) he starts singing when you touch him. Plus, he does not sing for a long time. He plays short little songs then stops and you have to press another shape for another song or he turns himself off. I am going to give mine away because he is just taking up room in the toy chest. My daughter never has played with him, she is 12 months now but got him when she was 8 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy.......but kind of big for little hands","review":"I ordered this online and I was surprised by how big it was when I received it. I thought it would be small enough for my son to snuggle with it. I guess he'll grow into it. It is a fun toy and I like the sweet little voice it has. Also the daytime and nighttime mode are great!! During the daytime mode any of the buttons can be pushed, but during the nighttime mode the buttons are disabled. I use it in conjunction with my son's crib aquarium and he really likes it for bedtime. Tad sings songs, teaches shapes and colors. He really is a fun little toy. I also like that it has a low and high volume on the battery pack in Tad's back. It is nice to be able to adjust the volume. Great toy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to push buttons, turns off quickly","review":"My 10-month old daughter always smiles when I bring out Baby Tad, but in my opinion the toy is not very well designed for babies. The buttons, embedded in fabric, are really hard for her to push. After a few seconds of not having any buttons pushed, Baby Tad turns off automatically, bringing a quick end to playtime unless I'm sitting there with her pushing the buttons. Could have been a great toy, but I think they missed the boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Tad keeps giving even at 16 months","review":"Our son is now 16 months old and Baby Tad is one of the few toys that he's enjoyed playing with the whole time from 6 months old on.

At night, we use Baby Tad's night night mode to relax our little guy in prep for bedy bye. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"We used baby tad when my daughter was two months old helping to get her to sleep. She loved to listen to the music and she the lights. We still will occassionally use it for sleep but now se also sing songs with her.

When our son was an infant, we put it in the crib with the nighttime music, and now that he is older, he likes to dance to the daytime.

The nighttime button lasted about 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Tad a \\"lovable teacher\\"","review":"My daughter received this gift for X-Mas when she was 3 mo. old. At first, I put it in the pack and play with her when she was playing in there. I would set the music mode and let it play for her (it plays lullabyes up to 8 min). Then as she started to sit up on her own we played with it together, pushing the shapes and listening to the songs that Tad sings. At about 10 months, I noticed her purposefully pushing the buttons that were lit up. So after about two months of watching her do this I thought it can't be a coincidence so I asked her to point out the individual shapes and she was able to do it. I never once taught her shapes and here she had learned it from Baby Tad! Now she is 2 and she doesn't play with it that often anymore. However, I keep it in the car and it amuses her."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I would have to say it is a good toy for little ones to play with its safe and not really annoying cause it turns itself off and is a pleasant and unannoying toy. the bad is that anything turns it on and the buttons are hard to push but other than those it is a very good toy my son seems to like it he smiles and I sing along to the songs its got 6 diffrent songs and another good thing is the classical music it plays six diffrent songs also and if you keep pushing the nightime hand it will go for 6minutes continuously whish helps put my son to sleep. I would recomend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Used Tad!!","review":"We got my son Baby Tad when he was 6 m.o. (he's now 4) he LOVED it! Tad went everywhere with us! We all really liked the Night time songs but wished they lasted a little longer. He is really soft but if he is to be a crib toy, move him away from the baby at night or you might be woken up to the sounds of Tad as he gets kicked or slept on. We always put him to the foot of the crib that way he would be there to entertain our son in the morning for awhile. We got our daughter a Lily like this but she didn't care for it too much, she liked Tad better but not as much as our son. That was the old Lily btw, not the one that is out now. Overall, I recommend Baby Tad, he was a great toy in our house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasted 4 years","review":"I just wanted to say that my daughter received this as a baby and now she is almost 5 years old and has fallen to sleep listening to the lullabies all these years! Unfortunately, the lullaby hand has been worn out now and just broke last night! She can't go without her Tad so now I am off to buy another Tad. I bought a CD player, but she just wants her Tad! The best features is that it shuts off after the lullabies play. This is highly recommended for bed time. She hasn't really played with the other features so I can't comment on those, except the kiss on the cheek."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's best friend","review":"We love Baby Tad! We gave it to our daughter for her first christmas at 5 months old, and it's been a big hit. When she was cranky or fussy, we put her in her swing with Tad on the lullaby setting and she calmed right down (and usually fell asleep). She now, at 16 months, sleeps with Tad in her crib. She can turn him on/off so if she wakes in the night, she can soothe herself. She also loves playing the musical games during the day, and it keeps her occupied in the morning so we can catch an extra 15 mins to 1/2 hour of sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"baby tad very annoying","review":"I found this toy, like many electronic toys, to be grating and incredibly annoying.

However, after the 1st 5 minutes of playing with it, my daughter quickly lost interest. It actually held my 2-year-old's attention longer, since she can recognize shapes and colors, and has the strength to press down on the flashing buttons on Tad's chest.I was disappointed with this toy for my infant. She doesn't need it to go to sleep (she already established her own sleeping patterns before she got this toy), so besides the flashing lights, this toy doesn't hold much interest for my baby.Ironically, my 10-month-old loves the Phonics Radio by Leapfrog. The buttons on this toy are easier to push for her, and the music is more fun too."},{"rating":"2","title":"All 3 of my boys love this toy","review":"We recieved this as a gift for our 3 week old son, but our 3 year old loves to play with it too!! Our 6 year old enjoys making the lights flash for the new baby. We have been through lots of infant toys and music boxes in the last 6 years, but this one seems to have more staying power for keeping the child interested. My three year old uses it to match shapes and colors, while my 3 week old enjoys the flashing lights and calming music. I love the 6 minute timer, less trips into baby's room at nap time!!

They looked cute facing each other in pictures. Then, Baby Tad was unfortunately possessed. He would not shut off and one night woke us up singing and blinking up a storm. I was not going to the basement at 2 am to grab a screwdriver and remove the batteries so he went into a drawer and kept singing through the night until his batteries expired. New batteries didn't help and thus was the end of Baby Tad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great nightime toy","review":"Both of my kids loved being able to operate the lights and sounds when they were playing quietly in their beds.

I was so frustrated I threw that one away too.He received another one for his 2nd birthday and is enjoying Baby tad again- I just hope he lasts a couple of years!I do still recommend it to other moms even after going through so many- it's that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love Baby Tad","review":"Baby Tad was a gift from my mother to my daughter. My daughter loves playing with Baby Tad. She loves the songs he plays and she is starting to grasp the concept of pushing the lit up button on Baby Tad's bib for him to say \\"YEA!!!!\\" and starting singing a song. I've also noticed that she claps her hands to the song \\"If Your Happy And You Know It\\". The best feature I've found to this toy is you can set it for \\"Nite-Nite\\" Mode. You press Tad's Foot up to five times and he will say 5 minutes till night night and for five minutes or however many minutes you set (up to five) he will play soft music and his bib lights up . This is great when we travel because the bib provides the night light (up to 5 minutes) and the lullabyes, no need to pack a CD player or music box for my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite toy","review":"My daughter received this toy as a gift when she was 9 months old. She is 18 months old now and still loves it. The lullabies are a must for her bedtime routine. I also like it because it's portable and she can still have the lullabies when we're traveling. You can also set the volume to high or low. You have to look near the battery compartment to find it. We have had a problem with some of the buttons wearing out though. The lullaby one in particular. But we got a replacement with no hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Tad is obnoxious","review":"My 6-month-old son's grandparents gave him this for christmas and he stared at it until someone pushed the buttons for him - which are pretty hard to push because the plush toy gives, so you have to keep pushing which is hard for a very young child to do - and then when he heard the voice he looked startled, then made a yuck face and moved on to the next toy. After a few attempts to interest him in Baby Tad, for his grandparent's sake, we tossed Baby Tad in the give-away box. Frankly, if he had taken an interest in it, Baby Tad probably would have ended up in the give-away box anyways because the voice is so over the top that I couldnt stand listening to it. It isnt really a little kids' voice and it isnt really an adult voice talking baby talk. I think it was closest to an adolescent cheerleader on helium. Whatever it sounded like, it was so obnoxious that even my baby boy didnt like it. There are better toys for learning about shapes and hearing songs to go to sleep with."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"On a recent visit, I brought this toy to my fourteen month old granddaughter. She was a good age for it and was able to push the buttons. However, so many songs are introduced by annoying \\" I'm Baby Tad\\" messages. Even the nice nightime song had a Baby Tad countdown. She by far prefers other musical toys that play melodies for longer times and without the spoken voice. I'll be more carefull ordering toys by mail in the future as what looked rather cute in a small picture seemed almost grotesque full size."},{"rating":"2","title":"babys favorites","review":"this is the only way my child will go to sleep in her crib. every night from 2 months old to now 14 months old, i turn the night time music on for 6 minutes and she goes fast to sleep. batteries last a while, and youll know when they need changing, and so will baby. she loves pushing his buttons. would recommend to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Tad is Great","review":"I love Baby Tad.

I can't wait to buy more as he grows.Awsome JobMrs. Martin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Baby Tad","review":"My son is 6 months old and is loving his new baby Tad. We take it everywhere with us. It sooths him during a car ride and he is completly in awe at the bright colors that light up on the bib of Tad. We since have brought this to other friends homes with young children up to 18 months and it is an imediate attention getter from the children. We love this Toy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use!","review":"The buttons on baby tad's chest are hard to press, his morning button (on the left palm) already broke (has a short in it already after 1 - yes 1 day of playing), it only plays up to 6 minutes of nite nite songs (ever tried getting your baby to sleep in 6 minutes?), you have to keep pressing buttons to keep it from say \\"bye bye\\" and turning off. She liked it for about 10 minutes. It's not a very good buy. I love leapfrog products but this one failed consumers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but annoying.","review":"I like that it teaches colors and shapes, but there is no volume dial. I feel that it is way too loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!!","review":"This is another great product from Leap Frog. My 7 month old son loves this toy. Since he loves to push buttons, he can easily make the toy interact with him and play music. The music is pleasing and the volume can be adjusted, so it won't drive you crazy like many toys do."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES his baby tad","review":"My son received Baby Tad for a present for his first Christmas. He was six months old...he is now almost 3 1/2 years old...and just LOVES his Baby Tad. He especially likes the 6 minutes of lullabys when it is time to go to sleep. We have also found that when our son wakes up in the middle of the night, he often sets it himself in order to fall back asleep with out getting out of bed. Baby tad also travels with us...it has been out of the country and will be going to Hawaii for the second time this December! It helps our son to feel right at home!Also, I would like to note that at one time Baby Tad just stopped working...after about a year of use. I called the company to ask if there was any way to repair it, they had me ship it to them and they sent me a brand new one at NO CHARGE!!This is our favorite gift to give new parents!!Hope that your child enjoys it as much as ours is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That Horrible Frog","review":"Our nanny calles this toy, ''That Horrible Frog,'' and I couldn't agree more. The music quality is lousy -- how any child would be soothed by the \`\`nighttime'' music is a mystery to me. It jars my nerves every time I hear it. I think all the LeapFrog products have too a high a ratio of noise to fun. My son prefers his noise-less stuffed frog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is not the best of the Leap Frog brand. This toy is just ok. Nothing exciting - I have two boys, each barely looked at this frog twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!!","review":"We absolutely love this toy!! My daughter has had Baby Tad since she was 5 months old, and it never fails to keep her entertained. She loves to listen to the music and watch the lights. I have even used the 6 minutes of lullabys when we went on vacation and did not have a musical mobile on her crib.I have also given Baby Tad recently to a friend as a gift for her newborn.....Her two-year-old liked it so much that they are letting him 'borrow' it from his baby brother until he is old enough to play too!!I would highly recommend this toy to anyone who is looking for a great value in a toy that will entertain for years!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly delightful toy for babies and young toddlers!","review":"Every baby I know that has this toy or has had the chance to play with one has absolutely loved Baby Tad. You simply cannot go wrong with getting this for your child or giving Baby Tad as a gift! It is soft and cuddly, plays sweet little nursery songs, plays interactive kissing games-says \\"I love you!\\", and eventually can be used as a teaching tool to teach colors and shapes, and following directions-\\"press the purple triangle\\"... You will find, unless you already have, that Leap Frog makes amazing (teaching) toys and products for youngsters. This may be your first Leap Frog purchase, but it will certainly not be your last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Toy","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old, but she was too little to activate it. At 18 months, she still had no interest in it. She loves music, but this never caught her attention. I finally got rid of it recently since we don't have room for toys that she doesn't play with. I highly recommend Leapfrog's Dreamscape crib soother instead. I could activate when she was small and now she does it herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cuddly","review":"Baby Tad was one of the first stuffed toys my son received. I would keep it in his crib with him. The night-time sleep music was the only way he would fall asleep at night. The songs are much more soothing than a standard mobile and lasts longer. I could set how long I wanted it to play (up to five minutes) which was great so I wouldnt have to worry about going back in and turning it off without waking my son. Or worse, forgetting that it's on and having to change the batteries every morning.When he got a little bigger, he loved pushing the buttons and singing along with the songs. After about seven months, the batteries finally started to give out. Pretty good life span! Unfortunately, it made Baby Tad sound like he was very sick and it scared my son. I had to hide the toy until I was able to get some new batteries.Overall, this is a wonderful toy for a baby. It can even last into the toddler years by teaching colors and shapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have other toys that sing or talk this isn't worth it","review":"No great shakes on this one. I agree with others that it's a bit loud. My little one isn't terribly interested. If you have other toys that sing or talk this isn't worth it. IF you don't though, it would be a nice gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely annoying","review":"This toy is annoying!! Tad's voice is obnoxious. Our child has no interest in the toy.I find the Leap Frog Learning Drum annoying too. A toy that we have that makes noise that I don't mind is the Fisher Price Circus Elephant with the blocks. For some reason it is actually uplifting and pleasant to me and other visitors. Our daughter enjoys pulling the string to make it pop/move and putting blocks (and anything else she can find) down the shoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"So darn annoying!","review":"My 10-month-old daughter received this toy for Christmas and within a month I passed it on to a new home. She was indifferent to it primarily because it is a rather passive and repetitive toy and the annoyingly whiny voice drove me nuts! I'm not much of an electronic toy fan anyway, since the simpler, old-fashioned toys (blocks, balls, etc.) inspire much more creative play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby show no interest","review":"I bought this when my DD was 5.5 month old. For the past 1.5 month, she shows no interest at this toy. The buttons are hard to press therefore even if she tried, she will get no interaction from it. As a stuff animal, I have to say not it is not the cutest on the block. My husband thinks DD is acutally afraid of it, that's why she won't play w/ it. :-D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I brought this in Jan for my son who was 5 months old.

She's now 9 months and stll hasn't figured it out.

The settings are either REALLY low or REALLY high!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Tad is too loud!","review":"When will toy companies learn that this kind of toy needs a volume control? My six month old received this toy for Christmas and absolutely loves it. It is soft, colorful, and sings to her, what more could a baby want? The big problem is that it is VERY loud, so loud that I don't feel that is healthy for her little ears. It has to option of nightime melodies for \\"sweet dreams,\\" but there is no way a baby could fall asleep to music this loud. I will be returning it and looking for a similar product with volume control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most likely will not arrive before Christmas!!!","review":"Think twice about ordering this toy if you need it for Christmas!! I ordered it on 12/13 and it STILL has not been shipped.......If I do not receive it by 12/22, I will have to go to a store and buy it or something else!!! and then incur shipping charges to return the one from amazon (if it ever comes). Normally, I'm quite tolerant about these things.....but this is the second Christmas Amazon has promised delivery by 12/24 and will probably NOT make it......in 2002 it was a digital camera which arrived more than 1 week after Christmas but had been promised for 12/24! Be forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Tad the savior!!","review":"I was shopping around the store and found Baby Tad by accident. He was just sitting on the shelf and my son (about 15 months at the time) was in the cart and getting bored with just sitting there. I picked up Baby Tad and gave him to my son to occupy him while in the store. I tried to put him down two different times and my son started crying because he wanted him back. I ended up buying him, thinking I would put him away for Christmas. Well, my son had to have him out of the box and takes Baby Tad with him everywhere, even now that he is 21 months old. This is a must have toy!!! It is a great Crib Toy, I agree with everyone else that wrote too. I found the Volume Control the first day!! (You have to read the boxes your kids toys come in!) I just bought him Little Leap to give him for xmas. You have to check him out for your toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"We bought this toy as a christmas gift for our 15 month old daughter and she's played with it every day since. I love the fact that there is an on/off button (good job to the designers!) and also that there is a hidden volume control, although we've not had to use that yet. The lights make it interesting to our daughter, and the toy keeps her attention by \\"talking\\" to her when she's not playing with it (It'll say \\"Let's snuggle.\\" or \\"Peek-a-boo, I see you.\\" if a button isn't pushed for a little bit.) Every time she turns away, it'll talk to her, and she'll respond by playing with it more. The songs are great - different from songs on her other toys (a big relief to me, since I listen to them all day long....) I love the sound effects it makes during the songs! Good job!! It makes me want to try other LeapFrog items as my daughter gets older."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Baby Tad","review":"My daughter just loves this toy. She'll play with it for what seems like hours. This is a great toy to travel in the car with, or just to have around the house as it's a great distraction. She loves the songs it plays. It also has a lullaby feature to get her into sleep mode at night. Overall this toy has been a great addition to her toy chest and I would recommend this toy to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby's first kiss","review":"My sister bought my daughter baby tad. It is a great toy with a little bit of excitement and calmness all in one. It is very educational for a baby and is fun at the same time. I love the nightime selection for 1 to 6 minutes. When my daughter gets cranky I put the nighttime on and she loves it. Tad was the my child's first kiss, what a cute added little feature. Anyways this is a must for every child, I will be buying them for any baby showers in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tad is Great","review":"Baby Tad is wonderful! My husband purchased Tad at a book fair shortly after our daughter was born. She is now 9 months old and is still captivated! Our only disappointment is the lack of volume control. For playtime, Tad is great, but we've found that he is far to loud to allow much cuddle time. If you put him close to your ear, you'll see why. Otherwise a wonderful toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We love Baby Tad","review":"Baby Tad is great!!! My 11 month old son has had a little trouble falling asleep on his own lately but thanks to baby tad, my son falls asleep to \\"6 minutes till night night\\" every night...it even works when he wakes up in the middle of the night. He loves to hear the songs and learn about the shapes during day time as well. The music is a little loud and their does not seem to be a volume control but he loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Toy","review":"My Daughter loves her Tad (Tad was one of her first words !) - it is relatively easy (but not too sensitive) to push the buttons and the quality of the songs and music is great. It is the one toy we take with us when we have limited space. We have bought it for many first birthdays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommy of 2","review":"I bought this toy for my 6 month old daughter 2 years ago. She got some use out of it at the begining but as she grew older she really liked singing songs with her baby tad. His voice is perfect for children.

I just recently passed this toy down to one of my neices even though my daughter still played with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"babylaughs","review":"My son has loved Tad since he was about 4 months.

She now rolls over to watch him as she falls asleep. I would recommend Baby Tad to everybody. A must have for every new baby!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute and easy to use","review":"the marvelous thing about this toy is its consistency. some toys do something different every time a button is touched. this toy is consistent, which helps with early learning. the voice is very sweet and comforting and the volume is not annoyingly loud. it is very well made and though my son's is almost two years old, it is still in fabulous shape. This is not a battery gobbler, so it is not expensive to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great toy for children","review":"my daughter rec'd this toy when she was 10 months old and almost a year and half later she is still playing with it.

She enjoyed the lights and music before she was able to push the buttons herself...then she had fun pushing random buttons and getting the cute responses...and now she knows what to push when and scans to the song she wants to hear. We keep it in the car to entertain her, and it's great at night in the car with the lights (she doesn't like the dark). I have NO complaints about this toy whatsoever, and I highly recommend it to EVERYONE to buy as a baby gift or for their own child!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent toy for baby!","review":"My son received this for Christmas when he was 13 months old. He held it all the way home (about 1 1/2 hours) and immediately started sleeping with it nightly. He would play with him until he fell asleep (better than screaming because he didn't want to go to bed) and as soon as he woke up in the morning. He still loves Baby Tad (he is now 23 months old) but we have to get new batteries because he has been used so much!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HUG AND LEARN BABY TAD","review":"My daughter got this as a Christmas gift. At the time she was 9 months old. She has played with it almost every day since then and even sleeps with Tad. The toy teachs colors, and shapes and sings nursery rhymes.

The buttons are too hard for my boy to press. (He has the strength and coordination to press lots of other buttons, these are just too hard!) Even for me, it takes two coordinated hands to play with the thing, since one hand has to provide the resistence so the other hand can use enough pressure to depress the buttons! It's all made worse by the toy since it gets impatient too fast, switching to different activities and then turning itself off before my child has a chance to respond to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR 1 YEAR OLD!","review":"I purchased a Baby Tad for my son a little too early and was at first disappointed in the interest that he showed in it. Since he reached 11 months he hasn't put it down!!! He loves it! He loves to push the buttons as they light up. He rocks back and for every time the music plays. I think this is a great toy! It is worth more than I payed for it! Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My niece was enchanted","review":"I got this for my niece for her first birthday. She was mesmerized by all the sounds and lights and things to do with it. At somepoint Tad says, \\"Let's snuggle\\" and she immediately grabbed it and gave it a big hug.I don't know how durable it will be in the long run or for how long it will hold her attention, but I loved giving her a gift that she clearly enjoyed receiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gift!!!","review":"I bought this toy for both of my nephews for their first birthdays. I am now the \\"Favorite Aunt\\" because of it. After opening this gift, one of them wanted nothing to do with any other toy.

This toy is so much fun for you and the child to play with together and you will even catch yourself singing along and pushing buttons for entertainment. This is a great toy and learning tool for children. I would recommend this toy to anyone looking to give a GREAT gift for a child they love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Product!","review":"My son got Baby Tad when he was four months old, but now that he is 10 months old, he is starting to learn that if he pushes the buttons on Tad's tummy, they will sing a song.

Once we got it home and played with, we found the musical hand. Tad was now a bed time doll. We would set the music for 2 min (it goes up to 6 min of play time) and he would be fast asleep in no time. My son is 21 months old now and still plays with his frog in bed. He sets the music for as long as he wants at night and in the morning it keeps him entertained until he's ready to get up. Don't tell him but he is learning a thing or two. The only thing now is I want a Hug & Learn Baby Lily for our 4 month old and can't seem to find one."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st Best Friend","review":"I'm absolutely thrilled that my son was given this as a gift. He received it when he was 4 months old and although all he did was look at it then, time would tell just how useful (for me) and fun (for him) Baby Tad would be. He's now 16mos and I can hear Baby Tad all over the house. He presses the shapes and laughs hysterically when it rewards him for pressing the correct shape. The timed songs for the sleep time are great- he's usually asleep by the third song. Baby Tad is a must- he even spots him out at the store and protests until I take him to it!!! MUST BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!","review":"My daughter was attached to this toy the day she got it. She associated the nite time music with bed and goes down without a fuss.

It is the cutest thing, and she loves him. He plays several different songs, and also classical music for bedtime. The classical music is quite pleasant, not at all annoying as some electronic music can be. She loves to watch the lights flash, and I think she will quickly begin to learn her colors. Best of all it has a volume switch so it can be louder for play and quiet for night time soothing music. My 3 year old also loves it, so I think it will be played with for a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We hate Baby Tad","review":"He was fun for a while, and my son enjoyed the things the doll would say, but after a couple of months we'd really like to toss this one in the trash - it's grown enormously annoying.The only educational button on this thing is the OFF button on his foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"lets learn (not)","review":"My little sister had on of these and we had to take her to the hospital because it says \\"push my nose\\" and she went to push it's nose and there was a spike sticking out of it's nose and it went right through her finger and wouldn't come out.Aswell as that the frog didn't teach her anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Kidding!?! people/babies actually like this!?!","review":"My dad got this for my son for Christmas, who was 10 mos then.

Her voice goes to places no one could have expected one to go. She really does these standards justice with her remarkable highs and lows. It reminds me of the album where she sang Pillow Talk and others where she sang The Beach Boys, Monkees, and Janice Joplin. They're true treasures. This is a true suprise because we've heard them before but not like this. I think she brings cocognition of these oldies to a new audience.

While it's critical insight and literary, social and historical merit will appease that crowd, as a new-comer to Bloomsbury history I found Bloomsbury Pie to be an insightful and capturing read.

I was disappointed with the movie, but at least it made me appreciate the documentary a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was extremely excited to see this movie based on how great the documentary was. Boy was I let down. They made it a point in the beginning to have you believe that this really happened, while making up the most non-believable storyline.

The families son is undergoing cancer treatments in the city. After being there a little while they discover that the house is haunted by spirits. They also discover that terrible acts took place there. A medium channeled spirits, and the spirits are out for revenge.This is one of the better horror films I've seen. I'm a fan of the genre, and I've seen a lot of bad horror movies. I was surprised with this one. I think that it having a true story behind it makes it more powerful. The production is well done. This movie has good actors, special effects, and some good drama. It's a pretty good film.

I could understand a Harmless one but a recurring one or in this case disturbing No Thanks, I don't like homes with history, it's the mom's fault for getting the home and then according to the true story lived there for two years.

Why would the mother let her sick son stay in the cold basement while she slept on the 2nd floor of the house? Scares consist of everything going quiet, and then a LOUD noise.

If they would have just stuck to the original story and got some better Actors and Director...this could have been a really good creepfest. Why on earth would you add what they did and take away what was scary and creepy from the documentary? I don't get it.Save your time and money and if you want to see the really creepy version of this movie, get the documentary.

They looked menacing, the history sounded menacing, but it just didn't menace me! The house was creepy enough on its own, it did not need the ridiculous backstory created by Hollywood.

Also, the writing on the bodies is never explained; we never really know what the deal was with Jonah and the others who used to live in the house; it's not clear if the boy was actually hallucinating because of his cancer treatments; the question \\"Are you okay/all right?\\" is used at least seven times, indicating lazy writing.There's also a lot of repeated shots of the same freaky images over and over again to the point of being tiresome; there is some very annoying use of strobe/flashing lights which gets on my nerves.There you go.

This book does not criticize other religions. Witchcraft is based on the old religion of Britian. It also has a mention of herbs and spices that are similar to what the American Indians did long ago to help pain and suffering.

I will be the first in line to buy the second book, by the sneak peek at the back of the book, it looks as great as this one was.

Maybe they should look to reducing paper costs. This book was much too long, packed with extraneous details that could have been easily skipped over. How many silent conversations did the victims need to have with themselves and the killers? \\"'Let me go,' she shouted silently.' Really?The story is a fine little suspense novel once you dig your way through the muck surrounding it. Ms. Jackson needs to remember that quantity is not necessarily quality. This seems to be a new trend for her--one that should be reversed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking suspense novel","review":"I usually adore books by this author, however I did not enjoy this one for several reasons. The killer drills victims teeth in a macabre dentists chair, I thought this was disgusting.At the end of the book, you know who commits the crimes, but do not know why. The author gives no reason for motive or why this person feels the need to drill victims teeth. Numerous pages were dedicated to how beautiful the heroine is, her body, how the men all melt when they see her. It got annoying. I would try another Lisa Jackson book, this one was terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD","review":"In the style of James Bond. Very good DVD, which my kids want to watch over and over again.

Unless you touch EXACT spots with the sensor pen (sometimes twice or three times before it registers!), the system reads something entirely different than what the child is looking at. How educational! Let's teach our kids WRONG LABELS for things! My son quickly becomes extremely frustrated and walks away from the toy. It's now sitting here untouched for quite awhile.

She has no problem turning the pages and then hitting the go button on each page.

I saw LeapPads in every childrens toy section of stores, so I thought this would be a good learning product to start him off with. I was wrong! First of all, the book is too small and it does not stay in place. It constantly falls off the hooks that are supossed to hold it on and it is very frustrating for my son becasue i have to reattach it for him each time. Also the pages rip eailsy from the spiral bind that holds it together. The sound is awful and often fades in and out.

Definitely worth the money spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy","review":"My three year old has had it since she was about 2 years old.

There are *very* few books that correspond to the My First Leap. They only seem to cover the pre-preschool level, and offer nothing for children who may need a bit more challenge.After trying this model, we bought the regular Leap Pad for our daughter, with some question as to how long it would be before she would be able to use it independantly. After a couple months, she was using it all on her own. She has eight books to go with it, and loves them all. What's even better is that the regular Leap Pad will grow as she grows, whereas the My First Leap wouldn't have made it through her second year.I would lump this into the catagory of all the other scaled-down products for younger kids. The better bang for your buck is with the regualr models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"My two year old son was very excited when I bought him the desk, but he quickly lost interest. He had to use the awkward pen to touch the green go circle on each page and sometimes the pen didn't work correctly. We tried replacing the batteries, but to no avail.We bought the Fisher-Price PowerTouch. It is much better. Not only will it last longer because of the expanded age range, but it came with 2 books, instead of 1. It is much easier to hold and operate. I highly recommend you spring for the PowerTouch. The extra $10 more than pays for the 2nd book alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and disappointing","review":"This toy has never worked properly. Perhaps we got a \\"lemon,\\" I don't know. Problems include: the bus plate constantly falls off, the cartridge isn't read properly by the pad, so the books don't match the story, and it's always either getting hung up or just stops working without warning. After fiddling around with it time after time, I finally just pitched it into the trash, a total waste of money. Had it worked, I could see it's value, as the child gets to point to a letter with the pen and a voice calls out the letter. But there's the rub: it doesn't work, so it's educational value is moot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We have gone through two of these toys since they suddenly stop working. I bought it because the small size seemed great for travel and the books available were more appealling to my 3 year old. But the toy often gets stuck in some kind of loop and the narrator's voice will skip and jumble or the whole thing will simply stop functioning. My daughter has not been rough with this toy at all and it started having problems within a couple months of purchase. The larger LeapPad has been fine, but this is not an equivalent product. We've been very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"It's a real shame that this toy is so poorly constructed. It would be great if it would continue to work for more than a month.

We gave it couple of tries, but he just doesn't enjoy it. The cartridge keeps falling out, so you have to turn it back on and every time you do, it's on the lowest setting. And this happens about every 2 minutes, so it's very annoying. We also got couple of books with it and there is just nothing fun about them. Not when you compare them with Fisher Price's Power Touch Learning System. There is just soo much more to do, learn and listen to. A lot more music too!

The only problem it\`s the cartridges, they get dirty and dusty and need some gentle cleaning from time to time; I didn\`t know what to do and E-mailed the customer service and they replied right away with the solution.

New batteries don't help."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy with product.","review":"This was a great idea and my twin boys love it. My problem is that the books are hard to find. Those I have been able to find are more geared towards older kids meaning those in kindergarten or 1st grade that are learning to read. Secondly, the few books like Thomas and Friends I have been able to find for their age group wear out really fast. The cartridges that come with the book start to malfunction after only being a few months old. I would skip this one and just buy the regular leap pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunctions after about 6 months-both of ours did","review":"We bought this for Christmas 2002. Our daughter was a little young for it at the time, so we didn't give it to her right away. When she started using it, it wasn't long before the stylus cord wore down. LeapFrog replaced it for free, but then other problems started. The cartridges weren't being read properly. Again, LeapPad was helpful to get it working again. Now even cleaning the cartidges as recommended doesn't make it work properly. Either the pen isn't working again, or there is an error message about wrong cartridge.We bought the pink version in 2004, thinking surely it would have improved by that time. We ran into the same problems right away, within 4-6 months.Now we have about 7 books that might or might not work...very disappointing.We have the bigger kids regular LeapPad in pink, too. We have not had trouble with that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a Leap Pad Instead","review":"I bought the leap pad for my four yr old. It was a great buy. I bought my first leap pad for my 2 yr old. It was a total waist of money. The leap pad folds so you can take it along with you. My first leap pad doesnt and when the child carries it , the book falls out. Also, shorly after buying my first leap pad, the pen only works sometimes. Its frustrating with the way the books lay open. I threw out the my first leap pad and my 2yr old has no problems with his new leap pad. Go straight for leap pad. There's books for it that two yr olds enjoy. Leap pad is more universal than the low quality my first leap pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy leap pad and skip my first leap","review":"While the intentions of this toy are educational, it is hard to learn when it does not stay together.The book does not stay in the system. It constantly falls out, unless you do not move it at all so, forget taking it in the car.I was so disapointed in this toy I threw it in the garbage after having it for only a week. I couldn't even pass it on to someone else because, it would only cause another child frustration. I did however go and buy the leap pad and my 3 year old loves this one the book stays in it. The books grow with her and she can take it in the car for long trips. Do yourself a favor and go straight for the Leap pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best travel toy","review":"I was so excited about purchasing this item as the main source of vacation entertainment for our three and one half year old daughter. Unfortunately, it was the main source of frustration. She loves to play on the computer, and we do workbooks together; so I thought this would be a good combination. It is if you are sitting perfectly still, or at a desk with it.She had difficulty hearing it on the plane (we were not near an engine). In the car, the spiral bound book kept falling off of the base. If there were grips holding the book on it would make a big difference, but at [item price] I wasn't about to rig one up myself.She was challenged in parts, but not enough to tolerate the poor construction, and the price. Needless to say, I returned it after the vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter for her second birthday a couple years ago. She never had the attention span to sit and play with it until she was about four. By then she had a Leapster and wanted nothing to do with the My First Leap Pad. The toy was not abused but didn't always read the cartridges and constantly turned off for no reason at all. This toy is a waste of your time and money. A better choice is the Leapster. It costs $80 but is worth every cent. So buy a Leapster and let your kids play with the free displays of Leap Pads at the stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Books in the Making for My First LeapPad","review":"My daughter will soon be 2 years old and was playing with this item in the store. She seemed to love it so I just purchased it for a Christmas gift.I noticed thru the Leap Frog company, that at the present time, they only have 2 additional books you can buy for it. This did have me somewhat concerned. I was not going to purchase this item if you can only use a total of three books. I would have went to the next size LeapPad. I then sent them an email and people should be happy to know that they are in the process of making more books and they will be out in the first quarter of 2002.I hope this information is helpful to current and future owners of the My First LeapPad."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit dissapointed","review":"I debated on whether to get my 3 year old the My First or the original Leap Pad. I went with the My First, but when I received it, I realized that my daughter was way too advanced for most of the material. I really think this is more meant for age 2-3. It is things like, counting from 1-10, learning body parts, colors and shapes. These are things my daughter knew by the age of 3. There are some good things for her age, but I learned that the original leap start has the red books called pre-math, pre-reading and etc. These books are the same level as the My First, so there really is no need to even buy the My First in my opinion. I gave the My First to my 20 month old to play with and bought my three year old the original as I should have done in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to understand","review":"My son loved this item, it was very easy for him to manuever.

My daughter got this for Christmas and played with it once or twice, and then got disgusted with it, and so did I.The biggest problem I had is that half the pages of the book that came with it don't work correctly. I touch the green go circle and it either starts telling the story on another page, or just makes a funny sound and does nothing. Or, even if it does read the info off the correct page, sometimes if I touch one thing, it will say it's another, like on the page with the parts of the body, I would touch the mouth and it would keep saying nose!I know I'm doing everything correctly because my son has the big LeapPad, which is the same principal. I should have just let my daughter play with his LeapPad and saved some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"This started out being a great buy for the money. I am a school teacher so I have bought many Leap Frog products for my classroom. I bought My First LeapPad for my 3 yr. old. We used it about 20 minutes per day together. The first set of batteries died after about 5 weeks of use which I thought was a little strange considering the light use. I replaced them, then the sound went on it. It has finally died after only 8 months. I don't have the receipt anymore so I look at it as a waste of money. I am not sure if I just got a bad product or what. I have different kids handling the Leap Frog stuff at school everyday without any problems. Again, I am very disappointed in this product. It was a great educational tool while it worked. My 3 year old really had fun with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powertouch seems much better","review":"I wanted a powertouch but I saw that this was cheaper and looked like it was supposed to be for a younger child, so I bought it for my 2 year old for Christmas. He can't play with it by himself because you have to do certain things in a certain order before you even play with it. You have to turn it on, but its hard to tell if you have turned it on because the volume is so low. Then you have to press go with the pen and then you can turn the volume up. Ethan likes the story on the top flip page, but only the one on the bottom works. It wasn't that imaginative either. Get the powertouch. Much cooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget it","review":"Why buy this when they will outgrow it so soon? I have bought both the Leap Pad and Quantum Pad for my children. I have 4 children between the ages of 4 and 9. When I first bought the leap pad my youngest was 2. Both systems can use the same books and cartridges. So they can use them from preschool to 5th grade (or higher, I even learned from them). That seems like a better investment to me than something they can only use for a couple of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER LAST YEAR FOR CHRISTMAS WHEN SHE WAS 16 MONTHS.

I didn't think that was very supportive: three strikes--you're out.My daughter also has a habit of chewing. She broke the pen tip, and the pen had to be replaced. If you have a chewer...you must supervise at all times. I think it's possibly a choking hazard to younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good toy overall with a few undesirable features","review":"My boys have really enjoyed this toy, especially my 2 1/2 year old. I think it does have educational value and is easy for children to learn to use. After a while, the toy starting saying \\"Ooops, that's not a leappad cartridge!\\" whenever I inserted one. I called the company and was told to clean the cartridge insert with a q-tipped soaked in rubbing alcohol, and it worked. I think it would be helpful if the company included this helpful hint in their literature that comes with the toy. Sometimes you have to be very accurate with the pen to elicit the sounds you want. Otherwise, I am pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"very disappointed.","review":"I like this toy for my grandson, but I am not very happy that you can not find the additional books to go with it. If the point is to buy the next step up, I am going to return it and not buy the next size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for a 1 year old","review":"We bought this when our son was 18 months old and he's now 2. He loves books, and have heard good things about the model for older children. I just don't think this toy is developmentally appropriate for toddlers, and imagine the manufacturer was just capitalizing on the success of the main LeapPad. My son and his friends just wanted to take out and put in the back cartridge, and seemed alternately bored or frustrated by the paper booklets."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SON WHEN HE WAS 23 MONTHS OLD. HE WAS ABLE TO USE IT AND LEARN SO MUCH HE ALREADY KNEW HIS COLORS, SHAPES, NUMBERS AND THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET. BUT IT HELPED TO REINFORCE WHAT I HAD ALREADY TAUGHT HIM. HE LOVED IT. WITH MY HELP HE USED IT PROPERY AND LEARNED ALOT HE IS NOW THREE AND STILL USES IT. I LOVE THE LEAPPAD SYSTEM I RECOMEND IT FOR ANYONE WANTING TO HELP THERE KIDS LEARN AND HAVE FUN. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT THE PEN CORD COULD BE A BIT LONGER. FOR YOUNGER KIDS ADULTS SHOULD HELP TO MAKE SURE THEY USE IT PROPERLY.IT IS GREAT FOR ALL KIDS. I WILL CONTINUE TO BUY LEAPFROG PRODUCTS FOR BOTH OF MY KIDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"1 or 2 years ago i bought this for my daughter. It broke within 3 months. We tried to reach the company. We couldn't get it replaced. It would shut off in the middle of playing. And we bought it for $35.00. What a ripoff. It's not durable at all. It was only dropped once. The fall was about 6\\" not even a foot in the air. Try some other leapfrog product. Something went wrong on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating to say the least!","review":"I just purchased this toy for my two and a half year old son and must admit we were both disappointed and frustrated. The pointer pen did not, would not work! We replaced the batteries, turned the Leap Pad on and off, checked to be sure the pointer lines were connected--everything but when we pointed to anything--the go buttons, the pictures, letters, words--the only response received was the mother's voice saying \\"please press go to begin!\\" Needless to say by the end of our first session we were ready to take this toy back to the store for a full refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you love sexual stereotypes","review":"This toy is a good idea, but whoever put together the graphics needs to modernize it a bit. The female characters have large bows stuck to their heads and long eyelashes, whereas the male characters have no eyelashes at all. I have not heard the term \\"mailman\\" in 15 years but you will find it here. We are very disappointed.Also it does not work very well. Even if you touch the \\"go\\" button before playing with each page, it seems to forget what page it is on and will skip ahead without warning. So suddenly the \\"canteen\\" on the camping page is being called a \\"robot\\". Fine if you are older than 3 and can figure out what went wrong, otherwise your child is being taught the wrong words.We also found that the leap pad is too easy for our 3-year-old and we would have probably preferred to go with the harder version to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money! Leapfrog doesn't stand up for their product!","review":"My daughter likes her My First Leappad, but after several months use, the pen has wires showing! I called Leapfrog and after a series of frustrating phone calls, I find out that they don't make the replacement pen for the My First Leappad anymore! At first the customer service agent told me they have the pen and I paid for it. The package I recieved in the mail had an old leappad system that doesn't work and 2 pens that don't fit my leappad. When I called back, it was a 2 hour ordeal. Finally, I spoke with a supervisor who told me that despite the fact that it was their mistake, I had to pay to ship everything back to them, then they would refund my money! Not only am I upset by this treatment, but I can't believe they don't make the pens anymore. I have invested in a lot of books for this leappad and now it is useless. What a waste of money! I cannot in good conscience buy from LeapFrog again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, LeapFrog has another winner!","review":"My 2 & 1/2 year old LOVES his LeapPad!

He got his first one at three (which was too soon) and know at almost five we are on our THIRD leappad. The problem is that stupid pen. The orange wire connecting it breaks every time. This time it broke inside the orange casing!!! He has had this one for a month and a half and I've been monitoring him closely so this wouldn't happen again but it did. They sell replacement pens for about $6.00 but I think I've just had it at this point.

I would not recomend it to anyone. It is a great idea but bad product. If they want to keep selling this product they really need to work out their isuues. Be aware, if you do get it, there is a 3 MONTH WARRANTY after which the toy seems to not work correctly if at all. Maybe, with all the reviews I'm seeing, they should just recall it."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT GROWLS!!!!!","review":"This is my second one we've been through and both of them did same thing. It always says oops that's not a blah blah blah cartridge or it will gargle and make awful noisees or just simply shut off. I've cleaned the cartridges and tryed new batteries, but doesn't work. It's a piece of junk!!!! I wouldn't even give it 1 star!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broke to quickly","review":"I gave this 2 stars onle because my son did enjoy this toy. But with in 7-8 months it did not even work right. Would turn it self off when playing with it and the pointer would not register whenever you touched it to the picture books.

I would have to say this needs to be alittle more sturdy if it is a young childs toy"},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged toy and I returned it and am waiting for refund","review":"The toy came from a company through Amazon- called Alabamafinest. I ordered a NEW toy and a damaged toy showed up in a shirt box with one tiny piece of bubble wrap. After checking my records to confirm our order was as I thought - for a new toy,I returned it and sent a message saying I wanted it exchanged for a NEW toy or a refund. The company could not comply and said they would refund our money. We are waiting for that. So, unfortunately, I am unable to comment on the value of the toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessories hard to find","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was 3.

He does not spend a whole lot of time on the computer but I think because he has played more sophisticated educational games this product is not fun for him. He is pretty patient and has a good attention span for a four year old so that is not the problem. The age range is 3-5 years but I feel my son is too old for this toy. I am going to let my daughter, who just turned two, start playing with it soon...I have a feeling she will enjoy it more. I can not rate durability since ours has barely been used, but I gave it four starts since everything worked well out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We usually love all of the \\"Leapfrog\\" products, but this one was a disappointment. It doesn't sit on the lap really well, and the pen doesn't seem to be quite accurate. I even have a hard time making sure that it hits what it's supposed to. The pages are also hard to turn for little fingers-so parts of the story would end up being skipped.My boy, (who's unusually patient for his age) just ended up being frustrated more than anything.It ended up being a huge waste of money for us..."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 is a bit young","review":"We bought this for a two year old and although he enjoys it, it took him a few weeks to remember to hit the green go on each page, and still he sometimes just points at things and does not follow the directions. Keeps him entertained though. He absolutely loves the Dora book! (sold separately)"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad cartridges ...","review":"This game is ok, entertains my children for a little while. I thought everything was ok, but then, after only a couple of months, the cartridges started to malfunction! We have two leap pads and some games work in one, but not the other (and visa versa!) For the price, I don't want the toy to not work 1/2 the time after only a few uses. The books seem to hold up pretty good, but the cartridges don't. And, at a price of around $12 each, I was very dissapointed. If the cartridges worked all the time, I would probably give this toy 4 stars, as it is fun (when it works) and portable. One last comment for improvement, would be to have the volume be on the outside, not in the book, as the regular volume is a bit too loud and I have to ask my little one to turn it down each time she switches books/cartridges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Educational Toy!","review":"I purchased this LeapPad for my 2 1/2 year old daughter. She loves it! I showed her how it works and she can now play with it on her own. Although, we have fun playing with it together as well. She woke up this morning telling me that when you turn the page you need to touch the green go button. (she was dreaming about it!!) One reviewer stated that the on/off button was slow, however I simply explained to my daughter to touch the button once and it comes on, she has had no problems! This is a wonderful product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: No headphone jacks on new models","review":"We had a My First Leappad 2 years ago for my son. In addition to its educational value, we really appreciated the fact that it could keep him occupied in a public place (he took a 2-hr airplane ride when he was 3 yrs old and the Leappad helped him be a wonderful, quiet passenger the whole ride).Our son has since grown out of the My First Leappad and it was no longer working right... so we bought our daughter a new model. HOWEVER, We found that the new one has no headphone port. It is no longer suitable for the airplane rides, busy car trips, doctor's office, etc because it is too noisy.Big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's gift that my daughter loves...","review":"My son received this for his fourth birthday and he played with it occassionally. My 2-1/2 year old daughter won't put it down. She calls it her computer and is constantly taking it out of my son's room. This is the only toy that I can say she plays with everyday (unless the batteries are dead). Her favorite game is the Dora the Explorer game and the Leap game that comes with the LeapPad. My son will only play the Thomas the Tank engine game on the LeapPad.My only complaint is that the activity pads can fall out of the LeapPad and that it is a little hard even for my son (who's five now) to attach the books to the pad. I usually have to flip the books for my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for young readers","review":"I bought this for my two year old daughter last year. She LOVES it, and plays with it for hours. This year I bought her the Thomas and Dora books, she hasn't stopped playing with them. I would highly recommend this for toddlers, even if they are under the age of 3. A Great learning toy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Toy!!","review":"I purchased this item for my son last Christmas. He turned two in February, so he may have been too young for it then. However, this summer, I took the toy out of storage. To my amazement, in a few short trials, he was manipulating the pen and the pages with very little assistance.This item is very educational. My son plays the games and is able to find the various shapes, colors and numbers. He also enjoys playing the paper piano. He is able to recognize the train sounds and imitate the sounds of the different characters in the books.Durablity has not been an issue for us. Although we do not leave him unsupervised with the toy, we do let him use it while in the car. I would have thought that a page would have ripped by now, but it hasn't happened.Overall, we are very pleased with this toy. We can't wait until the new Thomas book comes out so that he can \\"read\\" all about his favorite engine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't grow with your child!","review":"First, I must say that I love LeapFrog products!

Berlin and Merman together. What could be better? Well, to be honest, the 1966 revival CD is better.

But for historical purposes, put this one in your library as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW SLOW SLOW","review":"Slow is the word for this. The tempo is slow. There's no spirit. Frank's voice just DRAGS. Merman's voice grates on the ears. I give her credit for putting some energy into it...but I can't say that there was as much as there was in...say, Gypsy. It seems as though all the songs are slowed down. Maybe all the recordings made afterward, such as the revival, and the television cast with Mary Martin, were speeded up. But I must say that this recording is rather dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"In this case, the revival was better.","review":"Eeee. I did not like this CD at all. I MUCH prefer the revival.

However, if you want to hear a performance of \\"Annie Get Your Gun\\" with some real acting, this isn't it. Ethel Merman's voice MAY be much better but my 17 year old daughter played the part with a lot more feeling in her school play. For instance, \\"Moonlight Lullaby' HELLO... it's supposed to be a lullaby not an aria. Another example, \\"Doing What Comes Naturally\\" is supposed to be when Annie Oakley was an uneducated hillbilly and the accent in this version just isn't there. Some of this may be a proud papa speaking but I just can't buy Ethel Merman as anything other than Ethel Merman."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS SHOW...","review":"...And Merman was really great as Annie Oakley. I really like the 1966 revival recording a little better, but this recording is still great! Now, sometime in the late 60's a television version starring Merman was produced, and it was wonderful!

I initially thought that it was funny, but on reading the whole book it became so tiresome listening to the author go on chapter after chapter about how cool she is, even WITH a child! I kept trying to figure out what her larger point was, but that seems to be it: she has children and she is COOL.I don't know if living in Hollywood has sucked all depth or meaning from the author's life, but that's what this book portrays. Not only is life about YOUR yoga class, YOUR brushes with minor celebrities and YOUR Friday nights at the bar, motherhood seems to be all about YOU. About halfway through the book, I started to count where she writes about her child or parenting in any active manner. My count confirmed that this is a mommy book devoid of children. Children and motherhood are the SET UPS for jokes about her life. Too bad the jokes themselves are not funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast hilarious read.","review":"Loved this book.

Most of it is acid jazz/lounge/Brazillian/Vienna influenced whatever you want to call it, but not trip hop and not house. Mostly instrumental and mostly soft beats. This would sit nicely next to Costes, Tosca, Hedkandi, Naked Music, Compost, ESL, etc. The things I don't like: not mixed, two tracks are misfits: 9 comes on too loud as a French Disco number, and the cheezy vocals and accoustic melody on track 14 are so out of place it makes me drop what I'm doing to hit next track, because there's a cool song from Astrud Gilberto to finish the disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cybertrash","review":"This book is a wonderful example of everything that is wrong with contemporary cultural theory when applied to new technologies.

Our society's fetishization of technological progress and free markets should be challenged, and the best role for the Krokers and similar critics is poking the hornets' nest and seeing who gets stung.But there are bigger questions when studying Data Trash, Hacking the Future and the Krokers' other techno-dystopian tomes: does all this jargon and rhetoric actually add up to anything? The Krokers have been great at stirring the pot, but seem to have some fundamental misconceptions about the nature of technology and how, in a practical sense, it is accepted or rejected by people.Instead of just talking about economic culture and gloabalization, the Krokers wrap everything in hackeresque techno-babble, and instead of driving their points home, all we get is muddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing about hacking","review":"This book has nothing to do with hacking.

This is not however your typical 'making of' or 'behind the scenes' look at \\"Monsters Inc.\\". I'm certain that if it is not already out there it will soon follow if that is what you're looking for. This book is unique, especially since the movie is 3-D rendered computer animation, because it is not filled with wire-frames, and storyboards, and studio character layouts. This book is more about inspiration. The vast amount of illustrations are beautiful, whimsical, and as varied as the imagination itself. I thouroughly enjoyed this book as a lover of cartoons, of paintings, of drawings, and of monsters of all kinds. I highly reccomend it to children of all ages and art lovers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inspiration","review":"This book had been on my \\"must-haves\\" for years and am so glad to have received it.

(Quite possibly Pixar might not like us to know what goes on behind the scenes.)Liken it to the out of print \\"Before the Animation Begins: The Art of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists\\". But without the zest of Tengren and others. (Carter Goodrich lends some marvelously different takes on the monster feeling.)The multitude of pastel mood pieces are lively and beautifully done but overall this book lacks the superflous character development and animation insight of it's predecessors.I will eagerly await a follow-up volume that might come remotely close to The Arts of Bugs Life and Toy Story. PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MOUSE HANGS!","review":"Great product except for critical mouse hangs. Have chased this to death. Once it hangs, only recovery is reboot. Then, after reboot you need to get the device working again: requires a witch-doctor religious ritual: TRY_AGAIN_LABEL: pressing 'connect' button on receiver, then removing and reinserting batteries from mouse -and- pressing mouse's connect button before window on screen times out.

While I do like being wireless, I've found myself having to switch to the Microsoft model for one reason. The scroll wheel is very useful, but Logitech has designed it with slight clicks, or detents in the wheel. While some claim this is useful for precision, I've found it no help, and actually a problem. After a few weeks, the constant click pulse from the wheel hurts your finger after awhile. Kind of like chinese water torture. At any rate it got so bad that I had to switch to the smooth scrolling mouse from Microsoft, and life is much better. Maybe this is not an issue for others, I'm not normally sensitive to such things, but I thought I'd better convey my experience. If these things don't bother you, then proceed!Also, the software that maps the extra buttons to useful functions does not work well.

As long as you keep it in the receiver/base station when you're not using for stretches of time, it'll always be charged. Also, the mouse has a little light that blinks its battery status.Both mouse and keyboard are very comfortable, and I'm getting used to all the buttons.

Very nice.I have not ran into any issues with its range, though I have not used it more than about 8 feet away from the receiver. I really like the weight of the mouse. With the 2 AA batteries it has a comfortable mass to it. Others have mentioned the issue of not having a light on the keyboard for num lock, function key lock, etc., those being on the receiving unit. I assume this was done since that kind of light would really pull juice from the keyboard batteries. I have had other wireless keyboards and they also have not had lights on the keyboard.Once nuisance item for me is that the function key lock does not default to on, so you have to be aware of that when doing things like getting into the PC bios. I would recommend this combo to any of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"The software is sorry","review":"I love the keyboard and mouse but the mouse software is driving me nuts. It hangs, it jumps, it scolls on its own. I am a professional who uses the computer all day long. I would like to toss the mouse in the river and just let it drown. The software is bad and is more like a popup virus. After many hours of studying to get rid of the stupid popup screens, now the mouse is nothing but an irritate. It will be gone from my desk very very soon. Too bad because I like everything else about it. Shame on Logitech for such a sorry job."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Wireless!!!","review":"I am so happy I purchased this product. It was simple to set up, easy to use and it is so great not having to deal with those annoying wires!The only thing I noticed is that the mouse is much heavier than a standard wired mouse, so I have to adjust from home to work, but it really is not a problem.Saw the product earlier in the day at best buy for $20 more. With the free shipping, I received it on the third day after orderring. This is the way to shop!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not good for notebooks","review":"My primary machine is a notebook running Windows XP Pro, which I take back and forth between work and home. At home, connected via the PS2 ports and a docking station, the combo works great, and I have zero complaints. At work, where I have to connect directly to the notebook via the USB port, there are problems. Usually either the mouse or keyboard will not work upon start-up. When they are working, there is often some functionality missing (one or more of the buttons do not work). After a few minutes of using the combo, both would then stop working. I tried all of the troubleshooting techniques, and the only one to work was unplugging and reinserting the cable. Needless to say, this is not something you want to do every 5 minutes.If you are going to use this setup attached to a desktop or docking station, it's fabulous. I can't recommend it for a notebook setup, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't ask for more","review":"This keyboard/mouse combo is absolutely fantastic. I've been using mine for over a year and a half with no problems. Both the mouse and keyboard look and feel nice. The music controls on the keyboard work automatically with Windows Media Player (I haven't tried any others). That means I can lounge around my apartment and control tracks and volume with my keyboard from afar. The only thing I have to complain about is that you have to remember to put the mouse on the charger every few days. And that's more of a complaint about myself than the product! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless","review":"I was just playing with the unit so that I could add some more items to this review. Things that the mouse will work well on: My shirt, my wood desk, the side of my printer, a calkboard, the wall, the carpet. It does not work well on my hair.I believe I am on my 3rd workday (that means 7+ hours of use per day) without a recharge and the mouse still does not need to be charged. I'm able to use both the mouse and keyboard up to a distance of about 10 feet away from the base.For those of you concerned that you may need any extra items, you won't. The package comes with everything you need to get up and running. When I bought the Duo I was a little worried that I'd need a separate radio transmitter card and that fear was unfounded. The radio reciever is included and it just plugs right into where your wired mouse and keyboard plug in.I think it is hard to go wrong with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Flaw","review":"The biggest flaw in this book is that Brown does not deal with the fact that Ancient Israel and Second Temple Judaism believed in a three level universe.

I see this brand everywhere so I assumed it must be OK. I was wrong.I used mine rarely - maybe ten to twelve times - before it stopped retracting fully. The sound is OK, but the earpiece falls out constantly. It's not a good use of your $6, get something else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor sound and construction","review":"This thing was great for the one week that it worked. The sound is bad even for cheap earbuds, but I mostly listen to audiobooks and I was happy as a clam until it quit retracting properly. I was careful with it, because it's of noticeably cheap manufacture, but my care did me no good. It broke in about 1 week. Too bad. Good idea, shabby execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"When good business deals go bad","review":"There once was a man they called HaroldO'er business deals he had a fair holdIf no bargain was struckHe would curse his bad luckAnd write a new book of a rare moldOn the back cover of this novel the reader is informed that Harold Robbins is a phenomenon, then given what I assume is evidence: novels written in 1951, 1961, 1971, 1981, and now... 1991. So, here we have the wonder of a man who has had books published in five consecutive decades in years ending with the number one. My congratulations to the guy, that's quite an accomplishment. As for the rest of it...This one starts with promise. The Amazon adventure was rather exciting, but then we get the typical Robbins business deal porn overkill.

Nice fit and seemed like a quality product. But the Banjo part was a bit thicker than the other and the washers were also a bit thicker and that combination only left me 3 at most 4 threads to secure the banjo bolt into the caliper. That scared me. I had a good talk with teck support - they assured me that it would work but could not offer a longer bolt or thinner parts so I sent them back.After much searching I found the same brand as I had but with AN connectors not banjo type. 9 threads go into the caliper and I am happy with those.

They don't have any fancy little add-ons, but that's what makes it a great staple. I've purchased about ten in the last two years and I basically live in them since they're comfortable and cute, without making me look too gussied up all the time. The price is a little expensive, but they've lasted far longer then other leggins I've gotten at American Apparel, Old Navy and Target.They do loosen up with time and wear, which makes them less leggings and more flexible skinny pants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a quality legging!!","review":"I just got these today and I LOVE them!! They have just the right amount of stretch and they are really nice and thick. I also like that they are not so high waisted. They sit at the hips.

I have not a problem if the band decided to release the videos in mono, but somebody along the way forgot to inform the customers about this decision, and the disc itself has printed \\"LPCM Stereo\\" on it. That is the ONLY problem I have with the soundtrack.I don't ask for 5.1 sound, simply because 90% of music DVD's with 5.1 are \\"faux\\", in other words, echo and reverb added on the surrounds, which results in horrible sound imaging. Much better off with PCM Stereo and using your amplifier's Dolby Prologic II if you can.Why am I disappointed? Well, I don't recall if the videos were in stereo when I watched them on TV, but if they were, which I highly think the case, then a mono soundtrack doesn't hold true to the original video as it was conceived.Anyway, still a collection of great videos from some amazing directors like Gondry and Sednaoui.Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Collection Of Massive's Video's","review":"This is an awesome collection of all of Massive's Videos, but like the package says it's just Eleven Promos nothing more.Just a simple menu and Play. That said it's cool to see the old videos that you wouldn't be able to see anywhere else. Most of the videos are bizarre and really make no sense but somehow they go with the songs. The unreleased Angel video is cool but has nothing to do with the song, like all the other videos but I geuss it's meant not to be understood. The Teardrop video is probably the best video concept I have ever seen(Baby singing to mother in the womb), It's worth the purchase just for that video. Some of the videos(Inertia Creeps,Angel,Protection) I had to watch a couple of times to figure out. But all in all this is a must have for any Massive Attack Fan.But What I'd really like to see is a concert dvd,but well what can you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Value - It's Worth it!","review":"I seem to buy a lot of DVDs with videos on them, and I could not pass up these 11 promo videos from Massive Attack. It's like a GREATEST HITS or SINGLES package, so it should please the casual as well as obsessive fan. Songs go chronilogically in order throughout the disc. There are no extras - just eleven videos in stereo with no bells or whistles. But most of these don't need explaining. The good part is that you have many guest vocalists near the end - Tracy Thorne of EBTG, and Tricky to name two. So it seems to lend itself to parties or bar settings! Video quality is fine, though on widescreen televisions you may see some funky aspect ratios. This is built for squares! It's only in 2.0 stereo, but so were the singles. Wish more bands would release their videos this way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best band with the Worst Videos...","review":"Massive Attack is one of the best bands ever in my opinion, so it's twice the shame that their videos should feel like rejected concepts tossed at other bands. Rapping at a table. Bad lip-syncing down a boring street. Returning to a gritty apartment. A white guy watching his wife cheat on him with two black men. A baby singing in the womb. A stripper video that is a great example of nudity for nudity's sake. These are some of the worst video concepts ever completed, even early 90's Madonna videos had more taste than this. It's astonishing when the band and their live shows are so clearly intending to bring us something different.I have to say though, that the video for ANGEL should be seen, as it is the one great video they've done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Massive History","review":"All I can say is if you are a Massive Attack fan this is a must.

Good time span of vids all the way from the beginning during the Tricky days. Well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art or Pomposity?","review":"A Massive Attack fan to the death, I was sorely disappointed by this collection of videos. Since the release of \\"Mezannine,\\" I would say that Del Naja has become the Bono of the early-mid nineties: pompous and a bit self-righteous. Where I would have hoped to see some experimental music video directing, this collection is mostly a jumbled together collection of cheesecake closeups of the ever-scowling 3-D.

The Decca version of \\"Die Lustige Witwe\\" remains the standard by which others will be judged. Not only is this disc abridged, the musical quality is not particularly good. There seems to be a problem in the mixing, where some portions seems overly loud, and other sections seems tinny and distant.

Unfortunately, the print in so tiny (I mean tiny) that I literally had to get a magnifying glass to read it. After a few pages the eyestrain prevented me from reading any more. Judging by the headers, it looks like it's probably a good book. The only problem is that it's unreadable by anyone over 40, and that includes me.

You can trust me: this is the best Bowie biography ever published. The only drawback is that his pre-1969 years are described rather superficiously. But once you get to \\"Space Oddity\\", you realize you're reading a worthy tome by a knowledgeable writer. Buckley is a long-time Bowie fan and he got to interview key people in David's career, most of whom were still associated with the singer at the time of writing (unlike other biographies, where only former associates are heard). But unlike some fans you may have met, Buckley has a critical, non-biased view of Bowie's life. While most biographers concentrate on secondary aspects and anecdotes, Buckley hits the nail in the head and takes you right through the spinal cord of David's career. Whether you're a diehard Bowie fan or a newcomer looking for information, this book is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as advertised","review":"It came just as it was Advertised.

The vision of the American Civil War presented by this book at least isn't partisan: it is, well, centennial! Alot of books came out during, and leading up to the centennial, and most of them aren't any good. Foote, and Catton are enjoyable writers, but history-writing has changed alot since ca.1960. Keegan's \\"Face of Battle\\" really changed the whole historiographic scene, and that's too bad, in a way.

I understand this, and I accept it. When PBS negotiates the rights to release the program on DVD, the DVD only includes the footage that was shown on Masterpiece (rather than the whole program). I don't understand this. PBS does this a lot. They cut 40 minutes from Any Human Heart.

However if things go the way of \\"Framed\\" I will no longer be watching.This was so incredibly trite - montage-methods going back to bad TV movies and holiday Hallmark specials, plot leaps, adults becoming enamored and soften by the oh-so bright children, country school marm who knows so much more about art than the curator of an international museum, silly background music to tell you that something is supposed to be \\"cute\\" or funny....oh - should I go on.....?Probably not.If you like Disney family movies, you'll love it.

All this CD is is disco-like stupid dance tunes that don't really say anything besides \\"it's fun for us to party\\". Even those two tracks I DID like got so dull after listening to them about three times. I guess if your into the mechanical dance music and weird party sounds, you might enjoy it if your actually having a party or just feel like dancing around the room.

If you want dance tunes, try some pop music instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good fun","review":"Although this album is not the grounbreaking work of the beatles,or someone else, it is perfeclty suitable for some old fashioned techno fun or for spicing up your party.

Definitely worth the price.","review":"'The Party Album' is the Vengaboys first attempt at an album and I must say, they've done a pretty good job. Their songs are upbeat and catchy and will definitely have you singing and dancing. This CD is great for parties (it was a favorite at MTV Spring Break '99) but it's also a lot of fun on your own. The only reason it doesn't get a perfect five stars is that I'm not too fond of the purely dance songs such as 'Up & Down' or 'Paradise.' Personally, I like songs that you can sing along to. And not everyone will like the techno beats.Overall, this CD is a lot of fun.

I will admit that the songs are at least a little catchy, but they remain firmly lodged in your brain. I've heard this CD only once, and weeks later, the songs are still running through my head. I think I'll have to burn my brain because it's contaminated forever. Besides which, there's plenty of dance music out there that's every bit as catchy as this without being half as repetitive, cloying, or insipid.

I tried to attach the photo magnets to the wall vent. It held, but not as strongly as to the refrigerator. The problem seems to be the amount of ferrous material in the vent cover and the shape of the cover - mine were stamped by machine and the built-in air deflectors in the vent are raised slightly from the edges of the vent where they attach to the wall/ceiling.

Maybe she's not that stage to actually touch the letters yet. After about 4-5 spins, she loses interest.However, ultimately, I believe that she'll learn to love it. And I may try to detach the ball from its cradle to see if it make a difference. But she's not walking yet either, so it's hard to tell how durable it is if she doesn't drop it.The \\"ABCDEFG...\\" song becomes very repetitive if she doesn't spin it continuously- it starts over from the beginning otherwise... annoying for adults! Why didn't the egineers make it continue from there on??!One nice feature is that every letter has a different, albeit short, song that it plays in the music setting. It doesn't become old like many toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Dud!","review":"I have 3 kids--and none of them were interested in this toy for more than, honestly, a couple minutes.

My 3 year old loves it because he is just getting into his abc's and it's great for learning which letters are which and the sounds they make.

It also is very sturdy and has been thrown around a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batteries impossible to change","review":"Yes, just about everything I've read on all 100 something reviews is true, good & bad. This toy was fun for our daughter from when she received it at 10mos till over age 2 1/2.BUT BEWARE THE BATTERY CHANGE! I recommend before buying this at the store, make the store-worker show you how to change the battery so you don't have to worry about breaking the toy or losing your money. I've been working on opening up the toy for the last 40 minutes and am now jamming a screwdriver in it to pry it apart, probably damaging it. Other's have commented on this, too, if you read all the reviews. The great thing is it comes with long-lasting batteries so your kid gets to enjoy it for a long time (thus,all the rave reviews come in). My daughter would love to sing the songs on this ball if we could just get new batteries in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Toy","review":"I bought this toy for my son when he was a year old.

FOR THE LONGEST HE WOULDN'T TALK. NOW HE IS MUMMBLING THE ALPHABET SONG AND HUMMING SONGS. HE LOVES IT ON AND OFF OF THE BASE. THIS TOY IS ONE OF THE BEST STIMULATING TOYS I USED TO EXPAND MY SON'S LEARNING CAPABILITIES. A VERY GOOD INVESTMENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating toy","review":"I'm surprised this toy gets as many positive comments as it does. The fact that the selected song stops playing as soon as the ball is moved is very frustrating for my baby and me.Maybe we'll both like it better when she's older (she's 16 months and got it when she was about 10 months)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Leap Frog","review":"My daughter got this toy at Christmas along with many others as you may imagine. It is her favorite, which makes it my favorite. It comes on a stand making it easy for her to spin giving her lots of confidence in herself. The rubber texture makes it easy to grip and maneuver. The volume adjustment is a plus. It can be removed from the stand at any stage in her play. I believe the age range will be more than most. Right now she is spinning the ball and it reacts by playing music. Next, she can learn how to press the letters to play music or learn the alphabet. Great Toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I taught my son to sit up using this ball.With in 10 days, by learning to balance himself and spin the ball at the same time!Another great Leapfrog product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect toy for a toddler!!","review":"I bought this toy for Christmas for my 1 year old. HE LOVES IT!! It stands out from all of his other toys as his favorite! I like the fact that it has volume control and he loves the different songs. It is easy to use- he figured it out in no time. The ball can sit on the stand or be taken off and rolled around. It is virtually indestructable. A great value and yet another leapfrog hit in our house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovery ball","review":"Pretty nifty toy... my 18 month old started to recite some letters soon after throwing the ball agains the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"Ok, granted it only cost twenty bucks, but I was not impressed with this at all. First of all, don't ever spill anything on it, you will never get it clean. You can't get in all the teeney cracks without submerging it. Second, the volume cuts out every once in a while, and it's inaudible. Third, Once my daughter was a little older we took it out of the base, I could just get done vacumming the carpets and still this toy would find the only cat hair or fuzzy in the room and cling to the ball. Where after my daughter would try to eat it off. And finally after 4 months, only half of the letters work, and you had to push rather hard to begin with. I would not recommend this product at all, If you like the leap frog brand try Baby Tad. That was an amzing toy which my daughter loved and so did I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"This is plain and simply a good toy. For any parent to find the woman's voice or any repetition annoying is funny. It's a toy!! That's what it's supposed to do. It sings the ABC's in a woman's voice. It plays different songs based uopn the letter that the child presses (ex.O-Old MacDonald). It's entertaining and educational. It's a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK BUT BETTER ABC TOYS...","review":"I got this for my daughter for her first bithrday. She loved it right away & started playing with it still in the box! Well, 2 1/2 weeks later, it is still in the box, because as much as she loves it (I let her play with in her high chair while I prepare dinner), all she can do is spin the ball. The letters were certainly not designed for little hands. My daughter has never had a problem with any buttons before (ex: tv remotes, she can turn the tv on & off, she can turn her other toys on & play with them...), but this one, just frustrates her. I have not yet gone back to BRU or any other store that would carry this toy to see if maybe this is a defect, but unfortunately I am probably going to have to return it. She also received the leapfrog radio & the bus for her b-day which she loves (which all teach the alphabet) ... I must say, that I am dissappointed this time with Leapfrog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Toy for Young Children","review":"My 13 month old daughter received this toy for Christmas, and she loves it. The bright colors and cheerful music really hold her attention. Plus, the ball can be removed from its base and rolled around, all the while playing bright and fun music. The construction is strong and durable to withstand rough play, and there is a volume control to raise or lower the volume. The letters can be touched, and the sound of each letter is made. I highly recommend this fun first toy. It is very interactive and suppports early learning skills such as letters and sounds. Buy this great educational toy for your child. They will learn a lot from playing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Leap Frog Learning Toy","review":"Although I don't see the draw, our son loves every single Leap Frog toy we buy him. A couple with an infant daughter recommended this to us when we were in BabiesRus. A bit pricey, but definitely worth it. Our son, who is 8 months, has had this for about a month now. He loves to spin the ball, wait for it to stop and sing/say the alphabet, then he spins it again. It also offers the flexibility to be taken off the stand. As he is crawling now, we use it as an incentive to get him moving by rolling it a few feet away. He'll crawl to it, roll it, then chase after it to activate it again. The wonderful thing about Leap Frog products is that they engage the youngest child, but offer the ability to continue to stimulate and educate as the child grows.Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My 7-month-old son does like the music and the sounds but he just spins the wheel a few times and then goes off to find a different toy. I think the letter buttons should be more sensitive for my sons' little fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It","review":"Although the product information says that it plays 26 songs, it only plays one song when it spins. So if your child presses a letter (not something that most young babies can do, so you'll have to keep doing it), it does play a different nursery tune, and as soon as that ball starts spinning again...back to the default tune. I thought that on Alphabet mode it would play the Alphabet song all the way through once as one reviewer below said, but it does not.I had bought this with 2 goals in mind: to encourage my daughter to crawl, and to introduce her to different nursery tunes as well as the whole alphabet song. I thought it was lame, and my daughter lost interest in it, too, after only a couple of spins."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better options","review":"I got this for my 9 month old daughter. It was neat at first, the music was entertaining. But now it just sits in the toy box. When it is out avaialable for play, she won't chose it. I agree with another review, the letters are to small and the concept is just not there for little ones. There are better options than this toy. I would not pay this again. Not worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why, but my son doesn't like this toy...","review":"It looks like a wonderful toy. My son is two and a half and has had this toy since his first birthday. He doesn't like it. I'm not sure why; he loves the Leapfrog Phonics bus which is similar in concept.He'll play with the Discovery Ball for a few minutes then wander away. The batteries died simply because it was left on pressed up against something -- not from use. I'm hoping someday he'll start enjoying this toy.I have to say I was nearly in tears trying to change the batteries on this toy. Honestly, it's the hardest battery change I've ever gone through in my entire life! And I almost injured myself because there was a lot of prying involved. The diagrams on the toy are so faint and tiny that you can hardly figure out what to do.I will not curse my new nephew by getting him this toy. When he's old enough, I'm getting him the Leapfrog Phonics bus instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My kids barely played with it.","review":"I have a 3 year old, 2 year old and 7 month old. The 3 year old received this as a gift years ago and hardly ever played with it. Same with her 2 year old sister. I am hoping that my 7 month old son will but I am doubting it. It just never captured their interest. There are definitely BETTER products out there which can teach ABCs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun while learning and provides break time for parents","review":"This is one of the few toys that intrigues our son (11 months) enough to keep his attention for extended periods. He spins the ball, loves the music and can sit with this toy by himself and self entertain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchasing this for my own baby","review":"My SIL has this toy for her 7 month old baby who I watch one day a week. Her daughter absolutely LOVES this toy, and it has really encouraged her to become more active and mobile. She is sitting up for longer periods of time so that she can play with it, and she is trying so hard to crawl, rocking back and forth on all fours, to try and get to it when it rolls away from her. I love the fact that it comes completely with 26 different songs! Most toys offer only a few, and this one offers many. I also love the fact that developmentally, it can be used as baby gets older to learn the letter names and sounds. I am putting it on my own baby registry."},{"rating":"2","title":"7-month-old loves it","review":"Our son is 7 months and loves things that he can spin, which is why we got him this. Balls that roll away are no good as he's not really crawling. I am glad to see it does come off the stand, though it is definitely too heavy to throw! He learned very quickly that the song stops when he doesn't spin it, and he'll spin it again. He doesn't play with it for long, but it's good for a few minutes at a time, and I love that it's small enough to take upstairs and set in his crib with him while I brush my teeth or carry to another room to play. I don't expect any of these toys to make him a genius, but it doesn't hurt to reinforce alphabet lessons. Contrary to what other reviewers say, he is easily able to get it to say a letter by pressing that letter. Not that he is doing it on purpose, but he can do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter Loves Moms can stand","review":"My daughter recieved this for her 1st Birthday and has not stopped playing with it.

When we first bought this toy we took him toy shopping about 6 months old. I put this toy in front of him and he started playing with it if I put it back he got mad.

He likes hearing it and seeing it light up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun from 6 months+ - Good teaching","review":"My son got this for a gift when he was 9 months old. He loved it then and immediately knew to spin to hear the sounds. Now at 11 months he is starting to mimic the ABC song and knows when to spin so that the music will continue. The volume control is great and I know the phonics and letter names will be something he will use later. A great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainer","review":"Get this ball especially if your child is above-average intelligence.

Definitely one of Leapfrogs neatest inventions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume is too loud","review":"My daughter received this for her first Christmas. The songs the ball plays are great, but they don't last that long, especially if the ball is moved mid-stream. The volume control I thought would be a good thing, but it turns out it doesn't lower the volume enough--it is still very loud! I don't see how this can captivate a child long enough to be of any educational value."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too exciting","review":"This toy didn't keep the attention of either of my kids. The letters on the ball are way too small (and hard) for little fingers to press correctly in order to hear the letter sounds/songs. It also calls you back to play by chiming out a little ditty. This is enough to drive you crazy. When the child is done playing (which is rather quickly) it will do this little song, over and over. Also it is way too heavy to be off the sttionary platform. A kid can roll it, but watch out! Don't use too much power (this is reasonable with an adult or a baby, not so much with a two year old)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my favorite","review":"While the toy is \\"Educational\\" sings alphabet, and plays soft but catchy music not to annoying for parents, the base after time doesnt keep the ball secure.The ball is heavy, and will come apart after a fair amount of play. When your child learns to THROW, you will want to hide this. Its heavy and it hurts when it hits you.When the ball seperates as if you were changing batteries and it will, the plastic edges are a tad but sharp.I do not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"We wish we wouldn't have wasted our money.","review":"We purchased this toy to entertain our 9 mo. old.

But, it doesn't matter what song you pick, the second the ball moves at all it switches back to it's regular song. It's nearly impossible for a 2 year old to understand that once they pick the song, they can't touch the ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing and Frustrating Toy.","review":"I bought this toy for my 8-month-old daughter. Right away we discovered the most rediculous feature imaginable in a toy: namely, that in \\"music\\" mode, when the child pushes one of the letters that plays a new song, the child then naturally wants to spin the ball-- but doing so makes the song stop! The toy then reverts to one of 2 intensely boring melodies. For a child as young as mine who can spin the ball well but has difficulty pressing the letters, the toy only plays a couple of dull songs-- not much incentive to play with the toy. For a somewhat older child who CAN press the letters, there is a different tune for each letter-- but the tune stops as soon as you spin the ball! So, the child is punished for spinning the ball! I HATE this toy. In order for my daughter to hear a song, I have to prevent her from spinning the ball, and hold it still. More like punishment than fun. She has entirely stopped wanting to play with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Dont bother with this ostrich. The one I received had been incorrectly stitched together.

Who is spending [the money] on a Gumby set, the casual shopper... or those who fondly remember the quirky look, feel and SOUND of theshow, and want exactly that in a compiled set? With all the information a DVD can hold, they could have made the new sountrack an option, switchable in the menu.

Unfortunately, the impressive orchestral soundtrack and timeless sound effects have been replaced with cheap-sounding \\"modern\\" imitations. The voices are not original either, but they are much closer to the original soundtrack then the music or sound effects. Truly a large disappointment to anyone who has ever seen the originals. The \\"A GUMBY ADVENTURE\\" introductions were all removed too, replaced with a greasy-looking Pokey announcing \\"Hey kids, here's another GUMBY!\\" So sad. It could have been glorious if they just left it alone, and released the classic original versions as-is. Recommendation to buyers: Pass, until a truly \\"ALL ORIGINAL GUMBY\\" is released.

Also, some dialogue had been added and/or replaced, as well as, what I could tell, new SFX.I've been sad and disappointed all day. I'm not displeased that they released the Gumby shorts, and I'm not displeased with the packaging or the extras. But I am displeased that they would replace most of the original audio.Like previous reviewer Rick said, I can't watch the shorts. I just can't. It's not the same.

I guess I would never in my wildest dreams imagine that Rhino would screw up so badly, and mis-lead (by mentioning nothing) so severely. It's true that finding these treasures so de-faced can cause severe depression and feelings of being betrayed in a middle-aged collector. The fact that they managed to collect almost all the cartoons and the art pieces in one box is impressive and admirable -- but the nauseating scores and re-dubbed voices make it almost impossible to maintain the gratitude.

The beautiful, eerie, awe-inspiring soundtrack that included original compositions, all sort of innovative sound effects, and the great character voices have been replaced with a modern \\"Barney\\" mix.

Not the perfect package for reliving childhood memories (if you're old enough to have seen the original broadcasts) but perfectly adequate for showing today's kids and entertaining them hugely. The sly square/hip wit is still intact, and the synthesizer score is not nearly as bad as it could be. The material itself holds considerable charms, especially when the characters shut up and surreal events unfold.

What galls me (in addition to the mere fact that they would dare release these treasures in this format in the first place) is the marketing which makes NO MENTION of the rotten synthesizer musak and the chopped up episodes.

To make a long story short the only option you have is volume control and balance, nothing else.Another problem is that I find I cannot wear the headset for long periods of time as there is a lot of pressure on the head.

His moderate stance towards the Arabs sets him apart from most of the Jews and when his homosexual feelings for a young Arab boy comes to light and then Dr Vriendt's sudden murder, Palestine becomes a melting pot of accusations between the Arabs and Jews as to the identity of the killer. Irmin, an officer in the British security service, investigates the murder, and the complexity of the situation in Jerusalem becomes increasingly intriguing as the Reader follows the investigation and learns of the various different factions' interests.This book should have a wider readership as it gives a very balanced overview of the situation in Palestine in 1929."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash Gordon of the 21st century","review":"While this series was on I enjoyed the wildly Alien species from puppets to strange blue make up and rubber masks.The acting is B movie with a British accent and the sets are well donebut you know the shots are studio.This series is sort of Flash Gordon up dated with imagination?The end of \\"Family Ties\\" is a classic serial \\"cliff hanger\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Silly episodes","review":"The DVD's are well coordinated and the menus are easy to follow.

In fact I bought this book first and then Professional JSP and then Web development with JSP. I think this book is the best if you begin Servlet and JSP. I only think the author could spend more time on JSP since JSP is a clear winner over servlet in most cases. But JSP part of this book is enough to get you started.

Not only is it a great book for the subject area that it covers - it also should be used as a textbook for other editors, writers and publishing houses on how to put together a good technology book. The main advantages are that it excludes all superfluous backgruond/marketing lingo. This means that the book is useful and relevant from the first page - rather than the 3rd chapter. This book is rather let down by bad typography and formatting. It could have been made to look easier on the eye - giving it the initial mpression of a dense techie book. Don't let that put you off, persevere - and you will find the content loaded with insights, pointers to be aware about, and a natural flair for good teaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used the database connection pooling","review":"Great book.

It's a great way to get involved into different concepts and applications concerning Java, at which time you might want to supplement your chosen area with a book totally devoted to that area; one that covers all the nitty-gritty details.But what I like most about Mr. Hall's books is the numerous examples that are easily used in other applications. Much of this code can be used as the foundation for building very nice larger applications, and it's a lot easier for me to have the beginning pieces completed and just build upon them. I've found this to be true in both of Mr. Hall's books moreso than any other books I've read/owned.

The book is huge, and it's overfollowing with pictures of all kinds of Tiki collectables. The book focuses on mugs, with tons of great photos of an extensive selection, and is a must-have if you're an eBay Tiki collector as an unoffical collectors guide.I'm equally impressed with the pages and pages of other tiki collectables. Lanterns, decanters, postcards, swizzle sticks, matchbooks, dinnerware and more. There's a lot of variety here.

We have tried several times pulling it along the floor and making it count for him, but he still pushes it away and says \\"NO\\". We think he does not like it because it moves weird and it really does not \\"do\\" much. You push the feet and you can count, but it really is not his cup of tea!

Kaplan provided its usual engaging and well-organized style to the book; however, the book really lacked the information I was wanting. Most of the information covered in the book is pretty basic for anyone has entered an undergraduate college in the past 7 years. The example personal statements are awful. The critiques of the essays are shortsighted and overlook rather large errors. The book is commendable though on how it provides specifis chapters for certain professions (ie. social work) and students with special needs. Nonetheless, the book did not even mention my area of interest (religious studies).

You would think that Red Sun would provide a remastered version or at least a widescreen version of this movie.

I left some of them on the counter and stepped back to watch the magic. She sniffed it and RAN. Then I tried crushing it into a powder and added a small amount to her food.

I'm not saying that this book won't appeal to 9-year-olds (I wasn't very discerning at that age either), but there are many better alternatives out there for this age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Dead","review":"Without doubt not up to any standards. The writing is sloppy. Poor or absent logic. I can not really recommend it.Graphic violence for violence's sake and not as part of the story. Who cares if a spider is enjoying herself sucking out fly juice? Even Stephen King makes sure that his writing is just in the realm of reality; that is what makes it scary.In \\"The Spiderwick Chronicles\\" the characters are likeable or at least better fleshed out. They do not just rattle around for the sake of adding more pages to the book.Do not assume the Lemony Snicket fans would enjoy this either as the story has no redeeming value. The biggest faux pas of all is assuming that the reader is so computer illiterate they would not notice the technology is lacking and the author is only using buzzwords.I could go on and on about what makes for an interesting tale, however you get the idea that this series does not contain the \\"magic.\\" It is \\"Pure Dead\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Dead Magic","review":"I loved this book. It was funny and thrilling at the same time. A giant spider, 13 rats in a computer, a baby lost on the internet, a drunk mother, a thug in a bunny suit, a kidnapped father, a witch nanny, and a dragon are some of the many things in this book. I also reccomend Pure Dead Wicked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Magic Equals Humor","review":"Imagine this: you are one of the three children of the Strega-Borgia family: Titus, Pandora, or Baby Damp. Your father has recently \\"vanished\\" and now your mother has to return to Witch's School in order to financially support the family. You and your siblings are being \\"watched\\" by a recently hired nanny, a dragon, and other creatures of the dark. Baby Damp gets lost within the World Wide Web and the lipstick-wearing spider has to rescue him. Later, it is revealed that Mr. Strega-Borgia was kidnapped by his evil brother, because he wants the family inheritance. The simplistic plot is adorned by tongue-in-cheek humor that children ages 9 and up would think is hilarious. More pure dead humor is on the way from this author as this tale continues in a trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"I am so glad to have \\"discovered\\" Pure Dead Magic and it's sequel, Pure Dead Wicked by Deb Gliori. I have been recommending them to everyone who will listen! A delightful combination of the elements of the Harry Potter books, the Lemony Snicket books and the Artemis Fowl books. Great for both children and adults who love a good fantasy story that is a bit on the irreverent side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step-by-Step Powerpoint","review":"I had not even opened Powerpoint before I bought this book and it took me from ground zero up to detailed editing. It was easy to understand and the 'real world' excercises made learning fun. It was especially helpful to be able to play with presentations, without the fear of damanging or destroying. I will keep the book as a wonderful resource guide. It's definitely geared toward the beginner Powerpoint user. >"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything Except a Life","review":"This is a nice book that's written in such a dry style that it's difficult to finish the book. So you might rush through the pages when you are stuck somewhere but if you thought they could have written it in a more human style, then you are spot on what this book is!Anyway, I use PowerPoint 2003 but this book has a nice coverage of color schemes but nothing like Cutting Edge PowerPoint for Dummies. That book covers PowerPoint 2000, 2002, and 2003."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Oldfield's 3 best albums","review":"Many people rate Ommadawn close to or better than the classis Tubular Bells. No wonder, as it's a wonderful complete work which flows nicely from one section to the next. Discussions still rage among my friends whether the a or b side is better. Ommadawn and Amarok are probably to two albums I return to most often, simply because they are so damned well put together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album of Mike Oldfield","review":"\\"Ommadawn\\" is the best album of Mike. If you listen Part 2, near the end, your mind is totally upset. It's magic. There was Tubular Bells, Hergest Ridge, OMMADAWN and...AMAROK. Listen to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk","review":"I can't imagine why I bought this. For over 30 years, Ommadawn has been one of my favourite albums by anyone ever. The remix is self-indulgent in the extreme and shows, yet again, why it's not a good idea to monkey with success. The \\"lost version\\"...? Ho hum, really for completists only. Yes, it gives clear insight into the creation of the album but there's a shock waiting almost at every turn. Sorry, gang, but I wonder why this album was put out at all. Maybe I can't get out of the original mix enough to appreciate what Mike's done here but I don't want to. I love the album as was and this is not going to get a second hearing. It makes me wonder if Mike's well has started to dry up..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as Tubular Bells, but still great","review":"I really enjoyed Tubular Bells, with its constantly changing textures and moods. Ommadawn seems a bit warmer, but at the same time more somber. The happier moments are indeed happier than Tubular Bells, but it never quite reaches the atmosphere of the latter. I would give this five stars, but it isn't quite Tubular Bells."},{"rating":"2","title":"genial simplicity, craftfully arranged","review":"This is probably the best Oldfield album. I put Ommadawn among the greatest pieces of music ever made. I've never heard a tune that is so carefully worked upon through the entire piece. The theme that Ommadawn starts with is the most haunting melody I have ever heard. It's dark and bright at the same time, frightening and aerial, as it gives you shivers of ecstasy when you hear it. The composition is brilliant, compelling, craftful. Puts Oldfield among the greatest composers born A.D. Its base concepts are so simple, yet Oldfield builds unspeakable beauty upon them.There are, certainly, people that won't like this music. It's a matter of listening to nearly every kind of music to appreciate it, maybe. Or maybe it will be more than decades when people will understand that they still find this music new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took Me 35 Years to Discover This","review":"Been listening to two Oldfield albums for 15 years or so, \\"Islands\\" and the Best of \\"Elements\\" CD. Loved both, especially all the songs on best of Elements. Then, in November 2010 I finally decided to go after all the albums highlighted in Elements, starting with Ommadawn. I got the 2000 Remaster. I can't believe it took me so long to discover this. The first couple of times I listened to this I was like \\"ok, this is pretty good...I think I like it\\". After that I was like \\"OMG where have you been all my life!\\" This album is everything it is made out to be. Magnificant all the way through. Especially Part 1. It's like a delicious musical treat with lots of instruments, some hypnotic vocals and some of the most original guitar leads I've every heard. I'm going after most of Mike's albums now. It's like I found musical nirvana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life After Tubular Bells","review":"I never listen before to an other Mike Olfield's CD, and some how I thought he could not have written some thing as good as tubular bells but this is absolutly great, If you like the first one get this one you will not be disapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the signed poster that was shown in the picture","review":"I ordered what I thought was a signed Michael Parkes poster. When it arrived it was a very nice new poster, but wasn't signed as advertised in picture. Very disappointed. Called and was told that I would only get refund of poster not shipping. Figured I'd keep it since I would have had to pay for shipping twice to return it.Seller said that they don't sell signed pieces, that it would have cost much more than what I paid, and they don't have any. I asked who posts the pictures, they said Amazon. Amazon says they get pictures from seller to post.Disappointed that it wasn't signed, but needed poster for project and wasn't willing to pay for shipping two times."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Testament Words by William Barclay","review":"I am very satisfied with my purchase of this particular book. Barclay comes highly recommended and makes for, not only a good read, but he follows a pattern while describing certain Christian docrines. As a matter of fact, I will go as far to recommend W E Vines'Dictionary of OT and NT Words as a companion with Barclay's book so as to broaden the actual meaning of the original Greek language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange and waayyyy too lonnngggg....","review":"The only word to describe this movie is strange. Also, it drags in so many places that you want to fast-forward to the end which is completely anti-climactic and extremely far-fetched.The one and only bright spot in this film is the performance by the villain. He is wonderful in his part, and you get the idea that his talents are being wasted by making this turkey. At times, his acting talents are amazing. The others in the film are mediocre at best. There are better ways to spend a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindnumbing","review":"From begining to end I really felt like this film could have been shot on an old hi-8 cam. Tom Berenger wasnt bad, but neither was he great.. and the rest of the supporting cast felt like half dead fish floundering onscreen for the duration of the film.. in point of fact I dont really think it was their fault..The script, or what their was of it was slow and meandering and never really did have much of a point. Even when Tom's character did some dispicable act, you neither felt shocked nor disgusted or disturbed, but instead it all seemed forced as if the writer could find no other way for the story to progress.Now on to the music, it had those cliche guitar riffs you would catch in a lot of the late 80s early 90s thriller type films, which would be fine.. if this film hadn't been made in 2001.The only real good thing I can say about this movie is that eventually it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE TRY TOM","review":"Over the years, Tom Berenger has shown diversity in his projects, including such films as \\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar,\\" \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Rustler's Rhapsody,\\" and \\"The Substitute.\\" However, in this muddled Canadian venture, Tom works hard to make the film work. While he is convincing in his role as serial killer Eddie, the rest of the cast and the plodding direction/screenplay make all his efforts pointless. Tygh Runyan as Mike is pitifully miscast and doesn't do anything to really make you feel for his character; Rachel Hayward does a little better, but we never really know what makes her tick and the ending is abysmally flat. There's little suspense, and that rests mainly on director's lap; moody scenes of the lighthouse and the bay can't compensate. Could have been and should have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten Tomatoes, Tom!","review":"The jacket on the tape says something like \\"this will keep you guessing.\\" I was guessing that maybe it would make some sense as the plot evolved. However, it de-evolved, sad to say. Gratuitous sex, gory violence, and a very disappointing end. I guess Mr. Berenger was between good movies and used this as a \\"filler.\\" The writers gave him less than nothing to work with, so it's not entirely his fault. What a waste of talent and good looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fusion gone pop","review":"I am sure these guys could do better, considering their musical pedigree. This is no less than a supergroup. But they fail to deliver on this release: the music on this CD is mostly unispired instrumental pop, not unlike Spyro Gyra, and definitely misses the mark as far as fusion is concerned. The production is excellent, or course, and the playing very good, but the composition is flat and colorless, the beat steady 4/4, with very little to distinguish one song from another. The title tracks are pretty cheesy too, and are a good indication of the type of music they represent. A couple of tracks stand out, but overall, not worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muzak for the masses...not typical V.I.","review":"This cd was Steve Smith's venture into Rippingtons and Yellow Jackets territory, I guess looking for the bucks. This is not the Steve Smith fusion with an edge that you are familiar with. Unless you like smooth jazz, Stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great addition to your train table for a toddler","review":"If your toddler loves lights and noise, this is a great item to add to the Brio Fire Station.

Kodak.com says it fits the P850. Barely! I have lenses, battery rechargers and an external flash. There is not enough room for everything. There are velcro strips on the inside of the bag that allow you to move the dividers around which are useless since you can't even move the dividers due to some kind of built-in loops for holding pens or pencils or something of the sort. If I were to put a writing utensil in the loops there would be even LESS room for a camera. My camera makes the dividers bulge outward leaving no room for the first and third compartments."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLDS MY Z740 PLUS!!","review":"I have been looking for the perfect bag for my new camera.

Amazon's price can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to big","review":"This case is recomended for my z7590 but it is way to big, there is enough room in it for three digital cameras and accessories. I knew from experience that Kodak's small bags were to small so I thought this would be perfect but the camera is lost in there. I really don't have much else to carry, just the camera, charger and an extra battery so I am returning mine. I wanted a Kodak bag but they just don't make one the right size.

I just got an EasyShare Z612 and wanted a secure carrying case for an upcoming trip. This size bag was recommended so I bought it. To put it plainly, this bag makes no sense. It has myriad pockets, pouches, dividers and sleeves - all of which are either too big or too small for the camera accessories. I then tried several configurations with the adjustable dividers (a Velcro nightmare) and never could devise a fit that didn't leave the camera either floating around in space or crushed. This bag securely holds nothing. All I wanted to carry was the camera, the charger, an extra battery and maybe the manual; yet even with this bags considerable bulk it couldn't handle it. The bag is trying to be All-Purpose and ends up serving none at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new camera bag","review":"This is a great compact and well made bag.

It was about a boy(the narrator) who was Harris' cousin, who came over for the summer. The book could have been a bit better, like Gary Paulsens other books. I also thought the book was a bit funny because of the part where they broke the gun and Harris did it, but the narrator got blamed for it.

Gary does not want to do all of these things but Harris gets he to say okay.Read this book and find out what dumb thing they do next.To tell you the truth I would rate this book a lot more than just 5 but that is all the higher I can go.

I mean only one person put 4 stars and the rest were 5 stars! Now by the looks of that i think that's a good book. Our class in St. Stanislaus tri-parish school just got done reading it!

They live on a farm, out in the middle of nowhere, and the young boy has to learn the ways of the farm, and adjust to his new family. This book will definitely keep you reading.

GARY PAULSENS BEST BOOK!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HARRIS AND ME","review":"This book was not as great as it sounded. It was said in other book reviews that this book was funny and adventerous. But after I read the whole thing, it was not. Sure some parts were funny like when HARRIS went to the bathroom on the electric line. But the plot was still dull. Each chapter was even more boring than the one before it. All it's really about is a boy who goes to live with his Aunt and Uncle and spends some time with his cousin HARRIS and other friends of the family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropiate for young adults","review":"I would not want my children to read this book.

Words to describe \\"The Yin and the Yout\\" are \\"Rich,\\" \\"diverse,\\" \\"deep,\\" and \\"varied.\\" There is a great mixture of styles including tribal (African or Native American, I'm not sure which one), fusion, and Avant Garde. Some of the recordings are a little bit too radical for my tame tastes (a lot of modern-sounding dissonant kind of stuff). However, all-in-all, it comes pretty close to a timeless masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"roller defenser","review":"this blade amazes me it is so good dont pay attention to the 16 stars its practicaly invincible although its a big hassle to build its worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"yay i love my bayblade ^.^","review":"i got this last week and my first day i was beting all my frinds with it. it did not look like much whin i first put it together and yes it is my firt blade but whin i pulld the ripcord it flew in to a wall and made a hole in the wall! now i was in big truble for that one -.- but you shoold git its one its reely cool o-ya and if you wont to talk to me about anime or bayblades my neopets yousere name is san2000221 (im a girl)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous Set","review":"Dec.7/03PJ Peake: (Nickname Bobbie)I have this set and it is great!!

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dark and unknown world of procrastination, revealed.","review":"I believe Dr. Sapadin does an excellant job of explaining and bringing to light the world of procrastinators. I feel this book is of good quality, but in my case, it did not help me to overcome my own problem of procratination. She tells many stories of successes, but for me, it wasn't even close to a tie. In all, Dr. Sapadin presents this book in an excellant manner and shows the utmost knowledge and understanding of the subject. For others, this book may be a great help of which one has a risk they can not afford not to take in reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the music, it's the editing!!!!","review":"First, the actual title is \\"Live In Japan\\".

We cannot forget the hero of the right wingers, Strom Thurmond, who shamefully attempted to take down Thurgood Marshall. Thurmond tormented Marshall with sixty arcane legal questions and grilled him on three Reoncstruction era Amendments. As head of the Judiciary Committee, Thurmond also blocked the nomination of Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren.Those Republicans who attempt to argue that the Bork nomination began the era of bad feelings and nasty tactics have short memories and are shameless false fact revisionists."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful layout, full of incredible inspirational media art","review":"I just picked this book up in NY and I'm blown away. Every time I eye it on my shelf I have to stop what I'm doing and pull it out, sit on the floor, and pour over the pages... This is wonderful art for the generation X/Y age group. Not to cram too many buzzwords into this review, but this stuff really is on the edge... it's out there... I'll be a happy man is this is the direction the art world takes in the next few years...This book takes an empty approach to design... lots of white and black space with strange freeze frames of different video and web pieces. Unlike most of the digital art books today, this does not have a companion CD-rom. Thats what makes this book so interesting, is that you have digital moving art, frozen, taken out of context, and put to paper. There's not many books like this, too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool idea, insufficient execution","review":"This should have been a CD-ROM or DVD product.

Not worth buying. Each page features storyboards of various motion graphics commercials/video art (and not even the best motion graphics at that). If I could return it, I'd return it right away. If you're an art student and you're a motion graphics art student, and you're required to buy this book for class, please don't waste your money. You are better off reviewing reels of commercials on company websites and learning from them. The choices of work in this particular book are terrible. The art/color is very mediocre and most seemed to have been released in the 1990's. Much of commercials/motion graphics nowadays are very sophisticated and artsy. You'd learn a lot more by watching the commercials on t.v.If you are a student, please save your money for your bus fare/train commuting, or better yet save it as lunch money."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK!","review":"A well-written and graphically documented work on the art of communication design for broadcast and film.

None of these films appear to be remastered. It's a very low quality set of B movies, but with eleven movies at almost 15 hours of playing time for such a low price it's hard to complain.

Presumably, trying to make the on/off switch on the transmitter \\"pretty,\\" they have designed it as a plastic circle that you have to twist to turn on and off (turning it off so you don't have to charge it all the time), the problem is that it is hard to turn, sometimes I can't turn it off or on.

The metal shaft of the comb wasn't aligned with the wooden handle, and the cup-shaped metal at the interface of the handle and the metal comb shaft was loose. The teeth don't line up well, and the comb just doesn't exactly shout \\"quality.\\" This comb reminds me of the junk that came out of Japan after WWII; it is made in China. I will be returning this product to Amazon.I also purchased a similar comb (the Four Paws Pet Comb for Fleas, Item #00117). It is a far better comb with a more comfortable handle. Nicely finished with a well-finished anodized black metal construction, and the handle is more comfortable than that of the Safari comb. The teeth are perfectly straight and perfectly spaced. We use these types of combs to easily remove \\"thatch\\" from our indoor cats' coats, not to remove fleas since they have no fleas. The Four Paws' comb shows care in its construction, and the price is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good value","review":"We are very pleased with these binocs.

They do what low-price binoculars should do. You'll be able to see things which are a decent distance away (maybe two city blocks) with relatively good detail, but beyond that things get pretty blurry. Haven't used them for star-gazing or bird-watching, so I'm not really in a position to talk about that.

I wanted something nice and small for concerts but didnt want a piece of junk that I'd hate to look through. These binoc's have a metal focusing plate on top, smooth and tight focusing center-roller, heavy rubber covered lens barrels and they're very light. they have adjustable eye pieces for those with difference prescription eyes/contacts/glasses.

They were nice an snug in there box with packing foam and everything.The next thing I noticed was the weight. They were heavier than I expected which to me meant quality but they are light enough to carry with you all day long. Next the grip felt so nice not at all like a plastic covering you might find on most products at this price range. Last I took a look through the lens and they are so clear. I normally have a problem with most binoculars because I where glasses but that wasn't the case with these. to some it up they are a great buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reflections, haze around edges","review":"I regret taking these along on a trip. White reflections, especially on the right side, block the image and I also see a haze around the edges which further limits the view. Highly annoying to try to see the image past these shortcomings, even at the ten dollar price I paid. As far as I am concerned they are useless at this point. Only one star for the case, which I'll be able to use either for the pair that I hope to find to replace these or for my GPS unit.I purchased these from a local retailer based on my good experience with the Celestron 15x70 binoculars thinking this might also be a good pair in this category at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"These binoculars are fantastic for the price!

I didn't want to mess around with it but I think I'm going to have to buy a new window that will properly accomodate a dryer vent. I think I actually noticed LESS water vapor when I simply used a panty hose footie on the end of the dryer vent. I was shocked beyond belief when I saw the water running down the cement wall & onto the floor. Perhaps I had the device too close to the wall?

The idea behind this is great - the execution - that's another story.The duct is flimsy and tore when trying to attach it to the dryer's vent. The lid clamps are weak and have had pieces break off. Removing the lid to the water well is almost assured of releasing the duct and I've seen stronger ties on a loaf of bread.Now with that being said, if you are trying to vent in a small space without built in ventilation - this seems to be the only game in town.

The only thing that you could say negatively is it looks like the apeture will only stay open for 15 secs. I have been experimenting with night shots and wish it could be longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera, careful about recommended attachments","review":"I love everything about this camera, it's ease of operation, it's great pictures, quick learning curve, everything! EXCEPT, the lense filter mount is not really standard, and requires either an additional expense for a screw mount attachment, which I will not mail order, because I don't wish to order yet another non fitting attachment. When I bought the camera (here, on Amazon), one suggestion (which I agree with) was to get the UV filter, both as filter and as a protection for the lense. The problem is that said recommended filter is a screw mount, and canon, in their greed, has a click mounted thingy, which of course does not work with most accessories not canon made. Kinda like Microsoft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon S5IS","review":"Upgraded to a Canon S5 IS & very pleased with the photos. Easy to operate. Enough pixels to allow you to crop & still have an excellent photo. Macro just as easy to operate. Would recommend even to a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Video Quality!","review":"We initially bought a new video camera but it seemed like with our old one, we didn't use it very often because it was always put away, then we would have to drag it out and charge it before we could use it. We decided to return the video camera and opted for the Canon s5 with photo and video capabilities because we thought we would use it more often due to it's convenience. Boy, am I glad we did! The video quality on this camera is AMAZING! I can't imagine better quality from a dedicated video camera. The zoom is outstanding and the one touch video button is so convenient.It takes wonderful pictures as well. While I've mainly used it on the Auto setting, I love that as I learn more, the camera will grow with me.We got a great deal on several 4mb memory cards through pricewatch so we'll always have room for videos and pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon S5IS Digital Camera","review":"The camera is quite easy to use, especially with the use of dedicated buttons such as the movie and delayed exposure functions. The only problem that I have experienced is with the manuals. In some cases they appear to start in the middle of a process without telling you how to begin. Movie playback comes to mind as one area that I had a hard time with. Still, with patience I have been able to overcome most problems with the manuals. Wonderful camera overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Camera!!","review":"This camera is awesome... it takes wonderfully clear pictures. The 12x optical zoom is more than useful for long distance shots. I have taken several night photos in full Manual mode and got many compliments on the shots. The manuverable LCD screen is also helpful in taking angled shots and still having a clear view of the screen. This camera also has macro and supermacro mode for ultra close ups. I recommend buying this camera from Amazon... fast shipping and good product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"Bought this camera just prior to taking a 3-week trip. Almost no shutter lag, which is important when taking shots of moving objects, like little kids. The image stabalization is unbelievable: Took pictures out the window of a moving bus and many shots inside museums and other places where no flash is allowed. Camera automatically set shutter speed to values such as 1/10 of a second, normally too slow for hand-held shots, but everything came out sharp and clear. Got one blurry shot out of 600+. This may be the best point and shoot on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"S5 IS Powerful piece of technology","review":"This camera seems to do just about everything albeit at a price.ProsLens is very sharp - can actually focus down to a whisker.-Uses 4 AA batteries - a real plus.

Then I took it to Borneo with me to do some wildlife photography. I completed around 20 photos on a new set of batteries, and the camera reported \\"Change the Batteries.\\" So I did. The message would not go away. I tried replacing the batteries with new sets of batteries 4-5 times, all to no avail. When I later traveled to Java, the camera seemed to work normally again. My suspicion is that the humidity in Borneo was just too high for the camera (the user guide says standard operating range for humidity is 10-90), but from now on I cannot rely on this Canon S5-IS to be working when I need it. I must always carry a spare, back-up camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera for the money and then some","review":"This camera is a tough one to knock in any way. Right out of the box it is a pleasure to use. The photos are sharp if taken properly. Now for those who have knocked the fact that the lens cap comes off easily. First of all that is to protect the zoom mechanism. This can be eliminated by purchasing a LA-DC58E Conversion Lens Adapter for the camera. Not only does it allow a better hold on the camera for zooming it also lets you put on a haze or UV filter to protect your lens. A secure 58mm lens cap would then be used to protect the filter and lens. Not much of a big deal for such a fine camera. You would have to pay a great deal more and probably not ever use all the extras that a SLR might have over this camera. Great deal for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Power Shot s5 is","review":"it is an over all great camera for people starting off in photography but the one down part is the lens cap. it does not stay on that well and i wish they would make one that stays on great, other than that it is an amazing camera"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic digital camera","review":"This is a very easy to use camera.

Canon has a Loyalty program and sell me a refubished camera at a discounted price. I just don't know if I ever want another Canon. Which is kind of sad.

It takes great pictures, the controls are very easy to figure out but spending a few minutes with the manual is a good idea. I like the way it feels and where the position of the zoom and shutter are located. At the highest resolution, file sizes have been between 3.5 and 4.5 meg. The digital zoom is great - I used it at my son's baseball game and was able to zoom in on an outfielder and get some great shots. Redeye only works in portrait mode - not auto mode (unless I just haven't found the right setting). Flash doesn't automatically pop up when you need it but it will display an icon when you need it. That auto-pop is really the only thing I wish it had. LOVE that the lcd swings out and swivels. This is overall a GREAT camera for those who want something better than your average point and shoot but don't want to spend the $ for the SLR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can be use both as camera and camcorder","review":"This camera can be used as a video camera with the zoom and focus all functional. Though most camera can take video, the zoom is not function that makes them not very useful. Very few camera can fully functional as both camera and camcorder. This is the perfect camera to do both. I do not need to buy a camcorder any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon S5IS and PSC-75 case","review":"The S5IS camera is everything I expected from a Canon product. It is straight forward, easy to use and produces great pictures. Having more features than a simple \\"point and shoot\\" camera does introduce a bit of a learning curve which is to be expected. Like many people, I go to the instruction manual only when all else fails. The manual is good; however, memory card capabilities are not very well explained.Since most of my pictures are of travel and vacation, they end up on a CD for showing on a TV set. Wow do they look great on a new widescreen set!The PSC-75 soft case I purchased at the same time is a major disappointment. The case is too small. It closes with just the camera. With the neck strap attached to the camera and a spare memory card, it doesn't close completely and the zippers tend to creap open. Far better third-party cases that will also hold a spare set of batteries are available for about the same cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Camera I Ever Owned","review":"I bought this camera for my wife.

I used it in various different situations - to shoot fireworks, aquariums, macro and super macro shots, outdoor as well as indoor scenaries and portraits.Very nice for super macro shots. Properly focused pictures when my camera lens was almost touching the objects.Though I find it a bit bulky, but worth the bulk if you want good zoom.

Last year, on my annual trip to thoroughbred racing in Saratoga I decided to travel light and left my Nikon equipment at home. All the photographs I took there with this Canon Powershot were equally as good as and, in several cases, better than those taken in previous years with my Nikon equipment. My most recent test has been photographing wildlife (deer and birds e.g.) and once again the results have been superb. I am now seriously considering getting the SX20IS just in case I lose or damage my S5IS. I have examined an SX30IS but don't believe it is as good as earlier models."},{"rating":"1","title":"What good is a camera that doesn't work?","review":"Canon is still manufacturing flawed cameras that will fail many people shortly after the warranty has expired. This has been an ongoing problem since the Powershot S1 IS, but Canon refuses to acknowledge the problem or even fix it out of warranty.The camera will not doubt get many good reviews. It has many good things going for it. Good layout and takes good pics. As long as you pay the ransom of $120 to get it fixed, with no guarantee that the problem will not return, or just spend another $400-$500 on their latest/greatest camera you will be able to keep taking these good pics.Buyer Beware!I was one of the ones burned by the manufacturing flaw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Pictures","review":"Takes horrible pictures.

I do professional photography and typically use a DSLR that was quite costly and of course not the kind of thing you can throw in your purse. This is a great camera to keep on hand for impromptu family events, or just have around the house. It has a point and shoot option, but also allows the photographer to control the settings as they would with a much more expensive camera. I would highly recommend also purchasing an external flash as the quality of your pictures will be noticeably improved. The only downside I have noticed is having to get used to the automatic focusing, but that is certainly manageable. Great great camera!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deployed camera man","review":"The camera seems good, I am currently deployed in Kosovo. I feel that the video imaging lacks some clarity. I can get blurred images unless I put it on the sport shots. The zoom is great on the standard zoom, once you get to the digital zoom it startd to pixelate. I can zoom quite well with the regular zoom to distances of a mile or more and use it for reports to higher ups.I feel that the camera once the extras are purchased is well worth the price paid. I strongly recommend the larger SD card for the camera. Pay for the better card as the pictures that the camera is capable of will merit the larger images for future use.For being a larger camera, it still does alot of stuff that you would expect in a much more expensive unit.SSG Marc Johannes,Kosovo 2008-2009"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mega-zoomonly lacking a few things","review":"Previously we had owned a Canon Powershot G series camera. We decided to switch to the S series because of the extended zoom, image stabilization, and improved video recording. We have not upset with our choice. The S5 has handled nicely, taking great pictures and being very quick. This had been a minor drawback with our G series camera. The addition of a hotshoe is a nice bonus. Too often I need som flash fill at a greater distance than 9'.If I have one complaint it would be that I wish this camera took RAW pictures.

I loved using my A520 but it didn't have any zoom capabilities and would blur a good bit of the time when it wasn't in the Auto mode.

No going back and changing your mind. The software is not programed that way. I did not read this until too late and now I'm stuck with a program that I DO NOT LIKE.

The problem I am finding is that the device does not always focus on the target. I see it go through the range and go in and the out of focus. Then lock into the image, but it would be out of focus. Several tries gets different results, but none right. The only option is to manually focus or change. I tried both face detection and center focus with no avail.Overall I am very pleased with the movie quality and picute quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Near This One...","review":"This album is horrible! the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it's a tribute to Iron Maiden.The diffrent artists in this album completely ruined the classic Iron Maiden's tracks...

Not only does it fit Kodak cameras, but many others as well. Sufficient room in the front pocket for your USB cables, AV cables, etc. When you open the bag there is a small zippered pocket inside that easily holds your memory cards or rechargeable batteries. The carry-on strap is very useful as well.This camera bag is sturdy, lightweight and protects your camera and accessories quite nicely. A must-have for traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camera Bag","review":"The camera bag was bigger than I thought, but it has a lot of compartments to put your manual in, extra battery, battery charger. I really like it, and it has a shoulder strap also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky and Awkward","review":"This camera bag does a good job of protecting the camera, and carrying spare batteries and even a rechargeable battery pack charger. If you carry it with the strap on your shoulder, you will probably like this bag. If, however, you are like me and desire to carry it on the belt, it is somewhat cumbersome and awkward (i.e, too fat and bulky). Also, the snap at the bottom of the belt loop on the case comes on-done constantly. Since it is a belt loop strap, it won't fall off of you, however, it gets a bit irratating because without the snap done, the case flips back and forth as you walk too easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a small bag","review":"The item description is misleading (the \\"small\\" part.) I have the Kodak V530, which is a very, very small digital camera. We were expecting a camera bag that would fit the camera. The camera fits in the front pocket of the camera bag! While it is a very nice camera bag, it's way too big to stick in your pocket or your purse. One bonus is that if you are travelling and want to take the charging dock with you, the charging dock for the V530 will fit in the big compartment. If you're looking for a small bag for a small digital camera, this is not the bag for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"This is a very bulky product.

It has plenty of room for your camera, your connection cable, extra batteries and a small compartment on the top of the cover for an additional memory card. With all of these things we even included a small tripod and everything fit perfectly. I re-purchased this particular camera because it takes such wonderful pictures. My original camera was dropped down a flight of stairs when I was carrying it into my apartment. I know if I had had one of these camera cases I wouldn't have had to replace it.

The singers sound distant and the orchestra is not balanced. I cannot make any judgement as to how the singers and orchestra are performing, as it would be unfair to do so.A complete waste of money. Consider instead:Gheorghiu/Alagna (the most polished; Alagna is exceptional)orMoffo/Barioni (I like Moffo, although some of the other singers have pitch and/or technical problems occasionally)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book defines madness...","review":"First of all, I don't understand why this guy isn't that popular (at least in the USA)! His sense of humour is unlike anything you would have ever read in your life. Laced with witty humour, brilliant use of words and insane ideas, his plots keep getting better and better with successive novels. However, this one remains a classic to the very end. Its about Hugo Rune and all his crazy theories about life (well, at least the life of a screw!). I sometimes wonder how this guy's mind works...I mean, first of all, his plot is incredibly complicated, on top of that, its situational comedy to the very best (forget those stupid sitcoms after reading this...at least I have)Read this one and expand your mind! And the ending of this book is...well, MINDBLOWING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugo Rune... an extraordiary man","review":"I read this book once and laughed out loud. I read this book twice and had a giggly fit. I lent it to my Grandma and she didn't give it back.Robert Rankin is a master wordsman and his books never fail to deliver. The Book of Ultimate Truths is mentioned in other books of his, and Hugo Rune is in every book. This is truly wonderful - the extracts from TBOUT are really clever and makes me wish that I'd realised that first. An extremely funny book (in case you hadn't gotten the message by now) that EVERYONE should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meet Cornelius Murphy! Learn about Ultimate Truths!","review":"If you like Douglas Adams you'll probably like Robert Rankin because his anarchic, surreal humour matches the Hitch-Hikers style very well.Follow the hero (Cornelius Murphy) and his sidekick (Tuppe) as they search for the missing chapters of the Book Of Ultimate Truths. You'll meet an Uncanny Scot, a strange lady in a straw hat, some dubious monks and numerous other delightfully bizarre characters.The plot moves swiftly and the jokes come thick and fast with every turn of the page. I highly recommend this book, but I've only scored it 8 out of 10 due to the slightly narrow nature of the humour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to see this on Kindle","review":"If you've read any Robert Rankin, you don't really need this review.I enjoyed the Cornelius and Tuppe series, and it is nice to seem them available for the Kindle.

No wonder he is hitting the spike!Anyways, the movie is bad. I am not sure if it is the bad acting or the bad plot. There are a few good scenes that made me want to watch the movie further.It is very predictable. Very annoying. Very bad.Priscilla Barnes (Terry from Threes Company) plays on it, that was almsot worth watching the movie...See it anyways if you want to wate some time. Perhaps you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BARNES IS NOBLE","review":"Okay, this movie is really, really bad....most of the acting is unbelievably horrid; the script is derivative and ludicrous (they even steal a murder right out of the original Friday the 13th), and the writer obviously thinks the F word needs to be in every other sentence; the girls are breasty to say the least, but bimbos one and all. Even Corey Haim, virtually unrecognizable, is wasted. In spite of some pretty funny references to slasher movies and such, this movie is far down on the horror food chain. Except for..and here's what's funny...Priscilla Barnes as the bitchy band manager (looking nothing like the model she once was) is outstandingly hammy and cool; she obviously was having a good time. And Charles Fleischer as the flaming video director delivers many unbelievable lines with a strength and beauty only a true professional could muster.But, folks, rent it...don't buy it like I Did!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's in there","review":"Even Now takes a hard look at the darker side of female friendships, and the way childhood allegiances and competition and betrayals between girls extend into adulthood. The author states it best when she says \\"Every woman has a Daintry in their lives.\\" (And if you didn't, you probably were a Daintry.) It's also a story of mother-daughter relationships, and the way predictability and routine work their own kind of devastation in even happy marriages. Kelly is best at bittersweet situations -- wanting what you can't or shouldn't have -- and the details of domestic life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Packer Backer Shrine","review":"This to me is maybe the Packer Team Of The Ages. It doesn't get any better than these guys. The plaque is well designed, well made, has a beautiful photo, excellent protection to ensure the photo will not get damaged. The price is right also. For a serious Packer Backer(I am sort of)and especially one who does not live in the shadow of Lambeau Field...this is a must. I can pay homage anytime I want to all the Packer greats of the Lombardi era. You can't go wrong buying this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality revenge? .... More like: quality rock songs","review":"This album features more angular guitar work, amazing drumming (think: Dave Grohl), interesting lyrics, tons of melody and a highly produced vocal treatment that all adds up to great power-pop rock. The songs are tight (checking in at about 4 minutes each) and upbeat rockers with layers. The more you listen to these tracks, the more you hear in the music. Try this album with a good set of headphones - you'll see what I mean.This is not indie or emo. It is polished, super-catchy rock cut from the cloth of Foo Fighters & Nada Surf - not bad company at all. Highlight tracks include: Unorchestrated, Police Police Me, Oh Penny and The Switch. Really, the second half of the album is excellent. I would highly recommend this album to listeners who enjoy bands that have the ability to mix loud guitar & drums with melody. Very underrated band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Opportunity","review":"Though you may quarrel with Guaguin tactics or motivations, his art stands alone--brilliant, moving, subtle.

After the first use, my wife hated it. She said that you have to sing over the top of someone else singing the lyrics and that there is a lag in your singing. So, when your singing along with a song your a word or two behind and as anyone who sings knows, that can be very distracting. She said that she would love to return it. But, as with any type of media, once it's open they will only replace it. I've never used it, but she's a karaoke Queen and I trust her judgement. SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!

Their use on these recordings is a delight.I would also add that Johnny Prophet -- a name as true to life as Johnny Rocket -- is a revelation...Especially in the KISS ME, KATE section. The arrangement of WERE THINE THAT SPECIAL FACE is magnificent, penned by an arranger's arranger. (Note that well, Billy and Nelson!).

A riveting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delirious and Dark","review":"Kent Harrington's \\"Dia de los Muertos\\" is a deliriously dark and nasty hard boiled crime novel with an anti-hero (DEA agent Vincent Calhoun) who is hard to like but easy to root for. Set in Tijuana and taking place over the course of little more than a day, the novel chronicles Calhoun's rapid descent into chaos and his desperate grasp for redemption as his world closes in on him from all sides. The sleazy atmosphere of Tijuana is palpable and the secondary characters are vividly rendered. It is an exciting and disturbing ride. My only quibble is that at times the plotting tested the limits of my ability to suspend disbelief, largely because it undermined the gritty and realistic atmosphere that pervaded the novel as a whole. After reading this I will be searching out more of Harrington's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short But Dull","review":"Mrs. Madeleine Bridgeport and her three children have perfect lives--they're rich, attractive, bright, and energetic. But all of that changes when Mrs. Bridgeport's homely, lifeless niece (Wilma) comes to visit for a couple weeks and has a contagious effect on everyone. At first, you want to feel sorry for Wilma, but after a while of her lethargy, even the reader feels dulled by her. The one good thing about this book, though, is that it's short (128 pages). Yet it still took me a bit longer than I had expected to finish it. The ending isn't very satisfying either, but at least it's not too predictable.This certainly isn't a book I'd recommend, but if you like short, quiet horror with more atmosphere (fog, dark rooms, nocturnal noises, a broken grandfather clock that only functions at night) than blood and violence, then you might like \\"When Midnight Comes...\\" by Carol Beach York."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, comfortable shoes, even to wide feet","review":"The shoes are comfortable, I've use them a couple of times now, but don't now if they will last many games, the material made with looks cheap.

Unoriginality should never be praised, but is it really a glaring flaw? All bands can have their sounds traced back to their various influences. Winter... just doesn't go to any extent to hide their roots. In Solitary Winter Night, raw skeletal minimalism runs rampant under a bleak and melancholic, Burzumesque haze. The trem picking finds its strength in repetition, but more important, Winter... actually captures that oldschool magic that turns a subtle change of melody into the audial essence of dogmatic upheaval.

When the mother's breast was shown, it looked like she had a breast enhancement and then they zoomed in on them. Then, the bedroom scene was inappropriate for children. Even the dialog was too much. Instead of this movie, I would recommend the \\"God's Design for Sex\\" book series. It's very informative, purposeful and in good taste.

I was so horrified I could not even get up to turn it off. They zoomed in on the womens breasts, showed a cartoon baby suckling from them and the sex seen with the tickling sensation talk went on for ever monopolizing the video much more then the book.

There's the ever present red eye problem, which is to be expected, but the flash is so powerful that any subject closer than 10 ft gets washed out.I spent a lot of time making my decision to buy the Sony vs the Canon and resisted a last minute temptation to buy a digital body for my SLR lenses.

Within 3 months, it maintained a close connection (always on). Several months later, it blew the circuit that it was on. The latter condition leads me to believe that such a device would be dangerous on certain boxes, especially those homes still using fuses, or ITE breakers. Until Intermatic recognizes this and corrects the design flaw, caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"switch, not so good","review":"We had 2 of these before. They work fine, but this one, has been a pain. We have tried programming it over and over. It turns on fine, but never turns off, we have to switch it off ourselves. Unfortunately, we didn't get it installed before the time to return had run out, so we are stuck with a half working switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So good","review":"This product is operating as advertised. Turns on and off as programmed. Easy to install, easy to program."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK so far","review":"Been using this for about six weeks now and it seems to be working fine. Installation was a bit of a chore because my existing switch box was too shallow and I had to find an extender, as I didn't want to change the box. The result sticks out from the wall about an inch and looks a little clunkier than it could. Programming was not as difficult as some reviews suggest, maybe because I used the dusk-dawn default. Hope it lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wall swicth with timer","review":"It is the programatic wall switch with timer I am looking for. This timer controls on and off with mecanical switch is relay. You are able to hear the sound. It means, 100% sure to cut the circuit. :-)The document is not clear how to program but the 40 set of on and off is very nice and it can be replaced the current wall switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Installation a little tricky, but worth it...","review":"The size of the switch is a little daunting when trying to install, especially when installing into a box with a three- or four-way switch. The main point is to be very careful with tucking all wires away to enlarge the space you have to work. Once installed, the features of the new and improved version of this timer \\"shine\\" as the auto dusk/dawn setting really works well. Highly recommended, as this version improves upon the spotty record of the SS7 version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great timer, would definitely purchase again","review":"Purchased this product for two light fixtures illuminating my driveway. I wanted to switch the bulbs in these fixtures from incandescent to fluorescent bulbs and I had read that some of these switches do not work well with fluorescent bulbs.I took a chance and ordered this switch and I am very happy with it. The installation isn't too bad if you are comfortable with electrical. It was a little tricky to program and the instructions were not totally clear (hence the 4 star rating) but after some trial and error, I had it programmed correctly.Now my driveway is illuminated at dusk and shuts off at dawn automatically. I replaced two 60 watt bulbs with two 100 watt equivalent fluorescent bulbs that use only 46 watts combined. It is much brighter and I feel good about saving energy and $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give the Intermatic switch a negative score, I would","review":"Be warned, the Intermatic automatic switches are low quality and WILL break / freeze up. I've owned three now, and as a previous poster said, they last about a year. I've gotten about eight months of use with the previous two that failed. Now I'm on number three, and it too has just failed. I'm done with Intermatic switches. There are other options out there, and believe me, they can't get any worse than Intermatic. I should be able to give this item negative 5 stars for the frustration it has caused me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermatic Switches Break Down, Hard to Program","review":"Please read the 1-star reviews to see that Intermatic has problems with the units breaking down after time. I'm about to order my 4th unit in 5 years, because my 3rd unit just stopped working after 2 years (which is longer than my previous ones lasted). It's particularly annoying that the unit has a \\"NoOp\\" message, basically telling you it's time to buy a new one. I've grown to hate seeing that message. I kind of hate this company for producing a product that fails so frequently, but I still may order another one because I haven't found another option. I will do a little more searching after I finish this review.Also, these Intermatic switch timers are definitely not easy to program, and I can understand why some people never figure out how to set them up.On the pro side, the auto settings that account for sunrise and sunset work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronic Lights Control","review":"I bought this to replace an older Intermatic controller. The old one finally gave out after about 5 or 6 years, and I couldn't find the same model...evidently discontinued. I found this one on another website, and located it on Amazon.

Spent the most time trying to figure out what circuit controlled the outlet. The unit goes in with very little effort. Programming was not \\"difficult\\" but was a bit involved to get all the different settings I wanted. It takes some time, and some thought on what you are doing, but is not impossible. Does make an audible \\"click\\" when turning lights on and off, but this is neccessary in order to control lights other than standard incandescents. Some reviewers were mentioning that they astronomical feature was not working well. To fix this you should enter the time when it begins to get dark, not the actual Sunset time. I have had no issues with this feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost excellent product","review":"The product is well constructed, easy to install, and works fine.

One of the two needed the battery replaced which I did a month ago with a new fully charged battery and it has died already.

The replacement unit that I picked up was the Intermatic Model ST01 series. The engineers had redesigned the unit to use a camera battery (CR-2) instead of the previous models AAA batteries. Bad design!!! The CR-2s only last less than two months. I've gone through 4 batteries in about 7 months. They should never have gotten away from the AAA batteries!!! ...I've got to find another timer that uses a different battery design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does just what it says but confusing programming","review":"The timer was not working correctly for me until I figured out what they meant by a \\"program\\". I thought they meant one on/off cycle. Each \\"program\\" is an off or an on. Once that was figured out, it was easy to program.This works just fine with compact fluorescent lights I use in my outside fixtures.It was bit challenging stuffing all wires back into the box because I'm using it with a three way switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Replacement for SS8 Wall Switch Timer","review":"So far, this device is working as advertised. I purchased it as a replacement for the SS8 timer. The SS8 lasted 26 months, and was the 6th device of that type I had purchased from Lowes in a month (in August 2005). The SS8 just failed and failed and failed.The ST01C has been working for a month now. Programming was a little difficult, I actually had to do it twice to get the two programs I wanted into place. My older eyes could use larger display set in the window to designate the mode and stuff.After the month, this product is working just fine. We will see how it does with the new DST rules. It is currently tracking dusk well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really want to like it...","review":"I even replaced it 3 different times. But after 3-6months they just stop working.

The book is well-researched and very complex of plot. I also enjoyed how she very seamlessly wove both historical and fictional characters into the storyline, but I needed one main character with whom I could relate (someone I really liked and could identify with emotionally) to \\"carry\\" me through the story. Sometimes I felt too much afloat among the varied plot lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, compelling, and compassionate: if you like mysteries, you'll love Faye Longchamp","review":"A rivoting mystery about a strong female lead character with a problem: money. The story keeps you turning pages and leaves you satisfied while avoiding caricatures. Yes, Faye is a loner, but what detective worth his or her salt isn't? She's a scofflaw with morals, and her supporting cast is finely and sympathetically drawn.Evans weaves in a multi-generational plantation history of Faye's home, Joyeuse Isle (cleverly named from a Debussy composition), perched on the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast of Florida.Satisifying to feminists, history buffs, those with an interest in archeology and meteorology, and just plain old mystery lovers.The author's background as a scientist, musician, and mom help her create a believable and well developed world full of characters to care about. Fans of Sue Grafton, PD James, and Sara Paretsky will enjoy this book.I can hardly wait to readRelics, Faye's next adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I discovered it earlier this year and have now read four of the books.

This is true for all of the books, just to let you know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Artifacts: A Faye Longchamp Mystery","review":"This was a light suspenseful story and enjoyable easy reading.

I downloaded Artifacts free to my Kindle and I am really glad I did! This story kept me interested and entertained. I enjoyed it enough to pay for the second in the series before I was completely finished with this one then repeated the process until I read them all. These stories were absolutely my cup of tea and I very much loved seeing the growth and life changes the main characters and recurring characters go through. My only regret is that I finished them too fast and now I have to wait until 2013 for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autolite 4162 spark plug","review":"This plug may be the matching no. for the Bosch plug, but it is to wide to fit the cylinder head of a BMW F800 GS.

The \\"lessons\\" are all very basic intuitive business themes that Vince Jr. (or the publisher) has tried to connect with some aspect of his father's personality. Might be good for a school age kid, but any working professional has heard these lessons hundreds of times before. If you are looking for a book on Lombardi, try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Retread of Lombardi Quotes","review":"The Lombardi Rules attempts to provide a philosophical background of Coach Lombardi's beliefs and apply them to life and business. This was written by Vince Lombardi Jr, not the man himself, and although you'd expect his son to also possess many of the inspiring attributes of Coach Lombardi, they are not exhibited in this book. It is essentially a collection of Vince Lombardi quotes turned into 2-3 page chapters. Making matters worse is that the text supporting the quotes ranges from cliche to painfully obvious with nothing profound or meaningful, not even a decent example from Lombardi's illustrious coaching career. Its always frustrating when you could read the chapter headings and gain as much value as the entire book. You would be better served just searching for Vince Lombardi quotes than wasting any time with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Quick Read","review":"Good book, had some interesting stories about Lombardi's early life.

This book is an example of one that my boys really, really like, although to me it's a bit dull and stilted. They love the format, which focuses on one subject with 10 examples for each 2 page spread. The setup is orderly and not overly busy, and I think this really lets them focus.

I was not amused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minimally amusing and only on occasion","review":"I found this collection of jokes about the moods and behaviors of old men to be only slightly amusing at times. Nearly all are based on the grumpy, chauvinistic, extremely opinionated and critical of the wife cliché set that has been so vastly overused.

The use of the 1st person narration made for too much introspection, especially as the relationship between Releanna and J'role was the biggest part of the plot. The Therans being a mix of all different races didn't seem very realistic and there was only one hint of a horror in the entire story (and they are probably the coolest thing about Earth Dawn).

It introduces many possibilities that the storyline MAY have followed, however, the ending is a complete disappointment. Many of the concepts and ideas do not follow through and are left out at the end. You would think that a serious and important event occurred at one point to have some sort of meaning later. Yet, about half of the time, that is not the case. The ending is abrupt and too sudden. Actually, it does not seem like an ending at all. If everything ties up nicely, then the book would have been pleasant to read. I keep expecting that something is going to happen, but nothing does. To simply put it, I am confused and disatisfied.

Listing this particular book as a work of nonfiction does a egregious disservice to authors who have actually done the research or have faithfully recounted their own experiences.

I feel sorry for anyone over 16 who takes this poor buggers' book seriously. I note that quite a few of the previous reviewers gave the book five stars but this book is their only review.

After getting done reading the whole book it left me wanting more there was simply put no conclusion, and the dialog between characters was ridiculous, it was some of the worst writing I have ever read. I will give him props for the action scenes that is when the authors writing was truly superb. King says this book is based on true accounts of his own experiences, which I do not believe, mainly because the whole plot of the book was unbelieveable, especially the part about the far seers."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPOOKY 8 is a big load of hooey.","review":"SPOOKY 8 by Bob King is the latest in a recent blight of testosterone fantasies about supposed covert operators. There's nothing wrong with good trashy pulp fiction, but to label this shoot-em-up as a true story does great dishonor to the real men and women who risked everything for a good cause. Shame on St. Martin's Press and their gullible editors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that even non-reader will like.","review":"Being a middle-aged career woman with children, I don't normally read books of this nature for pleasure (especially books that appear to be meant for men). Well, Spooky 8 is an exception. This is an action-packed, fast-paced book that I had a hard time putting down. The writer brings a level of emotion to his work that I don't normally see in a \\"macho\\" type book. It didn't really make a difference whether it was all true, part true or all made up (I think it's true), but this book make you stop and think about our government and those that are suppose to be in charge. This story is not new but it is emotional and through that emotion, it put me in the character's shoes. I liked to read that people really are afraid in war (unlike other books I've read) and not just emotionless machines. I could tell that a real person wrote this book and I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Word...","review":"Mr. King has put into our hands an incredible work that is impossible to put down. Literally. I read it from cover to cover in a matter of hours. This is one of the best tales I've ever read, but what amazes me most is the point of contention of the \\"relatively few\\" poor reviews of this book. Almost every instance, the contention is that \\"I was there\\" or \\"I really do this\\". BS! Other's try to discredit his work by saying \\"when did the military start issuing HK's?\\" oh Please! Anyone wishing to trash this book over such non-sense or (more likely) because they refuse to believe that this type of thing has in the past & still does happen, has their head buried somewhere, but it's not in the sand! you'll recognize them, they are the ones who each \\"claim\\" to know more about it than the autor and everyone else. If you are not afraid to open your eyes, this is an EXCELLENT read, and if you don't believe this is the reality of the world we live in - WAKE UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spooky 8","review":"This book is an insult to those who have worked within the intelligence and/or the Special Operations community. A work of pure fiction. This book combines fantasy and a disturbing lack of any valid evidence for the authors claims. Reminiscient of Frank Dux work of fiction regarding his \\"employment\\" at the CIA. This piece is obviously an attempt to replace the authors bland personal history much like the large number of imitation Vietnam veterans who claim false combat pedigrees. The publishers should re-evaluate their agreement to publish this as non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Time with Spooky 8","review":"This is the kind of book I promised myself I'd never waste time with; lousy dialogue telling the story of a hot dog writing about all his hot dogging, real or imagined. Typos galore! String them all together and maybe it's a secret code.Here's one unforgettable sample of manly Chance talking to an admiring Sue, found on page 158. \\"I don't know how you do it,\\" she said. \\"Every time I see you, you're always in control. Do you ever get afraid?\\" she asked. \\"Oh, I guess so. I just don't have time to be afraid most of the time,\\" I said with a smile as I drove away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A work of Fiction","review":"Every read Clancy's _Clear and Present Danger_?

Don't waste your money. Buy some fiction that is honest enough to label itself as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense!","review":"An intense thrill-ride of suspense. This book held my attention from start to finish. I liked the refreshing honest writing style, and the obvious emotions that went into the book. I liked that the author admitted his fears and strong emotional ties. It's a nice change from the egomaniacs that are so commonly portrayed in this type of book. I liked that the author left the believing up to the reader and didn't try to shove what he believes to be the truth down our neck. For me, I believe this story and I'm sure what he writes is only the tip of the government iceberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been published as fiction!","review":"This is a passably interesting book, but it should definitely have been published as fiction. King allegedly changed some details in the book--I think that is an understatement! We follow King as he evades an attempt to kill him and his entire team in Colombia. While escaping King coldbloodly kills two Colombian nationals he conned into giving him a ride in their helicopter. Later he finds numerous beautiful women willing to help him, and of course they all find him irresistable and can't wait to bed him! All the while King remarks how he is never able to trust a woman. Please!!! The book would have been much better as a novel, rather than disguised as non-fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is a CROCK of Bull!!","review":"From an Old Warrior, This book is a crock of bull and to call it a NON-fiction is to travesty on the English language!

I get no sense of self-aggrandizement, embellishment or bravado, which truly gave me chills. The secrecy surrounding the world written about in this book makes obtaining \\"proof\\" about the events therein very probably impossible. I do believe, however, that this world exists. The author's matter-of-fact tone tells me he is sharing a real experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I picked up this book in the military history section of the bookstore as this book is being marketed as nonfiction. However, it clearly reads as fiction (and at times is not even original...some scenes appear to be lifted directly from other sources, such as the crash scene in the movie Air America). Is misrepresenting fiction as the truth a new marketing strategy from this publisher? From both a military and a common-sense perspective, this story is implausible. Come on, Mr. King, give us just a shred of evidence that this really happened..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Fantasy","review":"Bob King is a complete wannabe. If he was ever involved in combat it was with his mental illness. He babbles about how his experiences are \\"outside\\" the military only to cover up for his glaring lack of knowledge in a tactical environment. I love the way he explains how 'they' recuited him, obviously, 'because I could shoot well', yeah. The connections he makes to weave this sad story together are laughable. No, not complete nonsense-this is real!To top it off whoever gave this book the OK should be fired because it's so poorly written. Clearly it came from the diluded mind of a man who still plays with his G.I.Joes.Glad I got my money back. You'll want yours too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Are They Kidding?","review":"As fiction this book would be a barely passable example of the \\"blood and babes\\" school of adventure fiction, subcategory \\"secret missions.\\" But it claims to be \\"based in fact.\\" However, the inconsistant story line and the far-fetched plot have very little fact-like about them. For example, it doesn't merely get the US covert ops structure wrong - it ignores it all together in favor of a fantasy version. Now that's OK for fiction. After all, there never was an organization called \\"UNCLE\\" (of TV fame) either and that didn't prevent exciting stories. But when the story depends on its credentials as \\"based in fact\\" to overcome its other faults, it has to stay someplace within shouting distance of reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Deal","review":"Hey, everyone - Chance is the real deal, and the book's all true. I know, because I've heard about it from some of the other guys that were on the Spooky 8 team. Sergeant James Frey can attest that the book is a true recollection of the events, as can Sergeants Jayson Blair or Stephen Glass.Okay, I lied. But so did \\"Chance\\". This book would have been a poor excuse for fiction. The fact that it's sold as non-fiction is unbelievable. What an insult to those that actually served in the military.About the only detail that rings true is in the acknowledgements, where he mentions SFC James D. Cohron, who is indeed missing in action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spooky 8","review":"It's a shame there was no zero to rate this book with. A nice piece of fiction but it is sad that so many are wasting their money on this. Please don't, I will send you my copy.

It's value in revealing the truth is priceless.If you enjoy a fact based secret operations related expose, buy this book.If you are interested in learning about the kind of betrayal being perpetrated in the name of America, buy this book.99.9% of Americans would strongly disapprove of the policy of eliminating citizens for knowing too much, yet, under the guise of government support, this is what is happening.Mr. King's book will hopefully result in investigations that bring all those responsible to account for their betrayal of American values and ideals."},{"rating":"2","title":"from FROM HARD DATA SPECIAL OPS 5TH SF GP.","review":"TO SPECIAL OPS.

I believe cleaning is even easier with this style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"After hearing so many good things about Otis kits I dropped (the not unsubstantial) $40 on this kit. While it's a good idea, I really don't think it lives up to the hype. The bore cleaning procedure is effective, probably about as good as using a proper rod, brush and jag. But that's about all you can do with this kit. There is no way to clean any complex chamber- the short wire tool is next to useless in an AR chamber. There is no toothbrush, only enough oil for one or two cleanings, and no room to put a good rag in the pouch. After one use I've gone back to keeping a bore-snake, toothbrush, bottle of CLP and rag in my field kit and keeping a proper cleaning kit at home.The Otis kit is not worth the money, or the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty great kit!","review":"Well I bought and have used this kit to clean my Mini-14. The downside is that the packaging description and the Amazon description were both a little misleading. The reason I say this is because it \\"says\\" it can clean a rifle from .17 to 50 BMG. By contacting the company, I found out this was \\"partially\\" true. You can \\"patch clean\\" a rifle within those calibers... but you cannot brush clean a rifle in those calibers. For instance, the .223/5.56mm cleaning brush did not come with it. The company did correct this for me once I contacted them, which is the reason why I still highly suggest this kit! It cleans very well!!! It only comes with a very small tube of cleaning lube solution... and a handful of small and large cleaning patches. Everything in the kit is made of high quality parts though! I'd suggest this kit for your gun cleaning needs... just be sure you know if it can brush clean your gun or just patch clean it before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful, convenient, and most of all, compact","review":"I'm used to the old fashioned type kit.

I've used the bore snake in the past, and still use it, but this handy little kit really works well, Only problem I've encountered is that the pieces are sometimes a bear to get back in the kit, but what else is new?

Do not understand the purpose of the spiral grooves. It is impossible to get your hair exactly between the grooves, so you end up with dents in your curl.

I will keep giving these to them as a preventive measure.The first day I gave these to them, our sick kitten wasn't overly interested in anything but licking them. Once she saw her brother and sister gobble them down, she decided to try them as well. Now all we have to do is shake the container, and they all come running.

These songs, then, are obviously NOT inspired by Lord of the Rings but have simply been retitled (incorrectly in the case of Minas Tirith which has here been called Minas Truth) with names from Tolkien's triolgy. While it is interesting to listen to these old songs in their new conceptual connotations, this is still old material, and the musical styles of the original two albums don't always blend as nicely as one might hope. One would do far better to purchase both Seven Wonders and Heritage Suite and experience the songs in their proper form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and uninspired","review":"This album does not seem in any way related to Middle Earth. All of the tracks seem bland and very similar to each other, there is nothing to distinguish one track from another. Having read the books many times, the areas associated with each track are significantly different. I have liked some of Wakeman's other theme albums, particularly Six Wives of Henry VIII, where each track had a distinct character. This album is not up to that standard and the tracks seem to be a mish mash of bland compositions that was thrown together and had titles slapped on them to associate them with LOTR. Given the well developed character of each area in LOTR, I would have expected tracks with distinct character, much as Holst's Planets compositions each have very distinct characters that strongly evoke the character being portrayed. Not so the tracks on this album, they evoked only boredom in this listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD!","review":"I love this CD!

Soul of the Conga finds Poncho on another spirited journey of Latin Jazz with plenty of festive fire. In fact, if you're a fan of Afro Cuban Jazz, then this CD is a definite must. Poncho has a killer band (especially the Torres Brothers), but also brings some very special guests along for the ride, Hammond B-3 maestro Joey Defrancesco (on Henry Mancini's \\"Days of Wine and Roses\\"), trumpeter Terence Blanchard (on \\"Stella by Starlight\\") and the Ortiz Brothers, five brothers who add a festive vibe with their group singing (check out track 2, \\"Oye Lo\\").

Rings (like Z) are very familiar to normal high school students, so easier to understand than the more abstract Group theory.Starting from Ring to learn factor ring, ideals, Laws of Isomorphism and other concepts, then revisit them later in Group will help to reinforce understanding.2) He uses simple layman languages to explain complex concepts.

I can only thank Ruth Reichl for sharing part of her life with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has its moments, although...","review":"First of all, don't buy this book for the recipes. They seem to be included to give the feel of the period, and aren't very interesting today. That said, there are some worthwhile passages in this book, notably those that involve the author's bipolar mother. The problem is that the bulk of the memoir is larded with boomer-generation cliches: the motherly housekeeper, the exotic boarding school roommate, the high school 'fast crowd,' the exotic college roommate, the post-college communal household. One cringe-worthy chapter in the middle is reminiscent of Neal Pollack's \\"I am friends with a middle-class black person\\"--minus the satire. Finally, at the end, things just begin to get interesting as the author visits French vintners in the company of Kermit Lynch. Perhaps the sequel is a better read. For a far superior coming-of-age-with-food read, try Nigel Slater's \\"Toast.\\" It succeeds more effectively on every level--and all he had to work with was British food!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Tasty Treat","review":"I've enjoyed her NYTimes reviews and am very sorry to see her gone - If only she wrote more in Gourmet Magazine!This is a sweet story of the days of one of the greatest food writers of today.

I must have mistaken this for a cooking essay book. Granted, she throws in recipes along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it in one day.....","review":"I just couldn't put this one down! Ruth Reichl has an obvious talent for engaging her readers. In Tender at the Bone, Ruth chronicles her early life as a \\"gourmand in training\\". Join her as she tells about her not-yet-diagnosed manic-depressive mother. Revel with her as she has her first experience with truffles. Travel with her to Tunis as she becomes a guest of some mysterious strangers. Agonize with her when she moves to Berkeley, where her fellow commune dwellers constantly harped on her for preparing \\"elitist\\" meals, and grocery shopping meant digging through dumpsters. An incredible story about a strangely incredible life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is much better than \\"Comfort me with Apples\\". Its a nicely told personal story expressed with a touch of the art of becoming a home cook, and the pursuit to go further. If you love cooking, you can identify with the authors' experiences. Her family story is no different than that of any other struggling american family."},{"rating":"2","title":"YUM!","review":"This book is a must for people who share the belief that eating is not a biological necessity but rather one of life's great adventures. Ruth Reichl has enriched the life of many with her superb reviews. Now she has added courage and generosity to her work by sharing some of the experiences that formed her. It was a joy to share her physical and psychological journeys. I will continue to emulate her zest for life and food!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Might make a cook out of a noncook","review":"I used to say that my ideal job would be to be a restaurant critic...but not to gain weight! I've gone on to fulfill other dreams instead, but reading Ruth's books allows me to live this particular dream vicariously. For anyone who grew up in the 60s/70s this particular book provides a lot of nostalgia as well. I'm not a cook, but I admit that the recipes sprinkled throughout here make me want to cook. We discussed Tender at the Bone at our recent book club meeting. One member DID make the brownie recipe here which is wonderful...and the book triggered one of our liveliest discussions ever. about the foods our moms made.Kathie Hightower, co-author of Help! I'm a Military Spouse -- I Get a Life Too! 2d Edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable book for a remarkable life!","review":"Reading Reichl's \\"Garlic and Sapphires\\" piqued my interest in reading her other books. I thought this book was very enjoyable and a must-read for anyone who professes to love food. It's interesting to have a peek at Ruth Reichl's life and how she developed into such a gourmet. I loved that Reichl pretty much bared her soul when writing about her family, growing up and her adventures. It is so refreshing to see such honesty. This book is about life in general. Sure, there's a lot of emphasis on food and cooking and the kitchen, but it's also about family, growing up, friendship, work and battling with our own demons. The recipes (the ones I've tried anyway) are delicious and add a cutesy tinge to the book. Overall, this was a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of a personal getting of wisdom crowded with memorab","review":"This is a very enjoyable autobiographical account of a foodie discovering a range of cooking and eating possibilities way beyond her first, rather ghastly, home experiences. Reichl introduces us to memorable characters who accidentally or deliberately guided the development of her taste/s. I read it through at a sitting the first time. Now I am reading it more slowly and photocopying some of the recipes because I don't want to cover the book in grease. Highly recommended as a story of a personal \\"getting of wisdom\\", as well as a narrative which is crowded with memorable characters. P.S. I ordered as a companion, and am still reading, the 1998 compilation of essays about food, We are What we Ate, edited by Mark Winegardner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many wonderful adventures -- not all happy ones! Recipes!!","review":"Tender at the Bone is filled with many wonderful adventures, although not always happy ones. Imagine being sent off to school in Montreal for several years to learn French cold turkey! It may be nice to know the language, of course, but it seems a rather rude shock for a young kid. It's good to know that she survived to become editor in chief of Gourmet Magazine, but that's 20-20 hindsight.Interestingly enough, amazing meals of all types and varieties are instrumental in her survival of this and other many other adventures, filled with wit, sadness, resourcefulness and occasional mishap. Ms. Reichl is kind enough to include the recipes in this warmly written memoir. I haven't cooked any of the recipes (although I definitely dog-eared some pages, particularly the delicious-looking Artpark Brownies) but I enjoyed reading the book and could easily read it right through again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I had never heard of Ruth Reichl, but the book sounded intriguing. I received it this morning, and wound up reading it in one sitting. The book was such a fun read that I wished it would never end.I am the one Shake-and-Bake'r in a family of gourmet cooks, but Ms. Reichl made even me want to go out and whip up a souffle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugar & Spice and All Things Nice","review":"This book isn't just for cooks but for everyone who enjoys a good laugh now and then. The author's irrepressable mother, the quiet father whose past is full of great adventures untold, and the other zany characters the author lives with in a house is only a taste of the great characters you'll meet in this book. Extremely enjoyable -- finally, a book that doesn't sit and rot in your attic but stays around to be read time after time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy","review":"Ruth Reichl has been the food critic for the NY Times and the editor-in-chief of Gourmet magazine. This is the first of her memoirs and it covers her childhood and young adult life. As she mentions in the Author's Note, \\"This book is absolutely in the family tradition. Everything here is true, but it may not be entirely factual... I learned early that the most important thing in life is a good story.\\" And Ms. Reichl is a great storyteller. I also recommend her second book \\"Comfort Me With Apples.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, Poignant and Hopeful","review":"Tender at the Bone gives the reader a closer glimpse of Ms. Reichl and the factors that made her the fine food critic she is today. Alternating between touching, funny, poignant and outright tragic, Tender at the Bone is a different sort of book than Garlic and Sapphires. Here we see Ms. Reichl as a young girl, caught between the mood swings and impulsive (and often nonsensical) behavior of a clearly disturbed mother and a father who isn't quite sure how to manage it all. The tales are absorbing, and Reichl again grabs the reader and takes them along for the ride. Be prepared to gasp with laughter and horror at the experiences she relates. Like her recipes, you'll be looking for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Friend","review":"Ruth Reichl becomes an instant friend with her memoir, Tender At The Bone. She is conversational with all the quirks of the most tender of friendships. She is so giving with her life's quests and relationships...not to mention her recipes. You are compelled to immediately give back to this storyteller and share her life. Through her words you can just as easily feel the warmth of her soups as you can a hug from Aunt Birdie and Alice. Everyone needs to read a memoir like Tender At The Bone, every so often to remind you that being human and connecting with earthly things are the real joys of life...and as Ruth tells you, that she learned early in life that the most important thing in life is a good story. Amen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but...","review":"I thought that this book was an okay read, but it left quite a lot to be desired. The author's life story was, for me, a not particularly interesting one (except for the havoc wrecked by author's manic/depressive mother and passive/enabling father). Reichl's ponderous writing style ruined many a good scene. Her annoying use of passive verbs (i.e. \\"I could see,\\" \\"I could smell,\\" \\"He seemed to be,\\" etc.) slowed things down considerably. More aggravating, Reichl skips over some lucious details of her cooking apprenticship--she learns to cook such-and-such and it turns out delicious. Boom, just like that, with no description of technique or trial-by-error or any of those pesky things that home cooks (and probably professionals, as well) have to deal with on the road to a perfect souffle or divine roast.So, all in all, if a reader is seeking a combined autobiography/cookbook, there are better choices than \\"Tender at the Bone.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"reads well and easy to stay attached","review":"This is told as a story and is easy and entertaining to follow.Fun to read and tough to put down. I would recommend it especially to boomers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great food critic, lousy biographer","review":"I've always enjoyed Reichl's NY Times food reviews - they're quick, factual and accurate. The skills that she uses so well in her food columns just don't translate well into a personal biography. The writing drags on and on -I felt as if I were reading an adolescent's 'woe is me' diary. I couldn't even bring myself to finish the book and quit 2/3 of the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bits of Entertainment","review":"If you are looking for a book focused on food and cooking, this is not it. And perhaps this was not Reichl's intention in the first place. It is really an account of her upbringing and coming into her own...worth the read due to bits of entertaining writing, but more on the side of an autobiography than pure Food Lit."},{"rating":"1","title":"No point...","review":"I was disappointed. This book is just a book about Ruth Reichl's life before becoming a famous NYT food critic. The problem is that there is absolutely nothing to say!You would expect a book to make you either dream, travel, think, laugh or anything, even scare you, why not? But in this book, you will have nothing except for a completely normal life with nothing special about it. It was a very flat and pointless read.I guess the book is worth it when you really want to know about the author, then you probably have some answers, but if you are looking for a good read about food, nothing here, a good read with an interesting point of view on things, or a thrilling biography... dont pick out this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Memoir of a former hippie with a mother complex","review":"After enjoying the author's witty restaurant reviews, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Aside from some wonderful descriptions (particularly \\"the old, cold taste of olives\\"), this book is rife with '60s flower child attitude.

You owe it to yourself to hear him sing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable sound disqualifies a striking performance","review":"Everyone in the cast of this 1962 Covent Garden performance who is well known, principally Cesare Siepi as the Don and Mirella Freni as Zerlina, can be found on commercial recordings. Solti had a great run at Covent Garden, and I'd like to have heard his interpretation, but the sonics make that impossible.

My 4 year old loves information about animals. Since he watches Finneas and Ferb and their pet, Perry the platapus, my boy was intrigued to learn about them. This book has drawings instead of pictures and is more of a story instead of informational. Although, it does say about how big it is, and that it's a mammal, and has a bill like a duck.

The distinguishing features of this film are the extremely disagreeable spinster and the outlandishly bad acting, particularly of the three female victims. (I am especially fond of their skillfully crafted foreign accents.)This one has it all: ornery old woman, evil genius, hokey pseudo-scientific sets and dialogue, wooden acting, and a cat brain transplanted into a nubile young girl. The one unifying theme of the film, however, is that of boredom. The film isn't one of the very worst ever made, but it ranks right up there on the all time boringness scale. I recommend that if you want to watch this film you buy the version featuring the MST3K guys and their trademark mockery: it relieves the boredom and makes the viewing experience infinitely more enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sangre de Drago, Great product!!!","review":"SANGRE DE DRAGO (That is the real name) is just great for so many things.. among other virtues, it helps not to have the side effects from radiotherapy, heals wounds, and the best quality is it prevents matastasis to get fixed somewhere else in your body.. it is just a great product !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for acne or scars","review":"Sorry to say but I origionally bought for acne and scars, it does not work for either.

While everything ended happy, I was not altogether thrilled that she ended up with a guy as tempermental as Rand.If you think this is going to be of the same quality as Coble's \\"Mercy Falls\\" series, you are going to be in for quite a disappointing surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before you go","review":"Loved the book.

I thought this toy seemed interesting enough for him to want to play with in the tub. After reading other reviews I was sure this was the toy...boy was I wrong. He has absolutely no interest in this toy whatsoever. He won't even play with the whistle. He would rather play with plastic cups. I would say this might possibly interest a younger child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bath Toy!","review":"I wish I had seen this toy earlier - my son went through a period of hating the tub and I feel like this may have helped!He loves shape sorting, matching up colors so this is right up his alley. He is 20 months now (I bought it for him around 15 months) and still plays with it during every bath time. I'd highly recommend it - super durable and creative!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly designed bath boy","review":"I read the reviews on Amazon and decided to purchase this bath toy for my son for the hoildays. It seemed a little expensive for a bath toy honestly but the quality is great and I didn't want another crappy bath toy that would break in a month. This toy is so perfectly designed and there are so many well thought out and designed features of this little toy, it's great. The sail in the middle is also a flute and my son (16 months) has now figured out how to blow the flute and loves playing with it. He also loves seeing the 3 little people/animals that come with it bounce/float up and down in the bath. He will even sneak into the bathroom during the day to play with this toy when he's not even in the bath - overall terrific toy and totally worth the price! I imagine this would also make a great gift for a 1 year birthday present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but nothing that special","review":"I purchased this toy for my 8 month old and really was not that impressed with it. Maybe he is just too young. Some of my dislikes were how small the animals are. Of course everything goes into my little guys mouth and these do too -- except too far into his mouth. My rule has always been 'no toys that will not fit though the carboard of a tiolet paper roll.\\" And this one breaks that rule. Also, the container does not float very well. The yellow section does fill up with water and therefore can mold.On the pro side, it is great colors....that is not a lot of pros for a toy!Pass on this one parents. There is much better stuff out there -- Sassy is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice!","review":"This toy works well for both my 4 and a half and nine month old. There is so much variety to it. I feel that this is a toy with the versatility I like for my children. I will definitely be able to use this a teaching bath tub toy. The whistle mast is a great surprise! Add water into the whistle and listen to the pitch change as the water empties. The base makes a great \\"shower\\" for rinsing hair. I could go on, but I think you get the point. Get this one...you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and colorful","review":"I had picked this book up on sale and for months it was one of my daughter's favorites. We always act out the animal sounds and it definately helped her learn animal sounds and colors.

I tried it and found the loops are waaaaay too repetitive, and there is no musical skill here at all; everything is rhythm. I will say disc 2 is better than disc 1.

I have a lot of chill out music and people that don't even listen to this music have been begging me to make a copy for them. I tell them that I paid a lot of money and waited for over 2 months for this CD to arrive from Europe and it is worth every penny and they need to get it themselves. I would highly reccomend this disc to anyone who likes good music without regard to genre. You will agree that this is fine music. This disc just has class written all over it.

Just some show-offy guitar playing by the guy in the video, with zero explanation or context or insight in any of the material.Awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful - glad i got it","review":"This book will take you from beginner to solid rhythm player. It is a true musical trip into rhythm guitar and much more useful than a bunch of chord diagrams. Some chord theory is covered, and the chords are related to scales and positions. Short practice examples stress \\"basic moves\\" instead of full tunes, which is the best way to learn. If you can get through this book, you will fit in as a rhythm player in just about any style. I give 4 instead of 5 stars because there is no CD included - you do need to be able to read a bit to get the strumming patterns. This book is an excellent companion to \\"Chord-Tone Soloing\\", another great book from MI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved space","review":"I was traveling out of the country and did not want to take 16 prescription bottles that were each for a three month supply.

I however do not necessarily agree with all of it. That being said, I am always looking for books that can help me with my kids. I saw this one for sale at the library and got it. I read it through, and have applied some of the principals with my kids. The one thing that struck me is that it does teach independence at a young age, and guides the parents on how to encourage it. One of the things is how to teach a child to put on a jacket. I showed my 3 yo this and now he does this AND I believe it pushed him to learn how to dress himself completely. That for me is better than any of the activities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advice","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Easy to follow guidelines for arranging your home and life in your child's best interest. I and my kids like the games and activities this book introduced.

Some plants even have this ability. This fact wasn't even touched on. Lithops are a prime example.I kept looking for some animals that were hard to spot. I saw some insects. Just because a frog is bright green doesn't mean it is using camouflage.I usually love National Geographic but not in this case. Don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, great price","review":"I bought some of these volume controls for several in-ceiling speakers that are being installed in a home under construction.Due to the size of the controller, and the wires going to and from it, I found it best to use a deep box (or a box with no back).I had no real problem installing these. The lack of directions was frustrating at first, but it quickly became apparent that the bracket is necessary since the faceplate is larger than a standard box.They work well, and with the several color choices Phoenix has provided (white, ivory or bone), they easily fix into most decors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!

The quality of the master is very good (much better than any VHS) but not as good as many DVDs avialable on the market, especially compared to \\"Andrei Roublev\\" by Criterion. Also Kino on Video has transfered the monochromic newsreels in the movie (originally in sepia, orange, bronwnish tones) in plain B&W. What a pity. Last but not least, the foreign dialogues (spanish, and newsreels) are not translated, but in my opinion is not very important as it adds some mystery and make you feel like a stranger as if you were russian. Anyway, the movie is incredible and the DVD is quite good, colors scenes are stunning."},{"rating":"1","title":"The slowest movie ever made?","review":"First of all. I love Tarkovskij's movies (most of them) but this one is really something different. The film has not been panned and scanned it was shot in full frame ratio which is strange and it is only like 100 minutes long but it feels more like 200 minutes. I am a filmtheory student and have a hard time understanding the greatness of this film. To me it's just a lot of random scenes and sequences that are impossible to follow.

The instructions are unintelligible - tables where you need to look up a jumper setting based on the number of speakers actually refer to PAIRS of speakers, but you can only work this out by reading and re-reading the garbled examples.

It has very nice detents so you know what level of volume you are at without listening. I find this helpful as the control is outside and master volume is inside. I set the outside control to about 5 and then turn the amplifier a little louder than normal. When I go back outside the volume can stay where it is or be turned up for a really good song and then back down without having to go in and out of the house.The control seems to be solidly constructed and fairly easy to install.

I belong to a homeschool \\"strategy labs\\" group, which is run by a former gifted and talented public school teacher, and she introduced me to Think Fun games.My children thoroughly enjoy them, and have more patience than I would have expected to try and solve the puzzles.A previous reviewer said that this game is good for \\"gifted\\" children, and I'm sure it is, but I think it is a great game for ANY child who likes to solve puzzles, regardless of their giftedness at them.I would even buy this game (or perhaps River Crossing Jr, or Rush Hour) for a child who DOESN'T particularly like puzzles, because with some adult encouragement, the child may really enjoy it (thus learning that he/she DOES like puzzles) and improve his ability to think visually and plan several moves ahead - quite a nice bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family fun","review":"We really enjoyed this game.

The information and ideas that were ment to come across are lost in the bad acting and script. I really can't think of a positive thing to say about it. It seemed to me that the main charcter (Jsu Garcia) was using this as a platform to get him into some major movies. He was unbelieveable and trite to the point of just plain bad.

James Sallis has crafted an excellent noir thriller -- like a complicated mosaic -- from small, tantalizing fragments in the life of Driver, a Hollywood stunt driver who moolights behind the wheel of getaway cars. Driver is so cool his pores exude frost rather than sweat.As the story begins, people are trying to kill Driver because of a Phoenix heist that went wrong.

The book differs in many areas of the film, which makes it hard to compare. As a book, James Sallis creates an intriguing character we get to know through flashbacks and quick chapters. I like the snippets of character, the brush strokes of a man only known as \\"Driver.\\" Mr. Sallis writes with dead-on brevity and gives us only enough information to open the door a crack. I love how he writes, it's just as mysterious as the character. There are times, however, where I find it confusing to tell who is speaking. Eliminating all \\"Driver saids\\" in a sequence of ten lines makes it necessary to count evens and odds to differentiate each character. But I get what Sallis is going for with his prose, and he is a master at it.

Even the way the story begins \\"Much later...\\" creates the sense that time is certainly not going to be linear in the book. Some people feel that this takes away from the story, however I like the way that the book starts in the middle of the story, and jumps around. It is done well, and creates a real rise and fall in the tension of the story.The characters are all rather mysterious, even the main character.

I would bet money that this was the authors classroom assignment. The story flashes back and forward in time to give it a Momento-esque story line, but keeps it realy simple so the average slurpee pusher at 7-11 can follow the story between customers.

Also to note this DVD suffers from really bad lighting such as back lighting and dark light which resulted in a too dark picture or a washed out look.

And according to the exercises you're doing u may need ankle weights also. But please choose weights that you are comfortable with. Besides that, it's a good workout. It does target different parts of the body and it does make you sweat like crazy. Will reccommend you buy it.If you can work the bands well fine, but if not use free weights. I use both. It's up to you to know which workouts you want to use the free weights with."},{"rating":"1","title":"My my my","review":"Well, I'm not a bootcamp fan. For those looking for a good CARDIO workout, this certainly is not. It's not well managed, the bands can be extremely painful (think ripping out hair by the roots!), and the heart rate will not go up. The arm work burns the shoulders, but the pressure is too light to do any of the other muscles any serious good.If I had it to do over again I would not buy this set, and I will NEVER do the ab video again. I stopped midway b/c the bands were so painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"billy blanks boot camp elite","review":"It took a couple weeks for the product to be shipped, but the product was intact.

I'm a huge fan of Tae Bo cardio and wanted to branch out a bit and bought this box of garbage. The other reviewers hint at it: these Billy Bands are beyond uncomfortable and close to impossible to use at the correct tension. You're wrists will be sore after from the amount of timeS the handle area of the bands will slap against them. Also, the workouts themselves are lame. They're way too hard. Even his top instructors are caught cheating or skipping steps at times. Also, is Billy retarded? He constantly fumbles his words and says things that don't make sense, then spends too much time trying to correct himself, turning what was supposed to be 2 sets of 8 into 10 sets of 8.DON'T BUY IT. YOU'LL REGRET IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed- even though I love TAE BO","review":"I am an avid lover of Tae Bo, and I have over 20 DVDs (along with about 5 VHS tapes).

We wanted something that would stand up to dirt, dampness and the abuse that a basement door sometimes gets. Even though they cost a little bit more than some we looked at, they are well worth the money. They are very well built and are metal (not plastic) which is a plus. They fit our standard sized door perfectly and do exactly what they are supposed to do. The only thing that I would have wanted to be different was the color. They were an off-white color and I would have preferred something to match the color of the door, otherwise, they are perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic Half Bline","review":"Great item.

The garage really heats up in the summer with all the sun coming in. I'd been dithering for a long time whether to buy this blind and then after we lost some shade trees after a storm, one afternoon's hot sun pouring in and turning the laundry area into a virtual sweatbox was all it took for me to order one of these and put it up as soon as it was delivered. It's great! It took just a few minutes to snap the blind together and position it on the door. It's nice looking and fits the door and window perfectly. The magnets at the top which hold the blind in place are very strong. The bottom magnets keep it from swinging around as the door moves but are not so strong that the blind can't be easily raised. Best of all, the garage is noticeably cooler and more comfortable in the afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect solution for our metal door.","review":"These have worked out great.

Excellent product!","review":"I bought this blind to fit on a metal half-light door after suffering for nearly three years with being blinded by the afternoon sun. I can not believe we didn't order this before.

It's quite hinted at that something dreadful took place and before I got to the unveiling of that, I didn't know if I could continue reading this and thankfully, quickly realized I was on the wrong track.I ache at the unfairness of it. Yes, the occurrence itself was sad, however, the resulting consequence to a particular individual did not seem fitting.Giving it 2 stars doesn't seem fitting either and yet most of the story was quite prosaic. Not much happening except day-to-day events of the young main character. However, the climactic event really peaked it out. At that point, it had an Of Mice and Men feel to it, hence the mature audience bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through the eyes of an innocent child...","review":"I enjoyed how this book was written. With the chapters divided into months you are able to follow the life of Katy throughout this life changing year. I teach fourth grade and many of the girls in my class would enjoy this book. They love to read historical fiction. The character Katy spans from age six to nine years old. The students in my classroom are nine and ten year olds so they will be able to relate to the playfull and innocents of the character. Katy teaches us a life lesson about friendship. She befriends the boy that everyone sees as different, but she sees as a friend. She builds this bong with Jacob throughout the book. From a teacher standpoint I like this aspect of the book. I often see chidren stray away from children that are different or challenged. I have not read another book that teaches family and friend relationships through the eyes of a child. Katy teaches us the importance of these close relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book (not for children)","review":"Great book, but a warning is issued in the following excerpt on page 1: \\"If I tried to tell them this story, the one I am about to set down here, their parents would send me warning looks over the heads of the children.

The main character, Katy, wants to tell this story to her great-grandchildren, however, the parents would send warning looks over the children's heads saying, Don't! This is why I feel the plot could have been developed on a more adult level. I'm not really sure to whom Katy is speaking-to children or adults. Silent Boy kind of gives me feeling of A Painted House or To Kill a Mockingbird combined with a little of The Other. I'm not sure Silent Boy will hold the interest of the intended audience, but it is a story that any grandmother could and should tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Story for All Ages","review":"Lois Lowry has an uncanny way of making children's literature relate to readers of all ages. She tells a story, often through the eyes of an innocent child who is not yet burdened with the responsibilities of adulthood but who soon will be, and she reveals a universal truth that enlightens young readers and makes older readers reflect on life. This story is set in the early 1900s, a time when mentally disabled people were thought to be dangerous. However, when young Katy Thatcher establishes a special friendship with an autistic farm boy, she learns of love through a terrible disaster. An ingenious plot with a haunting end, this book will most definitely have an impact on any reader's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"i read this book in like 5 hours it was great. the only problem i knew how it would end just by the first 2 or three chapters. ohhh well it was still good"},{"rating":"2","title":"changed my reading of chaucer","review":"I've been teaching Chaucer courses for years, always passing along the standard schtick: Chaucer must have been a great diplomat, because he survived three tumultous reigns when plenty of his friends and cohorts didn't.

This book may or may not be correct in its theory as to Chaucer's demise, but it certainly made me rethink a few old assumptions--and that's always a good thing.

The heroine, while prone to a little too much demuring, was actually more likeable in my eyes than the average heroine. The plot was interesting and kept me involved, and I was actually surprised by the ending, a rarety. Justin is a likeable hero, a change from the usual run of the mill stoic silent alpha male. The locale is also presented in a likeable way. Even with the colloqialisms in the dialogue, none of the bayou people sounded stupid or illiterate, merely the simply, humble people they are.

To be frank, I stopped mid-way mainly because I was so frustrated with how the heroine kept feeling so sorry for herself to be of any help to others. The sub-plots involve some treason and military secrets but the author's style of appending every new development with a sentence starting with 'However ...' and 'While..' irritated me no end and made the writing seem pretty amateurish.

The trilogy has gone through many of the hard questions (for me) of being a Christian in a post-modern society. And now, finally, an honest discussion of the concept of hell. How do we stay faithful to the gospel and still reconcile hell with a loving God? Would a loving God damn anyone to eternal perdition and torment?Brian McLaren tries to talk honestly about all sides of the issue. His protagonist, Dan Poole, struggles with the need to be true to the gospel and the need to reconcile God's mercy and grace with traditional views of hell.I found the historical background fascinating--and now I want to delve further into more reading in that area.Read the book--decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here","review":"The real problem with McLaren's work is not that it is heretical, it's that he's just making stuff up and thinking of himself as a revolutionary. Not of his doctrine is at all new, and he isn't even particularly radical. Maybe if you've had your head in conservative Christian sand all of your life you'll think that he has something new to say, but probably not. This is just shallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read, on a touchy, complicated subject.","review":"If you have always wondered, \\"is hell real or not?\\", or are just curious to what different ways there are of looking at the concept of Hell, Brian McLaren does an excellent job of taking the facts and inserting them into a novel. A novel that is enjoyable and also easy to read.You may not come away with all the answers, but you will come away with all the questions, lots of answers, and direction on where you can find more answers.Whatever you do, don't only read the book half-way through just because your feeling your ego hurt and think the author is a heretic. Give the book a chance. Read it in the spirit it is being presented to you. And if you still have unanswered questions when done, then do some homework as the characters in the book did.Definitely a book I am going to share with anyone struggling with the concept of Hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUPER, HIMSELF DUPED, DUPING GULLIBLES","review":"THIS MAN IS A DUPER.

It gave me some good historical and Biblical background on our understanding of Hell. It was also a good story woven into the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sure","review":"I think McLaren is refreshing in that he takes us into the faith with honest questions. He is a relief to anyone who has gone to a church where the preaching consisted of inflexible dogma that didn't allow for questions. However, it's not really clear where McLaren ends up. If he casually adopts evolution and dismisses hell (in another book), exactly how does he make these theological decisions? What is his basis for deciding what is true and what isn't?Overall, I'd recommend this book to someone who had really been burned by church, but not to someone who had never been to church. I'm not sure that it would put seekers on the right path. Instead, I'd recommend James W. Miller's \\"God Scent\\" for seekers with authentic questions who didn't want an unbending viewpoint.

It is possibly my favorite of McLaren's books from the New Kind of Christian series. He tackles the subject of the hereafter with amazing finesse. I thought the book was thoughtful,kind and challenging while looking into the subject of hell. His chapter regarding the Holocaust Museum was incredibly moving and personal.The characters vary some from book to book, but the main ones are recognizable, and new ones keep the focus fresh. It is possible to jump right in on this third book without previously reading his first two.However, I found it helpful to have some background from reading them in order. McLaren always leaves me hungry for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Helluva Ride","review":"And here we go again on an adventure that most certainly will not leave us in the same spot we were when we began the story. This book is best read in short snippets in order to begin grasping and wrestling with concepts that have been so ingrained in our brains. Remember that learning comes from thinking, not listening or teaching. And at the end can I fully believe everything that is propositioned? The jury's still out on that one, but perhaps like Carol if it gets me to think more about the \\"here and now\\" it has been a sucess. I know I won't ever see the world the same and I've drawn closer to God in the process. Has it been scary to begin questioning my long held beliefs? Yes of course. But at the end of the day I would rather have wrestled with Truth and come away shaken than have clung so tightly to my brand of truth and come away missing the point of life completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great approach to a tough topic","review":"McLaren's writing is so relevant and powerful. I loved the illustrations surrounding this very tough topic. At worst, it will make you think...at best, it will change your views forever. I can't recommend it more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect end to the series","review":"You might want to pass on Brian's latest book if you think you have all the answers, can't accept that new ideas are crucial to a living and growing faith, believe that Jesus enjoyed talking about hell and if you have an easy time judging others before looking at thoughts and beliefs that you hold which could be incorrect.On the other hand, if you follow Jesus and love Him and his creation, then you will definitely benefit from reading this amazing book. You won't find any definitive and final answers on the big questions (the Bible won't give you those either) but you will find someone who engages the topic of hell in a humble and honest spirit. For those who believe that what happens after we die is a matter best left to each individual and their relationship with God.....spend a few hours with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one yet in the trilogy","review":"I found this to be the best book in the new Kind of Christian Trilogy (It also should be noted that I very much liked the other two). If you have questions/doubts about hell especially in regards to an all loving & graceful God then I cannot recommend this book enough.He manages to point out that the traditional approaches are flawed not just because of their approach to scripture but rather because they are asking the wrong questions in the first place.While this book is sure to be frustrating to someone who thinks they have it all figured out & anyone who disagrees with them is in danger of being a heretic, it will most likely be encouraging to anyone who strives for their allegiance to be to Christ rather than a specific doctrinal stance. It will also be an encouragement to anyone who is simply curious about Christianity.McLaren is one of the best thinkers in the evangelical community that I have come across & this is one of his best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"McLaren's Assumption that Evangelicals are Stupid.","review":"McLaren's wording in the introduction seems to show a disdain for anyone who thinks the Gospel is simple and clear. He says \\"pat answers\\" aren't acceptable in today's society.Evangelicals, contrary to McLaren's apparent thinking, do struggle with difficult questions. Most Christians--Evangelical or otherwise, DON'T struggle with the most primary message of the gospel: Christ's centrality to our salvation.Mushy, liberal-type thinking (the kind represented by McLaren)--dressed up in ANY kind of terminology--is not worth one's money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEW BRAND OF FAITH - WHAT not TO BELIEVE","review":"Markus Park and Neil Oliver represent emergent masters seeking disciples of the new brand of religious thinking in vogue today. \\"We are done with being told the right received way we all ought to understand the gospel story.

Hallelujah! what a Saviour! a reconstructed hell is a misconstructed gospel and a destructed thislife and afterlife. one star is granted for showing the vital importance of the issue for thinking Christians. see the book 'Hell Under Fire' for material unfairly omitted in this overly contemporary consumer-friendly maltreatment. what we have here is like calling terminal cancer only a 24-hr cold needing nyquil not radical chemo/radiation/miracle remedy of cross-blood to cure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am so Happy Times Ten!","review":"This CD is great!

Everything that you read about this camera is true....Poor indoor pictures...Eats batteries left and right...even when it is off...Cheaply made product all together....You have been warned...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating piece of junk","review":"I bought one of these cameras at Wal-Mart and returned it the next day as not only useless but frustratingly useless. My computer could access the camera as a pair of USB flash drives, and pull photos off the camera that way, until I installed the camera's software. With the vendor software installed, photos could not be retrieved from the camera at all. The vendor software also did not fully uninstall, so its installation marked the end of my ability to get photos off the camera. The camera went through a set (3) of Duracell Ultra batteries in a little over six hours, with less than a dozen test photos. I called the vendor's technical support line (a toll call) and spent 30 minutes on hold before giving up, having never spoken to anyone. All in all, both product and vendor support are excruciatingly shoddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this","review":"If only I had read these reviews BEFORE I bought this camera...I can only confirm what everyone else says: 1) the camera comsumes batteries even when it is off; 2) it deletes pictures in its internal memory when it loses battery power; 3) it will not operate with rechargeable Ni-MH AAA batteries - at least mine wouldn't!However, I would like to offer one compliment to Sakar, the manufacturer. Their customer service was very good. I contacted them (figuring that I had a defective camera) and they provided a replacement when I sent the first one in - it cost me a couple of bucks in shipping and I got a replacement in about 10 days. Only problem, the replacement camera is no better than the original. Obviously, the whole design is defective.As with the others, my advice is to spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating, loses pictures.","review":"If you're thinking of buying this for a nice gift/Christmas present, just say no! Here's why:This camera goes through a set of batteries in literally less than an hour. And even if you turn it off, it really doesn't turn off ever - the batteries will *still* be dead within a few hours (with all pictures forever lost if you didn't have them saved on an SD card).I bought this camera for a trip to the Grand Canyon. Probable scenario if I had taken it along: Hike for 1-3 hours, taking pictures. Halfway back to the car the batteries die and all photos are lost.No thanks. I bought a Kodak C300 instead for only $30 more, looks to have nearly identical functionality but already I can see the image quality is much better. So long as the batteries can last even a day or two in this one, I'll be a happy camper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a low end digital camera - this is too low","review":"Spend twice as much on a digital camera, and you'll probably get ten times the value - steer clear of this cheapo camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run from this camera as fast as you can!!","review":"1.

I installed the software to get the pictures to my computer and it worked all of twice before I had to reinstall the software plus the drivers. And then the drivers wouldn't reinstall. I haven't been able to find a manufacturer's site so that i could re download the drivers...to no avail.Camera consumes a lot of battery power. And it doesn't take pictures well indoors. Even having the flash on doesn't help much."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"-The flash on this camera floods the picture with so much reflective light nothing in the pic is recognizable.-Indoor shots taken without the flash are usually as dark as dark can possibly get, although sometimes a nice fuzzy brown image appears.-Unless your hand is as steady as a rock expect to have a double exposure effect in your shots.-Skip lunch for a day or two so you can afford to buy batteries for this power-draining device.This camera is NO BARGAIN regardless where it is purchased. My opinion may have been somewhat different if it cost $35-$45, a reasonable price range for one of the lowest of all low-end products."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this a negative 5 if I could","review":"This is the worst waste of money I ever spent. I bought it for my 10-year old, thinking it would be a fun camera and I would spend less money developing the tons of silly pictures that kids take. It eats batteries like there is no tomorrow. You can take only about of dozen photos before the batteries are used up. I've spent a fortune on batteries and even tried rechargeable batteries. Even when the camera is not being used, the the batteries die in about 24 hours. On top of all of that, indoor pictures are the worst quality I have EVER seen -- grainy & washed out colors, and if you use a flash, everything is way overexposed & white. TOTALLY WORTHLESS piece of garbage. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst camera ever!","review":"I wish I could give this \\"camera\\" zero stars. Works sporadically.

It needs an SD memory card to hold more than a few photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karen sweats and so will you!","review":"A tough workout not for beginners. Cueing is quick. I found I had to do it about four times before I started getting some of the steps down. I like that the workout seems to go fast because of Karen's \\"get down to business\\" attitude. The longest cardio segment is in the beginning, 9:15 minutes, so you know you got the longest one out of the way after it is over. By then, I am very warm and in the zone. The moves are not dancy but I do find this tick-tock move she does a bit difficult.

However, these are the worst. Audio quality is terrible. The design is the real problem, though. The retraction mechanism is too big and too heavy.

Even though there is a list of answers in the back, it would have been nice to just have a list of conjugated adjectives.If you are willing to teach yourself how to conjugate adjectives and are already assisting classes, this book will help you to better understand, but it will require you to work for the answers.Overall, it's a workbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best adjective book ever!!!!!","review":"i would give this lady a reward for this book, it is so easy to learn adjactives with its help, i just couldnt stop reading it and doing excercises, she did a good job, this book worth all the money u pay for it, it explaines grammar rule and then gives you excercises so that you can memorize the material better, of all japanese books i have looked through this one is the best one, you wont regret ever when you purchase it, it makes studying so easy, just amazing!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a workbook","review":"I was looking for a complete guide to Japanese adjectives, this isn't it.

The batman is not the cartoon for die hard fans of batman over the age of 3. The show is written for a much younger audience that does not need a captivating script and deep charactors. Instead this show focuses on the action sequences and way too many witty comebacks.I have to say this, but what the heck is the Penguin doing when he is fighting batman?

He talked about his role in the Montreal Screwjob & how he justified his actions by claiming that he's \\"loyal to the company\\". What a load of cock & bull! Let's not forget that Shawn's one of the most unprofessional men to ever wear all of wrestling's major titles, & that his unwillingness to job is the stuff of nightmares. He has lessened the prestige of those titles by refusing to lose them cleanly, & his actions at Montreal has even more lessened the prestige of the WWF Title.Don't believe the lies, people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heart Break Jerk","review":"This guy is a jerk and always will be a jerk The people Shawn Michaels screwed over is a long list. He was never a big draw as champion and had a mediocre arsenal of moves. Grant it Michaels was a good punching bag like Ricky Morton of the Rock N Roll Express. But could never carry a match like Hart, Sting, Flair or Steamboat.He blames Bret well hell he made Bret insane with his antics. HHH as well is responsible with his daddy in law Vince for Montreal. I'm glad his body is falling apart. He wants to come across as a so-called Christian. He's like most religous people full of it. He just does to keep his ex-stripper wife around. This guy is pure trash!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Determination","review":"I have been a wrestling fan for as long as I can remember. I have enjoyed following the career of Shawn Michaels over the years and really appreciated how he comes sforth in his book to show the ins and outs of the wrestling world. Most people who follow wrestling understands the art of the business while others are stuck in the fake vs. not fake aspect. I enjoyed reading about the friendships among the wrestlers as well as the \\"heat.\\" I would recommed this book to anyone. I could not stop reading it. I hope that in the future he will write a book that is soley based on his God changed his life and his work in the ministry. He is a wonderful inspiration and I look forward to reading more from him in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait","review":"When wrestlers started penning their books about their lives, I was hoping this one would be written. I waited, and it was well worth the wait. My only complaint, and not much of one, would be I wish there was more about the famous Montreal Screw Job story. More of the side stories to it. But it was mentioned to get a good idea of what went down. Fun read, glad to read about his born again life and how it came about."},{"rating":"1","title":"HBK Goody Two Shoes","review":"I have always enjoyed watching HBK in the ring. I have been on a kick of reading wrestler autobiographies of late, so reading this one was a must on my list.While it is not a bad read, HBK (and/or his ghostwriter)sugarcoats himself to the point the reader may be tempted to roll his or her eyes. Although he swears he never tried to hold anyone back, he then talks about being in a meeting with the Kliq and Vince and giving his opinion on who is \\"deadweight\\". There are many more contradictions of this nature throughout the book. By the end of the book you have the feeling that Shawn has just been trying to charm you over to his side and has no faults.Much better reads on this subject matter includeHitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestlingor either of Chris Jericho's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting bitter old man","review":"I picked up Shawn Micheals audobiography at a book store and read the introduction at first I thought what Shawn said was really nice a little too nice and what he was saying was honost. Then of course I turned to the only interesting part of his carrer, the montreal screw job and I was disgusted with what he had to say. He claims that he \\"Shawn\\" and he \\"Shawn\\" alone thought of the screw-job, that really pissed me off. Secondly what really up set me, was he never expressed any remorse for what he did after all of this time, thirdly he really cuts Bret Hart up and paints Bret Hart off to be some arrogant jerk. I think in reality Shawn is a really bitter old person and I really hope Bret Hart mentions Shawn Micheals audobiorgraphy in his up-coming book and cuts Shawn up"},{"rating":"2","title":"HBK FAN COLLECTIBLE","review":"AWESOME READ!!!from start to finish this man puts it all on the line and tells it how it is.

It didn't seem like it was an honest portrayal of who he is. The book was also very boring at times. I wasn't impressed. If you want to read about wrestlers read Ric Flair or Bret Harts book. Both were light years better than HBKs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book full of ignorance","review":"This book gets horrible marks simply for the idiotic and ignorant statement regarding Bret Hart.

Your version of the truth is filled with lies, skipping over facts and burying quality wrestlers...His comments about Bret Hart are absolutely deplorable and Shawn should be ashamed of himself...In the ring he was one of the best ever, but outside the ring he is a disgrace to the wrestling business...Thank goodness there are books from Mick Foley and Bret Hart that are sincere, from the heart and actually honest...This book contains none of those qualities..."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor performance","review":"I tried this system for two days. Several times when I tried to answer a call the handset would say \\"Connecting ...\\" for 30 seconds or a minute before I could talk on the call.

You can use all of these and the speakerphone on the base if you wish.The one con I found is that you need to enter long distance numbers with the 1-area code in phone book but caller ID on the phone doesn't identify them because they process the number without the 1.Do I have something wrong-don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"19 minute battery life no matter what","review":"My handset is placed back on the charger every time I'm not on the phone and still it only has a 19 minute battery life for a call.

Ill-conceived, silly premise, poorly paced, etc. etc.Over half the movie is stupid training shots - climbing walls, jogging, etc. One plot twist is completely implausible (involving contents of cargo). A ragtag bunch of kids takes on Hezbollah? Please.This is an embarrassment to all Christian movie-makers anywhere. To those who gave it good reviews - you are doing everyone a grave disservice. If you really enjoyed it, OK, otherwise, I'd consider it deceitful."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Long","review":"I waited awhile to see this film and at the price I thought I'll get it. Then I was disappointed in the film. The story line was great a group of Christians that specialize in helping persucuted Christians and bringing needed aid. But the acting was very flat and unemotional. There was to many characters that you can't get attached to. Not enogh time on the charcters to get to know them. They seemed to be just there. The gospel message was not really there either. The training scenes were way to long, they covered almost half of the film and tried to be a b rate music video. As another christian film maker I was diappoined greatly. Give it was a lower budget, but I have worked with 0 budget films and they came out more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"My wife and I downloaded this film thinking it sounded somewhat intriguing. However, I now regret doing so, and I have apologized to my wife for wasting our time. There is no character development whatsoever, almost no plot, long sequences that add nothing to the film, and a horrible soundtrack that constantly plays (with music that usually does not fit in any way with what is happening on screen). On top of all this, the \\"faith\\" aspect of the film is very superfical and unrealistic. There were several times I thought to just turn it off, but we persevered to the end. We really wanted to like it, but Squad 77 did not deliver. I think you will enjoy this film only if you were part of the cast or crew or are among their relatives and friends. Otherwise, I recommend avoiding it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I Fracking Thinking DO NOT D LOAD","review":"(warning, I had to rate this at one star to post this review, the option for zero or negative stars was not available)Another movie that left me wanting a refund or a freaking reset button!

All her songs are delivered in a sweetly expressive style with melodies so lovely, you'll find yourself humming her tunes all day long.

It features about eight different models in very tame scenarios. This is nowhere near the explicit fare you would expect from Penthouse. Penthouse does this from time to time (repackages old footage and sticks their name on it). It's kind of deceptive and doesn't do justice to their reputation for generally offering a quality product. This DVD should come with a warning to Penthouse fans - \\"Beware, no pink\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accidentally voted for it","review":"While browsing for a case for my new Ipod, Amazon asked me to vote on which of two cases I liked best. I clicked on this one to learn more about it, but that was read as a vote. Oops. Be careful when you look at their polls.In reading of similar products, many, many people complain about clear plastic covers scratching. However, they also complain about thicker covers being hard to handle. I would probably cut out the offending part with a razor blade, and buy the adhesive clear cover to attach directly to the Ipod in its place. This would also protect the Ipod when being pulled in and out. However, this case has a bigger plastic piece and probaby couldn't be done this way.I think a side-opening cover is inconvenient.I've seen a clear acrylic hard case after use. It is a terribly scratched up item.Remember that you may have to remove your Ipod from its case to use a dock like Ihome, etc. This action can scratch the Ipod.

I rarely come across a book that I don't finish and to tell you the truth, she made me return the book. Her bland and simplistic writing style didn't go well with me. At times, this book even put me to sleep. Anyway, the real significant drawback of this book is that it is written in an extremely narraw perspective!

I can verify the issues others have pointed out about the reader having problems staying connected. It will mount and unmount itself. The issue that is of more concern is the quality and mounting of the pins in the compact flash section of the reader. They are made of such light gage wire that it is very easy to bend or break the pins. If one of the pins breaks off in a CF card, good luck trying to recover that card. The potential for damaged cards is so great that I would have given this item zero stars if the site would let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere","review":"I picked this up because it states on the packaging that it works with Windoze Vista.

It doesn't see the SDHC card, and the slot is too physically small for a Microdrive/CF Type II card, even though the package says it is compatible.

I bought this unit because of it's claim to support micro-SD cards; however, it doesn't seem to support them directly, but instead through a separate mini-SD to SD adapter.

But the one thing that holds this album down is that this style/sound has been done before by others and with more passion and originality. \\"Dragonfly\\" isn't much different than what you heard on \\"Spirit of Music,\\" and, unfortunately, it doesn't better what was there.It's an OK, mellow, solid listen, but just not better than what ZM & MM fans will likely already have in their collections.It's a pleasant enough solo excursion, but this ZM & MM fan is still waiting for the group to release a version of \\"Uncle Sam,\\" which it was playing while it was last on tour.\\"Dragonfly\\" is for hardcore ZM & MM fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragonfly Has No Wings","review":"After \\"Spirit of Music\\" I thought ZMMM as a group were slipping.

I ended up getting so frustrated with the book that I left it on the Subway hoping a bum could put it to better use by using it to fuel a fire. What I was able to make it through was scattered and lacked direction. The characters are cliche and lack any emotional depth.

Just page after paiful page of unnatural and stiff dialog, contrived situations and impossible twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Though David Eddings has one plot and one plot only, his characters and dialogue easily make up for this.

Eddings' narrative devotes multiple pages to building up various baddies, who are then dispatched in the space of one when encountered by omnipotent heroes. Very shortly anything the villains say sounds trite and inconsequential, however threatening. The entire series should have 'Suspense Free!' stamped on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT!","review":"PLEASE don't waste your money on this book. It is SO boring that I put it down halfway through. Unless you like a book that puts you to sleep in the middle of day. So, please, turn off your computer and go outside and play.

This whole business with Garion and Ce'Nedra fighting at the beginning caused me to lose my lunch on several occasions. It wasn't a total loss, I lost five pounds. Then again, I regained 10 after giving up in frustration and eating the book. Here's a tip: Take 'Guardians of the West' and simmer it until the pages brown. Douse heavily with BBQ sauce. Place between two halves of a bun. Voila, you've just made an Eddings burger. Eating the books is way more intelligent than actually reading them, after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"This book had a lot of good reviews, so I was suprised that I couldn't get past about page 30. I tried to read the other series with the same characters, and couldn't get into it either. The characters are utterly stereotypical and forgetable, and I didn't care what happened to any of them. I have only not finished about 5 books ever (and I read at least one thick fantasy or sci-fi book a week), and this author scored 2 out of the 5. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensless, repeditive vomit.","review":"This book was the greatest... if you're having problems falling asleep. Same ol', same ol'. Nothing changes. No one dies, exept some loser who never says or does anything. And the characters are all above any sort of temptation. They have no desires people!!! You know, it would be kinda entertaining if Eddings added something new to his novels... A TWIST? The baddies are so dumb it's sad. The good guys come, stomp some guys, come to some retarded cave and some blind person has a choice between lite and dark... GUESS WHO WINS?It may be entertaining if Eddings wrote a book like Invasion, where characters arn't afraid to go over to evil. In fact it happens reguarly.However, asking for anything more would be asking Eddings to get four times better in writing skill. He has no new ideas in any of his books EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total insult to The Belgariad","review":"\\"Gaurdians of the West\\" is just the beginningof another \\"OH GOSH WHAT AN ORIGINAL PLOT A CHILD DISCOVERS HIDDEN POWERS ANDMUST FULFIL AN ANCIENT PROPHECY TO DEFEAT AND ANCIENT EVIL ANDSAVE THE WORLD OH WOW OH MY I THINK I'LL GO AND STICK MY HEAD IN ACUPBOARD\\" series!

It's sad though that Mandorallen,Hettar,Barak and Lelldorin won't be coming along.

So first someone tries to kill ce'nedra, then someone tries to maker her kill her baby, then someone kills brand, and none of these things caused them to worry enough to leave a guard on ce'nedra when the men leave to fight their war. So when someone steals you kid, I. Just. Don't. Care.Buy this if you liked the Belgariad and want to know what happens to Silk and Mandorallen. There are whole chapters you can skip that do nothing but characterize Garion as a whipped, whiny brat.Oh and the premise: The last prophecy was only a prelude, there's another prophecy that only matters if the first prophecy was fulfilled.Poorly written. Poorly edited. But it's got enough to it that I'll probably finish it. It would be a great starter fantasy though. Someday I'll give it to my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"Eddings in the Malloreon shows again that he is one of fantasies greats!. The story is a ton of fun and I honestly cant think of anything wrong...well, I could have handled a tad more magic, but that's all.The Malloreon isnt as good as the Belgareon, but it sure is worth it!The Malloreon rates in my top 10 all time reads/series with the likes of Martin, Erikson and Tolkien.. Of course Eddings is much more fantasy \\"lite\\" than those guys, but he is a extremely fun author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garblings of the Worst","review":"Disappointing and very lightweight. I didn't read the Belgariad but I don't think that mattered at all. I think Eddings deliberately stretched this out for the MONEY!! Most of the book deals with a series of crises for Garion and his queen, Ce'Nedra. They aren't having sex...Wah!! They don't have any kids...Wah! Those guys are fighting, make them stop...Wah!! The old king died, what do we do...Wah! Those people don't want to listen to me and are leaving the kingdom. Whine, whine, whine. My advice would be to start with the last 100 pages where events are set up for the next novel or just skip to the summary of the next novel, as one other reviewer suggested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any book of David Eddings is worth the time and money","review":"I read all the books of David Eddings, i don't remember how many, but i can tell you this, if you enjoy books from the Dragonlance from Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, or if you only enjoy good action and fantasy books, this is your stuff. Maybe they are not as good as Darksword, but is good enough to keep you hours reading. I enjoyed this book so much, as many, many other fantasy books i have read. So take my advice (i'm not an expert but i have read like 60 or more fantasy books), and buy this book (but first buy the Belgariath ones, if you don't do that you will miss the first part).

It's his favourite toy. He has so many electronic toys we decided to go with the good old fashioned long lasting toys for his birthday. This one was his favourite. He carries it around baning the drum and blowing in both the whistles. He can't quite blow one end of the whistle, but that doesn't bother him at all. He loves the fact that he can do the other end of it. This was a good toy for him. As for educational, I think that there are many things to discover on it. For such a small toy it has a lot of intrinsic value. He can bang, shake, tilt, rattle, whistle, and wizz this one man band to his heart's content and it will always be interesting. even my four year old daughter likes to play with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly obsolete!

I have both a short and long haired cat, and it works wonders on both. Other brushes just weren't getting all the dead fur off the short hair or random mats out of the long hair, this one tool serves all my purposes.

I am very pleased with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for short hair cats.","review":"Both of my cats are domestic short hairs, and this comb seems to be designed for much longer hair breads, which is not what it says in the description.

It's not billed as a flea comb, but it still \\"grabs\\" a few fleas along with their black specks.

I actually bought several other specific \\"dematting tools\\" that worked relatively nicely, but my cat hated them. I bought this one as a last resort before I would be forced to cut the mats out, and am extremely surprised at how well it worked. It may be a shedding comb, but most of the mats I had (large ones as well) combed right off. A few smaller, tighter ones required a few more brushes, but it didn't hurt him (although it took me a few tries to figure out how to de-mat him without hurting him). Am thrilled that the edges are blunt, not sharp, unlike most other tools. It doesn't hurt my cat, and am not afraid to press it gently against his skin.This tool is a de-shedder, de-matter and massager all-in-one. The only mistake is I didn't buy this sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I love this comb. It combed mats out of my ragdolls mane, while she purred!!

As an amatuer oboe player, I was curious enough to order the CD and was pleasantly surprised when I listened to it. This is a serious jazz album, with harmonic, melodic and rhythmic complexities to delight any jazz lover looking for something unusual. I was most curious about Paul Mccandless' oboe playing, which was great, as was his soprano saxophone work. But the string bass and percussion were also impressive. I also liked the HUGE variety of styles on this CD; all were played with great finesse, sensitivity, and enthusiasm. This is a great addition to my CD library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Note on the Sound Quality","review":"This is a very good sounding disk.

Where did the originality go? Some of the other reviews consider this to be a mellower, more melodic sound. I'd call it uninspired pop. It really could pass for Muzak jazz in the department store.

The liner is made of a flimsy material, but I have not had any problems.

They are indeed lightweight, compact, easy to focus, let in adequate light, and the view is very sharp and clear. My only complaint is that the strap attaches forward of the center of gravity so that the binocular has a tendency to flip upside-down against my bosom.

In fact I have had to buy 2 copies of this cd because I have always been playing this cd.

These guys deliver riveting melodies and powerful lyrics backed by new agebeats. But through all the contemporary beats, the timeless messages about Jesus and living a saved life shine through! The only downside is that the instrumental is all synthesized. If the music was actually played (via instruments) I think Phase 2 would be an even more un-stoppable force in Gospel Music. However they've already made their mark in the history and FUTURE of Gospel music. I definitely wasn't disappointed but the best way to judge is to try it on for size yourself!

The orchestral playing is good enough and Puccini's colorful score gets a vivid, if not truly exceptional reading. Unfortunately, the singing leaves much to be desired. Jane Eaglen's Turandot is underpowered and she sounds like the character's same old haughty self even when she's supposed to be won over by Calaf's love. This is a very one-dimensional and uninteresting characterisation. Dennis O'Neill is caught here past his prime. Some of the high notes (and high lying passages) are rather effortful and the tenor is not in very fresh voice. Mary Plazas gives a tender performance of Liu with some beautifully spin-out high notes. Hers is the best performance of the set. The other roles are adequately taken but it's good of have Gedda as the Emperor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eaglen disappoints","review":"Jane Eaglen has often been touted as the coming great dramatic soprano.

Beep! Sheep in a Jeep...\\", so I really looked forward to getting him \\"Ship in a Shop\\"... On the one hand, it's very cute, and the illustrations are utterly endearing with lots of color and detail, but on the other hand it lacks some of the rhythm and rhyme of Jeep which put it so high above the level of other boardbooks.

As other reviewers have written, the holes for accepting the wires are too small for quality gauge wiring like that made for running within walls. Plus, the screws intended to grip the wires do not get a tight enough grip to hold them while you insert the unit into the wall box. You have to attach 8 wires - 4 incoming, 4 outgoing -- but getting and keeping all 8 attached while installing the unit is nigh impossible, even after trimming the gauge back to fit in the holes. At least one pops loose in every attempt. I gave up and ordered a competitor's product -- the Niles Audio VCS100R.

It's silly, cheesy, and totally ridiculous....and I like it!!. I'm always a sucker for stupid B movie films like this. It's fun and funny in a really stupid way. Andrew Lowery stars as a kid who has the hots for a girl. In an attempt to show off to her, he gets killed by a store robber. He comes back as a zombie and begins to live life as if nothing ever happened. Of course, there are certain body parts that fall off and stuff, but that's to be expected from a rotting corpse. There are a few jokes and gags in here that are genuinely funny, in a sophmoric way. The best come from chacrter actor Austin Pendleton as a nutty doctor. The rest of the cast include : Paul Dooley, Edward Herrmann, Cloris Leachman, and Mary Beth Hurt. It's a juvenile comedy with a somewhat delightful and appealing presence.

I think it sets out to do everything it accomplishes. It's supposed to be a hokey, cheesy movie about a zombie; that softens the blow for what it's really about. In some of Johnny's darkest moments, I can see myself. A zombie? No. The ultimate outcast, doomed to be unpopular no matter what I do, heralded as a dork even after I'm dead? Yeah, that's me. Or it has been me. Or I have a cousin who was like that. No matter where you are on the high school caste system, you can probably relate. And then, in that touching scene near the end of the movie, I can see a subplot. Two teens, torn apart by popularity, only to discover each other too late. *sniff* C'mon, this movie never tried to be an Oscar contender, but it delivers what it promises, which is more than I can say for, oh, I don't know, TITANIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continual pain","review":"Never worked properly in windows 2000, but that could be due to something else.

However, I was very disappointed by the reception. My computer that I used this card in, is no more than 30 feet from the router, which has proven itself to me in many ways. But, the wireless Netgear card's reception stinks! Signal quality and strength typically stays around 20-30%, and 35% if I'm lucky. This was not the case with certain USB wireless cards and the Linksys PCI Wireless network card. I attribute the poor reception to the small size of antenna.

At a distance of 80 to 90 feet through the house the MA311 gets a 30% signal at best, and the MA401 gets 0% and will not connect to router. Tech support stepped me though a few things.

Fowler tries to describe some common domain problems and introduce various patterns that are supposed to deal with them.Some of them are quite nice and good at least to think about, but other were explained in very abstract manner, with weird (pre UML) pictures of often over-complicated problematics that poorly illustrated the domain problem.If your job is programming, you won't miss much if you ignore this book. If you are analyst, you should at least consider it, but it still isn't what you call \\"must read\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ground Breaking, and Ahead of its time","review":"When Fowler wrote this book, patterns were still in its infancy in the IT world. His book was a brilliant eye opener and in my view never got the recognition it should receive. Analysis patterns lays the ground work for thinking about business information entities, business activities, and business processes as belonging to a family of archetypes that can be characterized across all organizations. The power of this thinking has been proved correct as we have evolved business models in the internet age. In my review of the book linked below, it is clear that this notion of business patterns plays a key role in being able to control the emerging infrastructure beast that is affecting all of IT.AsNext Generation Datacenters in Financial Services: Driving Extreme Efficiency and Effective Cost Savings (Complete Technology Guides for Financial Services)Fowler is a pioneer and this book should be on every serious IT professionals book shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swimming through mud.","review":"I found this book very hard to work with. I'm convinced that the book's models and ideas have merit once they can be understood but getting that level of understanding is being very difficult. I've had colleagues also attempt to get to grips with this book to see if was just me, but all of us have had the same problem. This book explains scenarios at a reasonably understandable level for each of the examples and then dives very quickly into the abstract without a clear path of how things relate to the original problems. Other issues were the use of smalltalk for examples (smalltalk may be a fine language, but it's hardly intuitive for c,java or vb programmers), and the decision not to use UML for diagrams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb, but abstract. Concise, detailed and highly valuable","review":"I really do like Martin Fowlers books. He is bright, clear, rigorous and relevant. This is his first book and most difficult to grasp book. I started reading it a few years ago and had to give up: it was too abstract for me to grasp. Now with a few more years of OO and pattern experience it shines at me in all its beauty.This book condenses so much Analysis/Architecture/Modeling knowledge that it is difficult to come up with an idea to tackle the abstraction problem. Examples might help but how many does one need. I guess far too many.Still I have a wish: Please write a new edition with UML diagrams and sample code in JAVA.Then I also do have a big wish: I want more of this topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little dispointed for an excellent book","review":"This is certainly a good book about patterns. I found it clearly written by the author. Also he provided his own graphics symbols on the front and back pages in his book so we can understand the patterns in his book. However, he chose smalltalk to explain his codes. I think most readers are more familiar with C++ or Java than smalltalk. I wish he could provide those sample code on the addison-wesley web site (or his own site) with Java or C++. He promised (in his book, page xix) to put \\"further materials to keep this book alive\\". However, I did not see much update on this site or his own home page on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended! Natural. Anxiety?

RN seems to be against everything and everyone in America accept those who are exactly like them. It's pretty ironic how this band is so headstrong on not hurting animals but love singing about torturing humans...(Just a sidenote, it seems that the new trend of metal bands is to write lirics that are full of hate and just talk about mindless killing, then give an interview speaking out against war and Americans.

I was looking at a listening station at the local record store and i saw the latest Remembering Never cd. I thought SLSGIR was pretty decent so i decided to check this one out. I listened to the first two tracks and thought they were good also, and me being the idiot that i am bought it without skimming through the whole cd. I went home and put it in my cd player and found out that the remaining eight tracks sounded pretty much the same as the first two. It was just the same loud and heavy breakdown over and over again. I was disappointed because the whole cd just lags unlike SLSGIR. It doesn't even matter to me what Remembering Never's beliefs are or that they think hardcore sucks right now. Hardcore is mainly about the music and the message, and the music and the message that Remembering Never brings to the table is unfortunately not good or original at all.

But for the design defect of failing to provide real memory to store the TV-Guide information the Pioneer would be far preferable to the machine I replaced it with when my 533's hard disk failed two days after receiving it from Amazon. If you have time, wait for the 533/633 models to be replaced. The Pioneer human interface is excellent.

Why does it take so long to get programming???2. It is very difficult to find the manual timed programming mode, or to make changes to the TV Guide programming. The menu's are hard to use for this feature (which is mostly the way I want to program).3. There seems to be much less disk space available on the DVR for shows than the older units (which I like SO MUCH BETTER). Maybe this is due to the space TV Guide takes.I would trade my unit for one of the older 420/520 units ASAP!and would not buy another Pioneer DVR until they fix the interface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A DVR-420H or 520H","review":"I have a DVR-420H which is why I strongly advise against the DVR-533-S, which I also own.

Also, the constant thrashing means your drive will come to an early death. If you don't mind having this DVR in the closet so you don't have to hear it all day, then buy this one.
