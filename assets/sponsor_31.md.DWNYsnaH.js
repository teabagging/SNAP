I used to love to read Stephen King or Peter Straub but haven't for quite some time because their writing became too bizarre for my taste.

I actually fell asleep one evening with the book perched on my belly.I didn't like the \\"meandering gunk\\". The rest wasn't even a horror. It wasn't scarey...just gory (the intestine thing wasn't even worth reading - you knew it was coming). There was a lot written and not much said if you know what I mean - I was three quarters of the way through it and was wondering when something was gonna happen - aside from Ty's kidnapping, and Judy's mental break down, can you think of anything? Oh.. Sophie was a nice .. but again...not enough development here.

Unfortunate choice of name, as I kept picturing that bad ol' man of Springfield, C. Monty Burns carrying out the killings (\\"Chop, chop! Excellent!\\"). The book also borrows outrageously from both the film EXORCIST III and the novel THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.

I was then prescribed a cream from the doctor ($50.00!) and had to re-wash ALL my clothes, bedding, everything in baby detergent to get the Tide off. What a pain! Supposedly Tide is notorious for causing allergies. News to me, and I am no longer a Tide user. A friend later told me that her friend's little guy was a very sick boy in the hospital and it was finally determined that he had a severe allergy to Tide. He is all better now.

I am using it as a required text in a graduate-level Design Management course. Intangibles are defined by the authors in twelve areas and each area is succinctly described, each getting about a dozen pages. That's a good balance of a broad description of the subject and the right amount of detail. While this book, published in 2002, is due for a Second Edition to get updates on examples cited as well as discussion of subsequent additions to business management theory and practice, I enthusiastically recommend it. That this first edition is available for extreme bargain prices is a bonus, but the price is not indicative of the book's true value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praising the sacred cow.","review":"First off, I liked this book immensely. It had brilliant ideas about human nature and the origins of religious faith. It was more humanistic than most Dick novels, something sorely lacking in some, but it still uses the ideas to move the characters, which is never good. Here, the characters are made out to be the originators, not just instruments of the ideas, so it does make some sense that they would be motivated to follow the ideas wherever they lead. It's just that this motion tends to turn the characters into robotic true-believers, and thus instruments of the plot. I don't mean to dis, cause PKD is a brilliant thinker, and damned if I could do a better job, I'm just saying that there are unfortunate flaws in his writing style that make him a little less fun to read than say Robert Anton Wilson. Or Tom Robbins. Or Kurt Vonnegut. Or Chuck Palahniuk. Or... nevermind. This is a very good book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult","review":"I found this book very difficult to read. I have read Androids, Valis, Divine Invasion and assorted short stories before cracking this one.

When Newton and Leibniz independently invented the modern infinitesimal calculus in the late 17th century the need for more rigor around the concept of infinity became obvious. Fortunately the 19th century mathematicians Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor established a whole new mathematics of infinity. This part of mathematics is the study of \\"singularities\\". Singularities are currently the \\"unknown unknowables\\" in mathematics, physics and philosophy. To date, only religion claims to have found an (the?) answer on singularities, but I think there must be more to \\"know\\". Cantor's Aleph sets of transfinite numbers may provide the key to the answer. Aleph is the reconstructed name of the first letter of the Proto-Canaanite alphabet but in set theory, the aleph numbers are a sequence of numbers used to represent the cardinality (or size) of infinite sets.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"early maths theory","review":"Very interesting history of the development of mathematical ideas,especially the existence of irrational numbers,and the idea infinity can be approached and used but never reached....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I looked forward to reading The Mystery of Aleph (interesting subject, interesting people), and was disappointed for three reasons. First, it is disjointed, with each story or miniature biography interrupted by another story. Second, the book builds up Cantor as a protagonist, but then does not build his story to any climax or resolution. (I do not expect people's lives to follow literary conventions, but I do expect books to do so.) Finally, the explanation of the mathematics of infinity is very vague: it is neither mathematical enough to follow as math, nor non-mathematical enough to serve as a purely lay explanation. (The same is true of the explanations of Kabalah, which contain just enough information to be frustrating.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aczel's books are disappointing","review":"Aczel has gotten a lot of press, so I read two of his books to evaluate whether to recommend them to my students. I do not recommend his work to anyone. His topics are interesting and important, but his treatment is very disappointing. Light and fluffy writing can help ease laypeople into reading science, if it is organized and accurate. Aczel's is not. He wanders among ideas without developing them in enough depth to appreciate. He poses interesting questions as if he intends to answer them, but does not.Read Simon Singh or Timothy Ferris instead. Just as easy to read, and far more coherent and satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research","review":"Aczel's account of Kabbalah is confused and full of serious mistakes.

Aczel does an excellent job explaining the mathematics at a level that even a non-expert can understand. He also includes a comparison with ideas of infinity in the Kabbalah and does it very well. The psychological portraits of Cantor, as well as Godel and other mathematicians, are very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Logic","review":"I started to read this book.

It is the same way you might feel while cleaning the bathtub with a bleach product without proper ventilation. It has now been 12 days and the fumes are just as bad as day one. While reading the reviews on Babies-R-Us I found that 2 other people experienced the same problem and that it was only the white cribs.

The rest of the chair seemed to be made very sturdy, which made me scratch my head as to why the one critical moving part in the whole construction was an obvious cheap piece of metal that apparently broke in shipment. I was really dissapointed with the product, but very satisfied with how easy it was to return it and get a refund. Thank you Amazon, for being so easy to deal with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Present for Mom","review":"My mom wanted one of these chairs after sitting in one during a Cottage stay last summer.

It is comfortable and fairly durable. I only have two complaints. The bolts holding the chair together tend to fall off if not tightened every once in a while. Also, I am 6'4'' and the chair is a little bit too short for me. Otherwise, this is the perfect chair for it's price.Update: after a couple of months of use, another bolt fell off and the mesh is ripping. I am not sure how much longer it will hold up. Maybe I am too heavy for the chair (250 lbs.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"If i could give this NEGATIVE stars i would!!

The resistance of the heater is 3.8 ohms, but in the specs for my car, it says resistance must be 11-16 ohms. So it draws too much current. Either the oxygen sensor is broken or it's not built to specification. Either way, this sensor does not work for my car. I've called their warranty service line which is a recording, and haven't heard back from them.Other than that, the part looks and feels sturdy and fit perfectly. However the smartlink connector was a pain to set up, it took a few hours.If I had to do it all over I would probably by an OE style oxygen sensor not from Bosch."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a rotten \\"toy\\"","review":"If you want to torture your child with a great looking train-type thing that he can't touch, this is the thing for you. It's designed to look like a child's toy, but it takes an hour to get it up and running (waaaay beyond the average 7 year old's attention span), and then once it's running, you can't touch anything or it won't work.

Once it is on there...you can not touch it otherwise you will spend another 20 minutes trying to get it back on. My son was 3 and trying to tell him to just watch was useless. we packed up bolth and brought them to the good will store. It was such a hassle and way to many little pieces to put together. Stick with the wooden trains and tracks the kids love to scoot them around and put the tracks together...more hands on. This was a waist of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Big Big Bummer!!!","review":"We just received the Thomas Big Big Loader for my son's 3rd birthday; we were very excited, because my son LOVES trains...especially Thomas-related trains. Unfortunately, our excitement turned to disappointment quickly, when we first realized the quality of the toy is pretty bad. To our greatest disappointment, however, is the fact that you can not engage yourself with this toy...you can only watch it....THAT'S IT! The recommended age for this toy is 3-8 years old...what a joke...a one year old would be bored with this toy in one month! Anyway, we're bringing it back...all it does is work by itself, do the same thing over and over, and take up space on our floor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for dads not kids","review":"Setting this up was not as difficult as others have made it seem. However, once set up, you just watch it. There is no interaction. In fact, my 5 year old wants to play with it and touch things, which just causes it not to work until I fix it back the way it was.As an engineer, I think I bought this more for myself.

He spent his own birthday money that he received from his grandmother on it, and perhaps learned the lesson that the flashiest toys are not necessarily the most fun. The set up is not easy - daunting even for an adult (hint - make sure that the ramps for Thomas and the Lorry are correct - they look the same, but small difference will prevent the set from working if you get them mixed up). Once it was working, it was fascinating. . . for about 15 minutes. Then he wanted to play with it, but even the smallest jolt throws it off. The kids that would most enjoy it, I think, are younger than the 3-5 recommended range, but because of choking hazard, they are not suppose to use it. Overall, a disappointment - money would be better spent on other Thomas gear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating disappointment","review":"I assembled two Big Big loaders. Neither of them would complete one cycle of operation. The parts would not align properly, causing jams and not permiting the engine to reverse when it was supposed to at the top of the spiral tower.

The manufacturer did not return two e-mails.This toy would only frustrate a small child, not to mention frustrating the adult who must assemble it.Both Big Big loaders have been returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG BIG...Pain","review":"It takes a lot to frustrate me or my child but this toy did it pretty easily. The toy is not hands on (try to tell that to a 3 yr old). As soon as you touch it it falls apart. Some of the parts don't fit snuggly , so they constantly have to be adjusted. It has a strong motor, so when it derails(pretty often) it falls apart. Would not recomend at all.

Our only real complaint is that Barbie moves slowly through the carnival setting. We always want her to run - especially when following a hot clue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Play","review":"This game was fun and exiting to play. You find neat clues, follow footprints and look for handprints, and even chase suspects on cool rides. The clues and the theif/kidnapper change each time, and it is always fun to see where the clues lead you too. The only problem with it is that Barbie walks way too slow! If only she would ever run, maybe the game would be more exiting and less frustrating when you try to get her to move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie walks into walls, benchs ...etc","review":"My 6 year old daughter was initially very engaged and excited about playing. However, Barbie is very hard to manipulate, and a large part of the game is simply trying to get barbie to walk without bumping into things. My daughter was very tenacious and played for about 2 hours then was frustrated to tears when the game wouldn't let her in the room whe wanted to go to get the tools she didn't know she had to pick up.

Several minor editing mistakes. The section on calibrating your camera using a macbeth color checker could use more work including a hue/sat color chart as a reference.

Most movies with this theme are sure to get a star. As for all the rest, it's like pulling teeth trying to squeeze a star or two out of this Halliwell guy. I'm baffled at how a movie like \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\" gets four stars while \\"Titanic\\" only gets two. The best part about this book is reading the reviews of the bad movies.

Is their any critic who actually enjoys movies?"},{"rating":"1","title":"As useless as Walker's pedantic introduction","review":"I have long been searching for a good film guide, and this is definitely not it. First of all, the editor's introduction is an updated listing of the retail prices of DVD players and DVD videos! Excluding the opening sentence, the intro does not contain one comment about the book that it is introducing! Also, the author's reliance on the social and critical acceptance of the films blinds him to the true works of genius in the under-appreciated. The work is as bland as possible, the writing dry, and the reviews without conjecture. If you want a cynical compendium of overdone epithets by the author and other stuffy critics, than this book might be for you. Otherwise, if you enjoy movies like me, I advise you to stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooty and snide.","review":"Looking to rent a movie to watch with the kids? Well, this book will fill you in on such crucial information as production company, writer, and photographer, but won't give you a clue as to plot, sexual content or violence. It rates a large percentage of decent movies with zero stars (out of four), leaving you to guess if they're worthwhile. (Meanwhile, apparently every film out of France is a can't-miss.) The supercilious tone throughout is irritating. Sample tidbits: the jazz-related \\"'Round Midnight\\" appeals only to \\"minorities\\" (what is THAT supposed to mean?!) and let's see, \\"Wizard of Oz\\" rates 3 stars. This book is for cinema snobs only...average filmgoers will find it less than useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Band Hawkins","review":"These are just about the only recordings of the short lived Hawkins big band. Taken from various radio broadcasts in 1940, they show a solid band with some good soloists including Joe Guy on trumpet. The sound is prety good for radio recordings.The band never took off and lasted less than a year. Hawkins went back to small bands and rarely played with a big band again."},{"rating":"1","title":"plain rubbish.....","review":"i was really disappointed reading this book- the dialogues were corny, giving useless information (and in a rather stupid maner, might i add), un-explained actions which only seemed to serve the plot, and a general feeling that the author has read too many pulp fiction and cloak and dagger books, and REALLY wanted to write one, too. the lines are so over dramatic, that you can actually envision the scene ending with a soap-opera close-up.absolutely terrible....avoid at all cost!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too generic","review":"I had to check to see when this was written, because it is so devoid of current technology, it could easily have been written in the 60s or 70s. The villain, Dr. Goslar, is one of those all-powerful shadowy figures usually seen in pulp fiction (e.g., Fu Manchu). If he is so powerful and such a threat with some new biological weapon, why are there only a few agents attempting to bring him down? And why does Goslar fail again and again to kill them? There is also a plot twist involving sisters which I saw coming at least three hundred pages early. Weak, especailly when stacked up against say, Frederick Forsyth or Andy McNab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Dark Textures","review":"This is a beautiful contemplative recording. The South Dakota Suite sends shivers up my spine, and the Isiah 40 makes me cry, it is so beautiful. The choir is balanced and every nuance carries weight. I would have liked to hear more contrasts in the musical selections, the quick tempo selections are sparingly distributed. It is rich in texture, and the sound is gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, not so great instructions.","review":"This product is great! Carrying the kayaks to the water is a breeze now. We used to just carry them to the water one at a time and once we were done kayaking, our arms were so tired, we really didn't feel like carrying them back to the car.The only problem was the instructions on how to put the carrier together didn't make much sense. We just kind of figured it out as we went along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"We bought it hoping it would be satisfactory for moving a small fiberglass dinghy up and down a rocky beach, on an island where the tides average 13 feet. It does not measure up to that stringent requirement. But on more ordinary surfaces it is just fine. We have those other uses for it, too. It'll be nice for moving kayaks down to the lake. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all-around cart","review":"This is a very versatile cart, and due to the more square construction, can be used for carting more things around the yard than just canoes & kayaks. No issues of collapsing if you pull it the wrong direction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate items not ready-to-go out of the box","review":"Both of my unit's inner wheel guards were factory installed backwards. Therefore when you tighten the locknut, the inner wheel guard presses against the spokes preventing the wheels from turning. The unit is welded, so I do not see a way to flip the inner wheel guards. It took some time to determine what the problem was as the blurry black and white pictures on the instructions are virtually worthless. Pacific Cycle placed a red piece of paper in the instructions begging the consumer not to return the product to the store but to call their toll free number to correct any problems. Unfortunately, it's Friday, the 3rd of July, and they're off for the holiday. Since my 4th of July plans are not important enough to Pacific Cycle, I'm returning the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"large enough for the larger kayak","review":"This is my second carrier. The 1st one, smaller, (2 years old now), works great for my 14'. The extra weight of my loon 160T needed a strong, easy to wheel through sand, grass, dirt cart. My camping sites are always a few hundred feet away, this carrier makes the walk easier and possible. Attaching the kayak takes some work to stay where I wanted it, but I solved that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my 16\\" canoe","review":"Just reverse the cradles, to get a wider stable stand. Use a bigger pump to inflate the tires, the one they provide is useless. I used the one I use for my bike, a \\"T-pump\\". And when you fold the cart, do NOT tighten the axles screws. This cart is perfect for small and large canoes. Better than any other, and cheap enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent canoe carrier","review":"This carrier is solidly built. I did modify the strap: I bought a metal hook with a spring closure at Wal-mart in the boating section, $4.00. I cut the threads and took off the hook that came with it and sewed this new one on. I took the hook off the other side and sewed it directly onto the frame. This allows me to strap the boat down without needing a helper. I also slipped a piece of tubing over the new hook so it would not scrap the frame. The large wheels roll over rocks and roots easily. The tire could be replaced with non pneumatic tires, I found some at TSC, but they are heavy and expensive. This has a coated steel frame, very strong but not too heavy. The wheels fold in and it stores easily in my canoe. I would have to stow in on the deck of my kayak however. Much stronger and easier to push that anything else on the market, a number of which I have tried. Bought it for $99 on sale through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cart that carries the kayak with ease.","review":"Works well with my Ocean Kayak 14 ft. scupper Pro.

A good CD to listen to when you want to relax, or as background ambience. The guitar synth work by Barry is exceptional and unique. My favorite song is track 4 called Way Station. I love the soprano sax with that 12 string guitar. The last song Old Trees is very nice with its haunting groove. I would recommend this CD to anyone that might like something a little hipper than Kenny G."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hardware included","review":"The holder does not have the necessary hardware to install it. It came only with two screws. According to instructions, the mounting bracket with a spring is required to install the paper holder but it has to be purchased separately.

Without mounting hardware the paper holder is unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I order","review":"It was perfect. I would have liked a big roll role holder.

My husband was able to install it without using the spring, and the toilet paper roll fits in it just fine. We were replacing one of the same model which was at least 20 years old, so I hope this one lasts that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of C***P!","review":"Purchased this item, and while it was nice enough looking, it broke within 4 months.

Gatco claims this product is forged brass, plated with chrome. It is NOT brass at all. it IS cheap stamped steel. Check with a magnet, brass is not magnetic. I want brass to minimize corrosion in my bathroom which as you may suspect gets humid around bath time. The chrome plating already has damage on the back which would lead to problems in short order. Going to contact Gatco to learn more, i sure hope Gatco makes good stuff and not this junk. buyer beware, if it can be faked, it will get faked.

This was the only one that I could find at a reasonable price. It works fine and was easy to install. At a glance it looks fine but is very light weight almost kind of tinny feeling.When the toilet paper is in the part that shows is fine. I think that before we installed it we could have bent it in half. Hopefully it stands up better than it looks. I can't believe that there aren't more choices out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toilet Tissue Roll Holder","review":"This item is very nice. It was received very quickly with no damage.

It is poorly designed, it doesnt have the round flat mesh in the middle for the jar to sit on. Threee bars makes the heavy jar above VERY wobbly. Its also too big for most jars. After I received one I sent an email telling them what they sent is not what I bought based on their description, since there is no number to call, to get an RMA, they never responded. Amazon stepped in to refund the purchase price. Cost me $12 to send it back to get a refund.

How much fun it may be...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for a few minutes","review":"Although the idea is neat, this toy lost its fun factor after a few times. The smoke solution is dangerous for children and a parent should handle it at all times, which is not by idea of a fun toy. If a child is scared to touch the toy then it is not so fun anymore. Also, after it smokes and you shoot the cannon your child might get bored. My 7 year old sure did. It's a cute cannon, but not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"BULLSH*T","review":"They, whoever did this, placed a really cheap product with a photo of a totally different and a lot more expensive one.

Major storage problem","review":"I don't know what for or how other people would be using this tool, but I don't see it fitting comfortably in anyone's hand. Not an adult's nor a child's. I have other OXO Good Grips items that I am pleased with because they increase the utility of the product or are multi-functional.The handle is much larger than my medium sized hammer handle. It is so over kill for my uses. I would only be scraping the last bit of cake batter or frosting out of a bowl; a dainty two- or three- finger exercise at most. This tool requires five fingers, a hand, a wrist, and a forearm, wow. The white rubber portion is average sized and looks puny by comparison.And where do you store it! To fit in my utensil drawer I would have to evict 4 or 5 of the current tenants.

This worked far better than the 400 CD changer I originally attempted to use for my snacking.Now that I've solved my cracker problem, I must say I was able to pay full attention to this DVD, and only occasionally passed out due to the amount of sodium I was consuming. And I must say I don't get it. What happened to the Chicken Lady and Buddy Cole and Hecubus? Now they work in a radio factory of some sort, I don't get it.

Every now and then the episode will appear just slightly \\"blurry\\", even on my HDTV with the appropriate 4:3 settings.That being said, the content itself is first rate. You won't find a show as consistently funny from episode to episode as this one. Unlike other comedies from the 90s (\\"Ben Stiller Show\\", \\"Seinfeld\\") this one holds up well and except for occasional out-dated references (Unibomber) and out-dated cell-phones and laptops, could just as easily have been done last year.This is the definitive \\"Office\\" comedy.

This show was every bit as funny, if not funnier than Seinfeld. However, due to the geniuses at NBC the show failed to gain large ratings. This was a result of the NBC execs moving the shows day and time slots just about every two weeks. This shows strength was in it's characters. It's one of those shows like Friends where the writers build a familiarity with the character over time, and after watching a few episodes you feel like you actually know these people, which makes the situations they are placed in even more hilarious. I hope they plan on releasing the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD!","review":"I have been waiting for NewsRadio to come out on DVD for a long time. These shows are truly inspired lunacy. Contrary to an earlier comment, I actually find the picture quality to be quite good.

Please, please put the rest of the shows out on DVD soon. I want all of them in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will be released soon","review":"The page says 2010 simply because a specific date has not yet been announced.

I know it means nothing to you but it means something to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitting Tribute to Phil Hartman","review":"Watching the first disk of this set, brought back just how this show was (and how consistantly).

I Look forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"good times, goood times","review":"NewsRadio was simply the best work-comedy of its time, like \\"Mary Tyler Moore,\\" \\"MASH,\\" and \\"Cheers\\" before it.

If you're not planning on buying this DVD, you should rent it and see for yourself.If you don't find something to laugh at in every episode, you don't have much of a sense of humor and I bid you good day.

All the characters have their own endearing qualities to them, but my favorites are Jimmy James and Dave. This series has many great quotable lines: \\"Soon the super karate monkey death car would park in my spot.

This incredibly underated sitcom easily competes with other influential greats such as sienfeld, spin city, frasier and blossom.

Removing the back allows one to carefully hold the scale and move the mechanism to calibrate it. Also, Amazon gives you no place to click and ask a question about the product. Grump Grump.

The only thing that worked for me was adding Lemishine (pretty much just citric acid I believe) to my detergent. After the first wash the dishes that had built up the film were noticeably cleaner.

But doggone it, sometimes good things are going to be costly. Although this was a book not meant to be read from cover to cover, I am in the process of doing this. Geisler is very thorough, and while some of the articles get pretty deep (time to skim!), I have learned much from someone who is one of the most prolific writers/thinkers in Christianity today. The entries include people involved with apologetics, vital issues on the topic, and concepts that are sure to be looked up. It's one of my favorite volumes to just pick up and open to any page to just begin reading. Baker's \\"Encyclopedia\\" series is very worthwhile, so I highly recommend this particular volume for obeying 1 Peter 3:15-16."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with caution","review":"While this is a large and comprehensive collection of Geisler's work one would have wished he would have been more accurate in his description of Van Til's thinking. As most non-pressupositional apologists, he has many inaccurate representations which is a shame considering that Van Til was the most influential apologist of the century.

His restatement of Gould's evolutionary ideas would be unrecognizable to Gould himself. Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Philip Yancey have reconciled the distinct spheres of faith and science and have not tried to distort science to make faith look valid. Faith is valid independent of all science and this book fails to make that basic observation. Geisler does have more success in defending Christian faith against competing religions, while again the defense is a divergence from understanding the essence of Christian faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why go see a Toyota dealer to learn about Hondas","review":"Mr. Geisler is far from an expert on many of these topics. I feel he just flipped through other peoples books and wrote down what he wanted to present to others.Example is, his talks on say Zen. Anyone whose spent an hour online knows that the whole point of Zen or Eastern Religions, is to achieve an allocentric state of being, aka, enlightenment.One of the problems is, in the West (USA) the ego is taught as being part of the brain that...blah blah blahThe ego isnt part of the brain, its your symbol of yourself, resulting from being selfcenterd. By meditating, aka, keeping your attention on something else, aka, whats infront of you (the moment), you can go beyond this egocentric state, the state that leads to suffering.In this allocentric state, time feels to have stopped, life feels blissfull and one has gone beyond fear.The rulers dont want that...p.s....the fools will laugh, but the wise will understand"},{"rating":"2","title":"An investment you will never regret","review":"This book is awesome, I have not much to add to the previous reviews.

When I found it while grazing the local library, I was first suprised by it's size. It is a very large book. To think that one man wrote all of this is equally as impressive.For very basic information about all things apologetic, this is a great book. It deserves a purchase on that perspective alone. The overall problem with this book is that, while it gives a good springboard into much more detailed apologetics, it's natural simplicity in the words (words?) covered hinders it's ability to be truly good in it's desired field.So overall, lots of very good basic level apoloogetics, but more refined studies are needed to really understand specific topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomprehensibly Comprehensible!","review":"I will share briefly.

This book with out question is not in parallel to what the test throws at you.

If you liked Port of Mystery, you'll like Nightbird too. The only reason I rate it four stars is that some songs, like Chasing Shadows (Marching Season) are (to me) alittle boring. But the others are ones you want to listen to over and over. Even if it is collected from other good CDs', it's still worth buying.

This book does not have any of this, for the exception of maybe a good \\"basic\\" story idea.

The program comes with some sticker sheets which only contain one set of nails each and wastes tons and tons of printable space.

Fully zoomed out it is the same size as any of the 70-300's when they're not zoomed out. Makes a great addition to the kit lens. Sometimes the focus will 'hunt' with this lens when used in low-light situations at the longer lengths, but that's due to it's small max aperture of 5.6 at the long end. Get one- you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"50-200 good choice.","review":"The Pentax DA 50-200 is one of the digital generation of lens dedicated to the family of digital cameras.

The cost is reasonable, and the performance is excellent.However, if the latest and greatest is all you want, Pentax has announced a DA* series lens similar to this one with a slightly longer focal length (60-250) with supersonic focusing (focusing motor in the lens) which will be available by the end of 2007. Of course if you have the now discontinued K100D body the new lens will not work in supersonic mode, but if you have a K10D or buy a new K100D Super model, this coming but not yet available lens might be an upscale choice.For now though this is a good choice for all the ist digials and the k100d."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good OEM product","review":"Good OEM product, i purchased this item to fit in a lancer 2002 and it fitted well.The assemble was not handy, but is a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch O Sensor","review":"The product was received faster than expected but it was not the one I needed, my mistake.

Once installed, the H1 which is a small and good looking camera, turns into a big strange thing. Closing and opening the case is a hard work. When closed, the case is completely ugly when seen from the bottom. When opened, you'll get a thick camera that's difficult to grab because of the \\"base\\" and with a big case hung underneath of it. taking pictures with the camera with the case attached is a very difficult and uncomfortable job.

I ordered this book as a present for my daughter who is in early her forties and is an attorney in family law. I speed-read the book and found it really entertaining. My daughter loved it! I wrote in my dedication, \\"perhaps you can use a couple of these in court.\\" THAT certainly would add excitement to those court hearings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever","review":"Every quip that is mentioned is good but I was hoping there would be more repartees and fewer story telling behind the history of each one. However, it is probably necessary to an appreciation of the quip. I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Life...","review":"Well, this book has many different types of marine life. Everything from sea lions to sea horses, but many of the patterns are unattractive, really. They are sized for immediate use, which is refreshing becasue so many pattern books give you itty bitty patterns and they you have to run to the copy shop, so that is one plus. But if you are looking for cool tropical fish scenes like I was, this is not the book for you. Too many boring and bland patterns of strang looking star fish and sharks, and many other peculiar animals which just don't translate well to glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dimensional personalities and racist","review":"This book has no redeeming value. The characters are one dimensional. The racism is rampant throughout. This book will not teach you children anything positive, but instead will teach them to be more narrow minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Post-Potter Read","review":"After finishing the Potter series with my 7-yr old, he had developed the ability to listen for long periods of time without pictures. Looking for another adventure book written through the eyes of a younger person, I found Children of the Lamp at the library. I liked the interesting facts woven into the story and the settings which were exotic. He liked the djinn's powers and hearing about how the bad guys were cleverly defeated. We are both looking forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"no normal","review":"how could you have this book in audio but not in a normal reading version? i need a normal copy for my book report. really inconvenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing addition to children's fantasy books","review":"I thought this book was charming. My eight year old loves it too - perhaps he identifies with the two main characters. At any rate, the kids are great but not perfect, which is nice to see. The action and dialogue is well paced, and the story engaging. Personally, I liked books two and three better - but this one remains my son's favorite.Unlike general magic, Kerr makes the djinn powers interesting, providing colorful descriptions of travel, communication and impacts. What I also found well done was explanations of the limitations of the children's powers. Not enough books do this, and it comes across as more real.One of the other reviews talked about the smoking theme and product placement. I agree, it's a little excessive, but these days, I've found that we're sort of oblivious to it - for better or worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children of the Lamp","review":"I loved this book I think it is one of the best books I have read this summer and in a long time. I can't wait to read the second one I am 12 and I have never read a better book. I think all kids my age should read this book!!!!! I hope your books go far in series and I will be a fan of your writing. Many kids my age are not very interested in books, but I read this one for summer reading program at my school. I normally don't read that much. But I saw this book and it looked interesting so I desided to by it at my lil sis book fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Adventure Begins With A Wish","review":"Even though I'm in he middle of the book It's awesome. These kids are so amazing to me. They are just like my brother and I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children of the Lamp - a great book!","review":"Children of the Lamp is not only a fabulous story, but it's also very unique. P. B. Kerr skillfully blends fantasy into the world we know, so that you may catch yourself wondering about the real identity of some of your luckier friends. Few other authors could share the limelight between two main characters with such good results, but that is just what Kerr does. Twin siblings John and Philippa bring readers along on an imaginative and spellbinding adventure as they discover their own rather unusual heritage, and the responsibilities and opportunities that come with it. I'd recommend this book to fans of Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, The Bartimaeus Trilogy, and to anyone who enjoys a good story. I wish you all good reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea....Bad Book","review":"Children of the lamp # 1 wasn't a very good book. It was a good idea for a book series, but the book was written in a slow way, and I was more than half way through before I got to an exciting part. There was a very interesting explanation about genies and magic, and in the beginning it seemed like it was going to be a great book. Though, there was one pretty funny part. I can't say the whole series was bad, because after the first one I didn't read any more in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Akhenaten Adventure","review":"In The Akhenaten Adventure Two children John and Phillipa find out that they are actually djinn. Their uncle invites them over for the sumer and they go and search for the lost 70 djinn of Akhenaten. This Book was an exciting and fun read for me. I think that this book is best suited for fantasy lovers and big readers from 11 to 14. I recomend this book to eveybody though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Reading Time","review":"This is a book meant to be enjoyed by children under the age of 10. Young teens and adult readers will be disapointed. Wish I never wasted the time of day reading it. Glad it was borrowed from the library and not purchased or I'd demand my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why use one word when 27 will do?","review":"Terrible. Kerr's writing style is unbearable ... dreadful, convoluted monster sentences that frequently stretch to an entire paragraph. At first I thought there were a few of these beasts thrown in for effect, but it soon became clear that he has done the whole book in strings of dependent clauses. I suppose these things may just barely be grammatical, but I even have my doubts about that.Prudish parent I may be, but I was bit shocked by cigarette smoking being portrayed as mystically alluring early on in this children's book.A huge thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children's Librarian Point of view","review":"This book is not appropriate for elementary children. I found that it encouraged smoking and sexist attitude. The language and situations was too high for children 12 and under at our current level of education. Parents PLEASE be aware of the content of the books you allow your kids to read. This is better then some \\"kids\\" books but you can tell this was a first attempt by an adult author to write a children's book.This book is not as bad on the teen level. Their education and understanding should allow them to enjoy the book overall. For adults it is a nice read with some enjoyment.I do NOT recommend this for children waiting for Harry Potter 6. I think it is an ok read for Adults waiting for HP6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra extra read all about this book!","review":"Book One of the Children of the Lamp series, The Akhenaten Adventure, is really awesome! It's about twins, John and Philippa, who find out from their Uncle Nimrod that they have powers because they belong to a group of djinn, or genies. Akhenaten is an evil person who captured 70 djinn. After John and Philippa discover that they have their powers, they go on a huge adventure to find these 70 lost djinn of Akhenaten.If you like fantasy and/or mystery books, you would like this one because they use clues to find the lost djinn and use their powers to solve problems, defeat evil and escape danger. If there was one thing that I didn't like, it was that there wasn't enough detail about the characters so that I could not visualize them well.Where are the 70 lost djinn of Akhenaten? How do John and Philippa use their powers? Do they free the lost djinn? All these questions will be answered if you read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY reveiw of this book","review":"12 year old John and Phillipa go in to a deep sleep to get their wisdom teeth pulled.

This book has a lot of adventures and some parts are even a little sad. The adventure is about three characters who are trying to find seventy lost djinn before the side of evil gets them. Two of them are kids named John and Philippa who happen to be young djinn! I liked the book because of all the adventures that John and Philippa had. It was also very funny! My mom thought it was a great book too because all the detail made for great discussions between her, my brother, and me. Since I am only seven years old my Mom started reading it out loud but in the end I finished it on my own because I liked it so much.If you like a story that is funny, different, sad, and also very adventurous then this would be the perfect book for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Jinn...Needs Tonic...","review":"First volume in the Children of the Lamp series. An interesting and fresh take on the 'genie of the lamp' genre and younger readers will no doubt enjoy it. Adult readers who enjoy such offerings as the Harry Potter books and Series of Unfortunate Events will be left wondering where the rest of the story is.The author takes very clever ideas, such as the whole concept of kids who are half jinn and half human, wishes and TV loving dogs; interesting characters and places both in a very linear plot.I will check out volume 2 just to see if the author takes off after stretching their limbs with the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost wonderful","review":"The adventures of the \\"Children of the Lamp\\" is a very entertaining and captivating book. I must admit I had trouble putting the book down once it got going. However, I was a little taken aback by the \\"advertising\\" in the first few chapters wherein he used name brands a bit too much. Berluti shoes? Fox Kids? The Disney Channel? CNN? Jimmy Choos? (To name but a few). I get the feeling the author is writing to a very \\"hip\\" and financially secure generation. Either that or he is getting some sort of kickback from the entities he names. And Arthur Miller's play, \\"The Crucible\\"? I don't know a lot of adults who either know of it or have seen it. Either children of today are very enlightened on fashion and the arts, or the author is directing the story to an older age group. Perhaps my own world is smaller than it seems?That being said, the storyline is quite good and I do look forward to the next installment of \\"Children of the Lamp\\". I just hope he leaves out all the advertisements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cool book","review":"I was so excited when I first saw this book because I wanted the songs from sleeping beauty.It's a little bit harder than what I had guessed but that's good, It'll give me a challenge.

Bought when i opened it up i realized that it had ENORMOUSLY BIG PRINT and was made for little kids who were learning piano. The accompaniment, if you could even call it that, is very basic and would not pass at any professional audition. Its partly my fault, i think somewhere in the description it says that it has big or easy to read font. If i had known that i wouldnt have bought it.

Unfortunately, it took over 2 weeks to arrive and once it arrived I didnt have much use for it any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" F if for Format \\"","review":"To say that this is the most convoluted, haphazard and annoying book to read is an understatement. Talk about being all over the place and offering single lines and partial thoughts about a whole host of operas & related topics without ever getting to anything more substantial... And yet the photographs are good as are some of the one liners every now and again, such as when Marilyn Horne wonders aloud why everyone if focusing on Carmen's appearance instead of on her singing. Nice also is the inclusion of singers which I had little or no previous knowledge of from the 1950s at the NYCO and other venues.

I discovered this gem of a show when it was in syndication...channel 5 (here in NY) at 5pm every weeknite. I was so happy that it was released on DVD. From that smile inducing theme song to the laugh inducing characters and plots, this show somehow flew under the radar. You can't go wrong with any of the characters...Dee, Raj, Rerun, Mama, Dwayne and Shirley. Heck, you can even spot a pre-All My Children Debbi Morgan. This show was funny without being gross with the constant sex jokes that are so common now. As Madonna sings on Nothing Fails, I'm not that religious, but I thank God that DVD's exist and can bring older shows to a new generation and to nerds like me who live for 70's and 80's sitcoms.

All right. The novel (if it indeed qualifies length-wise) is a mystery/thriller in the first half. The 'Wanderers' turn out to be the real people, and this is a good interpretation of the common plot device, ie. ghosts. When the protag. and his friend (I forget their names) try to turn things back to normal, Cosmic Puppets seems a little like a precursor to Ubik, what with the layers of reality visible in a physical sense. At this stage, Cosmic Puppets is quite tolerable.But then the ending! It's awful. Terrible. Enought to stop you from reading. It all falls apart. Cosmic Puppets is an early PKD novel, and it shows. But it also shows in simple form the themes that PKD would pursue later.Only a PKD fan would find anything of interest, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Sweet","review":"The Cosmic Puppets can't really be classed as science fiction, it would be more supernatural/fantasy. The story wouldn't look out of place in a Stephen King short story collection. I think it's slightly unfair to charge full price for a half-length novel, I'd recommend borrowing it from a library if it's available.

I didn't know she had been a Mouseketeer though, so that is something new I learned.Then I was thinking that it was a book filled with great insights from her very public Christian walk. It's not really a book about that, either. The book really covers a very early portion of Lisa Whelchel's Christian walk. Much of the theology is relatively basic.

One can write a small book on the errors this author carelessly makes.Take this as TOTAL FICTION and you MIGHT enjoy it. If you are looking for a feel for the period, look elsewhere. Save your money - and the headache!

It is much easier to pull a swifty on the public and reviewers when the subject is more obscure.The information Murray used is easily available in the public sphere. Christopher Hibbert has done a great job editing Gronow's works, it is easily available too, Lesley Blanch did a wonderful job on both Julia Jones and Harriette Wilson's memoirs. There are endless copies of the Creevey papers too.All these books are marvellously gossipy, have great detail- they also have editors that understand their subjects and are able to shed light on their lives which Murray is incapable of doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy Fluff","review":"If it were possible to give this book half a star I would. The book is fluff. It would be an enjoyable time waster if it were not supposed to be fact. The chapters are littered with errors of fact, misidentified people,mistaken identies,and misdated events. There is a general absent of dates. None of these deficinecies would matter if this were a work of fiction. Unfortunately the book is promoted as non-fiction. If all you want is a cotton candy introduction to a fascinating period of English history, this book will do as well as any other novel; however, if you want a solid meal of fact, look elsewhere. It is a shame for the book is easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can a supposedly Non-fiction book sacrifice the truth?","review":"\\"~Venetia Murray shows again and again that she neither understands nor has properly researched the Regency period.

It seems to have been written with no other purpose than to cash in on the popularity of the Regency period. It is not scholarly, it is not acurate, it is not even well-written. In fact, I think Venetia Murray gives a bad name to amateur historians. Her book is so second-rate that she makes the kind of general reader who likes reading social history look foolish for doing so. I am sorry to say this but it makes me angry to see a wonderful subject brought low by an ignorant journalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't tear myself away","review":"There were parts that seemed a bit suspect as I read, but I didn't realize how inaccurate it was until I read these reviews here. Still, the book was quite entertaining so if you want to read it more as a work of historical fiction, then that's what I suggest. I recommend this as a source of entertainment rather than a source of information and as a source of entertainment it's very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, if not terribly accurate","review":"This book caught my eye on a display, and I bought it more out of curiosity than from any great desire to know the intimate details of the upper classes of the late 18th and early 19th century. I'm not terribly knowlegable on the history of the Regency, so I can't really comment on the accuracy of the history, but it is an entertaining read. It also manages to illumintate some of the social history of a critical point in modern history- the transition from a mercantilist agragrian society to a modern market-based one. It's not unlike reading Paul Johnson; the author may not have a terribly good grasp of the details, but there's an interesting narritive nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Contents","review":"This DVD will include a documentary about the band entitled \\"Paris Before the War,\\" music videos for \\"The Tain\\", \\"The Bachelor and the Bride\\", \\"16 Military Wives\\", \\"The Soldiering Life\\", and \\"Here I Dreamt I Was an Architect\\", and the entirety of their concert at the Roseland Theater in Portland on the 4th of November 2005.Tracklisting for the concert portion is as follows:01 The Infanta02 The Soldiering Life03 Leslie Anne Levine04 We Both Go Down Together05 The Engine Driver06 Eli the Barrow Boy07 The Sporting Life08 July, July!09 16 Military Wives10 The Mariner's Revenge Song11 The Chimbley Sweep12 I Was Meant for the Stage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you like rock","review":"this DVD has none of the songs I know this group from- and it is Great.

I'm a big fan. Even his beautiful face couldn't keep me engaged. This movie is horrible- bad lighting, bad sound, bad plot, bad dialog, terrible camera work and my gosh was it BORING. I didn't laugh, I didn't feel any sort of emotion towards the characters. Didn't know much about any of them and didn't much care to. If you, too, are thinking of buying it only for Mr. Olyphant save your money. He's in it for a few moments and, as sad as it is to say, his performance contributes nothing. I was hoping both Garner and Peet would make the parts without Olyphant entertaining, but the suck was distributed evenly throughout the film. I'd feel jilted had I rented it. I'd probably go so far as to want my time back had I watched it free on television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Fabulous","review":"Raymond Brown has once again proven with this volume why he is one of the greatest New Testament scholars in the world today. His thoroughness is unsurpassed. He intricately explains each point in detail, leaving very little for the dedicated reader to continue to wonder about. Still, it does its best to raise healthy questions and by no means considers itself to be the definitive work. It only presents a main line scholarly perspective, sticking straight to the middle and not giving much voice to fundamental or liberal interpretations except to acknowledge their existence. Still, the book is quite wonderful and makes one of the best references out there for anyone interested in New Testament studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most comprehensive introduction you will find","review":"Raymond Brown sure knows how to write an introduction. Though I am not exactly sure how long the New Testament is, surely it is dwarfed by the 800+ pages of Brown's commentary. He does an excellent job covering the books as well as discussing various approached to studying the New Testament. I used this for background while studying Mark. Thus, this work is approporate for specific research or a general understanding of the New Testament. Though it is not quick reading, if you have your bible handy it the learning process is better. Unlike many theologians, he does a good job of sticking to mostly understandable vocabulary. I would say this could be of use for all beginning and intermediate-level bible students as well as those extremely familiar with the doctrines surrounding the New Testament. High praise for Brown in attempting such a collasal task!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarly piece of work","review":"The book does a fair analysis of all elements of the NT. He either states conflicting views in the body of the text or in the footnotes and/or bibliography before he states his opinion. After reading this book one would be well prepared to take on the interpretive commentary on the New Testament by an authoritative source since no attempt is made in this work to provide religious education - merely the best historical analyses possible with information available to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service!","review":"I have not read the book yet, so I can only comment on the very efficient delivery of the book. It came as expected, and was very well protected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Access the New Testament on a whole new level.","review":"Great for personal study and introductory research. This book should not be limited to academics alone. Provides background on the origin of the New Testament books, guides to a deeper appreciation of the NT, background info on the history and ideas surrounding the NT writers, and an analysis with various notes for each book. This book is filled with bibliographies for deeper studies, so it provides a perfect access point for deeper, lengthier studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summary of New Testament for both the scholar and the novice","review":"The book is substantive enough for use in university settings yet accessable for those who for the first time wish to seriously engage in a review of the New Testament. Father Brown (who past away in early August, 1998) was widely recognized by both Catholics and Prostestants as one of the leading Biblical scholars of our day. His writing is readable yet thourough, allowing progress through the material while giving the reader a confidence that the basics of each of the books of the New Testament have been communicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reference book for the NT","review":"Excellent, concise and perfect for anyone having questions or just wants to learn more about the New Testament."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive, but...","review":"...Boring. As a reference, this is a great book, a thorough (and thick & heavy) survey of New Testament theology by one fo the the heavy hitters of NT scholarship. I read this book, however, as part of a graduate seminar, and found it extraordinarily boring, as, I believe, surveys of this sort are often doomed to be. If you're looking for something to read cover-to-cover, this is a tough one. The writing is lucid throughout--no problem there. There is simply too much information packed between the two covers, without an angle. It's like reading the encyclopedia.Nevertheless, if what you want is a reference, this is the book. Brown covers a very wide range of scholarship, and varying opinions in discussing the books of the NT. At the end of each chapter, he gives a long list of books for suggested reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Scholar of the New Testatment","review":"Raymond Brown is a highly regarded Scripture scholar and very highly respected in the world of Biblical Scholarship, regardless of denomination. Any biblical work with his name as author or contributor would be something that I value.

I don't care about how loose the lid is, I don't mind taking it off and didn't expect it to be a tight seal. But my problem is I loose a lot of liquid down the side and onto my counter when pouring. Even if I take the lid off. I'm not talking about a few dribbles, but puddles. I'm going to return them, they're not worth the mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Trouble","review":"A number of buyers commented that the pitchers were broken upon arrival but I purchased them anyway, hoping that the company had cured the problem. The box containing the pitchers was shrink-wrapped in a VERY thin layer of bubble wrap, the kind with the tiny, rather flat bubbles. Then the smaller box was packed in a much larger box without bubble wrap to fill up the large gaps between the small and large boxes. So the pitchers just rattled around inside during shipping until one finally shattered. What a waste.I tested the surviving pitcher for dribbling and can confirm that it DID leak from the lid when pouring. The lids are cheap and flimsy and probably would not hold up over time. On a more positive note, the pitcher itself is nice and heavy and easily fits in the fridge door.Overall, I would avoid this product unless and until the lids are re-engineered and the packaging problems are fixed. Mine are being returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Looking. Not Functional","review":"The pitchers look great, however you cannot pour from them without dribbling your beverage along the side of the pitcher as well. This is regardless of having the lid on or off."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy lids!","review":"Love the idea of glass pitcher with a lid so bought these.All is good except when you go to pour liquid into a glass. You will be better served to leave off the pouring lid (with 2 sides; one for allowing ice to flow out with the liquid, and the other side has strainer slots). With the lid on, when you pour, the liquid pours out beyond the lid area and you get liquid all over your counter/table.Very pooly designed lids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"i love these pitchers! they are exactly what i was looking for and then some. they will make my lemonade, sour mix, and iced tea adventures a breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design!!","review":"Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before purchasing. The glass is nice and thick and it keeps my water quite cold, however, I bought this to replace my plastic leaking water pitcher and it didn't fix my problem. These glass pitchers leak when I try to pour water into a glass. I've tried to pour quickly and slowly BUT THEY STILL LEAK. I now have two pitchers which I refuse to use. The handle is also close to the pitcher which makes it difficult to put your entire hand around it to pour. POOR DESIGN OVER ALL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitchers","review":"I like the pitchers except for one thing, you need to remove the lid in order to pour without spilling. Also, the lid does not fit tight enough in order to shake the pitcher to mix up powdered drinks. The glass is sturdy, they fit well in the frig door. I had ordered 4 and unfortunately one set arrived shattered. Amazon was quick to respond and issue a return and refund. Very happy with their response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Poor pour and bad lids! You can't even pour the juice out with the lids on without making a mess. Very bad design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"The lids are the cheapest throw-away type plastic that do not fit. Pouring, even very carefully, results in spillage. The handles are too close to the bottle to allow for a good grasp as you can barely squeeze your fingers in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor for Pouring","review":"These are lovely and fit well into the side door of a fridge. BUT, they are lousy at pouring. Although they are clearly intended to be vessels for pouring liquid, the liquid leaks big time. What a mess. I'm stuck with them, so I do continue to use. A way to get around the leaking is to remove the cap when pouring. But that defeats the purpose of having a pourable pitcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"you must be lucky if it does not arrive broken","review":"the packaging is paper thin cardboard & paper thin cardboard seperating the two bottles.

The smaller size means that even full, the pitcher isn't too heavy. We also use these in our cooler when we camp because they don't float in the icewater. I love glass - no worries about the toxics found in plastics. I highly recommend these.Comment on lids: The lids we received fit well, and we haven't had any problems with pouring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor lid design makes this product practically useless","review":"Looked at the overall reviews and the rating and am very sorry I did not pay more attention. The lids do not fit at all; so loose that it seems like they are not even made for this product. Even when you turn them so that the spout is technically closed, they have a gap. Definitely cannot even swirl juice to mix without it leaking out. As others have stated, pouring with the lids on is real mess. Dribbles and if you tilt just a bit the fluid leaks out. The lids make this product practically useless. A real shame that this company would ship with these lids since they make other pitchers, one of which I purchased, that seal beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are dishwasher safe and great products","review":"I just got these.

Amazon did everything possible to make sure they did not break (The box was bubble wrapped in two other boxes) however there is no padding in the original box, so there's not much Amazon can do. When I received them, one was broken and one was fine. Instead of returning them, I asked for a replacement in hope that I'll receive another one that is intact so I can have a set. Amazon is paying for the shipping so I'm not losing any money, however, the Bormioli jugs do not seem to be designed to ship.The quality of the jugs are fine; just be prepared for possible breakage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well......","review":"Good sellar, items arrived quickly. The pitchers don't pour well with the lids on, although they were designed to be used in that way. They are the perfect size for a packet of Koolaid or to use to fill my coffeemaker in the mornings.

Beware!","review":"I was filling one of these with 180f hot water and the bottom literally fell off and all of the water spilled on my legs and on the floor.Glass of that thickness should be able to hold liquids around boiling point.I'm disapointed, but happy that my 2 year old didn't get burned by the spilled hot water.Update: i just poured tea out of the one that didn't break and it drips due to a very poor design.

Amazon finally did the class act by refunding me 50% off the price I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's true, they make a mess","review":"They're very pretty and the glass feels well-made and very sturdy. However, the poor design makes them dribble down the side every time you pour.

Small things like this really help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value & Quality","review":"These pitchers are very heavy-duty, with equally thick glass for handles and sleek plastic lids.

Because the lids fit so poorly, these are not optimal for storing. But even worse, the lip is so badly designed that, unless you are dumping the entire contents in one fell swoop, the liquid will dribble and run down the outside of the pitcher. If you try to pour with the lid on (turned to appropriate position), it's even worse, making a mess and wasting your juice/water/whatever. Also they are very top-heavy, so if you don't have enough liquid in them (to balance the top weight) and swing the refrigerator door open other than v-e-r-y slowly, the pitcher will partly tip over. AND the handle is uncomfortably close to pitcher, fits fingers badly. I recommend Quadro glass pitchers by far over these; wish I had bought more Quadros rather than trying these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Lids","review":"As many others have said, the lids fit poorly and the liquid drbbles down the side when you pour. You have to remove the lids before pouring which is a pain when you are holding a baby!

It was room temperature and had no cracks or chips. I poured hot water into the pitcher, and as soon as it was full, one side of the pitcher completely cracked and shot across my kitchen, getting boiling water and glass shards everywhere.I've used glass pitchers for iced tea for years and never had this happen before.

I've tested this lens extensively. It adds more than a 33% to your field of view, but that added stuff is warped and blurry. I am unable to get a shot that is clear enough to be proud of. It exaggerates the H1's natural tendency for purple fringes. I used a tripod and took two pictures of the same scene, both on timer.

In essence you can't use your lens for indoor flash or flash photography in general.This lens should not be sold and Sony should be ashamed.

Katy Green is a musician who joins an all-girl swing band on tour through the United States. The problem is that members of the band are being injured and killed under the most puzzling of circumstances. Susan Egan heads a multiple performer Broadway cast in a vintage \\"whodunnit\\" that is wonderfully enhanced with original swing music performed by Ann Hampton Callaway.

If you are a tea drinker, I would recommend this product. Sure you could microwave water.

The origin of the smell appears to be the lid. So I disassembled the lid, wanted to see if there was something that got lodged there. To my surprise, the inner structure around the vent crumbled upon touching. And that is where the plastic smell comes from. Basically, the plastic around the vent is melting and in the process releasing chemicals that smell and who knows what else they would do. Because of the way the lid works, vapor condensing on that part of the lid drain back to the main pot, hence the bad taste in the water.Zojirushi's store sells a replacement lid for $22 plus $6 shipping. It is a steep price to pay every 1.5 years. But the most important issue is the potentially toxic chemicals that we have been drinking as the vent slowly melts over time.Definitely a dangerous product."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have product","review":"I can't stop using this product.

I contacted Zojirushi to see how I can repair the unit under warranty. Overall, customer service is very poor and they will not stand by their warranty claims.

She asserts that the water heater doesn't accurately heat the water to her desired temperature. What she doesn't know is that the water heater always boils the water first to drive out the chlorine, then the temperature drifts down to it's preset limit where it is kept warm. What Jessie needs to do is to fill the unit before bed, set the timer and when she wakes up she will be rewarded with water at her desired temperature. It will keep the water at that temperature until she fills it again, then it will boil the water again, and let it drift down to her pre-set temperature.This is a terrific little unit: efficient, accurate, and a joy to those who read their instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy tune greets you every day","review":"Most people talk about the Hot Water.

This device is a staple in the Japanese kitchen. As an avid tea drinker, it's great having a reservoir of water at the edge of boiling all the time, and it has settings perfect for black or green tea. A full 2 quart reservoir takes about 5 minutes to boil from tap temperature, but the joy of this device is it keeps the water at 195 (or 205) with a very small energy footprint (17 watts for the 195 setting), so if I want green tea, it's immediate gratification, and if I want black tea, it's a 1 minute wait time before can start brewing. Also has a slow-serve setting, which I use with my chemex coffee decanter. If you have hard water, the reservoir can start to scale over time and affect performance and since the reservoir is built into the device, it's not the easiest thing to clean, but cleaning even with hard water probably only needs to happen every 6 months or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!!","review":"best all around water boiler and warmer. a must have if you have a new born baby like us. this make life much easier!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome","review":"This is an amazing product.

I poured a cup into a thermos type cup with a lid and checked the temp with the thermometer I use for my tea. It was 10 degrees off. So I dialed it down to 195. I checked the temp for this and it was off by 10 again. Finally I checked it at 175 and it was off by 12 degrees. So if you like teas that can boil at 198 max temp, this may be the pot for you.

It is great especially those who are focused on school work/reading and often forget about hot water boiling.There was an off taste from the plastic spout but after running 2 cups of hot water/vinegar mixture it went away after 3-4 run through.The zoji keeps the water warm at the right temp, but if you are using a cold cup/tea pot you will want to set it at 195 instead of 175 unless if you preheat you cup/tea pot.It has a great build the annoying beeps and music can be turned off easily.After having this machine for the past few days I have already been drinking much more tea.Anyways I would highly recommend this to anyone who is busy and drinks tea regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"So convenient","review":"I frequently microwaved water for coffee and tea.

Wait and buy this book on the bargain book table if you must read it. One of the worst political science/history books I've read recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innuendo After Innuendo","review":"For whatever personal reasons, Phillips has savaged the Bushes - both GHWB and GWB, as well as their forebears and offspring - by building upon innuendo after innuendo, and weaving them into a largely unsubstantiated web of intrigue and deceit. It is as though playing cards were tilted on their ends, resting one against the next, and precariously poised so that a slight breeze might blow the whole lot down.To trash the Bushes page after page, Phillips has used the wily techniques of a skillful writer, apparently unaccustomed to any critics suggesting that the \\"[Emperor] hasn't got anything on.\\" If the innuendoes and the qualifications and hedging are removed, Phillips' theses fall like a house of cards.

It is thus splendidly complementary to the numerous other good Bush tomes - by Brewton, Parry, Hatfield, Tarpley & Chaitkin, and Bowen, in addition to those above, and others.Bottom line: these people exist only to deceive and rip off. And most Americans know it, but that won't deter their leaders from completely running a once-great republic into the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"A country divided!","review":"Phillips offers a vast amount of information on the Bush family. Unfortunately it is sometimes shrouded in nearly impenetrable language, or overshadowed by his obvious dislike of the Bush's, sometimes degenerating into name calling. He also introduces some fairly wild conspiracy theories that detract from his work reading like a scholarly historical account. The bottom line, as is clear if you read some of the other reviews, is that if you are a diehard Bush loyalist, you will probably hate this book, and your time would be better spent watching Fox News. If you believe Bush to be the worst thing that has ever happened to America, this book is a must read.

Personally, I think we're all ready for something different. He has a more sober writing style than Al Franken, but don't be fooled by the lack of humor: this is actually an even less consequential book than \\"Lying Liars.\\" There are real and interesting questions about the Bushes, but Phillips never addresses them because he seems to focused on propagating class warfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"As an independent minded voter, I generally like and support the Bush adminstration.

While the author looks for hidden conspiracies and plots against western civilization he loses the reader by not including any factual information (by his own admission in endless interrupting citations - his comments are speculative at best) or relevant source material. Sadly it would seem that Mr. Phillips is just another man with an axe to grind.While there are some interesting questions raised in the book - the arguments just don't add up and the endless polemics of Kevin Phillips are maddening.

I thought it was going to be a factual commentary on the Bush family. I couldn't finish it because of the author's poor writing This seems to have been written with an agenda in mind.

I've never read a more scatter brained work in my life. This book is an editor's nightmare. I really thought I was going to like the book based on reviews and what I was able to sample online. Very disappointed with the writers style and his inability to keep a reader engaged. The book is written as if the author assumes everyone reading the book has his base of knowledge on the topic. So when you read the book it's like you're listening to someone elses conversation. You never quite understand what they are talking about. I'm 70 pages in and want to punch out Phillips. Im rather interested in the topic but ticked that he can't muster a single rationale chapter. I'll likely still read the book.....but will never buy another work by this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Required reading for pinheads","review":"No doubt the Bush bashers will enjoy this drivel by Phillips. If you are looking for a reason to rationalize your current inequalities, whatever they may be and want to blame Bush, then this book is right for you.If, on the other hand, you are intelligent, you know your history, you know that Bush I and Ronald Reagan fixed the mistakes of Jimmy Carter and Bush II fixed the mistakes of Slick Willy aka Mr. Zipper, then you will see this trash for what it really is.I do agree with Phillips that the Bush's have a Dynasty going. And that Dynasty has created a better America and a safer world.Thank God for the Bush's. Thank God for GWBBII and thank God for our great military.Only people who never read the financial pages and are not aware of what is really going on will support this book.

The reader that compared this book to Al Franken's book was not being objective. Al bleeds liberal blood. Kevin Phillips is very far right of center and I believe it is hard for people to be objective and think out of their own political biases -- It's only natural.

He is no conservative, and no influence and not too many brains. It would be more insightful to have in depth studies of kevin, michael, al, molly, etc. and find out just how trashy they really are and where they come from.This is the second book of kevins' that I have tried to wade through. This one was so full of insinuations, no proof, politics of envy, it puts one off to start with. Nothing is substantiated and that old nasty story about hitler and the Bushes was put to bed a long time ago.

It is indeed very challenging to read this book and realize that it is written under non-fiction. Like Michael Moore's \\"documentary\\" which was more fiction than fact, American Dynasty should be listed under fiction not non-fiction. Of course the left wing liberals will like this book as much as they like all of the other mindless, factless, feelgood garbage that permeated book store shelves up untill 13 months ago and were proven to be baseless nonsense.

What a boring and stupid book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Perfectly Good Paper and Ink","review":"While Phillips is admittedly a reasonably good story-teller, the book is nothing but an unfortunate re-hash of old diatribes, biases and liberal conspiracy theories. The lack of primary sources and his continuous use of secondary sources with long-standing political axes to grind is unnerving and annoying. Whatever credibility the book may have had is destroyed by the lack of objective, original research or documentation. I'm both proud of having finished it - perseverance has not been one of my strong points - and a bit embarrassed to have wasted so much time. The book is neither informative nor charming. If you don't like President Bush, there are better, more effective attacks, and if you do like the President, this hash of old invective will merely raise your blood pressure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devastating indictment from the GOP's Own","review":"A devastating indictment, not from typical left-wingers, but from a Republican. Phillips obviously hits a nerve, given the ignorant vitriol spewed by obviously biased right-wingers who will never admit that their Emperor has no clothes -- despite Phillips' thoroughly documented book. They'll accept no amount of facts, no amount of budgetary red ink, and no amount of evidence that W's case for the Iraq war was, at best, ill-founded and, at worst, full of damnable lies that have sent America's best to their deaths.

It appears to me that Phillips is offering opinions, not facts and is only trying to sell a book.This book belongs in the fiction isle. Read it as entertainment, but not as fact.This book looks like it was written by Al Gore, Howard Dean or Paul O'Niel! No credibility!I also found Phillips comments about election 2000 interesting. Obviously Phillips forgot to mention the military votes that were never counted or the Florida voters, who would have vote for Bush but did not go to the polls because had deliberately but falsely announced Gore as the winner.Skip this book. It's worse than bad.It s al so obvious that voting here is being manipulated (shades of election 2000 - is Al Gore manning this website?)A better book to read is At Any Cost How Al Gore Tried To Steal The Election.AGAIN I ASK: WHERE IS THE PROOF!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Royalty is Un-American!","review":"A documented indictment of the Bush/Walker clan, with longstanding ties to historically dubious characters, including Nazi German leadership and the oil-drenched bin Ladens of Saudi Arabia.

I like the fact that it goes far back into the Bush family history, even to their ancestors from Britain. Phillips has shown several common themes in the two Bush administrations, their ties to Haliburton, Enron, and other dubious, greedy, corportations, the oil mega-industry, the American \\"War Machine\\" and the CIA.

Bush and what he did in Texas, or how insidious and elusive the truth was concerning what all his father was involved in. This book fleshes out not only the trickles of truth that had already emerged concerning the Bushes (and the neo-conservatives' self-serving loyalties), but a whole - and in terms of the welfare of the average American - terrible long term agenda.

Also, the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy, and doesn't work well for reluctant pins. I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more, but I guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter, so I won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a string winder, OK.

Still it is a very effective tool.The string winder was also very good.

It slips off if you go too fast, but I thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this.2. It didn't come with much of any instructions, so I was using it wrong at first. There is a big and a small slot.3. The cutter is so that I pinched my finger during use. The cutter works great, you just have to be careful.4. The screw that holds it on keeps coming loose. Sure I can tighten it, but it just means the design could be better.All and all it's one of those must have gadgets, but it does require a little discipline to master. I hope the next version comes with a soft, rubber insert so it doesn't scratch the chrome off my turner pegs. That and maybe they could use a long screw and some Loctite to keep it from coming loose.

At least this time around there aren't any assasins, but in Alien Bounty McCade manages to wind up in chains not once but TWICE, and once again manages to get rescued by his buds, Rico, eversoheavily armed, and Phil, once a slave himself. In the next novel, McCade's Bounty, our galactic space hero's daughter is enslaved by the space pirates. I swear, I would be suprised if in McCade's world anyone lower in status than Lakorian royalty was NOT a slave at some point, considering the stats. Also, the part in Alien Bounty about Mustapha Pong is a bit short. Other than those two points, though, MCCADE ON THE RUN excels. It weaves an intricate, complex universe in its diverse worlds, some of which entirely artificial.

The book assumes that separatism was entirely economic, rather than religious and political, and mistakenly supposes that the British actually supported Zionism, when quite the opposite is true.Beginning in 1929, for example, the British enforced Islamic law concerning Jewish prayer at the Western Wall in Jerusalem, thereby prohibiting Jewish worshipers from approaching the sacred wall within 10 feet, and from sitting there. Furthermore, the British actually instigated Arab riots against Jews, and prohibited Jewish communities from defending themselves.Furthermore, while the book rightly acknowledges Arab attacks on Jewish communities in 1929, it fails to note that such attacks actually began more than 20 years earlier, and therefore preceded by a substantial margin any \\"economic\\" development cited herein.--Alyssa A.

Do we really need to know about every single time the character gets up to make a pot of tea, or what he had for lunch and what he thought about the quality of the food?If Modesitt had cut out half the pages, this book would've been a solid 80's-style cyberpunk yarn.

There is no real explaination of the movements, Cyndi goes through each move very quickly and gives no real guidance if one does not have the flexibility that an intermediate student has. Ultimately, I had to return 2 copies of this dvd as they were both very poorly made, skipping and stopping. After checking Amazon, I went back to the bookstore and purchased Seane Corn's \\"Flow\\" Uniting Movement and Breath. I really like this one!

His window creations were somewhat neglected here in this text, which was one of his passions if you do further historical research into the man's history. All in all, however, this is a beautiful representation of Tiffany's expansive talents that anyone would enjoy. It also has some great biographical data about him that makes for an interesting study.

The book however, is only moderately amusing, and doesn't really capture the humor that was found in the TV commercials. A collection of pictures accompanied by some handwritten captions made for a fairly average read. I'd highly recommend purchasing the actual 'Sock Puppet' from Amazon.com...since I think for the extra few bucks it's more fun to entertain kids or co-workers with the charming little terry-cloth sock, than spending money on this book.

I put up with it because I already purchased it and by the time I used it, it already pass the return date. The worst thing of all, was that even though I was only able to use it a couple of times, that was exactly it, A COUPLE OF TIMES!!! because the motor or whatever died. I was so mad! I threw away the base because it was useless, I kept the jar part and see if I can sell it for the parts. I hate this blender!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This blender is terrible. It's so loud that it sounds like it's malfunctioning when you use it.

Someone had used the product and then put it back in the box- they had not even bothered to remove the thermal paste properly. As soon as I opened the box I could tell something was not right . Now I paid full price and expedited shipping for junk they tried to pass off as new (did they really think I would not notice??)We shall see if they refund my shipping costs I had to pay to send it back too (LOL)...Point is they are supposed to check all returns before reshipping them out to customers. I have used J&R in the past but not for too many items- I will stick to my better and more reliable suppliers in the future, BTW Amazon rocks and I have NEVER had any problem with anything I have purchased from them. I Buy a ton of stuff from them ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little item","review":"Bought this to use for my CPU. I've heard of Thermal Electric Cooling before, it was never widely adopted as water cooling was. Neither one was really affordable if you bought it years ago, most was homemade. Technology has come a long ways and this little beauty is well worth it if you don't want to risk water cooling, but need to do something about CPU heat. It's heavy, and you also need case space since it's tall, but will save a lot of grief later on. You can fabricate and attach a bracket to the case to ease the weight as well as to help relieve the strain on the mainboard. More expensive than other makes, but well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilltec Cpu Cooler","review":"This unit stabilised my heat from Cpu and now i am running at 26c from 35 c under full load, It is BIG and takes up space but I went to a full tower. Highly recommended application for getting rid of the heat from the intel chip dual core. Price wise you can get a different cooler if you trust the fan setup on some out there that are advertized as the best cooler for gamers. Generally they give you a small fan and exspect it to do the job, always had to replace fans on such units this one on the Chilltec does the job without modifycation of the fan. Best buy for a cooling system so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Por favor mi gente...","review":"Este tipo no sirve, y aunque es cubano y todo eso, no tiene nada...lo unico que hace es tirar el cubanazo, y el cubanazo le sale cool a un chileno...Esta plasmado, esto tipo no se puede comparar con nadie...como van a decir que he represent miami???...este tipo no representa ni pinar del rio...Don dinero??..tremendo jodon, me dio dos millon, para escriberle el track dos...lolHay que darle todo el respeto en este genero a las Boris...Orishas la metio profundo, me se todas las canciones, estan pegado de verdad...pero este tipo, don dinero, vive del \\"cubanozo\\"....no sirve...Tego, Vico, Mexicano, Don Omar, Tempo, Eddie, Lito y polaco...esa gente si la ponen, lo siento patria, pero puerto rico tienen lo mejor de la cochinada esta..."},{"rating":"2","title":"best latin hip hop that i have ever listen","review":"This album is totally a masterpiece, the flow on the songs are so good that i cant stop listening to all the songs.i really put this guy don dinero as a very talented artist, in other words he is more than a artist.I was raised listening to hip hop all my life and since i found out about don dinero he is one of the best to put the latin flow to the mic.if you pay attention to that song que rico es vivir,the lyrics on that song are so good.and the message that it has make you love life every minute that you listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuban hip hop???

He attempts to compete, but the odds are not on his side. He decides to give up the whole idea and heads to England, where he must face more challenges.

I'd say it's an enjoyable family film, it's witty without having to resort to adult inside jokes like Shrek or Puss in Boots (which are good too, but different humor). Though different from Wallace & Grommit, I think this production still has the same soul in it. Reminds me a bit of old comedy classic films, a kind of Abbott & Costello-ishness, Hugh Grant's Pirate Captain is completely obtuse but comes through in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pirates","review":"The Claymation studios at its best.

The movie was visually stunning, (computer animation enhanced claymation) but poor in story and humor. Charles Darwin and Queen Victoria are the over the top dastardly villains in this, which should give you a good impression of the pervasive wrongness present here. A few chuckles now and again, but nothing to appreciate more on a second viewing. I'm not a kid, so I can't speak with full authority on their potential enjoyment, but I would guess it would be low. All I know is that Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run are fantastic fun every time, and this was disappointing. Very odd sort of ironic sensibilities here (probably very British humor) that miss more than they hit and are definitely over the heads of younger kids, and a majority of the older ones as well.

We didn't turn it off, but we did decide to do some chores while watching the last half of it.

That soundtrack is available and should be heard before buying this CD. Adventurous souls may also be interested in acquiring the original version of the movie in French--which, incidentally, has much less talk-over, allowing viewers to absorb the images more directly.

Having grown up in Cleveland, I know that there are many times when three days of rain is not only possible, it's almost commonplace. The music on this soundtrack is amazing, original and took me away. I'm truly impressed with the way it matches the events in the movie, yet stands out on its own beautifully.

I totally agree with the author that psychology affects the stock market. When stocks are going up, investors are happy and ignore all the bad news. When stocks are declining, they do not believe any good news and scrutinize things harder. The author also took a long-term view on investing while the rest of Wall Street only cared about short-term results.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

But unfortunately, if you are looking to glean some insights and wisdom from his years in the trenches, you will be disappointed. Except for a few references to interest rates and value investing he never really spells out his theories on economics and investing. He repeatedly makes mention of his brother who continued his father's work (economic theory) but never really explains it. He probably has much he could teach us, but fails to do so. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This is a book full of rambling thoughts from a mind that seems past its time. Mr. Levy spends several chapters with pointless stories about himself and his childhood. He also spends half the book talking about what a genius his father was and about the \\"great\\" book on economics his father wrote- then later admits that he never even finished reading his father's book because it was too boring. There are about 5 decent pages comparing the Internet bubble to past bubbles, but there are no new insights.

He highlights his contributions including the success of Oppenheimer. He tells many tales, including the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998. He blames that collapse on the fund manager's overconfidence in the efficiency of markets.Levy offers his perspective on the recent stock market bubble, concluding the bubble continues (with lower prices ahead). His conclusion that Newt Gingrich's 1995 \\"contract with America\\" paved the way for the egregious acts of corporate executives and accounting firms makes for interesting reading.This book is worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful book","review":"This book is highly useful.

There were too many references to earlier books, without enough back ground to really refresh a reader's memory. Also, there were too many characters playing roles in this story, and they all seemed to be falling in love with each other (and not for any reason other than being of an appropriate rank/age).In short, while mildly entertaining, keeping track of the plot twists was confusing and made the book difficult to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I'm a longtime Lansdowne fan and it's difficult to say how much I enjoyed reading SHALL WE DANCE?

It was a wonderful read, with lovable, eccentric characters, witty, quirky dialogue, a bit of mystery and suspense - and, of course, romance - bravo!!!I can't agree with the previous reviews - I buy these books, and love them, for some of the very reasons others panned them. (Note: reading MY FAIR QUIGGLEY prior to reading this one will help the reader appreciate who everyone is.) I love the richness of the characters, and the many secondary characters, to me, just show off Lansdowne's talent for \\"quirky and funny\\".

I'll admit that I don't read a great many romance novels, however, when I initially stumbled upon her novel \\"Amelia's Intrigue\\" I was enchanted and blown away by her characterizations of the men of the ton, especially the two brothers, one of whom suffered from a brain injury as a result of a childhood accident. I can't tell you how many times I've read that novel. Simply stunning. I've recommended it other friends who loved it as well. Another novel that made me laugh out loud and go \\"ahh!!\\" is her \\"Legion's Ladies.\\" Again, this novel was filled with caring, witty characters and the writing was superb. The novels lately, especially the Nightingale series, were just carbon copies of the typical romance - nothing special; no lovely friendships I so loved about her earlier novels.

I would run out and buy them as soon as they were released. With the start of her Nightingale series (which I hated), and continuing on, I have been consistently disappointed. Her stories now seem to be a mish-mash of characters, most of whom fall in love immediately but then little time is spent on their romantic development. Her romances are too sweet valley high. No, I am not looking for erotic stories, but the cloying \\"sweetness\\" of all her characters, males and females, the ever present animals, crazy relatives, nutty servants, have been overplayed for me.

Only two slight cautions -- it does NOT do well with wet leaves (but I doubt that anything does), and it can be a bit difficult to start after it's been running for awhile and shut off temporarily (basically just a hard pull).

It focuses on showing accomodations (even bathrooms), campgrounds, and families on beaches and in the water.

So much devastation and bloodshed was unleashed that there remain visible scars in many large cities in the Balkans.Misha Glenny's 700 page 4-star book, The Balkans - Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804 - 1999 tells the story of this period and the history leading up to it.The following is a sentence from the book which characterizes its style:\\"On the evening of Monday 22 April 1996, a small group of Serbs were enjoying a drink at the Cakor café in Decani in western Kosovo.\\"Where detailed information is available, the author uses a personal approach to make the complex integrations of Balkan history more clear and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOREIGN LANGUAGE ANYONE?","review":"Glenny has taken on a herculean task that only a kinder hearted approach would have worked. About every tenth word, Glenny shows off his knowledge of all the multiple languages spoken there. He gives the English word for them only once after their first usage! Better be prepared to enter these words in your palm pilot for when you need them again later in the book. I guarantee, you'll never need them anywhere else! Another major weakness, Glenny starts his history in 1815 after Waterloo and the Congress of Vienna divided the region.

The fall of communism is well illustrated as is the struggle between Russia and Austria for mastery of the region. The establishment of Bulgaria as the \\"super power\\" of the Balkans by the Russians is illustrated in the comical light that it was at the time. This book does an excellent job of thoroughly covering the salient points in the region and doing so with wonderful prose. This is an incredibly troubled area and understanding that this area was created out of conflict is essential for studying the region today. This is great for an expert or a beginner.

Before the ball is snapped, the defensive linemen can pretty much jump over the offensive line and sack the quarterback whenever they want.

The cord had been unravelled ad no so well rewound.So, with that being said. We did unwrap the popper and tried it. It did work this time.

After that, it has only been able to pop a few kernels at a time. .then it shuts off until it cools down. It seems that it is overheating...again and again, and in a matter of a few minutes (easily less than 5). Sadly, because i didnt save either the box or the receipt, i have no recourse other than to warn the world that this is surely not worth anyone's moneyI bought this in target. I would never had bought this one if the presto machines had been sold there. this was the only hot air popper they had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but avoid this stinker","review":"My gf loves popcorn so I was tasked to purchase her a replacement for her cheapo $10 air popper. I saw this one and thought \\"what a great idea\\" and bought it on the spot. I hadn't read the reviews here when I did my heart sank. Although some people \\"did\\" rate it high and said it was great. Sadly these may be closer to paid reviews because the consensus here seems to be true. Slow popping with small kernals. It makes a mess as well with kernels everywhere. If you like running through a batch of pops then do not look at this model. It's simply too slow and requires a \\"breather\\". It was returned yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Popper","review":"This popper is horrible. Even though it uses no oil or anything, just hot air, it is big and bulky. It can become a storage problem. Also, once some of the popcorn is popped and hot kernels are in the bowl, they will pop, sending prpcorn everywhere!!! If I could, i would give this produst 0 stars. It is a horrible product that is a waste of money. You should buy a different popper, even if it uses oil. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This doesn't even deserve a star","review":"My husband bought me this for Christmas at Bed Bath and Beyond. At first the thing didn't work, then I stored it away for a few months and brought it back out thinking that I'd give it a second shot. Well, it worked good for a few weeks, it was popping most of the kernels and then it just stopped working again and was popping 20 kernels at the most (big waste of money on the machine and the kernels!) and now it just makes a humming noise when I turn it on. This product is definitely a big waste of money, and I agree with some of the others, it seems they only made this thing for looks, no thought went into popping the kernels. I think the buyers should get a refund for this product! So for all you who are thinking about this product, SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy a different brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Unsatisfied","review":"So, I bought this during the Cyber Monday Sales as a Christmas Gift for my family-and the deal on this popcorn maker caught my eye. I was buying the family a new entertainment set for the living room and a few new movies and figured this nostalgic, Old-Fashioned looking popcorn maker would fit my running theme perfectly. When I tool it out and turned it on as a test drive, I immediately noticed that the fan tht should have circulated hot air was not running and that some of the decorative plastic fixtured appear to be loose. Honestly what is the use is a cheap looking popcorn maker that does not pop popcorn? No matter what the cost? Money is money and it is a tough economy. It seems to me that this item belong on the Islanf of Misfit Toys rather than in someone's Amazon Shopping Cart. Now I am dealing with the hassle of returning it, and hunting down a replacement two weeks before Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This pop corn machine is amazing!

While it may look cute, it is a total piece of junk. They got 2 uses out of it and then it stopped working. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems to work fine","review":"Just followed the directions and it worked fine. As some people say, the kernels pop out, but I really didn't have that prob, maybe 10 kernels popped out into the bowl. As the air popper spins and gets hot, some of the kernels did come out, but once it started popping, popcorn filled in the air popper and no kernels could get out even if they tried. It does have a poor design with getting the popcorn out cause the wheels are in the way, but even that wasn't that big of a deal. I just put a bowl that was at the height of the pop corn emptier and it worked fine, some popcorn came out the sides but not enough to really complain about.If the kernels didn't pop out and the wheels weren't in the way it would have gotten a 5. It gets a 4 cause it worked super fast and doesn't require oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many unpopped kernels!","review":"I read the reviews here before I bought this and decided to take a chance. That was a mistake! I will be returning this to get my money back and buy a popper that actually works. Now I understand what people were saying about popcorn flying all over the room! Only about 1/3 of the kernels actually popped in the machine - the rest flew out unpopped. Some of them actually popped while they were in the bowl or on the counter - quite a sight! I don't know why this problem only affects some of the machines but if you have your heart set on buying this, be sure to keep the box it comes in. You might need it to take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"On a scale of 1-5, I give it a -20","review":"This is the worst popcorn popper I have ever owned! It is slow and doesn't pop well.

In the same timeframe I was able to take out my old $10.00 popper (Walmart special)and pop 3 large bowls, melt the butter and disperse to the 15 teengers waiting in movieroom.

At last I found the product I've so desperately been looking for. Wrong answer. This is the worse mess I've seen. It only pops about a third of the kernels and shoots popcorn and hot kernels everywhere. Has anyone thought to let the manufacturer in on this worthless product? Obviously it was improperly tested. How about Consumer Reports?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I blame the company","review":"I have called 3 times now because we unboxed this \\"treasure\\" and thew away the box and set it up for movie night.

This looked so cool at the store. I wish it worked as well as it looks. If anyone has a solution to keeping nearly half of the unpopped kernals from flying out, let me know. To say popping corn in this is an adventure is an understatement. However, the entertainment value for my two young nieces who love watching popcorn (both popped and unpopped) fly across the kitchen is priceless. Don't buy for looks.

I was very happy with it for the first 2-3 weeks. I wanted a simple, hot-air popper and that's what this is. Then it began to only pop about 1/3 of the kernels. Yesterday (May 15, 2008), I turned on the popcorn maker. It started up, then started to make horrible noise. I turned it off, unplugged it, and left it for 10 minutes. When I turned it on again, it did nothing. I opened it up, cleaned it, turned it upside down and lightly shook it in case a kernel had gotten down in it, then put it fresh kernels and turned it on. It came on, then began making horrible noise and a flame shot from it. I turned it off and unplugged it.This popcorn maker has obviously malfunctioned. I'm very upset that it barely lasted a month. I won't be buying this popper again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasty popcorn, horrible design","review":"The air-popped popcorn was tasty, but the popper had some definite design flaws. The square chamber traps the popcorn in corners, making it difficult to get out. Mine also died after 2 weeks of occasional use-- it started making horrible noises and then just refused to turn on. Since I had received the item as a gift, I didn't have a receipt, and couldn't get it fixed under warranty. Given this one's design flaws, I'll just be getting a more standard (round) popper in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Cute, Works like . . . .","review":"Like one other reviewer said, this popper doesn't pop all the kernals. I got this popper as a birthday present and ended up returning it. When you fill up the measuring cup for kernals, you have to pop it through about 4 cycles before you get most of them popped. As kernals pop, they shoot lots of unpoppped kernals out into the bowl and you have to keep popping them over and over. Also the spout is very large and even with a huge bowl, some kernals went flying across the counter.Don't waste your manoey for looks, buy somethign that works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"cotufera","review":"Excelente producto, me gustó mucho sus servicios y disposición para atender mi compra. gracias espero seguir contando con esta tienda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, fire hazard.","review":"We got about 6 pops total, over a few months, out of this junk before the thing went nuts and made a bunch of noise and then burned up inside.

Fairly well, except for the obvious design flaws. We put it away for a few months, and now it is not working at all. Nothing. Of course, they have a 90-day policy, and we are beyond that.

Real cute design, especially for any fan of nostalgia. HOWEVER. As another reviewer mentioned, the raw popcorn is spewed out of the machine before it even sits long enough to get lukewarm, let alone hot to pop. The whole quality of this device is NOT worth the money. Several area stores sell this machine and looking back, I should have returned it right away. The product was given to a charity organization. Perhaps someone can use it a decoration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Cool and That's It","review":"It barely pops even half the kernels and like others have said, they end up EVERYWHERE.

It works perfectly and is ridiculously easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darling design and functions too!","review":"This is so cute! It looks just like the big ones at a fraction of the cost.

It shoots popcorn everywhere and is in no way fun. We thought this would be a fun item and a conversation piece. It IS a piece all-right.About 1/4 of all the popcorn that is put in the popper comes back out and into the bowl un-popped. Sometimes it is so hot that it comes out an pops IN THE BOWL! All in all we threw ours in the trash. I hate to throw things away, but in this case I was glad to be rid of this mess maker. If you have bought this, I am very sorry for you. If you are considering it, go to another brand. Presto seems to be highly rated. I think my mom had one when I was growing up, seems like it was a good one. All I know is STAY AWAY FROM THIS POPPER! NOstalgia should have kept this one in the past!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible popcorn maker!","review":"The only thing this popcorn maker has going for it is being cute sitting on the counter. Forget about making popcorn with it. It does not stir the corn properly so the kernels tend to burn instead of popping and then when they finally pop, they get all blocked up in the container and don't want to come out into the bowl. PLUS, the motor on mine burned out after only a few uses. Buy the Orville Redenbacher instead if you actually want to make popcorn with your machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Popcorn Popper Ever","review":"I received this popper as a gift, and while it looks nice, it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine. I have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn. Nothing worked. If I had the receipt it would already have been returned. Since I don't, it is going in the garbage. Also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine. Stay away from this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"My mother-in-law bought this popper for my two small children for Valentine's Day. What a piece of junk! My kids were so excited about it since popcorn is their favorite snack. Half a jar of Orville Redenbacher's kernels and 30 minutes later, it managed to pop enough to fill 2 sandwich-sized zip-lock bags. I'd also like to warn you that it spits out hot unpopped kernels...my 2 year old picked one up before I could get to it and burned her finger. I wish I could throw this thing away since it takes up so much space to store, but I'm sure my mother-in-law will look for it on her next visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the popcorn???","review":"Looks cute sitting on the counter!

However, when I bought this popper, I was amazed at how many kernels went unpopped. The corn that was popped was somewhat burned. Both of these happened because of the design or the popper. I also agreed that it rather large to store. I returned the popper after trying it twice because I was so unhappy with how it did its job."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"How would you feel about something that made you ill? When I took the popper out of the box I read all the directions about cleaning it and how to proceed with popping corn. I cleaned it and plugged it in. Then I turned it on and began to wait the required two minutes. After about a minute thick black smoke came billowing out of it. Since I was standing right next to it the toxic mess was inhaled as I reached to unplug it and turn on the exhaust fan. I ended up with a respiratory problem and asthma attack. It was cute and the person I gave it to as a gift loved it - until it almost burned down the house and filled our home with noxious smoke. Amazon as always refunded my money when I returned it. It was a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"This popcorn maker shoots hot uncooked kernels at you, only about half of the kernels actually pop, so,not only is it a waste of good popcorn, but a safety hazard. I have tried different brands of popcorn. Nothing seems to stop the onslought of lava hot kernels hitting your bowl and flying everywhere. I think this product is also poorly designed, a bowl doesn't even fit properly in front of it, so you have to hold the bowl, like a shield. I would definately not recommend it, and if you do attempt to use it, I suggest hiding the children, the pets, wearing a long sleeve shirt, gloves, and goggles.

Yes, it's that bad. I bought this item for my sister for Christmas as a way to steer my nieces from that buttery microwaveable mess they get in the box to a more healthier regimen. The only healthy thing about this popcorn maker was the fact that you could eat the kernels raw because they didn't pop! I poured in the amount as I was instructed and as my nieces and I waited excitedly to hear the poping sound, nothing happend. The machine started fine and the kernels were turning, then one kernel popped. After that one popcorn, the machine stopped. After 20 minutes it turned itself on again and popped another. After another 20 minutes the fan turned on again and the rest of the kernels burned (without popping). Needless to say, this burncorn maker was definetly a waste of time and effort. I would have more success popping the kernels outside in the sun during Boston's winter season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky, inefficient mess-maker","review":"The Movietime Popcorn Maker is larger than need be, making storage a problem for those with limited space. This is a particular problem with this item because after a few uses, it's probably going to stay in storage until your next yard sale. Whatever the freshness or brand of popcorn you use, it has a high rate of unpopped kernels. The design of the unit makes it impossible to catch many the popped and unpopped kernels that spew forth -- some as far as 5 feet from the machine. The height of the ejection shoot prevents the placement of a bowl deep enough to contain the popcorn without flying about and the ersatz wheels prevent all but the tiniest bowls from getting close enough to the unit. If you get the popper, save the many unpopped kernels. Odds are there's nothing wrong with them and many will pop on subsequent attempts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Time Popcorn Maker","review":"This is by far one of the worst products I ever purchased. Only about one-quarter of the kernels pop and when they do pop its usually as they are leaving the maker and end up all over the floor.

Don't waste your money unless you want it for decoration. It makes a mess with the popcorn blowing out.

Most families would need to make several batches but you have to wait 15 minutes before you can make a new batch. LOOK FOR ANOTHER POPPER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Popcorn Popper is Possessed!","review":"I bought this popcorn popper for my parents as a gift. They hated it and so did everyone else that witnessed it's performance. We all concluded it is possessed. First of all, it left at least half of the popcorn kernels unpopped everytime, which was very disappointing. I know this is not due to the quality of the popcorn because I have successfully popped the same brand of popcorn in my own popper (different brand popper) at home with great results everytime.

Told primarily through the eyes of a Newspaper Artist, the story deals with all the issues of the war, such as slavery and states' rights, while presenting a good-though-fictional story framed within the four years of the war. While it tends to be melodramatic at times, and there are a few slow passages, the fine storytelling, inspired performances and terrific battle sequences make up for the film's weak points. Overall, this is a fine Civil War drama.Grade: B+Postscript: I am reviewing \\"The Complete Miniseries\\" 3-Disc Set.

Poorly told, poorly acted, it was an attempt to justify the Union's invasion of the South as something noble. The bravery of the Federal Army with four times the number of men as the Confederacy is never brought to one's attention, and the slaughter the Union inflicted upon the people, the land, and the economy of the South is down played to an extreme. Union traitors, spy's and soldiers are glorified while Southern soldiers are nasty folks who were doomed to failure. After you've seen the film Gettysburg you'll have an idea of why this war was fought and how wrong a war it was. The miniseries of The Blue and the Grey fails to show the truth about this horrible war."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was decent until the main character killed Federal soldiers","review":"It was decent until the main character killed Federal soldiers, that was unexcusable. Notice to all producers: Make more Civil War movies! There is a shortage of good ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War Fun","review":"This mini-series is a fun, not-too-heavy look at the American Civil War through the eyes of a Southern-born artist working as a war correspondent for Northern newspapers. He has family on both sides, so he experiences both sides of the war. The war itself is largely glossed-over with many key events omitted or only mentioned in passing. For more intense and emotional Civil War films, you would be better off with \\"Gettysburg,\\" \\"Gods and Generals,\\" or \\"Glory.\\" For more soap opera qualities, the \\"North and South\\" mini-series is what you are looking for. This has a light mixture of both and is still worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very inaccurate civil war movie","review":"The makers of this miniseries should have done their research beter. In the movie it says the battle of Gettysburge took place in May!? The battle took place July 1st, 2nd, 3rd. And then they showed Lincoln giveing his Infamouse speech right afterward the battle. He didn't give his speech until November. Another thing that was wrong was the fall of Vicksburge. The city was surrendered on the 4th of July 1863 the day after Gettysburge. Last but not least as with all movies about the war they failed to mention the true causes of the war which were political coruption in the north andthe fact that Lincoln was a SOCIALIST."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blue and Gray enjoyable movie","review":"The movie The Blue and The Gray comes with three discs. The movie is over 6 hrs so we watched it in sections - a disc a night. The only problem we had was on the third disc it hung up mid way but finally got going again. The sound was lost so we had to pause and then the sound came back. We just backed it up to where the mess up was and it was fine. The movie itself was enjoyable and concentrated more on the personal aspects of the war instead of on so much fighting. There are some battle scenes, but that is not the major content of the movie. Anyone who is a Civil War fan should enjoy watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue and the Gray","review":"Never got to watch this due to working retail hours when it was on network TV.

No way could this be rated five stars. Anyone who did is way to easy to please. I watched the whole thing and thank god I had a fast forward button that was used quite often. The whole war seemed to be fought by 50 of the same people. Uniforms were ridiculous. Gregory peck should be ashamed, though he did a splendid job of acting the script was un-believable. Stacy keach did a great job of acting. The Geyser family did not make you feel like they were a real family. This really took away from the reality of the whole mess. Again, I watched it. I will never watch it again so Im going to sell this. I made the mistake of watching Maxwells Gettysburg and God and Generals. Those were the BEST EVER MADE SO FAR! All other movies cant compare to those. Blue and Grey is a joke compared to them. Now that I think about it. I really should have given this series one star. Sorry but it was corny as hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much for this movie...","review":"It's bad - really, really bad. If you are able to get past the early 80's haircuts, uniforms which don't look quite right, Civil War battles that look they were fought by maybe 30 people, and painfull to watch overacting, then there is still the writing. Stacy Keach's character for example, had dreams in which he predicts the future (you hear about them throughout the movie - somehow Keach is able to deliver his lines with a straight face). Hard to believe someone wrote this movie on purpose, harder still to believe that someone thought it was a good idea. Save your money and get Gettysburg instead, or make your own movie with sock puppets, which will still be much better than The Blue and the Gray."},{"rating":"2","title":"CORE quality","review":"I have purchased several CORE pillows & supports at the recommendation of my chiropractor and have always been more than pleased with the high quality of their products.

The game is designed by Reiner Knizia -- a great German game designer who also designed the great Lord of the Rings game.In Lost Cities, the two players are competing in the realm of archeology (although the theme of the game is really quite thin). Players take turns playing cards and drawing replacements. The basic idea is that once you start an expedition, you can only play a higher card of that suit. There are five suits altogether. You must be very careful not to start TOO many expeditions, however. The game is easy to learn and great fun for two players. Highly recommended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Cities Lives Up to the Hype.","review":"Lost Cities has captivated my wife and me-- we play almost every other day. The game certainly deserves its accolades, including \\"Best Game for Couples,\\" by Real Simple (which is how we discovered it). The gameplay is extremely straightforward (imagine two player competitive solitaire)-- it only took about 10 minutes for us to get going, and we haven't stopped since. As you become more experienced, the game will become very strategic, with elements of deception and sabotage. It's great as an after-dinner game, and it'll feed your appetite for puzzles, competition, and entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!","review":"I bought this game before going on a cruise with my boyfriend so that we would have something to do on quiet days.

I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a 2-player game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got 15min to kill? Play this game!","review":"My wife and I have had this game for a month and we've really enjoyed it. When we play we usually play for a certain amount of time. There is definitely some strategy involved, mostly consisting of not discarding cards your opponent could use. I think this game would be a great tool for learning addition, subtraction, multiplication and could be a good step up for children who don't want to play a \\"little kid\\" looking game. I do recommend using something as a player turn token, especially if you are doing something else while playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers.

But a good game for two people, which are hard to find. Arrived quickly, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another game that does nothing with a promising theme","review":"Buyer beware, the promise of this games title and description are extremely misleading. The artwork on the cards is very pretty and depicts exotic locales, but that's as close to a sense of exploration as you're going to get with this game. Rather than a game of exploration and discovery, as is promised, what you get is a 2 player variant of solitaire.Game play consists of arranging numbered cards (with pretty but game-irrelevant artwork on them) into sequential stacks. You essentially \\"wager\\" on how many of these stacks you can complete before the draw deck runs out. That's really all there is to it.Prospective buyers are well advised to look around online and find the game rules before buying this. If it seems like something you want to play, that's fine, but the whole \\"expeditions to lost cities\\" motif is essentially a complete misrepresentation of the game play. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun game for 2 players","review":"I got this game hoping for a quick 2 player game to play with my wife. We don't have a lot of time at night after getting the kids to bed, so the games we normally like to play get neglected. Lost cities is a great 2 player game that takes less than 1/2 hour to play.

It's just a pack of cards (it comes with a board, but you don't need it to play). There's lots of luck involved, but without good strategy you won't win.The crux of the game is to build up suits of cards from lower to higher, choosing which cards to play and which to discard. By playing up suits of cards, you earn points, but if you commit to a suit too early, and don't make the minimum points, you'll get a negative score.Discarding can be problematic, too, as discarded cards are available to the other player.Extra point bonuses come from investment cards, and building long suits.I highly recommend this for older children and adults. There are few good two person strategy games on the market-- this is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cooperative or engaging","review":"The game is portrayed as if the experience is two players working together or charting their own paths versus the game's obstacles. But in reality, it's strictly competitive, and you win by thwarting the other player. The gameplay is rather simplistic and somewhat boring. I cannot say I would recommend this, even for someone seeking simple fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son was thrilled to get it for Christmas.","review":"I bought this for my son, who I know researched what he wanted - he was very happy and has played this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting game with unique concept","review":"I bought this game while looking for a unique, fun 2-player game. Lost Cities is not your average game and is quite interesting. Game goes by super quickly and the first time I opened up I played 5 times. I think you really need to be open minded and play a few \\"warm up\\" times to get the hang of it. There is counting and strategy all of which is confusing until you really get the idea of the game and the scoring of the game. I would recommend this game as a good, durable, quick, 2 player game for people looking for something unique and different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Two Player Game","review":"My wife and I prefer more involved games, like Settlers of Catan and Dominion, but wanted something designed specifically for two players. So far we have really liked Lost Cities in that role. The gameplay rules are extremely simple, which makes you think there's nothing to it until you get to the end of your first game and realize how poorly you've done. After that the strategy starts from the first move of the game.

I took particular issue with his argument against people acting as utility-maximizers, where he uses cigarette smoking as an example of something that people trying to maximize utility would never do - he argues that they would weigh the health risks 30 years down the road and the expense as outweighing the immediate pleasure which smokers derive from cigarettes. In other areas, though, like his discussion of the health-care system, his reasoning and writing is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical.","review":"As previous reviews have mentioned, Everything For Sale is little more than typical leftist diatribe packaged in muddled economics. William Grieder's One World, Ready of Not makes the same type of arguments but at least provides keener examples. If you want to read this stuff, go with Grieder's book. While it's reasoning is just as muddled, it does provide hundreds of colorful stories that are worth hearing. If all you want is the diatribe, you're better off saving your money and buying a copy of Adbusters magazine, which is cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who does he think he is? William Greider?","review":"A tepid defense of the new Robert Rubin/George Soros style of capitalism. Kuttner tries to balance the need of liberals to get filthy rich but also to pay token respect to antitrust, regulation, and the poor. His idea that market economics can work with restraints is ultimately unworkable; the restraints he sees as good stifle experimentation and promulgate the welfare state."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Royal Wedding:William & Catherine","review":"Own a piece of Royal History with this BBC DVD Video,the quality is amazing,and it covers all aspects of the William and Catherine Wedding,there is even a history of how they both first got to know each other,and fell in love,very complete and very highly recommended!I hope they make a PART 2 BBC VIDEO to this one that will cover the 2 Wedding Receptions that took place after the Royal Wedding was over,we can only hope!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not so good","review":"This is a beautiful memento of that very special wedding day.

But for those of us (all) who wanted this as a keepsake of this magical, iconic event, the integrity and keepsake value of this DVD is vastly and sadly reduced, because of the glaring, glaring, absence of even one single milisecond of one sngle frame of one single shot of the unique, unprecedented, and now LEGENDARY ride in the blue Aston Martin, one of the (if not THE ) most memorable shots of this most historic event.

The late Jim Hensen outdid himself w/ this wonderful heartfelt Christmas movie. Thank God VCR's were invented before HBO stopped showing Emmit around Christmas. I hope this will help you future Emmit lovers to decide on buying this movie. It's a classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the edited version!!!","review":"Contrary to some other reviews, HBO always ran the same exact version throughout the times which they aired it. This original version was released in the mid 80s on VHS. They have since rereleased it on VHS making the original out of print. Like many things for whatever reason someone with a suit and tie thinks it will be good to revamp or change things(See MUPPET FAMILY XMAS). So the current in print VHS and DVD are not the original version aired on HBO. I have that version and it is different from the new DVD and VHS. For those who don't have a copy of the original try some auction sites(...) to find this rare out of print version. It comes in a white big cheesy VHS 80s plastic box with the characters illustrated on the front. If you are lucky enough to find it. Good luck!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is NO unedited version available . . .","review":"The original, full-length version of this classic is not available anywhere, for any cost. If you watched this on HBO growing up, you will not be able to find the same version. There was a VHS version that has since become unavailable. There never was a full-length, unedited version available on DVD. Even the version with Kermit on the box has been signigicantly edited. This is what's availble. It sucks, but for $10.00, it might do to hold you over until the people at Henson Productions get their act together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A holiday classic!","review":"I remember watching this every Christmas when I was younger. This is a family tradition and I'm so glad to find it available on video. The adorable characters, the sweet songs, and a very touching message. It has everything a Christmas story should have and it's Jim Henson! You can't beat this great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Version of Christmas Classic","review":"Some problems: 1) Picture looks slightly out of focus at times. 2) The audio mix emphasizes the music instead of the vocals, making it difficult to decipher some of the song lyrics. I tried every audio setting available and none sounded as good as my old copy on VHS. These are Muppets, it's not like we can read their lips or anything. 3) One of the \\"edits\\" makes no sense. Towards the beginning, when Emmet's mom is annoyed that the woman won't pay her this week for the laundry, her voice (in another version) trails off saying \\"Why don't you just fall...off...the...dock.\\" But in this DVD version, the last four words are edited out. So when another character says, \\"That's telling her Alice!\\" he's not referring to anything. All in all, this DVD is very disappointing and I can't recommend it, even though I love the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emmet Otters JugBand Christmas","review":"This is a great classic that I watch with my children every Christmas eve. It shows the true meaning of love. I also would like to say that I bought mine 2 years ago in a mall at one of the movies stores and only paid 19.99 for a brand new one on DVD. So please do not try to rip people off it is a horrible thing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Editing","review":"I was going to buy this finally-released video, but when I read the reviews and found all of them said the same thing - that the original Emmet Otter had been edited from what we remember it as being, I backed out of it. I, too, have an old copy taped off air about 20 years ago, and that (original) version will just have to suffice for a few more years. When Emmet Otter's Jug Band Christmas is released in it's original form, then I will gladly pay to add it to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emmet Otter","review":"Great service. Item was received before the Christmas Holiday. Notification on the shipment indicated it would not be received until January, however, it was received prior to Christmas and it was enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great version, but I miss Kermie in the middle","review":"I was one of the people who saw this in its original form and, unlike it's cousin The Muppet Family Christmas, it survived the editing process with only minor resections. However, it boggles my mind why they removed Kermit's narration towards the end of the show. It is quite obvious where they did it because Emmet freeze frames for a few seconds and then it abruptly segways into them singing together. Oh well. I have loved this one since I first saw it on HBO in the late 80's. This is a good example of how a good story survives, no matter how low-tech its presentation is. It is nice to have it on DVD, even with the alterations. Merry Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, so I'm not going crazy","review":"Thank goodness other viewers also noticed the 3 big edits in this video/DVD. Why did they edit it at all? Better yet, why can I seem to remember the original broadcast that I saw almost 20 years ago but can't remember simple day-to-day things?!?!?! I guess it's just because this movie is that good. It's a great story that has characters you'll remember forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas","review":"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas will always remain a classic in my book! This is a wonderful video for both the young and old. I wish that there were more creative puppetering in today's world. So much though and effort was put into each of the characters. There are valuable lessons to be learned in this story, something that seems to be lost in todays childrens programs.

Happy holidays!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"Before buying this DVD I read the reviews and all of them seemed to be real good (4 or 5 stars). Now I see quite a few reviews much lower and I must agree. I wasted my money on this purchase. The quality of this effort reminds me of the early days of TV when puppet shows and cooking shows were about all you could call entertainment. Although the show was \\"cute\\" it was not anywhere near the quality of other Muppet features. If you want a good, really good Muppet Christmas flick then I would recommend \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy..","review":"The quality of this dvd was so bad that I purchased a new one from walmart to compare. Not only was the picture quality bad and blurry, but the sound quality was even worse it almost appeared as if it were recorded from a VHS tape. Every time the music started for emmit or his mother to sing, the music would sound but the singing voices lowered. You could only hear the music and and very little to no voices...nothing wrong with my equiptment, I own a state of the art system and tried every adustment to my equiptment and television before writing this review. In conclusion, the dvd is totally useless and a real dissapointment. I gave it two stars only because it was shipped and arrived promptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sleeper Christmas Classic","review":"A priceless, magical gem of Christmas spirit! Jim Henson pretty much nailed it with this one. Yeah, it's a little corny, but the show is filled with great characters (my favorite is Wendell) and infectious little songs. How can you hear \\"Momma's Barbecue\\" and not go around humming it all day? It's a cold, cynical person who cannot derive some joy from this video. This is especially good for little-little kids, even toddlers. They may not understand the concepts, but they *love* the music. At least my toddler did. Of course, this means that in February, with Christmas long behind us, we're STILL watching Emmet. : ) Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Fun from my childhood, still great to watch!","review":"I can't say enough good things about Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas. I watched this movie for the first time on HBO. At that time I was amazed at how the lifelike the muppet's acted. I still completely enjoy watching this movie, over and over, again. In fact, right now I have the song, \\"Bar-B-Que\\" from this movie stuck in my head. This movie is a good lesson on importance of family and friends. And an absolute MUST HAVE for your Christmas DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Movie--How Could Someone Edit It?","review":"I'm 24 years old and I remember watching this wonderful movie on TV every Christmas. Emmet Otter was a holiday tradition in my family alongside the Grinch and It's a Wonderful Life. Then it disappeared for a few years until it aired on Nickelodeon in the early 90s. Luckily a cousin shared my love of Emmet and his friends, and she taped it. I was delighted to find a new copy available on Amazon.com earlier this year. It arrived today, and my excitement was soon replaced with disappointment when I realized I had been sent an edited version of the film. At three distinct parts in the story there was dialogue missing. This appalled me. How could someone edit a classic? I realize this isn't Amazon.com's fault, but I thought consumers should know that they aren't buying the original. I will continue to watch my favorite Christmas movie, even if it doesn't match perfectly with the version in my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Henson, great family fun.","review":"This movie is a prime example of the great work we've all grown up with from Jim Henson. It's Christmas time in Frogtown Hollow, and Ma and Emmet Otter want to buy gifts for each other. Only problem is that money is very tight. Ma and Emmet (with his jug-band) enter a talent show, each hoping to buy something nice for the other with the prize money. Kermit takes us through the story as the narrator. This movie gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling. With a story that will capture your imagination and warm your heart, Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas is a must-see for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I too grew up watching this movie on my own tape recorded copy.

No-can-do with this crazy-azz jack. Twist the jack handle anti-clockwise as gently, carefully and as precisely as a neurosurgeon would, or as quick, brutish, and abruptly as a prehistoric caveman might do. The outcome is the same: Your vehicle comes crashing down to earth in a nanosecond, just like the stock cars in the pits at the Daytona 500 after a tire change.

I feel that I am finally starting to understand music now, it's a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Written","review":"O.K. so maybe the cartoons are kinda cheesy, but this is hands down the clearest, best written theory book I have read.I'm no theory expert, but I've looked over a couple college level texts as well as intro theory books/websites and this book is very comprehensive without overwhelming the reader with academic music pedagogy. The tone is friendly rather than pedantic and makes the subject very accessible even to the complete beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Undesirable Journalist","review":"This book is about a german journalist who goes undercover as a Turkish worker to investigate the ways immigrant workers are treated in the german work environment.

I was very excited about a \\"bullet proof\\" USB storage device that was advertised as failproof. In less than a year the graphics wore off completely from being on my keychain, which in itself isn't the main problem. Granted, it took away from the appearance, but the main issue is with the total failure of the unit. No reason that I'm aware of. . .never been in water, never thrown, never dropped. . .it simply stopped being recognized. I tried three different computers at work and two of my laptops at home. . . the USB storage device simply stopped working. I'm very disappointed, especially having paid as much as I did to have this type of an upgraded USB storage device. I have several plastic units that are older, yet still working.

Your samurai, ronin, navy ship, and piece tiles will influence the surrounding pieces. Once a piece (rice, hat, or Buddha) is completely surrounded, player with the biggest influence gets the piece.

I've had it for under three weeks and have played it 26 times with friends and family. Fans of Carcassonne, Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, and the like should enjoy. One strategy will not win you many games. Game play between 2, 3, and 4 people is delightfully different.

All of the black males are negatively portrayed; even the 5 year old son is portrayed asa brute. The black female adultress says that blacks in the USsecretly want whites to accept them. Basically Scott Spencer hada mid-life crisis; never got over OJ's acquittal and decided to write a masturbatory tale for him and other low-lifes of his ilk. Maybe he and Alice Walker should team up and write a book about ablack male psychotic murderer. And no, I didn't pay for this junk. I heard about the ridiculous premise in the paper and borrowed it from my library. The only interesting things about the novel are the passages at the start of each chapter and thereferences to relatively obscure artists such as Don Covay (who in reality should sue for being associated with such tripe)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, just awful!","review":"A huge disappointment. A 12-year-old boy's outlook on sex (except some 12-year-old boys have a maturer attitude), and the race dialogue will make you wince and cringe. Besides, nobody actually talks like that. Flat dialogue, wooden characters, cutesy flashbacks...ugh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I don't know when I have been more disappointed in a book. There is foreshadowing early on that the story will end badly, and indeed it does, on many levels. The story definitely draws you in, and while the author has a wonderful gift for prose and has bravely tackled sensitive issues, the result is an unbelievable, unhappy story with characters that are all foolish, weak, and selfish. Spencer portrays blacks very stereotypically and negatively, and it seems that he spent little time researching interracial couples.The ending was an absolute disaster - how I wish I had stopped reading before I reached it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improbable","review":"OK, I'll admit that love stories aren't my favorite genre, and I got the book from the library only because it was an NBA nominee. Perhaps I got confused and basketball players, not book critics, made that nomination?I found the events improbable and the characters unlikeable and unbelievable. The end of the book was awful. Spencer seems to have tired of telling the story, so he abandoned everyone in the stinking mess that he had created, with their noses barely above the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's love got to do with it","review":"I agree with many reviewers that the writing was good in part but wasted on unlikeable characters, a weak romance and unpleasant stereotypes (why are all the young black male characters violent, why doesn't the devoted mother get counseling for a 5 yr old who left a babysitter needing 20+ stitches and shot at another kid, why does the caring stepfather let these kids play together unsupervised?)And I think there was a glaring error in the very first sentence that foreshadows a critical scene when it says Kate has to leave the party to relieve the daughter's babysitter because they took the daughter with them to the party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha?","review":"I gave this book a 2 because the writing is excellent. However, the characters are all unlikeable. They act irresponsibly and disrespectfully and none of them seems to learn anything. The whole race thing seems disassociated. Daniel and Iris are not torn apart because of color. They're torn apart because they are in committed relationships with other people and worse, kids are involved. I disagree with some of the other reviewers that the ending is unsatisfying; there is no ending. What about Hampton? Will their son improve or become a serial killer? Is Iris pregnant and why would that be a good thing at that point? Will Kate get on with her life and move back to NYC already? It doesn't have to be tied up in a neat little package, but give me something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsession or True Love???","review":"I read this book about a year ago and recommended it to a few friends. This still sparks discussion amongst us even today. The debate mostly centers around Daniel's obsession or love for Iris. You be the judge! I found the author's use of setting and mood to match perfectly. Spencer does an excellent job of painting word pictures and weaving plotlines together smoothly. I finished this book quickly based more on the intrigue of the novel than length. If you're looking for a book club book for the new season pick this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible ending!!!","review":"My wife found it so disappointing, she made me read it just to see what I thought about it. Well, I agreed. The story itself was not too bad, but the tragedies that brought it towards the conclusion don't fit.My big problem with this book was the ending. Seems like the author just got tired of writing and butchered it at the end. The ending is pretty bad and abrupt. So for that reason the book is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what Scott was trying to say in this novel","review":"I'm not sure what to think of the book. As I was reading it, I kept thinking 'what is Scott saying to his readers?' with this text. I thought it was at times a little stereotypical. I was even suspicious of why the book gave attention to the O.J. trial. I didn't feel like the book redeemed itself in the end. (Speaking of the end, I didn't QUITE get it, but anyway...) I guess I was looking for the 'love conquers all' thing (or at least love will conquer what we want it to, not necessarily ALL). I think Spencer needed to do more research into interracial relationships before trying to write a novel about two people who were obviously terribly lonely (Iris) and curious about the other (Iris and Daniel). This was hardly a love story. It was incomplete and quite frankly, hopeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting, but not perfect","review":"A Ship Made of Paper works as kind of a riveting, emotional page-turner. This is rear for a piece of literary fiction, which can usually be easily put down, as much as I like the \\"genre.\\" Some of the dealings with race are clumsy, and the plot turns push the boundries of plausibility, but Spencer also demonstrates real skill jumping in and out of his various characters' perspectives. Ultimately, it's just a terribly entertaining read.PSDon't read the Publisher's Weekly review. They give away too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screwed up","review":"Another reviewer mentioned that the characters and story drew her in, but that the ending of the story was just too difficult. I feel just the opposite. The tragic events near the end of the book finally gave an otherwise dull story some color. The screwed up characters were not particularly interesting and I had a very hard time getting engaged in their random and self-destructive behavior. Of the last 20 or 30 novels that I have read, this one I almost abandoned midstream. I acknowledge that there were moments of sensitivity and clever insight in this book, but these redeeming nuggets were floating in a sea of boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book - Borrow from the Library","review":"This is my first Scott Spencer book. I heard him on NPR discussing Man in the Woods. So, I borrowed A Ship Made of Paper (and Man in the Woods) from the library. And, I'm so glad that I didn't spend money on it. Dribble is the best word I can find to describe the content. I did finish the book, but was so tired of Daniel's whining and deceitfulness. I was bored by Iris and Kate's characters. It took over 2/3 of the book to reach the accident that was described on the flap of the cover. I kept waiting for whatever was going to happen - thinking that perhaps that would make the book more interesting. Based on reviews and articles about his writing, I had higher hopes for Mr. Spencer's novels. I will read Man in the Woods - and then decide if I will read other Scott Spencer books. In the meantime, borrow this one from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your time reading this","review":"I bought this book for $3 and I definitely paid too much. I don't know why I even finished reading the book. Although the back of the book makes it look intriguing, it is a silly book. I found myself frustrated with the fact that the author went into detail about a character which led no where. It does not flow together as a well written novel should. The racial issues discussed in the book are not enlightening, they are irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular writing","review":"Interesting that most of the reader reviews here are either five-star raves or one-star expressions of disgust. For Spencer's readers, as for his characters, there seems to be no middle ground. This is a risky, ambitious, provocative book about lovers who are finally not up to the challenges heaped upon them by their headlong affair. Not every detail of plotting rings true, but the subtleties of relationship dynamics are wincingly accurate, and Spencer's prose is supple, playful and often drop-dead gorgeous. There are sentences here that made me gasp. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ship Wreck","review":"Based on reviews I read, I looked forward to reading A Ship Made Of Paper. I tried very hard to give the author every chance to make up for something stupid in the plot. He failed. While this book could have made some very positive statements about interracial love, it continuously plodded through very negative racial stereotypes. Many of the characters, not just the main characters, validated so much of the negative perceptions we have about each other. Although fiction, I wonder just how much of this was based on personal experience. The ending was miserable. I closed the book and said to myself, \\"what a waste of time!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooking The Sephardic Way","review":"Love this recipe book. My mother-in-law passed away and I was lucky enough to get it. She used the recipes for years and we loved everyone of the great foods she made from it.

Once in my new shop, I installed a new light bulb following the easy assembly of the components, turned on the motor and the light bulb blew out instantly, probably due to the heavy vibration from the imbalanced wheels, and within about 1 minute the variable speed control would not function. I managed to balance the wheels with the dressing tool that is supplied, and the grinder runs on full speed now all the time. I will probably buy a new speed controller from a local electronics store to fix it myself. I am reluctant to buy any more Delta products due to the poor quality of this tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Machine NO Problems!","review":"Bought the machine at Lowes a couple years ago(2003). I've had no problems whatsoever with it! I use it to both grind and buff various materials. Plenty of torque and the variable RPM lets me fine tune the SFPM for buffing everything from plastic to stainless. Not a production type machine but good cost/benefit. A really fine diamond dressing tool was included which keeps the grinding wheels running smoothly.

The story is just plain weird and disturbing. But it's worth reading, nonetheless, which is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1. The bad writing is great fun to laugh at.

The reading selections are edited to allow students to understand the overall idea of the main myths without going into a lot of detail. However, there are a few annoying typos throughout the book and some serious mistakes like the wrong names of heroes or gods in some sections which really makes students confused.

Needed the book for college, worth every penny to buy. If your interested in mythology I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowdlerized summaries","review":"While Donna Rosenberg does provide a nice, complete collection of well-known world myths, this book is not, as it promises, an \\"anthology of fine literature\\": rather, it gives a quick summary and overview of each myth, written in boring, stilted prose and often watered-down and censored. Sexuality, violence, and foul conduct are an important part of mythology, and to see those elements removed defeats the point: yes, the harpies took a dump in the water. Yes, Cronos castrated Uranus.Yet Donna Rosenberg glosses over these details without once bothering to discuss their meaning.In fact, Rosenberg's notes in this book are set on one thing and one thing only: her absolute determination to tell the reader about the wonders of the matriarchal pre-history she so firmly wants to believe in (even when it is utterly irrelevant to the story being discussed!)Buy this book if you have to for a class, but if you want to truly study mythology on your own count this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"An \\"interesting\\" reEd.","review":"This collection of myths deserves less than one star! While there are a variety of myths, the versions are so awful that their true meaning is often missed. There are spelling, punctuation, and other mistakes throughout World Mythology. Even searching for the myths on the internet provides better versions that are not censored or over-edited. Take Beowulf for example, Ms. Rosenberg explains in its introduction that Anglo-Saxons used kennings in their works, which is true. However, they did not use kennings for every descriptive phrase. On the other hand, Ms. Rosenberg hyphenates so many words an all of the hyphens put together would equal the length of the large intestines stretched around a Swedish meatball!

Listen with an open mind and you'll hear a GREAT collection of rockers and ballads, with can't-get-it-out-of-your-head melodies and that rarest of things: lyrics that actually mean something (and are very clever to boot).If I could, I'd deduct half a star for production quality, but Lewis (no relation) is an amazing songwriter and singer who deserves to be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be the all time greatest stage debacle!","review":"This musical is infamous in Seattle as being perhaps the biggest flop ever to briefly see the stage. Produced, written, and performed by the meglomaniacal C. Rainey Lewis, this production was doomed from the start.

The game is about building the town and deploying your followers to get you points. Since you build the board as you play, there is very little set-up time needed. Also the game is easy enough for anyone to pick-up, but there is a complexity to it which keeps you playing over and over. Lastly, it isn't a marathon game like monopoly or risk, which is nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verrrry interesting","review":"We love to play board games and this is one of the best to come along in quite a while.

Good for all ages (we ranged from 7-60) who like a strategy-type game that you can play under an hour.

Instead of just picking one card each turn, you can always have a card in your hand so you choose which to play. More strategy this way - you can think ahead.

This is one of the few games in my collection that I can play when my non-gamer friends come over. It just takes a minute to explain and after the first game, I find that most people can pick it up. It has a high replay value as well because each game will turn out differently. No two game boards turn out the same. This is thanks to the very interesting tile laying game mechanic.If you're only familiar with American-style board games like Monopoly or Risk, do yourself a favor and pick this up.

You certainly have to spend some time on learning the rules but it is worth doing. There is just enough thinking to be entertaining. I suspect that some people really put heavy thought into strategy.

However, although this product photo and description both clearly indicate this includes the river expansion pack, Amazon only shipped the basic game without the expansion pack.

I was searching for a 2-player game and decided on Carcasonne - what a great choice! Very interesting, fun game that is never the same twice! Only reason I gave it 4 stars is that my boyfriend likes to play WAY too much and it can get repetitive after awhile. Once you play a few times and get the idea (and strategy) of the game it is addicting! I highly recommend for people looking for a different type of game - not like a regular board game - and who are up for something new. This is a great 2 player game but it can also be played with up to 3 more people. I haven't tried the expansions yet but with how popular this game now is in our household I'm sure we'll be buying some soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"This was one of my grandson's presents for the 7th birthday.

It's challenging for competitive players, easy for players at all skill levels to enjoy (the randomness factor does not always ensure the \\"best\\" player will win, which is nice) and its good for younger players (good problem solving + spatial understanding). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good strategy game for parents to play with kids","review":"I purchased this game as a Christmas present for my 11 year old son. My 8 year old daughter loves to play it with us also. My kids love to play games so this helps spice it up a bit. Good strategy game that doesn't take forever. Game play is about 45 minutes. Make a perfect family game night adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game - easy to learn","review":"Carcassonne is one of the best games I have ever played. It meets the two biggest criteria for a strategy game for me:1) It's easy to learn.2) It's hard to master.It has to be the uniquest approach I had ever come upon for a game, and I have now played it many times. It is one of those games, that it plays incredibly differently depending on the number of people who play and who you play with. All people have a different approach, and it drastically changes play.Simply said, this game sells itself. Every person I have introduced to the game has gone on to purchase it themselves. The basic game is good, but all the expansions add a new element to the game that shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carcassonne","review":"We bought to play this as an alternative to video games.

Maybe after you play it several times and get into the strategy it gets more fun, but it is rather dull really. Prefer Settlers of Catan for example a lot more (maybe it is because there isn't much interaction with the other players) that I found it dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game If You Have People to Play With","review":"This is a great game that is an absolute must if you are looking for something different from the regular likes of Clue or Monopoly.

My college roommates love playing it during our study breaks and my little brother also really loves playing it whenever I am home.It is easy to learn and it never gets old because the game is different every time. It is a great game for just two, but I prefer playing with more people.If you enjoy this game I would recommend purchasing some of the expansions. I would also recommend Settler of Catan, which is another great strategy game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game!","review":"I bought this game for my bfnd on his bday cuz he had it in his wish list for the longest time!we already played and it was lots of fun. . .it was so easy to understand that, although we said that our first game was a trial so we can get used to it, we got it right away and our trial became the real thing.I recommend it for all ages (my mom is her late 50's and she enjoyed herself)and actually the expansions are in my Christmas gift list :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"game of the year","review":"i have introdruced this game to several families , a german game jury has voted it game of the year , it should be in every playing household !!if you are a playing person , you can start to train kids with the bacis already with 6 years . one friend of mine is 9 in the meanwhile , he beats me now almost every time :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game","review":"This game has an optimum balance of complexity, duration and engagement for me, my wife and our 7 y/o daughter.

Now my wife and I play this almost every night we are both home and not busy. A few weeks ago, our 5 year old daughter asked about the game and we showed her how to lay the tiles so that features connect together. We had a few days of having fun just building cities and farms. Then she asked about the little guys (the meeples). We explained how you place them on cities, roads, etc to get points. We played a few rounds with the meeples and she started getting the strategy. Now its all she wants to play. Looking back, we didn't plan to teach her the game this way, but it really is great that you can build up to the full rules and along the way its still fun play. We just added the River 2 expansion and plan to add more soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good overview","review":"Environmental Crime: Enforcement, Policy, and Social Responsiblity is a pretty good overview of environmental issues. It would be good to read if you want to get the big picture on environmental issues. It covers philosophy, natural science, law, etc. I read it as a text for a college course. This was a small class and we had much discusion on the material. The book was well suited for such a class.Each chapter is by a different author and because of this it repeats itself a little. Much of the environmental crime data and examples given are from the early 1990's. Environmental crime has changed a lot from the early 1990's so the book was a little out of date even when printed in 1998. As a history and a basis for understanding it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Baptist Hymns.....","review":"with the old school black baptist flava to it. if u know anything about \\"missionary baptist\\" or the like, u may like this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best flamenco CD I've ever come across","review":"I especially like the songs from Los Serafines de Valme.

Thomas Flanagan's story of Irish independence, centering on the figure of Michael Collins (the Big Fella)is a story of historical significance and personal tragedy. While this is not a full rounded history of the time, since it focuses on Collins and ignores for the most part the other Irish leaders, it is still a grand adventure and captures perfectly the tone of time and place. Flanagan is a writer of significant skill and his handling of character and story - not to mention his skill with language - make this book a memorable and moving reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunbeam Rocket Grill","review":"I was given the Rocket Grill as a birthday gift.

I love the smell of it but even when using a tiny amount in a full bath I feel like I just bathed in an oil slick. It also clogged my pores and I ended up with pimples on my back and thighs. So it's just not for me, a person who has normal skin. However, to be fair, my mother used to use it and she loved it but she had extremely dry skin. My recommendation is if you have very, very dry skin this can be a plus. Otherwise keep in mind the oily factor. If you're not sure of how your skin will react, try using baby oil in your bath first.

Anyhow, in the picture it looks cute and cuddly, but in real life it is not at all. The white material on the outside is a rough cotton that feels like burlap, there was no attempt to make it look good, but maybe for a 100$ piece of real wool the rustic look of it was the point.

Having actually been on the Kimes case before Kimes became chic, I must say that the satirical portrayal of this deadly mother son team, does nothing but trivialize their crimes. I would rather see thought provoking exploration into how the mind of a female predator works. What makes Sante Kimes tick? What could have possibly happened to her to create such a monster. She is not a comic character, or some sort of twisted folk hero. She is truly evil. The style of Indiana's writing is not what bothered me, rather it was the flippant treatment of quiet, seething and pathological evil which is glorified and its victims satirized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Boring!","review":"The story went back and forth between interesting and boring. There was too much filler of boring conversation and discriptions. If Ms. Busbee would have left out the filler stuff, she would have had a good short story. Sometimes, the story you have to tell doesn't have to take 406 pages. Also, the passion was good but lacked in discription. Funny, when everything else was described in boring detail. I have read 3 of Busbee's books and only one was really good.

Don't waste your money on this book, and don't allow Brett Pulley's expose' to determine your opinion of one of the most respected African Americans in the world.

Brett Pulley does an excellent job of taking a potentially boring, dry subject matter, adds his special author's flair, and creates an entertaining, informative business biography!

It is packed full of data.Without question, it is someone's textbook.Myself, I found it unreadable. The text rambles. Examples run on. The layout itself is challenging - small font, little white space; the authors invented their own set of cute icons for various summaries and text and data boxes for which I'd rather just see a small title than to learn someone's codes - granted there's only 10 or so - just a straw on the camel.I do read a lot - from Harvard Business Review and professional journals to current business books - I don't mean to blindly take a shot.Perhaps this style just didn't work for me.I hope other readers will add reviews - at the this moment, it appears just two opposite ends of the spectrum."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dull","review":"I sat down to watch this, and within just the first couple minutes I knew I'd be bored. I guess I was expecting more of a wide shot of earth, but the camera is zoomed in close on almost every shot and makes it difficult to even tell what you are looking at at times. And because it's so close, they do this annoying pan with every shot so you can see the whole thing, and that got me a little dizzy. And it just wasn't smooth, because it cuts to a new video about every 7 seconds. It's not something you can just sit and watch, but I guess if you have it on at a party or something, it's ok, as long as it's for your grandparents or something. I have to say the music is pretty good and goes with what you are watching, but as with all dvds of this type, you can play your own soundtrack.

It's rare to find such a book. Many of the recipes are things I grew up eating. It's amazing to find them listed in a book.My only complaint is that I found a mistake, inadvertently, which leads me to wonder what other inaccuracies exist in the book. My father's small hometown (district) was mentioned in the book, but described completely incorrectly in terms of its location. This is nitpicking, I know, but I would think that a native of Bengal would know the geography of his or her state. Furthermore, if the regional differences are in fact relevant in terms of cuisine, then in fact, this error is significant.Overall, a creative book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a good book, but....","review":"As a serious collector of Indian cookery publications and keen cook, I was most disappointed with this particular effort. Bengali Cooking seems to be written for a United States audience and is a 'tour de force' satisfying possibly only the author and her family. The trendy pseudo phonetic Bengali spellings add absolutely nothing and only confuse, referring the reader to a poorly laid out and incomplete index, there is nothing wrong with the universal 'garam masala'or other common India ingridients, why alter the names? The recipes, with minimal quantity alterations to overcome copyright no doubt, are nothing new and occur in many publications, festivals and seasons seem to have little bearing on the publication as a cookery guide, a lot of the original ingridients are unobtainable. I was very disappointed in this as a cookery book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read!","review":"This is fun to read, even if you never cook a recipe!

I am using the word 'fantasy' quite liberally, to include several kinds of works that we tend to categorise as \\"speculative fiction\\". My favourite work was \\"The Moon Maid\\", and others must be having their own favourites. Now, what about getting the guy to produce some more stuff like this? Because, in this era of rising prices and pinching pay, these stories are surefire anti-depressants.

I went to Detroit Labor Day of 2004 and thought it looked liked it had been hit by a neutron bomb. I have yet to find a book that gives a truly thoughtful analysis of what happened to Detroit.This book is unimaginably poorly written and disorganized. Is the author dyslexic?. Chock full of \\"more on this later\\" and \\"which I discussed earlier\\". But this book has some amazing facts on the Republic of New African and Aretha Franklin's pastor dad's collusion with black militants. So it is the better of the two books for insights.Despite the bad writing I would have given it 3 stars for the amazing facts except it peters out badly near the end as the author, a former chief of the Detroit P.D., dwells on his definitions of good policing."},{"rating":"1","title":"limited","review":"This book is a poor substitute for Thomas Sugrue's \\"Origins of the Urban Crisis.\\" More sensational and less objective, Holloway's weak prose add very little to the important discourse on the fall of Detroit.

This book has some real valid and promising advice, but the author injects himself into the book far too much. This book seems less like advice and more like a publicity campaign for the author. Co-authored by Diane Holloway Ph.D., who did alot of the research and I believe is responsible for the excerpts I did enjoy. If you're a die-hard Detroit fan, then I say go ahead and get this book but be warned the author has a pretty crummy current view of the city that's unfair and biased especially since he doesn't live here anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book is like reading the comment section of The Detroit News -- pasted together end to end ad infinitum, ad nauseum.

It would be just as easy to read the w3c spec."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every cent","review":"The scope and goal of the XSLT Programmer's Reference by Michael Kay is precisely defined and adhered to. It is indeed an excellent reference (as opposed to a tutorial) on the subject of XSLT version 1.0.I have given 5 stars to only three other books in the past, and this was for what I regard to be truely remarkable contributions: Design Patterns (Gamma), OOCS2 (Meyer) and Concurrent Programming in Java (Lea). Whilst not as generally applicable as these works, Mr Kay's XSLT-PR deserves its five stars for sheer timeliness, accuracy and quality of writing - not to mention value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great, great book!","review":"Wrox books have always impressed me in their format and choice of authors but this book is so exceptionally good that it is almost in a league of its own.It is the most readable reference work I have ever encountered - excellently written. Michael Kay's immense knowledge of his subject comes through on every page (It came as no surprise when I read that he had written the Saxon product).I've pretty much read every page - and have started working through it with a colleague at work who wanted to learn xml. I am a beginner to xml/xslt and mostly program for pleasure - and although it is sad to admit to, I found it addictive reading.It is truly worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best XSLT reference","review":"Mike Kay, who is currently the editor of XSLT 2.0 and the author of one of the best XSLT processors, is a good writer who has a talent for presenting information in context. This is probably the best reference book, and the best explanation of the design behind XSLT. For a computer scientist familiar with the concepts of XML, it is also a very good general introduction to XSLT.If you intend to use XSLT seriously, this is the book.Jonathan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent XSLT tutorial and reference","review":"This is a great book on XSLT from the author of the popular Saxon XSLT engine. This was the first book I read on XSLT, it gave me a very thorough understanding of the subject and even though I have bought other books to cover some of the whole (in particular the XSLT cookbook), I keep turning back to this book as a reference. The coverage of XPath, which is critical for writing good XSLT, is concise and excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners","review":"I am an experienced programmer and have several Wrox books that I would happily recommend to any commercial programmer but this one seems to have been written by someone who is well-informed and well-intentioned but somehow distanced from \\"real\\" work. I want to see classic examples that I can relate to, e.g. sales order processing, but what we get here is poetry, family trees and knight's moves around a chessboard. In other words, an academic approach. Now I've spent all weekend trying to get to the beef but I'm still chewing the Taco. Anyone care to write a 90 page monograph on how to do XSLT? If so, I'm in the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organised","review":"Although this book appears to cover most of the subject area, its disorganised structure make it a difficult companion, both for learning the subject and as a reference.The writer's style is difficult to follow and does not lend well to diving in to learn about a particular area in detail.The author recommends his own product, SAXON, which seems to do things in an unusual and non-intuitive fashion.This book was one of the first to market on the topic. Unfortunately it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere for XSLT Book","review":"This is the worst technical book I've ever used. There is no organization to it, and there is redundant information, especially in the elements listing section. There are areas that are extremely verbose and make little sense while other areas could use simple, less wordy explanation follwed by an example. This book makes a good paper weight, that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very tough and unordered reading","review":"It is a pity but I have to write I am not satisfied with the book. It is kind of a book which does not concetrate on the main purpose of a reading - \\"to learn something\\". Of course I understand - it is programmer's reference but even so there is a lot of introductory parts which could be done much better.There are parts that are very very talkative and give nowadays \\"vain\\" information and on the other hand there are parts which should be absolutely more narrative. The book reminds me a kind of \\"scientific\\" or \\"academic\\" book. From this point of view it is quite good. It is for people who have time to read it in their labs. It is the book for a long time. You absolutely learn a lot of useful topics but you have to find your own way of reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK as a reference","review":"If you're already clued up on XSLT, this would be a good reference. If you know XML, but want to *learn* about XSLT - it's quite appalling.Its dense, assumes lots of prior knowledge, and is written from the perspective of someone who already knows what he's talking about, so there's no need to explain it any further.The examples don't bear much relation to real world problems, and are concerned very quickly with low level details of the XSLT language. A common question I found myself asking was \\"I can see that X does Y to Z ... but why do you want to do this?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive XSL Book!","review":"If you are looking for a reference book for XSL, this is it. The information is very, very current. The author is extremely knowledgeable - no wonder, because he wrote his own XSLT processor. Besides covering the XSLT standards, he compares various XSLT processors, which is invaluable. Kudos to WROX for publishing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Online Support","review":"This is a great book, as the other reviewers have noted. One thing that is particularly impressive is the fact that this book has great online support (as of June, 2001 anyway).Just go to the website ... (mentioned in the book) and follow the links to join the newsgroup. You can follow the current discussion on XSLT issues and post your own questions, related to the book or not (quote page numbers and everything, if you like). Michael Kay himself answers many of the posts.I've never seen an author so interested in following up with his readers and the issues they have with his book and the topic in general. I'm impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative but not for beginners","review":"This book is a thorough reference of XSLT. However, don't read it as a tutorial. Before reading this book, I had already read one on XML, and a couple of XSLT web tutorials, plus a few magazine articles on XSLT. That was about enough to understand what this book has to tell you about the details of XSLT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost unusable","review":"This book, as the other reviewers have said, is an awful beginning or reference text for XSLT.I have to whip up an XSL transform only a few times a year, so I never remember exactly how the syntax works. This book is never any help. The introductory sections are not informative, and the reference sections are not well-organized and have no helpful examples.He likes to spend a lot of time explaining in various places that \\"technically, this blah blah blah is a valid construct, but no one will ever use it.\\" Who cares? The book is supposed to help others get their jobs done.Still, I have been able to finish my assignments using this book, so I can't give it 1 star. 2 stars is generous, though, for how angry this book consistently makes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pack-in games barely save this product from being useless","review":"When you first look at this product, it's hard not to get excited aboutSpending hours with Mrs. Pacman. While you can still have a date with her, you will not be using this stick. The absolutely atrocious flimsiness of the actual stick will drive you mad as you unintentionally run into ghosts. The only thing that is cool about this thing is the click-wheel, which almost no game uses.Now, for dischodians out there, the stick has a solid redeeming factor. It's a game in itself. Actually using this thing to play a game is one of the biggest challenges you will ever face. If you are just too good, and have become bored and disillusioned with your gaming experiences, ratchet up the difficulty a bit by using this so-called controller. Seriously, stay away unless you enjoy horrible things, and if that is the case, I value at 9 dollars. I use it as a backup controller when guests visit. If I value their company, I let them use a real controller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - You won't get what you are expecting","review":"This is a good idea with poor execution.2 stars for the joystick, and 5 for the games that come with it.The good thing is that it comes with 3 games (astropop, frogger, and time pilot). Its good that is has a spinner control like the atari paddle and that's where it stops.The bad:1. It should have come with a game that uses the spinner control which would either be Tron or Tempest.2. The spinner does not currently with with Tron.3. The joystick has too much range of motion meaning the stick leans too far left, right, up and down.4. Gameplay can be awkward using the controller while trying to use the button on top of the stick and playing an intense game.Currently, you should not play more that $30 for this item (about how much the 3 games are worth) because it really isn't utilized by any game I am aware of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"This is extremely poorly designed -- there is not nearly enough weight in the bottom of the controller, so I often found myself knocking the thing over instead of, say, encouraging Ms. Pac-Man to chase down blue-and-white flashing ghosts.It would be completely useless if it didn't include downloads of several Xbox Live Arcade games, but save yourself the trouble and just download Astropop from the XBLA Marketplace and forgo this controller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cable","review":"I'm using this in a live streaming video set to connect a Component HD camera to the computer.

I own a library of Gregorian Chant CDs, and I consider this CD one of the best in quality, content, and price. It is an extremely enjoyable listen. There are several sections where the monks harmonize, something you don't hear too often. Very, very spiritually uplifting. A must for all Gregorian Chant lovers!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so authentic","review":"I found this CD to be a bit stilted in its representation of Gregorian chant. The voices are beautiful, but there are only two or three of them to my ear. The CD notes do not even reference the name of the group or its conductor, but only mentions two singers by name. Even though the CD notes refer to Gregorian chant as \\"flowing\\" and having its own rhythm, each note of every chant was the same length and had the same volume. This CD would be fine for background music. However, it is not authentic Gregorian chant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple shapes used to create very complex designs","review":"The patterns in this book contain so much detail that I found them difficult to look at for extended periods of time. The patterns are in black and white and they pull your eyes in several directions. My eyes bounded from section to section, as sometimes I was able to separate them and other times they seemed to blur together. Simple geometric figures such as circles, spirals, dots and triangles are repeated and altered to create diagrams that appear infinite in scope. If you are someone looking for a dynamic background for your artwork or a tile to use to create a larger backdrop, then this is a book you should take a look at."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Expanse (plus \\"The Xindi\\")","review":"This book is a combination of the end-of-season episode \\"The Expanse\\" and the start-of-season episode \\"The Xindi\\". As is usually the case with novelizations, much has been added beyond the dialogues of television. It is well-written, and I very much had the 'feeling' of the cast members speaking as I read the rendering of the dialogues."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no Puppy Peek-a-Boo, but still a great board book","review":"My daughter LOOOOOOVES Puppy Peek-a-Boo with illustrations by Lisa McCue. I was searching for other peek-a-board books and found this one, which was highly recommended by other parents. It's good, and she does like it - we got it when she was just under 1 year old, and her appreciation of it has grown as she has gotten just a bit older (she's nearly 15 months now). I think it would be ideal for children 2 or older.My only reason for not giving it 4 stars is that I don't think it's on par with Puppy Peek-a-Boo (which sounds so ridiculous as I write this, but it's true). That book has such incredible illustrations and so many little hidden surprises and details that allow readers to find new things each time. This is much different.I have not found anything in the board book realm to equal Puppy Peek-a-Boo, but as board books go, this one is very good (as is Peek-a-Who? by the same author)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves this one!","review":"Got this for my baby since she loves the Peek-a-Who book.

It's a sort of Bonny and Clyde for the new millenium, with plenty of Hendricks' great ertoica sequences. Maybe it's because of the vivid restaurant scenes, but the book also reminded me of Choke by Chuck Palahniuk....Highly recommend this fast, highly entertaining read, as well as Hendricks' noir classic, Miami Purity.Jason Starr, author of Twisted City, etc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than amaturish video","review":"This is a very poorly done video of a lovely area of Croatia.

This book explains entry rituals into the rosicrucion fellowship. It explains the preparation ceremony the pass words and basic symbolism of the passwoards, and thats all. No new mysteries are presented, or explained, no glyphs or or secret grips revealed. This makes a good edition to your library but not a particularly useful volume as the philosophers stone was not even mentioned in the sections i read. Maybe one day if i get my copy back from a certain small furry flying creature, i might find something interesting enough to study here.

Horrible shipping","review":"Love the bench, it's exactly what I was looking for. The shipping has a lot to be desired. The carton looked like it'd been through a war and back. Both ends were torn and it had been so poorly traveled that the straps binding the thing closed (barely) were cut into the box in all directions.Because of this experience I'm very unlikely to buy any major ticket items from Amazon ever again. This was terrible and customer service was no help at all. I guess I'm just lucky all the pieces managed to find their way to my door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not industrial strength","review":"Overall, the system is useable but there are multiple areas of potential improvement. The most important area for improvement is the height of the weight bench. It is too high so there is no way to perform a traditional bench press. Second, the pegs that hold the weight bar in place are positioned where one would normally place their hands. There is no way around this other than narrowing your grip. The fly bars are awkward and tend to bang against the bench support. The lateral pull bar provides resistance through some palstic housing which I am pretty sure will wear out in a short period of time. The weight bench has basically been relegated to my off day strength work outs since it does not provide the stability and support for a vigorous weight session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product - Packed poorly","review":"The machine itself is of decent quality, a bargain for the price. The company however has basicly no internal packing material in the box and the box itself is thin cardboard which is not appropriate for such a heavy item.

It shows a superstar Liszt pupil's way with an orchestral transcription. It's a dramatic view of the 19th Century virtuosos' way with this kind of music.

The Mattress Genie does inflate nicely but is very loud. One of the biggest problems is that it is very slow in letting the air out of the pillow so that the bed returns to normal after being elevated. Also the process of the mattress raising caused the mattress to scoot down and was putting pressure on the footboard. We thought this might be an inexpensive solution to her problems without having to purchase an electric bed or a hospital bed. The thing we least liked about the Mattress Genie was the slowness in deflating and the noise that occurs when the pillow is inflating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The Mattress Genie I received lost air from the first day.

Overall, thumbs up!!I've had this installed on my bed for only three days now. At first I didn't think I'd be all that impressed with it, it doesn't look like much out of the box. After the quick and easy installation, I gave it a test try and I really like it. No more putting all my pillows and my arms behind my head to watch tv in bed. Honestly, it's like having a new bed. It kinda makes me giggle when my head is lifting up!Yes, when the product is inflating with air, the air pump is noisy, like one of those big cheap vacuum cleaners, but it only takes a couple of minutes to inflate, so I can deal with it just fine.

It's just that apparently it is not constructed well enough to maintain the air overnight. Now, I weigh 125 lbs so I'm not a real big person so I can imagine if someone were heavier the unit would function even less reliably. I noticed another responder had the same problem and used super glue to fix theirs. I am not going to risk this temporary fix and lose my money if it deflates again. The cost is too high for something that does not work well.If you don't mind inflating every morning and don't need the full incline during the night this might be a good idea for you.Warning for all of you with the inflated air type mattresses(Select Comfort for example) this is not an easy item to work around all the tubes to your mattress but it can be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tips and is uneven","review":"So, for a start I want to say that the product does inflate OK, and, that is all that it does OK. The only way you can use this is if you have the exact weight persons on both sides of the bed, giving EXACTLY the same weight on the item, otherwise, the one person has to be exactly in the middle of the bed and that is not really possible for disabled persons that you need to have a food tray to feed them. The person needs to be on one side or the other for the tray to be able to work when feeding. If you use it with the person on say the right side of the bed, with a tray, the other side moves up MUCH FURTHER than the side that the person is eating on the tray, pretty much just pushing that person out of bed onto the floor. Stupid. Needs to pump up equally on both sides for this to be even a \\"good\\" product, and in my opinion, this is a very \\"poor\\", not well thought out product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I had about 2 weeks of great sleep before it started losing air.

It works very well for foam mattresses, but rigid innerspring mattress users might be disappointed. If you have GERD, and have been instructed to elevate the head of your bed six inches, the Genie Mattress Lifter is perfect.

I found the angle at full inflation to be too much.Any less than full inflation, it becomes unstable and thereby aggrevating and unusable. Move to one side the other will push up. stay in the middle both ends will be around your ears, ect.If they can fix that major design flaw, they would have a great product. Also a hose juntion that CAN'T leak.

If you are one person and stay in the middle of the bed, then it will be stable, but if you try it on the side or with two people, it will wobble and be aggravating. You will positively slide down any regular bed mattress, if it is elevated at one end. You have to elevate the head and legs, to keep from sliding. That is true for even a hospital bed or one of those $5,000.00 motorized beds. Given the money, it is very appealing!

It SHOULD have been called \\"Jewess meets Jesus.\\" Basically, this young woman converts to Orthodox Judaism (her father's religion), and shortly after taking this huge step, she begins to explore the Christian religion, and eventually she REconverts to that. Basically, she doesn't know WHAT she believes in or WHAT she wants. I can't finish this book . . . but if I were to continue, I would not be at ALL surprised if she became a Muslim toward the end.

The anecdotes about her life and the trajectory of her life feel scattered. She doesn't give me great faith that she could even pull off a straight memoir.

That path involved joining, then leaving, orthodox Judaism for Christianity. There's less a juxtaposition than an experiential sampling of one over the other. It leads to some significant insights and refreshingly brutal honesty. But it also points out the weakness of Winner's conclusion. While I enjoyed journeying with her, why she favored Christianity over Judaism (or any other religion for that matter), seems inconsequential. One gets the sense she could migrate back to Judaism, or on to Buddhism or Wicca or something, just as easily. Perhaps I'm wrong. \\"Girl Meets God\\" has a hip, whimsical, stream of consciousness feel. The prose are stellar with many memorable lines along the way.

I found the sadness of it beautiful, and the dishonesty that played into the friendship between the two men gave the story certain aspects of a thriller for me.

These additions by Levin are unholy abominations that reference various periods from Baroque to modern day with little regard for musicality. Never mind the mediocrity of the fugue writing, that's not unexpected after hearing Levin previous efforts, but to end a work that begins so sublimely with such wretched cacophony .... there are no words to describe it.The performance is itself tolerable if dull and poorly paced at times with inappropriately operatic vocals.

Not angry at the story or the people involved, mind you, but angry at the terrible grammer structure, the inundating repitition, and the awful typesetting. An otherwise great story that deserved better editing, I felt that it was a challenge to read and was very disaapointed by the final result.

This book was obviously self-published and the author chose to ignore the obvious need to proof-read and edit his copy. The fact that he called a T-41 a jet in the first three pages was also a tip-off that he either didn't proof the copy for mistakes or wanted the reader to think more highly of his flying prowess. I think he was referring in this instance to the U.S. Air Force's basic jet trainer, the T-37 which in no way resembles an F-16 fighter. The T-41 is a 145 horsepower version of the Cessna 172 single engine piston powered aircraft. I also do not think the Air Force used outside contractor training in the T-37 jet trainers. My final disappointment was the author's obvious bias in favor of these drug smugglers. In my opinion, big or small fish, drug smugglers are all lowlifes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever ???","review":"You gotta be kidding !! The Best Of Bell Biv Devoe, is a joke, right ??

It provides compelling insights into how bubbles are created by 3 types of distortions - 1) psychological, 2) competition, 3)excess. Its a much better way to understand bubbles and is a perfect way to view today's real estate bubble. Moreover, it helps explain how to manage them better.

The truth is that this is a more HARDER album than 21st. The music is still driven by an acidic melody but the beats are harsher and harder and the synthesising has taken a back seat.What is on the album though is definently still good. It has amazing vocals on all tracks and has hard-hitting melodies coupled with hard beats.All in all Praga has not lost it.

At least the lead vocal can sing which I can say is nice compared to the others who sound like wounded dogs. If you want real good rock you need to go back before the 90's, even the late 70's when there were a lot more complex arrangements, compositions and even better lyrics that actually said something instead all this silly adolescent angst.What happened to musicianship and creativity?

This CD is completely boring and unoriginal. It sounds like the band abandoned their \\"mainstream rock\\" style for an \\"adult contempory\\" style. They try to sound \\"softer\\" and more \\"middle of the road\\", hoping it will put them on top of the charts again. Just one problem...the songs are BORING!They all have a dull, droning sound. The lyrics are in the same monotone voice throughout the entire CD. They use the same distortion on every song. Its very boring to hear.I can't recommend this CD to anybody.

They can very easily learn how to make it move. It has a high weight limit so moms can use it too. I race my kids around our house (we have 2 and more traditional scooter). The cons to this is the wheel comes off a lot easier than I would expect. The bolt that holds it one comes loose quite easily. And the other con is it need a smooth surface.

To me, the strange mechanism of theplasmacar was attractive, but for my three-and-a-half year old son, the mini scooter was more attractive, and for my one-and-a-half year old son, it is still much too large. As a play car, it is quite large, and fairly heavy, and it needs much open space in the apartment to move it around in. Also the space needs to be hardwood floor, not carpet. I think is a good thing if you have a large playroom with an assortment of toys for moving around; it is certainly different, but in a normal household with rather limited space, the mini scooter is more fun for the child.

Actually, he's an inverted Kantian, nothing more. This is the sort of text his alterity-stricken fan club gets excited about. Its conversational style gives the impression that deep insights are waved at because they just never show up. The reader is made to feel that he missed something. And then the game is lost. Intangibility becomes intrinscially virtuous, and so the reader forgives the great Derrida's omissions, who is relieved of the responsibility of answering his own questions. Don't be fooled. He can't answer those questions because the special discourse he reserves for himself prohibits him from doing so in principle. That's the oldest con in the book.

By far her best known song is Grandma's Song, a sweet tribute that begins with the sentimental low-production recording of her grandmother and mother singing \\"The Fox Hunting Song.\\"Someone is Looking for Someone, a sort of self-consolation, is beautiful and Poison Love, despite it's country-choral vocals, is thought-provolking and sweet without succoming to sacharine.How Davies has managed to go so unnoticed for so long is a bafflement, but if you are discerning enough to have found this album to read about, I would suggest you seriously consider a purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For heterosexuals in the very early stages of infertility","review":"This book would be appropriate for heterosexual couples who are still trying to conceive and have not yet seen a doctor about it.

I was disappointed in the read, though. It does not captivate as the first book did. I am not finding fault with the writing; Potok was incredibly gifted with words. It's the story which was a let-down.Asher Lev's artistic and spiritual confusion, aimlessness, and lethargy brought us a dark and mysterious story overall. I felt empathy for the pressure put on Asher by family, the Rebbe, and the community. Mostly, though, from the moment in the story that I guessed what Asher's \\"gift\\" might be, I really, REALLY hoped I was wrong. But I wasn't wrong, and the revelation left me feeling cold and empty.I truly wish I had not read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sequel of excellent book","review":"The excellent \\"My name is Asher Lev\\", to which \\"The Gift of Asher Lev\\" is the sequel, is certainly hard, almost impossible, to match. I think every author can be proud to write such a book once in his lifetime and, in fact, I found that \\"The Gift of Asher Lev\\" is not as great as the first part. Nonetheless, considering the trash you can normally expect from sequels, this is still pretty good. I don't know how I would have liked it if I hadn't read the first part, though, perhaps I would have wondered what it is all about.

When his beloved uncle dies, he ends his exile and returns to Brookly, to the chasidic community he thought h had left behind,to small storefront shuls and men in dark hats and coats,to that place deep inside himself which he could never leave. The travles from Willaimsburgh to Monticello, Ny{the catskills}, and the intorduction of Lev's young son are a lovely narrative touch. The Rebbe,based it would seem on the late Lubavitch rebbe of Blessed memory,is brilliantly,sympathetically drawn. he comes off as a holy,profound man of deep compassion and mystical understanding. Lev has grown, also, and the story of these tow, brilliant men is the key to the novel.

When it's wet it tends to look a litle more floppy (o.k. and also a bit stupid) than shown in the picture. Those crystals surely do keep you cool but they also destroy the hat over time. This is a one year (or less)hat if you use it often. Little pin holes will appear around the gel area. They will get bigger and the crystals will ooze out. The eyelets will start to rust and discolor the material of the hat. Worse yet, the hat will get moldy and black around the gel area. This happens because those crystals can stay damp for a day or so. Mold is inevitable. Mine was beige like in the picture. Today it goes in the garbage. I bought a Dr. Shade Outback hat at the same time I bought this mold maker and that hat looks like the day I bought it. I used it just as much as the other. It doesn't have the crystals and I don't get it wet but it's a great hot weather hat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"This hat works pretty well.

The ballistic rock shield that Brooks is so proud of really comes in handy when running over rocks, roots, etc. In fact, you can barely feel it at all! They have great ventilation and dry quickly as well, which is great for running after (or during) a fresh rain.Overall, they look great and they feel great. I can't give any feel for how they will last over the long term, but they are still great after a full 2 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cascadia vs Terra Firma","review":"The first thing I noticed was how well this shoe gripped the road.

This wouldn't be crucial except that this is the section of the chapter/book in which he is specifically explaining references.Further, while there is a link to submit errata, there is no link for a place to view/download them.

If you liked the latter, then there's a good chance that you'll like the former. I personally found the art in both unappealing and uninspired, but to each their own.

David Kilgour opened for Lambchop several months ago. I caught the last 3 songs, and wished I had witnessed his entire set. Anyway, I was impressed enough to buy this CD and it is wonderful chimey, psychedelic guitar pop, but not at all brittle. Except for a few rough edges and a couple of songs that end rather abruptly, this would be a five star effort.The listener will hear dreamy, gorgeous songs featuring layer upon layer of guitar, interspersed with even dreamier, short instrumentals. In the hands of less talented artists, instrumental breaks usually are just filler, but Kilgour isn't just filling space. These are fully realized little pop symphonies that add to the overall effect.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Fit","review":"This claims to fit most ovens but does not fit Magic Chef.

The truth is out there, indeed. There are plenty of sexual&violent; scenes to compensate for the lack of a coherent plot.

Some of the dark battle scenes in the original go completely black on DVD. This movie starts out like a documentary in Australia with the commentator talking about the Australian cattle ranchers. From time to time through out the movie it goes back to a documentary style. This bored me to the point that I fast forwarded it to the point they go off to war. The rest of the movie moves at a decent pace and the acting isn't to bad. Peter Finch is in it and turns in a fair performance. However; there are a couple scenes where the commanders are planning their battle tactics that are very stiff. Overall the movie just doesn't make it in my library of those WWII movies to own. If you are really into Australia's war movies you may find this more redeeming than I did.

My 15 month old daughter slid it right off of her high chair the first time she used it. It looked like it would be heavy from the pics and the show, and for the price I thought it would be but it is not. On the other hand, I do like the shape. It maked it much easier to scoop without spilling and the spoons work well also. So if you are looking to find a bowl that won't send food flying through the air then this is not the bowl for you. I found a bowl from Target for a quarter of the price of this one and it works way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over priced","review":"I wouldn't have a problem spending nearly $20 on a plate for my son to use provided it would stay in place, be difficult to launch across the room or clean easily. Alas this doesn't fit the bill.Nothing special with the plate, just another chunk of plastic dinnerware to be buried in the pantry along with the rest (at a quarter of the price). I'm pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I am very disappointed with the misleading marketing of this item stating that it is BPA free. The code on the bottom of the plate shows a #7, which is one of the plastics made out of polycarbonate that can leach BPA. So I am confused as to why this product is marketed as being BPA free?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE: plastic is unsafe","review":"These say they are dishwasher and microwave safe, but they are made from type 7 plastic, and a lot of research shows this type of plastic leaches a toxic chemical when heated.

After using them for a while, the plate and spoon both got stained from food, they were much harder to clean than other bowls, i realized the plate looks more like a dog bowl then a kid's plate, and i found myself not using them as much as my other normal plates.

It has not suction, which I thought that it would and whenever the baby drops it off his high chair (which is often) the white middle pops out of the base. I thought it would be a heavier material so that he couldn't flip it off his tray so easily. Not worth $[...] that is for sure. Should have just gotten a suction plastic bowl at K-mart for 4 or 5 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointmet","review":"After hearing all the good news about these plates, I decided to dish out the money for them. Instead of being thrilled, I have become more and more disappointed with them. My son picked them up and threw them on the floor. They now have cracks down the middle of them. They are way too easy to crack. However, the spoons are wonderful. I wish they sold the spoons separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than any other plate","review":"I bought this hoping it would help my son use the spoon against the side and keep from picking up his plate (as advertised). Well, it really made no difference compared to the cheap plates and spoons we had purchased, and in fact my son did not like the width of these spoons (too difficult/wide to get into his mouth) so we stopped using them. The plate is more difficult to push, doesn't slide as easily, but my son has no problem picking it up.I suggest saving your money and buying a less expensive plate since the food will end up all over the floor anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tips over easily","review":"I bought this because it wasn't made in China, was cute and fit everything I was looking for. I really like the fact that it's big enough for little hands to fit in it. I can put cooked veggies that tend to be slippery, in it and my 9 month old can actually pick up the food (as opposed to it sliding around not ever being picked up). However, this advertised as \\"no tip over\\" which is another reason I bought it. I was disappointed that on the first time trying it, my child tipped it over and the food went everywhere. Other than that, so far it's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"We have had this set for almost 6 years and I'm purchasing one for a friend today. The spoons have been the easiest to use of all that we've had and tried. The plates sides help them to be able to scoop food more easily. And, we are on kid #3, the set lasts! There are some cut marks on the bottom of the plate and a smidge of wear on the spoons, but that's it. It has weathered well considering all the use its gotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I should have known","review":"I read most of the reviews. I thought I'd give it a try. I'm now assuming that most of the reviewers had kids younger than mine because at 14 mo. I am just starting with the utensils/dish. When I gave it to him he picked it right up and promptly dumped all of his food out. So, no go for us. It looks great but for a dish that really doesn't stay in place at all and is easily picked up, I'll go spend $5 on something cute and functional instead of $18. Perhaps the rating I gave it too low, but I really expected more. Bad me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as described","review":"bowl did not have enough slip resistant base to keep it from moving on baby's tray as stated in the description.

The edges are design in a way that the food doesn't dance around while my toddler is trying to scoop it. It makes teaching using utensils a lot easier. I also love the look of the plate and spoons. They have funky and fun colors! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good baby bowl and decent spoon","review":"This bowl is relatively hard for my daughter to tip over, and it is supposedly dishwasher and microwave safe. These are the reasons I bought it. Many other plastic bowls are melamine or contain BPAs and should not be microwaved. That does not appear to be an issue with this one.The spoons are OK. They are a bit too wide and not as soft on teething babies' gums as some of the more rubbery options on the market, but they are fine and have nice stubby handles for babies to hold onto.My bowl did not come with a black spoon like in the picture. I received the advertised pink spoon, but my secondary spoon was green. For me, that was fine and even preferable, but if for some reason you're really excited about a black spoon with your pink bowl, beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"Does this book say that Karabagh is an essential part of Azerbaijan and its occupied by Armenian armed forces?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Edition is Bigger and a little better than the First","review":"I already own the First Edition of this book which was published in 2001, but I bought the Second Edition which just came out so that I can have the latest version for my next trip. The biggest changes I noticed are that the Second Edition added a phrases section and a full index. There are also more pages in the new version, with some extra details on the tourist spots. I can see that the listings are updated, too, with information about new hotels and even a new airline. My biggest criticism of the new edition is that most of the photographs are the same as from the first edition. Also, a fold-out map would have been nice. Otherwise, I would say that the Second Edition for 2002 did a good job of building on the First and I am glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the price","review":"I've been to Armenia 3 times in the past 4 years and have read every single guide that I could find. I agree with several of the reviewers that it is still the best travel guide on the market and the photos are superb.

I hope the publisher comes out with a 3rd edition some day to update Armenia's constant changes and perhaps provide a little more detail on specific regions and historic sites. however, i don't think it should become an atlas or a compendium- it is afterall a \\"travel guide.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great pictures but not enough information","review":"I agree with the reader from India; I also purchased the book hoping to get additional information about hotels, the monasteries, detailed maps etc. The book (first edition) contained information I was already familiar with and could easily obtain on the internet.

The instrumentals are tinkling, childlike backdrops incorporating the sounds of crickets, music boxes, toy pianos, rain storms, etc., fitting for a film about the relationship between a 29-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy. The lyrical songs feature a muted version of Merritt's grand irony and romanticism - again, in keeping with the film's clear-eyed depiction of its touchy subject matter. Whether or not the relationship in the film is consummated, the longing in these songs is palpable, painful. Merritt's dry croak of a singing style - an old man's voice married to a young man's idealistic view of love - is creepy in this context, and all the more convincing for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the main song????","review":"i saw the movie, then i decided to buy the soundtrack, cause i really liked the song that charley sings for eban when they're back from the beach,( after u've seen the movie that song reveals to be the most important of them all ), so i got the cd i listened to it and when it was over i was still waiting for that song. now, tell me what kind of soundtrack is a soundtrack that doesn't even include the main song?? the rest of the music isn't even that good actually it's everything but good, this is just a waste of money and time so **** it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vichy France","review":"The history is good but hard to read without insights into the people and the aftermate after the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"comparisons","review":"Having read Aron's book on Vichy I was curious about this view on the period .As the original was written in 1972 it was a huge scandal but after the years went by proved right.For those familiar with more recent works it will still be a pleasure since it's so well researched"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best book for J2EE app development","review":"I chose this book because it was the No.1 best-selling book at amazon and I was not disappointed.

Much of the book contained best practices that were incredibly valuable, and he seemed to have a focused direction that he wanted to take us in - not just re-hash the J2EE specification.However, I felt like was left hanging at the end of the book. He talks about a sample application throughout his discussions on design and the source code for the application is available from wrox's (the publisher) website.

Worst of all it is degrading in terms of the way it portrays and treats women. For example, the director of this movie obviously thought it was amusing and erotic to have a flying penis rape virgins. I just thought it was sick and perverted.This movie does have a lot of sex scenes with beautiful naked asian girls. However, to truly appreciate those scenes you would have to be one sick puppy because of the disturbing context for which those scenes are set. Now I am no prude. I have no objections to truly erotic scenes; however, I am turned off when those scenes are submerged in a sea of morbidity.

Movies such as the \\"Hustler\\", \\"Color of Money\\", and \\"Poolhall Junkies\\" though good in their own respects have long since given pool and pool players a bad rep as macho, greedy, pigheads who play a great game but are stupid when it comes to other aspects of life. SG has made it no better or worse than the other films have.Saying that, this is a revenge story set in a poolhall. I'm sure poker players everywhere would be spewing the same mindless battle cry \\"It gives us a bad name\\" if this movie took place over a poker table. People fail to see that and are too concerned whether or not this film gives who a bad name.Cinematography is excellent. Acting is decent. Some nice pool action. Not the greatest pool film ever but certainly not as bad as people would like you to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"A terrible film on every level. The story is unbelievable as well as unrealistic. The characters are not only hard to believe, but are not sympathetic so you really don't care. There is so much slang inserted into the dialogue that's it almost incomprehensible -- they actually have a special feature on poolhall slang which I guess we're supposed to watch first. Seeing a few well done pool shots well executed is the only positive thing I can say about this mess, but that it's not enough to warrant even a rental, as you can see that on ESPN.

First off, pool hustlers are charming (the better to relieve you of your money), unlike the venemous, scenery-chewing characters in this flick. (As an aside, today's tournament players are as likely to pull you aside and ask about the state of your salvation as to hustle you.) The only nod to realism is a string of trick shots--but try setting your drink on the rail in a real poolroom and the manager will run over with a quick dose of realism. As for the story, forget it.

Remini is an adequete writer, but certainly not at the level of the aforementioned authors.

It is about a boy paying his respects to the mother of a girl he killed.

He struggles daily trying to be \\"popular.\\" He gets his chance to prove himself when he is allowed to go to \\"cool guy Chaz's\\" party. Unfortunately, his chance for popularity is ruined that night since he is humiliated in front of everyone by the girl he has a crush on. He leaves the party and his life changes forever. In the process of trying to kill himself, he kills an innocent 18-year-old girl. As punishment he is told to build whirligigs in her honor and place them in the four corners of the country so that her spirit can live on. In this process he learns that there is more to life than he ever imagined. I liked the book okay although it was somewhat depressing throughout until you reach the ending. It made me think about how trivial some things in life are. It also made me think about how the things you do effect many other peoples lives. I recommend this for people who want to read it by their interest in what I wrote above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out on a journey, to find himself.","review":"Whirligig is a book about a boy who goes to a party and is rejected by the girl of his dreams.

Instead, he kills an innocent girl in another car and is asked by her mother to put a whirligig on the four corners of the United States. He goes to every corner and finds another adventure in each state causing him to love the world around him more than before. There are a couple chapters about people who have seen these whirligigs and are inspired by them. Whirligig is a touching book, but it is not recommended for children ten and under. Whirligig will make you smile and cry with happiness and sadness. It is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whirligigs- An exciting summer read!","review":"I loved this book!

The theme is about a boy named Brent who is learning how to forgive himself andalso maturing a bit too. This book is a combination of mysterious and adventurous. It ismysterious because he meets so many different people, for example the book said, \\" He'dnever met a Canadian before.\\" He wouldn't know if he was a good guy or an evil guy. \\"The consequences will be real\\" \\"No one would go near him.\\" Who knows what he coulddo. Also could be adventurous because Brent visits different places on his journey. Forexample, \\" Let people all over the country receive joy from her.\\" He meets so manypeople along the journey. All in all, it was between ok and bad because I couldn't stayfocused. It was confusing, boring, and dull.

The characters are superficial and stereotypical and the plot (if there is one), is very disjointed. If the San Diego Union Tribune's review is correct and Gandt took no notes and did no research to corroborate his facts, then this book should be fiction instead of non-fiction. I find it interesting that basically only the women pilots' names were changed. If Gandt and his sources are so \\"unimpeachable\\" and the facts are true and indisputable, then why would Gandt feel the need to change the names of the women?

I thinkthe general public would find it interesting thatGandt's primary Navy sources are being investigatedfor their criminal conduct and admitted lies abouttheir stories.

Best of all, Gandt does not shy away from the \\"women in combat\\" issue, as many would in today's PC-liberal climate. Refreshingly, he engages the issue head-on and up-front. Specifically he reveals some painful truths about preferential treatment in womens' flight training. He takes no position whatsoever---but he reports the facts with brutal honesty.

I am already waiting for the next!Tiny"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit the iPod","review":"The case appears cheaply made and kept slipping off the iPod at the top, so the screen would not have been protected. I confirmed with the seller that I had received the correct size for the thicker 60GB/80GB iPod because the case seemed too small. Also, the \\"3pcs Screen Protector\\" seems to mean the one protector you receive is cut into three pieces so you can still move the controller on the front. Either that, or the seller didn't understand that the plastic protector has thin covers over it that you are supposed to peel off so it sticks to the iPod. The seller was helpful, but now I have the hassle of printing out their return authorization, going to the post office, and paying for postage to send it back for an item that only cost $15 in the first place. I went to an Apple store and am much happier with the Marware cover I found there.

I have eaten gluten-free cakes which taste no different than cake made from wheat flour, so I know it can be done. This cake texture is mealy, the cake is dense and tastes like corn. Not like cake should taste. With butter-cream frosting, it was edible, but I will not make it again. I'm still searching for the perfect GF cake mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet muffins, works egg-free!","review":"We're picky about our gluten-free baked goods, especially since we can't use eggs. This mix was very successful without eggs, baked as muffins. The flavor is like a sweet cornbread, but lighter in texture. And it's wonderful with a quick lemon glaze ...and better yet with fresh berries. I suspect it will make an excellent strawberry shortcake, too.Note: I used a variety of egg replacer for 2 eggs, plus a bit extra Ener-G egg replacer, used milk instead of water, tossed in 2 Tb nonfat dry milk for extra yum/protein. Baked at suggested temperature, 25 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I made this cake for Christmas 2008. My family thought this cake was dry and said that didn't taste good.

THE definitive DVD for any fan of AILD. There are 3 discs contained in this DVD set. The first disc is called \\"This is Who We Are... From The Beginning\\", it's basically the story of the band told from the perspectives of the band mambers both past and present. It gives an in-depth look at the band and the views that they all have on the band. Disc 2 is called \\"This is Who We Are... Now\\", which is a bunch of live shows they did. They were obviously on an amazing sound stage because there is no audience sounds and all of the instruments sound crisp and amazing, and Tim's voice sounds as amazing as ever. Disc 3 is called \\"This is Who We Are\\", and it contains some awesome music videos and some bonus features. This collection is an essential and a must-have for fans and those who are curious alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent live set","review":"The sound quality is excellent, the video is well filmed and quite clear. The band is tight and focused in their concerts, and they nail some really technical parts in their performance. There is a lot of variety to the performances captured, from a church to a small club, to a concert hall, to large festivals, and the band brings a lot of energy to each performance. This probably will end up being one of the best DVDs of the year. Whether you are already an AILD fan, or are a fan of good metal, you'll find this to be a good buy. I actually wish that there were an audio-only version of the shows, it is that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good shows","review":"I can not help but recommend this video.\\"Madman's Paradise\\" has Grimlock and Daniel emerge in a fantasy world, where magic reigns supreme. The deep storyline, in that the Autobots must decide who is the good guys and who isn't, adds a depth seldom seen in American cartoons.\\"Grimlock's New Brain\\" features the origin of the Technobots. (They were actually first seen in \\"Money is Everything\\"). In this episode, Grimlock gains enough intellect to become the smartest of Trnsformers. However, this adds contention between him and the other Dinobots.Highest recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like the plague","review":"The first episode, \\"madman's paradise\\", is supposed to show Grimlock being a hero? As usual the big Dinobot stumbles around creating chaos in a worthless episode, though it did do a tiny bit of character developement for Daniel. It would have been better to have \\"Call of the Primitives\\" instead.\\"Grimlock's new Brain\\", atleast Grimlock is a hero in this episode. Basically the only reason to watch this episode and buy the tape is to see the Technobots for the first time. I can only recommend this episode is if you want to complete your Kid Rhino collection or if you can only get \\"The Return of Optimus Prime\\" in a three set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound and picture of a historic DVD","review":"Don't believe the person(s) who say not to get this fabulous recording because it has poor sound and video. He is not telling the truth. I have the DVD, and the sound and picture good. As good as my Callas documentory at least. Remember it's remastered.This is the most spectacular display of singing I've ever heard. I hate saying it, it sounds like a cliche. But I have no way of stating what is the absolute truth. This recital is nothing sort of phenomenal. Everything you've heard about Dame Joan being the greatest coloratura on the planet I will echo. And I can't even find words to describe just how stupendous this Dvd is. All I can say is, get it, listen to it, and you'll fall in love with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A testament of a great singer","review":"Nothing more needs to be said that has not been said (especially by the descriptive reviews here).

And I've been an opera buff for over 50 years. Sutherland had the ultimate instrument...huge, lush, silvery, and capable of anything and everything.What does Sutherland do on this DVD? She simply thrills and trills all the way through it.There has never been and there will never be a singer with such astonishing God-given talent vocally. And in these early recordings of Dame Joan, she really showed that she was a fabulous actress too.Do not miss this one. This is the best I've even heard - NO exceptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate display of singing","review":"No words can describe the perfection that Joan Sutherland displays in this dvd. If there is one operatic recording I can take to a desert island, it would certainly be this one. A whole galaxy of stars for this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five star power for the Queen of bel canto","review":"I'm not good with words. I only know that this Bell Telephone DVD is incredible. I have always been a die hard fan of La Stupenda. But never have I heard her in this state of voice as it is here. Maybe it is that she did it 40 years ago when she was still young.It puts all of my other Sutherland cds and dvds to shame. And that includes the Lucia and the Lucrecia Borgia.I sit here and read all the remarkable and raving reviews and incredible as it may sound, these fans are not exaggerating. This really is the most spectacular display of bravura singing that has been recorded. But the only way to convince you that this is the epitomy of great singing is to experience this. After that, you'll be a believer, and a fan for life. As I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Video seems to be defective - All copies!","review":"Well, it's great until the tape runs out before the video is over. I tried 3 copies - same problem. This one should never have gone to market - someone should be fired!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I started watching this series because it sounded so good, but it was so boring. I think one of the main problems was that I couldn't get into the characters. The only character I liked was Larva. He was so pretty when he took off his mask..why would you cover up such beauty? It seemed as if the story would get better, but I do not want to bore myself with every episode just to find out it doesn't get better. If you like the characters...this may be a good series. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but acceptable . . .","review":"Why does Larva talk? I don't know. He's not supposed to. But other than that, this was a lovely second volume. The animation quality, I think, dropped down a notch, but who the heck cares? The voice casting is still excellent. I have a little trouble with that Reiha chick and her talking doll. Where in the world did she come from? She makes a nuisance of herself by popping in and ruining Miyu's fights with her Ice Blast. You should probably watch this if you're a Vampire Princess Miyu fan, although these TV volumes are nowhere near as dark as the OAVs. Plus, VHS doesn't come subtitled, which takes away from some of the mystery and haunting-ness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music for Massage","review":"This CD is one of my favorites, along with Polynesian Spa. I am a massage therapist and I have listened to this disc over and over again during a days work and it's enjoyed by my clients as well as being something enjoyable for me to listen to as well.

It opened my eyes to several things I have been doing when helping my child read which actually hinder a child's ability to decode words by themselves. Too much focus on the mechanics of reading and the letters in a word can contribute to problems when the child moves beyond the most basic reading skills.Marie's book offers many excellent suggestions for working with a child. Her suggestions help a child grow in their reading without getting in their way. The lists of activities and skills to be acquired are helpful. We have seen tremendous progress in our child's ability to read independently since implementing the reading recovery program.I think every parent who has a child struggling with reading could learn something from this book. I also think it would make excellent reading for any educator interested in helping their students read better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Thinking","review":"I am a former Title I teacher and reading specialist. I am currently teaching third grade in an excellent school district. I am always reading the current literature and keeping up to date with data driven best practices. I purchased this book after the great reviews from others. Wow, am I disappointed in the content of this book. Granted, it was written in 1993 and is outdated. Thank goodness that those of us who graduated from school within the past 7-8 years are not using these methods that are so outdated. For all those parents looking for information on how to teach your child to read, this is not the book for you. My suggestion would be to focus on decoding and work attack skills. Please keep in the back of your mind that statistically speaking, approximately 10%-15% of children will struggle with reading. Some studies cite even a higher percentage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whole-Language by any other name is still Whole-Language","review":"A frightening look into the way children who can't teach themselves to read by being exposed to print, in the whole-language classroom, are remediated.With this method it is claimed you don't even have to know letters or their associated sounds to be able to read.Whole-Language was a horrible failure in California and its continuing implementation is likely to condem thousands of our children to marginal reading skills, if not total illiteracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Chore to Read!","review":"This book is so poorly written it isn't worth even the bargain book bin and it was obvious to me, since the author used as a cover for the book a picture taken by someone else that she probably got off the internet of Clay in concert that she has no original thought. Shame on this author for intruding on Clay Aiken's family life. It is VERY obvious that she was using Clay Aiken to pull in his fans to buy this piece of literary junk and that is exactly what it is. Now she excersizes her freedom of speech by writing this trash and tell falsehoods, just another person making a buck out of what she calls a book off Clay Aiken's back. A tribute indeed. She may call it that to get people to buy it and the fool I am that I did, probably one of the few sales she had. This book stinks!

It was waste of paper and more importantly was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Buying Any of It!!!","review":"IN MY OPINION, how convenient for the lawyer in this case to be able to come to an internet site and delete her comments! Luckily for the attorney, she had the 20/20 hindsight to delete her comments AFTER a suit was filed and AFTER a book was published. Kettle, meet black.I did read the lawsuit and am amazed at how irrelevant so many the allegations are to the case. It appears to me that both the suit and the book are complicit in one goal only....to incite a dedicated fan base to want to know everything there is to know about Clay Aiken; to create hype where there is none. This is one fan who is not falling for it. Again, I'm just stating my opinion. This is my husband's and my account, but I'll post my name to it Joan Price Williamson, just in case anyone wants to sue me for stating an opinion and a recommendation not to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the Blue","review":"I met this woman a year ago and she was bragging about her book then.

Snoozefest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holes","review":"I refer to the message posted by Jeannie Holleman's lawyer about the lawsuit. First, why would a lawyer feel the need to defend a client on a website like Amazon. Shouldn't the defending be conducted in a courtroom?Second, why would the author ask Faye Parker for her blessings about writing a book about Clay and his wonderful fans in 2002? Clay was a not a celebrity then. Clay hadn't even appeared on American Idol (season 2). So in 2002, there were no Clay fans and there were no Claymates.Third, if Faye Parker and the attorneys of Clay had instructed that the word \\"unauthorized\\" be put on the cover of the book only in 2005, why is it then that the hardcover version of this book containing the word \\"unauthorized\\" was already released on the 31st of December 2004?Sorry, I don't buy the explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unprofessional","review":"I honestly cannot understand why the lawyer of an author would need to use a review page to talk about the case of the lawsuit.

I received soliciting emails asking for my \\"Clay stories\\" and then asking for prayers as she went to Faye and the family to get their blessing for publishing the book. Which she obviously didn't get. (The family's blessing or my prayers) How about making your own way in the world instead of on someone else's back? And, have you noticed that those who really are in Clay's inner circle, including friends from high school and college are incredibly tight lipped about sharing any information to any media? I regard that has a measure of the content of their character. Sadly, something lacking in this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I purchased this book because I thought it would be fun to read about Clay from someone who \\"knew\\" him all of his life, which is what I was led to believe from the book cover.

It is poorly written in an amateurish style and, if the author used a proofreader or editor, it doesn't seem evident. After awhile I just skimmed through the book because it was unbearably tedious to read. The photos in the book are of poor quality.Also there is something about the tone of this book that smacks of being opportunistic. The author clearly seems to relish basking in the reflected glory of a hometown celebrity. That made it uncomfortable to read.

I know that I personally don't make it a habit of suing friends and those I am a fan of.....If you want to know about Clay's life as a child, read his \\"Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music In Your Life\\".

We can get that for free. To imply that fans were instructed not to buy this is specious - how have other books about Clay sold? Surely the author did not believe this book was another Learning To Sing?Clay fans can also get more information than they need about Clay right on the internet. So again, why buy a book?I did read a bit of the book. Found no reason to buy it.The author evidently thought this book was a slam-dunk for sales to Clay fans, and there is no data to support this. None of the other books written about Clay have done very well - because this is the internet age. We can easily find anything that may be in a book, on our own.

Just another WAY to make money off of Clay. Geez. What a sleazeball.I have told everyone I know NOT to buy this book.

For those fans who have read or posted on the various message boards, this is a most enjoyable, heartwarming and indeed inspirational book. I was surprised at how much I learned about the various people who thought of ways to raise funds for the charities that are endorsed by Clay Aiken; people who were heretofore known to me by \\"screen names\\" became alive as I read their stories in this book, which could have been named \\"Testament of Love.\\" If you are curious about what makes Clay's fans \\"tick,\\" this is where you'll find the answer.

She writes an UNOFFICIAL book about Clay Aiken, which would mean that Clay never endorsed the book!Now she wants to sue Clay and expect him to pay her a huge sum of money, endorse her book, which as mentioned was never endorsed by Clay, and she wants free publicity by demanding that Clay sells her book at his concerts for 5 years!!!!In addition to that, I am a member of many of Clay's fansites, including his official fan club. Never at any time have I read any critisims from Clay or his mother about this book.In fact, I was never aware of this book until I read the news that she is suing Clay!This \\"author\\" is beyond being ridiculous!

Today more than ever, people are leaving or being let go of their J-O-Bs and going into business on their own. Many are fed up with the commute, lowered benefits, ceiling on income and downsizing, but not many are ready to face the world out there as an entrepreneur.

Unfortunately, I should have waited. It happens to be a rehashed version of Rich Dad, Poor Dad and the Cashflow Quadrant. Since I already own both of those titles, I didn't feel that I received any added value for my money. Also he spends most of the time telling stories about his own life, instead of providing valuable tips on what to do and/or what steps to take before you quit your job. If you have not read any of Kiyosaki's other books, then by all means pick it up, but if you have any of his other titles, you should just skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice head start on starting your own business","review":"I've read a lot of Kiyosaki's books now and this one does a good job of further focusing his efforts. It's a great guide on starting your own business using the \\"Rich Dad\\" mentality and ideas. I would hardly call this book a good start for beginners since it does require you have some working knowledge about being an entrepreneur. In summary, worth your time and efforts for a small investment of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the book, it's all about buying the game!","review":"I have read some of his other books and they all are a sales pitch for his game but I must say, this one it was over the top sales.

A lot of what Kiyosaki has said in past books is repeated. If you haven't read any of the rich dad books I'd say this one isn't a bad one to start you. The book really gets good after you've gotten about half way through it. One thing i really like is this book tells you why cashflow 101 costs $200, Kiyosaki has a good argument on why it cost so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifechanging","review":"This book is so powerfull that it will change your life if you take what it says to heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book provides a sound overview of the fundamental infrastructure that must be present for a business to be successful.

BUT PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY A DECENT COPY OF THESE MOVIES!!! THIS TAPE STINKS!! It's missing more than 20 minutes of story in Rain, and you can't barely see Martha Ivers - the image quality is AWFUL!

Part of my displeasure is very subjective: I am a sincere Christian and kept reading only in the hope that Heinlein would resolve the blasphemous story line in a settling manner, but it only got worse and worse. Part of my displeasure is more objective, however: the story is a juvenile fantasy of free sex and freedom from consequences that I find ridiculous and, especially after reading so much of his genuinely edifying juvenile fiction, frankly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"Great experience... the book was in good condition and was shipped in timely manner. no issues with packaging.. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"More Heinlein drek from the era of his that you Just Should Not Read.

Not sure if it is supposed to be Twainish, or what."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must Weigh In Against","review":"After several attempts I had to toss the book aside- a rare gesture for my reading patterns. I purchased this book after seeing the positive reviews, but I failed to read more carefully about the heavy religious references and biblical quotations. I'm not bible literate for many reasons and this was just too much of an insider's joke- I only assume it was an ironic position because of the comments made by others who appreciated the different slant on something that as a very nonfundamentalist individual was lost on me. I'm really sorry I couldn't enjoy what was so apparently enjoyable to the many readers who gave it such high marks. However, I feel that a cautionary note for others whose interests, like mine, tend to be more secular- I would advise to consider the subject matter and content a little more deeply than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I read this book for an English Study unit.

I picked up the book for a new experience - an experience that was flat. My criticism, however, might be misguided from all the positive reviews by people, I suspect, are more into the genre than I am. A great help, however, at midpoint in the book, to read a biography of the author. Then I could start to see themes of his philosophy emerge. The irrationality of religion, the jabs at all sorts of denominations, the odd relationships between people, and the fact that true love conquers all started to become clear. Getting to those points seemed to be a chore. Instead of enjoying the experience, I found myself confused and impatient with the way the reader is jerked around - but then, that may be the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rare Heinlein travesty","review":"This is the ONLY Heinlein work I don't like and have read only once, and I've read everything he wrote that I could get my hands on for more than thirty years (since I was a teenager). I've literally worn out multiple softcover copies of several of his novels, and starting to do the same in hardcover, especially \\"I Will Fear No Evil\\" and \\"Time Enough for Love.\\" I'm sorry to say, however, Heinlein completely lost me with \\"Job\\"- it's not a 'comedy,' it's a travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lesson in Values","review":"Something new and unpredictable happens on every page.The most faithful Christian on earth turns out to be the most open minded - to the chagrin of higher powers who put him to the test. He is nave, but resourceful. He is average, but honest. He is dogmatic, but flexible, because his most fundamental value is love - not his image.You will also find out how the Bible and science could both be right, and although I don't think Heinlein believed this for a second, it does make a thought provoking story.If you are looking for a good novel with a libertarian bent, then read this, or pretty much anything else by Heinlein for that matter. I especially recommend, \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no Kindle book? Why only Audible?","review":"Heinlein is one of my favorite authors, and Job is my favorite of his books, one I can pick up and begin reading at any point and enjoy.

I have read it over 5 times, and still enjoy it as much now as the first time I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a comedy of justice or any other","review":"While Heinlein has many hits, this one is a miss for me. While the premise of the first two-thirds of the book is promising, it gets old in a hurry. The last third is a little better, but not much. I guess it is somewhat telling when the book gets better when the protagonist dies, or at least leaves this earth. Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heinlein's Most Readable Novel","review":"As Heinlein got older, he seemed to become a better and more focused writer, instead of peaking when he was younger. \\"Job: A Comedy of Justice\\" does not have the usual kinky bisexual characters or aliens with odd names that make his other more popular books so hard to follow, if you grok what I mean. I highly recommended this if you want a different slant on a Biblical story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-encompassing religious thought piece","review":"This book, while being an entertaining read, was also something more - a thought piece on the viability of some existence outside the conventional wisdom which exists in human religion to date. The question of which group of believers is right is presented in an insightful and thought provoking way - in the spirit of Mark Twain's Letters from the Earth. If you like to think about existential matters, and can put your beliefs to the test, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous satire","review":"This is top notch Heinlein, doing the social critique/satire he does best. Reverend Alexander Hergensheimer, citizen of the apparently Christian Reconstructionist influenced United States of North America, awakes from a fire walk to find himself being transported from parallel universe to parallel universe with his lovely Danish concubine Margrethe.While this doesn't replace Strarship Troopers as my favorite RAH, it does equal Stranger in a Strange Land. This is an excellent satire and parody of Christian teachings. I loved the portion where Hergensheimer volunteers to go to hell. Reminded me of Machiavelli's advice that one would encounter beggars and nuns in heaven but popes, kings and princes in hell. While this book didn't convince me to leave the Catholic Church (I already have) I see where it could knock wavering Christians off the fence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Religion with a sense of humor...","review":"This is the first book I've read by Heinlein so I can't compare it to his other work, but I can say that I did enjoy the book immensely, especially the views of Heaven and Hell. I just couldn't seem to put the book down!The character of Margrethe could have been fleshed out a bit more. I never really warmed up to her. Her speech seemed a bit subservient to Alec much of the time, but her actions were otherwise. She obviously had a strong will and wasn't afraid to take a stand when she felt it was necessary, even if Alec didn't approve.The beginning dragged just a bit for me, but from then on I was hooked and the book moved along fairly well and the ending was great! I would definitely recommend this book, especially if you have any interest in ideas about religion. But be warned, a sense of humor is in order. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life, love, and the pursuit of happiness","review":"If you've ever gone looking for the 'meaning of life', read the book and you'll quickly discover that you couldn't avoid it if you had to. The poor guy in this story didn't have a chance. I read this book a couple of times, lent it to a girl in '92, - haven't seen it or her since. An enthralling story about justice, and mercy, and fate, and Diety, and 'it isn't fair' - all wrapped up in a bed of hot coals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Heinlein Masterpiece","review":"I found this book in the personal library of a friend, and nearly had to be restrained from releasing my excitement at finding another Heinlein book.

I was transformed to a cool Englsh afternoon on the grounds of a mansion perserved by the National Trust with every detail delineated musically by Patrick Doyle, and his ensembles.

I understand that the book was written from interviews, court documents, letters, interviews, etc. but there is no reason why everything couldn't have been put in some kind of order.

She had been on antibiotics and ended up chapped and sore. Nothing I had found worked to clear up the rash. I went to the doctor concerned that she might have had a yeast infection; luckily she didn't. My pediatrician offered me a sample of Dr. Smith's and a coupon. He warned me that it might be hard to find the product and it was more expensive than most. Well I ended up using the small sample with immediate positive results and ordered more from Dr. Smith's website. I'm thrilled to see that Dr. Smith's is available through more outlets. It is wonderful. My kids don't get diaper rash anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you would expect","review":"I thought the reviews for the other buyer were accurate, but after installing the product, I find the picture to be less than useful.

I looked at the AT&T, Panasonic, \\"major brand\\" phones that were on Amazon, and the Cortelco didn't have that many reviews, but had all the options I was looking for. I am SO GLAD THAT I chose to purchase this phone. I've only been using it for about a week now, but it is perfect! I'm a virtual employee and I sit in on a lot of lengthy telecons; so lengthy that they were draining both of my cordless phones of any power, thus I needed a hard line phone - this one fits the bill. I don't sound like I'm in a well when using the speaker phone and so far everyone says it sounds clear. I'm hoping that the several reviewers that had \\"bad phones\\" were just a fluke. If the performance of my phone changes, I'll amend my review - but as it stands, I really like this phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last. :(","review":"I purchased this phone for my home office. I bought it in August and by October was having issues with it cutting out and having a static filled connection. I am constantly on the phone for work and can't afford a bad connection. I initially thought it was because I have a digital phone line and addressed my concerns with the cable company. After confirmation from them that the connection cutting out was not due to the phone line, I purchased another phone as a replacement and haven't had a single problem. I'm dissapointed this item didn't perform better, and doesn't offer more than a 30 day warranty. For just a slightly higher purchase price at Staples, I was able to get a better performing product with a 2 year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"POS!","review":"I don't know how this phone could get a 5 star rating.

After about 2 hours, I noticed that the display brightness was varying with the caller's speech. The next call I picked up on speaker was terrible. I had a strange electronic buzzing in the speaker and the caller couldn't understand what I was saying.I works fine on the handset and with my Plantronics S12 headset, so it appears that something is amiss with the speaker function.

The rest are a mishmash of pieces from various other sources. The two from Secret Garden are lifted from their \\"Dreamcatcher\\" album. As has been mentioned, there is no real flow to the music.

Some of the stupid anecdotes that are meant to amuse, just don't. They're just stupid picks of stupidity. There's much worse out there, we've all seen it, and it feels like the Petras didn't try very hard enough to gather the really good anecdotes. Don't get me wrong, at times, it was hysterical (and oddly bi-partisan), but sometimes, it was just completely dry. Some are hard to understand. Some categories are just random (You have your government, marketing, and then randomly, CARS. What?

The authors just grabbed some stories off the Internet and print short excerpts, often withholding key information such as when and where they happened. The worst part is that many of these stories are unresolved--so they don't give you the ending to what happened.For example, a Memphis high schooler sued the school for $25,000 because he earned an A+ in a course but the highest report card grade is an A. The book doesn't state when this happened or how it was resolved. Then they include the story as part of a section about Stupid Education Lawsuits--of which there are only two examples!Some of the entertainment-related items are a little fun, but there are a lot of pages here that are filled with fluff.It's bathroom-style reading for someone looking for something brainless, but expect to get frustrated because most of the stories are so incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Funny!","review":"What a riot!

The trigger is pretty stiff. 1 CO2 cartridge lasts 80 shots (8 magazines) or so, and by that time the pellets barely come out of the barrel. Never pull the hammer back when the barrel is up, you will be frustrated at how jammed it will be. As far as the shooting part goes, this gun is pretty good. At about 25 feet, you can put a hole in a tin can as long as you haven't already used up most of your CO2.

Ms Burnham captures something about the spirit of Catharism in this book that is well worth experiencing. She has done her research, although this is not straight historical fiction; it is more of a spiritual and emotional journey. I live in Cathar country much of the year, and have a special passion for Montsegur, and as such I will say that my only disappointment is that the title is slightly misleading. I expected, and wanted, more of the Montsegur story, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. If you are looking for in depth understanding of Catharism, you will not find it here. But if you are lookng for beautiful writing about a moving subject with deep spiritual undertones, you will find this book stays with you for very long time after you turn the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiction I really learned from","review":"The Treasure of Montsegur actually brought my attention to a part of history that I previously knew very little about. The Cathars were this gnostic Christian sect that lived in Europe during the Medieval period. Their beliefs, and practices somehow threatened the established Catholic Church and the pope issued a crusade against them. The result was a genocide, where an entire religion and culture was eliminated, as well as the birth of the infamous Spanish Inquisition.While the story starts slow, it finishes well. Along the way you learn things you never learned before. The book is a bit too spiritual for my taste, but when you place it into the context that the Cathars were essentially a mystical sect the spirituality becomes a part of the story, and not a case of religious teachings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this very much","review":"I enjoyed this book very much - a good flavor of the times.

It has the two female leads (including the girl soldier), always a moment away from disaster, a moment away from rescue, and a moment away from bouncing out of the costume. It has the jungle princess, the king of the monkey-men, and the dashing hero with pencil-thin mustache. It recreates the older kinds of adventures, the great-grandparents of Indiana Jones.\\"Rascals\\" is completely enjoyable: a lot of good, stylized drawing, a little adventure, and nothing at all to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old hard science fiction...","review":"It's a very interesting world that Asher brings us into. The centrality of the slugs at the heart of the world's eco-system is more asserted than really demonstrated, but that's a quibble compared to the very interesting lifeforms that exist together in this novel.The action scenes are well-imagined and the author has clearly spent a little time on a fishing vessel (or a good deal of time in secondary research) as his \\"fishing\\" (not really fish) scenes are exciting and detailed.Ultimately, this book is really about the life-forms that populate it. Asher seems to have loads of fun describing the life-forms and the way they interact with each other. Ultimately, however, the payoff to the premise is surprisingly \\"humanistic.\\"A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"really, 4.5 stars. Fun, intelligent","review":"Few flaws... Fun, fairly intelligent, not too predictable, good characterizations and ideas. Interesting biology and characters. Definitely worth the 4.5 star rating... but the virtues have been well-covered so don't mistake for damning with faint praise. Worth the price and the hours spent reading it. Thanks, Neal!On the down side, it is rather on the vulgar, pulp side- lots of gratuitous violence and plain old human nastiness that approaches modern \\"horror\\" movies, and in my view this detracts somewhat from the virtues. Also, the final \\"twist\\" involving the war drone... maybe I'm just getting really used to clever, smart-alec, almost god-smart battle AI characters, but frankly I did see it coming 50 or more pages back...

But as I was starting to read \\"The Voyage of the Sable Keech\\" this year I realized I needed to re-read \\"The Skinner.\\" I'm really glad I did -- it gave me additional insight to the whole social structure of Spatterjay, and prepared me for the new book (Voyage of Sable Keech).

If you are desirous of miraculous changes being manifested in your life, adhere to her \\"sound\\" principles and watch the changes.....watch for new beginnings that will bring you health, wholeness, happiness, peace, prosperity, success, wealth, and protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A RECENT EX-WIFE RECOMMENDED THIS ANIME . . .","review":". . . I guess that makes us even for my marital faux paws.Anime can be silly and senseless and still be enjoyable. But this pubescent idea of adolescent libido and misdirected exuberance, doneover and over and over with only minor variations is antagonizingand definitively not enjoyable. (Incidentally, I collect movies, including over 100 anime's.)Style/graphics are dated and recycled episode-to-episode. Screeching over- reactions to jiggling female body parts might work once or twice; but, dozens of times? In every same-seeming episode?And I don't wonder at my being the first reviewer. Others might just be too embarrassed to admit they bought this teen-turkey - although it is weird that the producers ID'd the GB as one who'd finished law school to age 25, then reversed his baseball cap and went bicycling through his country adventuring 'learning' (but seemingly learning nothing...Okay, Brenda, we're even; now, can I have my Porsche back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad packaging!","review":"The dvd set arrived in apearance looking new and was the complete Golden Boy series....But the problem was that both of the dvd discs were loose in the case and were scrached because of that.

Chester is trying to impress his boss and, to do so, agrees to coach the boss' daughter's soccer team. Unfortunately, the team sucks so he convinces his soon-to-be stepson to dress up like a girl and join the team.If you enjoy fun, Disney-type teen movies, you'll love this.

I like his longer explanations of some of the things on the hikes. But I had several problems trying to use this book.1. The worst thing is that his descriptions of a lot of the hikes are confusing. We finally gave up using it as a result and switched to other books. In many cases, he also doesn't give distances where you find things or make turns. We've gone off course many times as a result, or searched all over the place for what he's talking about, and that is not fun. When he does give distances, they're sometimes not right which throws us off worse.2. The maps are bad, hard to follow. Robert Stone's book has much better maps.3.

The topic is a difficult one, and I think the author is successful in providing a comprehensible overview of a large, complex, and incompletely understood scientific project.My main criticism is that the author seems to be uncertain about the audience for whom he is writing. At times he is glib and humorous, using colloquialisms and expressions which will quickly date. At other times, understanding the text requires expert knowledge. For example you might quess in Figure 5.3 that Pcx and Ncx stand for Paleocortex and Neocortex, but can you be confident in Figure 7.2 that the orthogonal axes labelled 'M' and 'R' are actually medial and rostral?

If you liked the movie or not, you can definitely dig the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie","review":"I started reading this book because I loved the concept of teleportation but was a little disappointed in the movie based on it. The good news is that the book is waaaay better...and different. I'm not sure why the story for the movie was changed so drastically from the book. To me, the author's take on a boy who learns he can teleport and how he chooses to use this exciting ability is a lot more down-to-earth and relatable than what they chose to showcase in the movie. My only complaint was that because this story was told in first-person perspective we never really got to experience the reactions of anyone other than the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing like the movie!","review":"I love this whole series.

So I started with the first one, this one. The story concept is excellent. The emotional rollercoaster is way overdone. Over all I think the writing is rather poor. It is not clear where the story is going re: sequels. The Paladins are not in this book or even hinted at. This was a first novel, so perhaps that is understandable. I could not get my hands on Reflex the sequel he wrote 13 years later (out of print); nor have I read his 6 intervening, unrelated works. I did get the novel \\"Jumper: Griffin's Story\\" which he wrote as the backstory of the character from the Jumper film. This is SOOOO much better written than the first that I wonder if the same person actually wrote it. Of course with 9 novels under his belt, perhaps Gould has improved markedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I have to admit I purchased this book because of all the high ratings it received. Although the storyline held great promise, the writing was juvenile and the characters were shallow and therefore not very likable. Although our lead character \\"jumps\\" quite a bit, there is no magic in what he does, nothing original or unique at all. I was very disappointed in this book.

I enjoyed the movie, but felt it left the ending open, probably in anticipation of a sequel. The book is good - better than the movie, but completely different. The ONLY things the book and the movie have in common are:1. The Title2. Teleportation3. The main character's name4. The girlfriend's name5. The father is a drunk6.

However I felt that the move was very flat and felt that it left out a lot of things.The next day, I went to the bookstore looking for this book, thinking that it would fill in some gaps.

Thin, one-dimensional characters with ridiculously over-simplified emotions and ham-fisted clunky dialogue abound in this adolescent teleportation fantasy. Perhaps an introverted teen (from the eighties) might find the characters intriguing, but any mature reader, even a sci-fi fan, would have a hard time not laughing at most of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would you love to be able to teleport?","review":"This was an excellent read. The book was well paced and the characters showed both growth and intelligence. Davy's life is not an easy one. His father is an alcholic and violent man, and his mother left him and Davy when her husband almost killed her.Then one day Davy makes an amazing discovery. He can teleport! It doesn't solve all his problems, but it does give him a freedom the rest of us can only dream about. If you ever wanted your own transporter beam - well, this guy has it.The latter half of the book made me glad that terroist actions on public transport are quite rare these days, and I would have hated to live through the rash that Davy went through at the end. That was the only part of the book that kind of jarred with me. That *so many* terroist actions took place in such a short period.Aside from that, these characters really do grow on you and easily carry you to the end of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfying, entertaining read","review":"I chose this book because the premise sounded interesting. You can read the synopsis of the book on Amazon if you're interested, so I won't rehash it here. Suffice it to say that I did enjoy the fact that teleportation was almost a background aspect of the story. There was no real attempt to rationalize or explain it. The story was more about how character(s) learned to deal with this abilty.This is not a multifaceted, complex story like \\"Dune\\" or some of my other favorites, but Steven Gould's writing style flows so effortlessly that I couldn't believe how quickly I raced through the book. I will be looking for more of Mr. Gould's works in the future. I've already added the second Jumper book (Jumper: Griffin's Story) to my wish list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"I love this book.

When Sebastian and Alesia met sparks were flying and when they got married Sebastian couldn't stay away from her and let me tell you, he tried and tried.

He takes her home to his mother who lives in a farmhouse in the South and shows her what family love is all about. Through their love and normalacy she learns right from wrong and repents of her crime. My favorite scene is when they are all sitting around the piano singing on Christmas Eve. I nearly cry every time I see it.I stumbled across this movie at the library and got it because I loved Barbara's performance in Christmas in Connecticut. I think this one is even better.

Maybe he or she would not have thought that way?Well this book will try to convince you that people actually don't think that way. Even when you ask a stupid question they will answer it and won't think that you are a stupid person. Anyway it is a very good book if you want to get what you want, maybe you can get a pay raise from your boss after completing this book (There is a chapter in the book about \\"How to ask at work\\" too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aladdin Factor","review":"Good read and a lot of wonderful stories and helpful hints to boot.

Decided to check this out since it was mentioned in his book, but found it not only boring but useless. There's not much substance here. I listened to the tapes because I had already spent the money, but would not reccomend them to anyone. Get Success Principles instead, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical survey","review":"This short book (64 pages) relies on writings, seed catalogs and paintings and lithographs to recreate the pioneer gardens of upper Canada. There are chapters on vegetables, fruits, tea and coffee and chocolate substitutes, medicinal plants, dyes, etc. Period drawings and paintings are included to illustrate the text, also full color pictures of the Black Creek Pioneer Village workers engaged in specific activities. I found it most interesting that roasted barley was considered the best \\"coffee\\", and that the Iroquois of 1750 were quoted in 1770 as saying that they had never seen bees before the Europeans came.There is a large nice bibliography at the end and liberal references scattered in the captions. Every page contains colored pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Superman story in an outer space setting.","review":"This is a very entertaining story because Superman is challenged to find a way to free the planet Earth from captivity by extraterrestrial aliens. Superman's power is pushed to the limit, but this gives the reader a truly exciting look at what our hero can do if necessary. If you are a Superman fan or enjoy a good science fiction story with a super hero in it, than this book is a must read for you. It's definitely 5-star reading material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Superman Story Ever","review":"The story was obviously written before \\"Crises on Infinite Earths\\". But published 2 years after. I found the story line just silly. This was the kind of immature story that DC had moved away from. I real step back for them at the time. Save your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kool Keith is back in classic mode","review":"This is a classic concept album that plays like the score of a crazy science fiction movie. Mr. Nogatco is sinister, his rhymes and even voice sound totally unique. The beats are intricate and come with many twists and turns including some drum and bass, metal and glitchy electronic touches. Also enjoyed the wild bonus features on the CD-ROM portion. The movie features an alien autopsy and killer robots invading suburbia. Only Kool Keith could deliver this kind of out of the box, classic hip hop entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?","review":"If you liked \\"Dr. Octagon\\", you will probably be pretty disappointed by this album. The beats are wack, the lyrics are complete nonsense, and it definately does no justice to the original masterpiece. I can barely get through the first 10 tracks without hitting \\"eject\\" on my cd player. Dont get me wrong, I love Kool Keith; but in my humble opinion, this is one of his worst albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kool Keith is boring","review":"Don't get me wrong, I loved KOOL KEITH back in the Ultramagnetic Days, the Dr. Octagon days, and even the Black Elvis days...but his albums have gotten TOO left field and experimental. When it works (Night Flyer, Celestial, and Alpha Omega) it's dope but when it doesn't (the rest of the CD) it just fails to accomplish anything. If he would do an entire concept album like Doc Oc again with the same dark mood it may be his resurrection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound!!! Classic.","review":"Classic Gilbertito Santa Rosa.

If you like his salsa you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try to hard to be Tito Rodriguez","review":"Gilberto has demostrated he is following the path of what american record labels want. Monga style of salsa, and he is trying too hard to copy every little detail of Tito Rodiguez, the hair style, singing and even album cover.This is terrible coming from one of the top soneros of the late 70's early 80's. This is the reason salsa is pretty much done to people eyes. They follow commerical style of salsa and thats it. they dont know groups like La Excelencia, Tromboranga, Lucky 7 Mambo, Charlie Donato, Charansalsa,Bailatino, Ralphy Irrizary, Guasabara, and etc. the list goes on by the dozen.Pick up any of these groups and you see modern day salsa with flavor of salsa dura.This album is a total disapointmentSorry if the truth hurts Salsa monga lovers!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He is the GREATEST in romantic Salsa!","review":"I love Gilberto Santa Rosa's songs.

This book says nothing on Forms. However, it is a good book explaining the ins-out of the rest of the stuff to a degree. But I feel it spends too much time on hypothetical questioning & marketing your pages, which is good I suppose but a waste of time when most of what she says is common sense. I already knew HTML before going into this book & it shows some new helpers that weren't there before. She doesn't address the pitfalls of many HTML situations like nested tables or backgrounds in cells in nested tables in older browsers (well not that old). The publishing company QUE wrote a book on HTML and it was much better. The whole HTML/web design coding is changing pretty fast with XML/XHTML, & CSS arrising, this book is no better than QUE's published 5-7 years ago. I do not recommend this book.

I pretty much taught myself HTML through the internet, and I already had a good understanding of XHTML and CSS when I read this book.It's a good book, easy to read and understand, that goes through all of the basics of web design, with all of the important elements like HTML, CSS, and image creation discussed fairly thoroughly. The last few sections include sort of a preview of other things like DHTML, Flash, and the sort. This probably will be a \\"gateway\\" book into the world of web design for most people that read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning Web Design: A Beginner's Guide to HTML","review":"This is this first \\"How To\\" book I ever read cover to cover. It works. It is well written, and breaks concepts down without making you feel like a \\"dummy\\". It's perfect for a novice like me.So many things that were a mystery to me were explained. I now can do rollover buttons, animations, add music, etc. But most important is the Web design concepts this book drives home. It teaches how to make a balanced, well structured, and most importantly, user friendly web page. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good place to start","review":"The best thing about this book is that it is very readable to someone who has little or no background in web design; it covers a lot of territory and lays the information out in layman's terms. The caveat is that, having been published in 2001, some of the info is a little dated -- for example, I understand that the FONT tag is an older standard that is being abandoned in favor of Cascading Style Sheets. But a beginner has to start somewhere, and I got a lot out of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction","review":"Although I have not plowed through this entire book yet, it is shaping up as one of the books I've been looking for to tie up all the different threads that now make up the task of creating a good website. I may never actually create my business website all on my own, but at least I will have familiarity with the various tools that are currently being used so I can intelligently discuss and understand what the professionals are recommending. One of the toughest parts of learning any new technology these days is the constant improvement and changes going on. It's impossible to guess what may become standard and what may be obsolete by the time I finish the book. Books like this at least give an average person like me a fighting chance to keep as current as possible without continuous formal education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I am a design student, and have not yet learned web design, or how to build a website.I purchased this book to teach myself the basics of web design.

The price is also better, If you buy this, you have to pay 13.49$ for 7 episodes, but if you buy the first part of spongebob season 4, you have to pay 18.99 for 20 episodes and 2 of them are double length episodes.

If somebody wants to get this perfect music, but without the additional noise, added to this particular CD, he can try to find the CD called \\"Zen for Hallmark\\". It's really a very rare one, very hard to find, but it's really much better that this one!

Scatman Crothers only performs 4 songs on this whole disc, and they are recent numbers, not pieces from his Cotton Club heyday.Likewise the Cab Calloway material.

I felt that the theory portion of this book was outstanding: it even compared the Weber systems to SU carbs in one area - the object was to reinforce there are multiple ways of achieving the same objective. I felt that the section on disassembly/assembly was not quite as strong as the Braden book - but if I ever tune my car for more serious racing - this is the one I'd come back to. Overall - well worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only useful for rebuilding","review":"This book will hardly teach you anything about the theory of operation for the carburetors, but it is useful for rebuilding due to the detailed strip-down and rebuild procedure. There is not a single illustration explaining the principles of what is going on, and the tuning advice is trial-and-error and seat-of-pants based.Methodology for identifying which circuit to tune is not very clear. No mention is made of tuning for power and economy and what tradeoffs to make. Since wideband O2 sensors and data loggers have been available for a few hundred US$ for the last few years, one would expect a recent (2003) book to make use of them, even though they where more expensive at the time of print.

The movie makes the feeling anti-western rather than pro Indian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative Series","review":"We learned much from viewing this series - history, peoples, geography and culture. Well done but sometimes the sound and narration were hard to hear and understand. The subtitles helped but there needed to be more use of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get your lesson in Indian Religion here.","review":"This is a great documentary, excepting two primary problems. 1: It makes Indians look like some sort of primitive, sub-human species. 2: The explanations of religion are way off. Brahminism was brought by the Vedic Aryan people from the north, not the natives of the south as the documentary seems to express."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"This may be one of the best documentaries ever made. Michael Wood takes us on a tour of all of the regions, history, religions of India in this short space of time. Of course it can't be comprehensive, but it is representative. It's a great way to communicate another world to the public. We see snapshots of India which bring out what is brilliant and fascinating about the cultures of the sub-continent. Secondly it's filmed in a way that brings India to life. His narrative of these moments contextualizes and fascinates. The cinematography and score bring India are far above your standard \\"talking head\\" documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Six Hour Tour of India","review":"Michale Woods' India is by far the best overview of India to date. Superb detail, rich color, insights and insider information, Michael Woods brings India alive, accessible and understandable. Michael's enthusiasm is infectious for a country that dares you to understand it. Michael accomplishes this and so much more. If you are an India expert, this will probably not entice, but it will entertain. If you are a neophyte to India, then this will overwhelm you with data, colors, sounds and a sense of India today and 3,000 years ago. This is a marvelous series and very difficult to only watch one segment at a time. What is certain is that you will not be disappointed with India."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is probably the best series of documentaries I have ever seen. I never knew much about that country or about its culture. I still don't, but Michael Wood's presentation makes you want to really learn about India, and you are left with the strong desire to take a long trip there and see it with your own eyes, and to experience that wonderful country in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"A fascinating series that details scenery, history, and culture and introduces the viewer to many interesting local people. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but could have been done better.","review":"This series is very informative, beautifully shot, and interesting, but watch for some things that are overstated. Sometimes it will proceed to say that India has the oldest this or that, or other such things when plenty of historians would disagree with such warrants. It also discusses religions in an exotica sense rather than actually telling much about the religions sometimes (other times, it gives a decent synopsis). However, given that they could only cover so much, it is wonderful what PBS has produced, and I have enjoyed the series a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok for a beginner who knows nothing about India","review":"A travel movie, maybe, but not a typical travel movie.Some facts are questionable.

So much to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"objective documentary","review":"those who want preview this documentary before buying can do so on youtube almost all the episodes are there. this a well researched and objective show without any biases. my queston is whether any indian can present such a documentary or do they have to continually rely on foreigners to tell their story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed all the episodes.

From the deserts of Turkmenistan to the Khyber Pass, the plains of Pakistan, the majestic Himalayas, and much more, India is a vast land and with a storied historical narrative that spans millennia. \\"The Sights and Sounds of India\\" special feature enhances this lengthy and involving documentary, highly recommended for armchair travelers as well as public library collections. 6 hours, closed captioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Educational. . . and Honest","review":"This series, though far from perfect, is a must see for anyone of Indian descent, or who is interested in insight into a paradoxical but fascinating country. As stated by other reviewers, the series is forced to be superficial on many aspects, but the photography, the passionate narration of Mr. Wood, and the attempts to link India's past to explain the paradoxes of her present make it a must-have.I felt the viewpoints presented were balanced and insightful. Many topics were by necessity dealt with superficially, but always with respect. After spending 41 of my 43 years in the USA, this series left me with a thirst for more insight and knowledge of India's peoples and past, and hopefully will do the same for my children.Based on the appearance of the series on standard TV, the upcoming Blu-Ray transfer (April) should be stunning and worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colonial Times to Independence","review":"This exceptional PBS series wraps up with a look at India, from the mid 1700's through modern times. Focusing on British colonial rule, Indian uprisings, Ghandi and Nehru, as well as the partition, the conflict and the challenges faced by modern India and Pakistan. The information provided and the approach is solid, with great cinematography. Following a viewing, the interested viewer will have a good idea of both the challenges and history of the India-Pakistan conflict, as well as the hopes and desires for the potential of a reunited India."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Development of India in World Trade","review":"This episode of the series explores the rise of India in world trade from approximately 200 BCE to 200 CE. Focusing on three elements - silk, spices and rice - the will written and well filmed PBS documentary takes the viewer back nearly 2000 years. Exploring the northern and western regions of India, we are exposed to the influences of the Roman and Greek culture and the trade routes, the development of new kingdoms and city-states, and many of the ancient treasures of the silk road - especially Buddhist art and culture, much of which was destroyed in the last century by fundamentalists. A great way to spend an hour, learning about the history and culture of a land that we Westerners do not understand, but has significant and growing influence on the modern world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ragav","review":"Excellent Documentary from BBC where we know india's history and its heritage.

I recommend the aluminum version. You can write pretty well with a regular pen. The onyl drawback, and its minor, is that you have to keep a finger on the left margin to mark what line you're writing on. That's if you're using it completely blind or in the dark. If you're just limited vision, you will be fine. Overall a good, sturdy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned mine","review":"This is, as the other reviewers stated, 18/8 flatware and not 18/10 as advertised.

Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of King's Best","review":"An amazing book, even if it was written during one of King's narcotic spells. The way King draws out every character, even the minor ones, is unforgettable. One of my favorite passages comes right after Vic has discovered Donna's infidelity. He asks her the inevitable question \\"Why?\\" and her thoughts spill out to the reader in a way that proves King isn't a run-of-the-mill pulp writer (88-89). The way he sustains the very tense last half of the book is remarkable. And that ending: tragic, honest, and heartbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.. however","review":"Great easy fast read.. I love his \\"movie\\" books so much more than the movie itself. However just be warned, there are some errors in this kindle version. I am new to Kindle books not sure if this is the norm or not, its nothing you can't get over just slightly annoying. So if by chance you have the hardback, and are thinking of also adding this book to your Kindle, pass.Oh I really suggest THE LONG WALK by SK if you havent read that yet, Don't really read what its about, just jump right into it! SOO AWESOME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This is a lovely story about somebody's pet dog and the wonderful adventures that they have with him. It's a wonderful story. I read it aloud to my first grade class. They loved it and so much that none of them could talk for months. All of them just sat there, pale faced, shacking. I didn't know that they would like it so much. It is a wonderful book, a must read for all animal lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad book!!!","review":"I love Stephen King movies. I picked out this book because it was the shortest one they had. Big mistake. I bought it expecting a scary and terrifying story about a killer dog when in fact, Cujo, the dog, wasn't even the main character. I think the book focused way too much on a failing marraige and very little on a killer dog. I wasn't interrested in their marraige at all. I wanted some action. This book was at the most a one-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget Misery... THIS is torture","review":"Non-stop character development. Cruelty to animals. No point whatsoever.\\"Cujo\\" is about a dog who gets bitten by bats and goes on a rampage... all within or around his house. Grrrr...First, for 100 pages, no blood is spilled, and everyone is talking about an affair, a \\"failed\\" ad campaign (more like controversy), and a monster in a closet. Excuse me, is this horror, or a stupid drama with a dog going rabid?Then we get up to speed and Cujo kills two people. That's the body count of his murders. Please...If you look at it as a horror story, you won't find enough horror. If you look at it as an affair story, all that action (no dirty pun intended) happens at the beginning. If you look at it as anything else, nothing's there.No wonder King doesn't remember writing this. Speaking of King's works, why all the sex? Every book of his has mention of sex!"},{"rating":"1","title":"family dog gone rabid","review":"this book was probably having its golden age when people more feared rabies. that was before my time though, so perhaps i couldn't relate. i never saw what was so great about this work. a family has a big dog. the dog gets bitten by rabies-infected bats. in the end it becomes a treath to a family that seem to be unable to escape. ok. the suspence wasn't that much, that is what i consider to be the greatest flaw. never been much for \\"people standing around trying to make a stand\\"- plots. but the way K describes cujo's mind, as it goes through the phases of rabies, and how it considers things, is the book's real greatness. this was between 2 and 3 stars. a little too dull for my taste"},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was actually better","review":"I remember watching the movie with a boyfriend back in high school. The movie wasn't that scary and I wasn't interested in reading any of Stephen King books. However, that changed a couple of years ago when I finally decided to read IT. I lucked out and found some King books at a used bookstore and one of those was Cujo. I was excited to read the book and settled in one night. However, shortly after getting started I realized this book is not up to the standards of his other books. The typical horror felt in It was nowhere to be found. When I read IT I admit I had moments when I was frightened... Cujo however was just a book about a rabid dog nothing more. Fortunately I know there are more King books out there that are still awesome like Salem's Lot and The Shining (not scary but a good read). I suggest skipping this book unless one is doing a comparison to King writings...."},{"rating":"1","title":"King's short story lengthened to fill his pockets","review":"Nowhere near the level of \\"Salem's Lot\\" and \\"The Shining\\" to name a few of his earlier masterpieces. This book, along with a few of the other forgetable novels he published during this same time frame in the 80's, was obviously a short story he stretched with fluff and junky sidelines to make it long enough to get his money from the publisher--and from US! I give it one star for the short story it \\"could have been\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"gud bok","review":"this wuz a neeto bok. u shud reed iit.. tarzen like bok. FIRE BAD! errrrrghh!

Taking things that are taken for granted and making them bite you. The writing makes the fear palpable. You 'feel' the anguish and terror. If you love the genre or the King...a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I am a new reader of King. I have heard about him my whole life but am only now collecting his books. I am reading them in the order they were written so Cujo was the next one on the list. I have to say I did not like this novel as much as some of the others; however, much of this was because I have been an abused wife just like the one in this book. I have been a mother who worried over her son again just like both mom's in this book. There are other parallels as well but I won't go there here. I also felt I was in the dog's head and I felt increasingly sorry for him. I understood Tad's fear of the monster in the closet and remember feeling that way as a child. I had wolfs in my closet :). I agree that this is a dark novel but I also got a truth out of it. Make the most out of each day of your life. Sometimes your life does not work out as you would have wished. Everyone probably should read this book and I am sure in a discriptive literature class the disucssions would be awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another page turner.","review":"Cujo was scary! Another one where the book is better than the movie. You are actually inside the dogs head at one point. Although the story is a bit far fetched, it's still entertaining and very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rabid!!!","review":"If you think a dog can't hurt you, then think again! Cujo is a Saint Bernard infested by rabies and stalks his owners!!! This is a novel that begs for attention as the unspeakable horror turns out to be a two-hundred pound dog. Buy this book! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh???","review":"I had the same reaction upon reaching the end of this novel as I did with a later work of his - Gerald's Game. Namely, huh??? Or to be more precise, that's it?? Cujo reads like a premise for a short story that King, with his usual expansive style, manages to expand into a novel. Too much seemed contrived - like the monster in the closet in the opening chapters - and the Castle Rock stuff felt like it got tacked on to add another fifty pages. In reading Cujo you're slogging to the conclusion, rather than accelerating. Not recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I felt sorry for Cujo. More so than for Donna and the boy. Stephen King should of used another kind of dog instead, like a pitbull"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cujo a killer dog","review":"I thought Cujo is a great book but is more for 8th graders and higher because of the content. ON the other had it is a great book and Stephen King is a great writer and describes everything very closely. He must take a lot of time writing books for all the descriptive details. I think I will want to read his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best to be read with a 2 pots of coffee","review":"Like most people, I think, I read this book long after I saw the movie. Though I can't really remember what the movie was like, I wish I could forget the book just the same. This has to be the biggest let-down of all the books I've read from King. I only finished it because I had already commited myself after the first few hundred pages. It started out really great, but it kept dragging on....and on.....and on..... Sorry Stephen, but you could have scratched all the boring character backgrounds- job/life/relationship crap and focused more on Cujo and his little problem. You could have done all this and put it in Skeleton Crew or Night Shift as a short story. I also expected way more horrific attacks from Cujo. The whole (being trapped in the car) scene was way too drawn out and the ending sucked big-time. If your looking to read a good novel about a dog, read \\"Benji\\"....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"Cujo wasn't a good book. King had a good idea about a rabid dog, but he limits his attacks. I expected Cujo to have a rampage through Castle Rock and attack many people. Instead, he limits it to just 3 or 4 people. And half the novel is spent with other charactors and places. Cujo is alright for a light read or if nothing else is availible, but The Green Mile and Diffferent Seasons are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up 2 expectations","review":"Cujo started out as an interesting book with it's frightening parts, but as the book went on, Stephen King seemed 2 have lost his writing passion and the rest just wasn't scarry and was somewhat boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Scanned Kindle Edition","review":"The content of the book is terrific ... having read a hard copy years ago I know this. Unfortunately this Kindle version was poorly scanned and not properly edited for scanning errors. I have only read the first few chapters and it is hard to follow at times with the errors. Hopefully the publisher will correct these problems soon and let us know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like the movie!","review":"Cujo has got to be the source of most fears of dogs... And for good reason. After you're done reading this book, never again will you want to go near a Saint Bernard (or any other wrongly termed dog) again! Or at least for a long time. The biggest plus to the book besides the movie is not having to hear the kid screaming and crying all the time (I think). That just got way too irritating for me. As with all books, Cujo went into more details than the movie, you learn more about the characters and what thoughts are running through their heads. To run or not to run... etc.~Natalie Kilpatrick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn yamn yawn ...","review":"Sorry; I'm one of those who'll pick up a book by an author I like and read it regardless of the order the books were published. I read this one AFTER Gerald's Game, and thought at first that there would be similarities; you know, like a slow build up to an extraordinary ending and just an overall tremendous satisfaction. But it wasn't! Cujo bites, if you'll forgive me! I'm still trying to figure out the relevance to the opening \\"monster in the closet\\", and the book changes scenery and thickens plot about as much as a first grade level story book (See Cujo run, See Cujo jump and bite that guy's head off ... end of story!). The only thing that added weight to my star-rating was the intricate channel King took through the mind of the dog (an interesting, King-like sentiment). So, if you're looking for a quick, blah, single-very-visible point read, this is King answering your plea. If you're looking for a typical fulfilling King novel, try firestarter or something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror was OK but story line for it was bad","review":"The story was damn dragging with family ties and business prospects brought in meaninglessly. I couldn't find the relation between Frank Dodd's monster, the boy's dreams and Cujo. Only part I felt like reading was from when the mother and the child were trapped in the Pinto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storyline All Over the Place","review":"I find some of King's works hit or miss. Cujo was a big miss for me. The story line was all over the place. The main story line focused on the rabid dog, but there were sub plots that I fealt had little to do with the story if anything at all. It was a miserable reading experience to get caught up with the trapped duo in the car being terrorized by Cujo, then the story cuts over to the husband's business trip. It had me thinking, \\"What? Why? Who cares?\\". There's a slimeball character in the story also, but why he was in there, I don't know. The whole thing seemed hodge podge and vast parts irrelevant. I just couldn't finish it, I skimmed the last third of the story.I tend to like King's longer books like \\"It\\", \\"Under the Dome\\", and \\"The Stand\\". I've been disappointed before by some of his short stories and shorter novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak sauce","review":"Cujo is definitely my least-favorite King book except for \\"Under the Dome\\". Way too much in-depth detail on characters that don't matter, not enough actual flesh to the story. Wish I'd skipped it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cujo","review":"Typical Early King, less (but not insufficient) character build up and more of both, suspense and action. I have to say it is the suspense that increases the most and therfore carries the book while the 'sitting on the edge of your seat' action is not quite there. I didn't feel the goosebumps or even the outright fear I have felt in several of his other books.

In the book there are too many loose ends in it. What happened to the guy she had an affair with? What happend to the woman and her son and their aunt? What about the two men who Cujo killed before he found the Pinto? What about the cop Cujo killed. What happened to the husband and wife after their only son was dead?

The last half of the book always kept you on your seat always wanting to know what was going on with each character and how they would react to what happened. I would definetly say it was a good book and I would recommend it to many people.

To my surprise, this book isn't like that at all!! King is much more creative and realistic than that!This book is actually far more psychological than action oriented. Even though it is relatively short, there are numerous intriguing subplots in addition to the main plot.As with all King books, the characters are very well developed. We really feel for the main characters. Even Cujo, the dog, is well developed and in the end King finds a way to make us feel sorry for him. As for Kemp, *shivers*, King really knows how to make us hate a character.This book is scary to begin with, but what makes it even more frightening is the fact that this situation could actually happen to any one of us.An excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"positively nail biting!

HYDROPHOBIC TERROR AT ITS BEST!","review":"To say this book is not good by comparing to other King's books like the masterpiece IT, is quite unfair. This book really gets to you. It is very impressive the way King actually puts you in the mind of Cujo, and what's more, you know that you can understand that the dog never wanted to be evil, so that makes it even more frightening. This is a must read by King. Somewhere in the cover you read that the book really hits the jugular: it actually does.

All SK's books are about the horror experiences even the average person experiences, whether by werewolves, vampires, or just the people next door, or in ones own family.

That's dog talk for \\"boring.\\"","review":"I have come to expect more of Stephen King.Cujo (the book) was disappointing and boring.This isn't horror. This is crud.What's the point of a mean and rabid Saint Bernard? It's like a having a live and biting doormat. What's the point?What else can I say? Stephen King blew it withthe movie,too. The book stunk,the movie stunk.A package deal.Don't waste your money and time with Cujo"},{"rating":"2","title":"An actual page turner","review":"Now I know what you're thinking. You've read all the books that say \\"Page turner\\" and \\"Cannot put it down\\" on the back cover and gotten bored or tired half the way through. This is not one of those books. It is a kick in the balls from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Otherwise engrossing book is brought down by boring subplots","review":"After hearing about how scary and suspenseful Stephen King's books are supposed to be, I decided to check one out and see. Apparently I picked the wrong one.In fact, it was so boring in the beginning and throughout most of the book that the only thing keeping me from putting it down was the threat of a failing grade in my English class. Just the exposition of the book seems to last 300 pages. And on top of that, it is filled with useless and uninteresting side stories that don't all fit together but instead give the book the feeling of being either unfinished or un-edited. The only redeeming quality of the book is the last part where the woman and her son are trapped in their broken-down Pinto for days by a rabid Saint Bernard. Personally, I thought the movie was much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic tale of terror!","review":"Cujo is perhaps not King's best novel but it is definitely an enjoyable and frightening read. King sticks to more realistic terrors in this story of a St. Bernard who contracts rabies and terrorizes a woman and her young son, keeping them trapped in a car that refuses to start for several agonizing days in sweltering summer heat. King shows us not only Donna and Tad Trenton's horror at being held \\"hostage\\" but also lets us into Cujo's own mind, showing us his confusion and sickness. One feels almost sorry for Cujo and we get a glimpse of him not as a monster as Donna and Tad come to see him but rather as the sick and suffering creature that he is. Even though you feel some of Cujo's emotions, you will keep turning pages to see if Tad and Donna will survive their ordeal. Definitely worth reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with Typos","review":"Cujo is classic Stephen King and ordinarily I'd give it four stars, but this ebook version is so riddled with typos it takes away from the enjoyment of the story.Typos like the frequent \\"Vie\\" for \\"Vic\\" and \\"rll\\" for \\"I'll\\" and \\"Helpl\\" for \\"Help!\\"The book appears to have been converted digitally via OCR and then badly proofread. You'd expect a major publisher to take more care with its ebooks than this. It's an embarrassment to Signet / New American Library / Penguin Group (US)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cujo","review":"Overall Cujo was an extremly wellwritten novel.Using an amazing mixture of hope, suspense, and fear, the author(Stephen King) creates an exterordinary tale of a dog that terrorizes a town.The dog (Cujo) obtains rabies from a bat and immedietly shows signs of being rabid. The author portrays what is happening while he is going through the changes that any rabid animal would go through, making the story easier for young people to take in.I do not recommend this book to anyone who is below the age of 12 or has a soft spot for dogs. Cujo is a book that anyone from ages 12 to 100 will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Won't Put It Down.","review":"I love Stephen King; to use his term, I am a Constant Reader.

I was completely entertained and on the edge of my seat the entire time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites from King....","review":"This is one of my favorite novels from King. The plot is pure genius...a gentle, loving family dog that gets rabies from some bats...then unwillingly turns into a savage monster. I myself am a dog-lover, throughout the book -- I had alot of compassion for Cujo...he was a victim of a terrible disease -- not a cold blooded killer. It's weird to have compassion for the humans and the dog --- this is not a novel with a clear-cut good guy vs. bad guy. I guess it is just part of King's genius. This book is fairly fast-paced....the only part of the novel that bored me a little was the whole \\"Vic/Roger -- Rasberry Zingers/Advertising job troubles\\" subplot. The last 100 pages are some of the most intense pages I have ever read. I want a St. Bernard :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all good horror is supernatural.","review":"Read this book in paperback before I saw the movie, and at first was kind of put off that a horror story was based on rabies. Then I got into the book and loved it. Cujo is a Saint Bernard and a good dog, until he gets rabies, after which he changes into a rabid killer. A woman and her child are trapped in their Pinto when it won't start (kind of creepy when I was reading the book since I also had a Pinto). Cujo is a masterful story of man's best friend turning into his worst nightmare, killing his owner and terrorizing some visitors. I think it was one of King's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This was the fourth book I read by Stephen King and to put it mildly, it was a disappointment. Actually, reading it was like getting your teeth pulled out by a tow truck with no novicane.

I read The Stand, The Shining, and Misery before this one, I was actually angry that Stephen King could produce such a .... I would rather read the phone book then attempt to read this book again.

Stephen King says he can't remember writing this book; that explains it! King was so piss drunk that he forgot to add important things in his novel like reader interest...In the beginning, King adds a connection to The Dead Zone, making this seem like it would be an interesting read. Wrong. Cujo is a stunningly simple character, with him being good and then he becomes rabid and kills one kid. Whoo! This book is one of his shortest, but it's also one of his most boring. I do not recommend this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well done Mr King","review":"This was my first Stephen King book that I attempeted to read and I must say it was very interesting. Thank you so much Mr King. Thanks for writing a book that completely wasted my time and filled my mind with something far worse than suicide - BOREDOM. And why name the book Cujo, when the story doesn't even revolve around the fat two-hundred-pound dog anyway? What further irritated me was the fact that the book dragged. If Mr King used this slow-revealing technique to build up some suspense, then I'm sorry, it failed badly. The only thing that it succeeded in doing was to prolong the torturous agony of reading such stupidity.

I love this short, because it's excellent from beginning to end. A very fast-paced short, and Curly's at his best in the marching scenes. The ending with the boys being blown with laughing gas is the most funniest and outrageous Three Stooges ending ever. I never get tired of this.MUTTS TO YOU (1938) is a bad short. I never really liked any of the \\"baby\\" shorts the boys did, and that goes for this one as well. There aren't a lot of funny scenes, and for the most part, it's a pretty boring short.WHAT'S THE MATADOR? (1942) - A pretty good short.

The quality of the sound is AMAZING but the new transfer is a bit shoddy and there a times when the image looks \\"digital\\".. gone is the dreamy soft quality of the previous releases. Also, I am a bit confused by the release order on these discs. The Pioneer releases are in chronological order.. these new volumes are not. And there is hardly any written info included with these disks.. the copy on the back of the DVD case is mere filler regarding Judy's life.. nothing regarding the show.

My 5 year old son was very interested in clocks so I decided to introduce the concepts by ordering this video along with a Mini Judy clock for him to learn on.

Isn't part of the fun and impetus in learning a foreign language conversing with others? You don't even get to the past tense until 200 pages into the book.

On closer examination, one realizes that it is a cannibalization of what must have been a more comprehensive textbook. The cannibalization was done in a haphazard way that left out things that are essential and included things that are less essential, at least for a basic knowledge of the language. For example, there is a detailed chapter on the subjunctive mood, but completely absent is the imperative. This would be like learning English in such a way as to allow you to say, \\"It is necessary that he be there,\\" but to leave you clueless as to how to say \\"Come here.\\" Also absent are the present perfect and past perfect tenses, as well as the future and the conditional.

This is not hyperbole. Some would find this work to be dry, but it isn't intended for popular entertainment. Through all the editions it has remained a meticulously researched piece about that most famous, or infamous, of Roman institutions-the Legion. If one is looking for a light read, the equivlant of the college survey class, then don't read this book.

Ran it again the day after Christmas and it started to run shaky, erratic and hesitant. Ensured the track was clean and ran my other trains to ensure it was not a track issue which it was not. Afterwards this train continued to give me even worse problems. Great paint job, just very dissapointed in the operation. I am calling Bachmann to see what they will do for me. I have not even had a chance to mail the warranty card yet!

I usually only notice it when it is going very, very slowly or after it has stopped.Mine came dead on arrival, but I took the cover off and tweaked one of the engine contacts and it worked just fine.

One small problem I had with the last bottle, was that it stop spraying near the end of the fluids.

The author exhibits knowledge of current scholarship in his treatment of the synoptic gospels, but does not apply the same standard to the Gospel of John, which he treats as authentic, or at least the most authentic of the four gospels. The same is true in his treatment of apocryphal literature, which were written later than the gospels. His preference for these writings over the synoptic gospels is unclear.The author's lack of source notes is irritating, especially considering the content of the book, which leads one to want to know more about the subject and the sources. Instead, he gives a list of source material at the end of the book.For a more scholarly analysis, I recommend Raymond E.

I absolutely love this cookware. It is truly no stick, and with proper care, should last a lifetime. I have used the saute and the dutch oven in my oven several times, and it is still like the day I bought it.Some non stick cookware gets sticky over time, and I hated that. This has not done that even owning it for 2 years now. The only piece I don't like is the extra that was included as a freebie when I bought this, but wasn't a part of this set. It was a saute with two helper handles (no long handle), and was much thinner than the rest of the pieces. That piece does not cook evenly, but I still use it as it's a good size and I like that there is not a long handle.I sometimes wish I could put this in the dishwasher, but I know it won't be a good idea.

I think they would be fine for a small family or someone who simply heats things up.I've only had them a couple weeks but the quality seems very good, the casting is heavier than last year and the teflon coating appears to be well done. Time will tell on teflon coating. The handles appear well attached and they are supposed to withstand up to 400 degrees which means, in my oven (which is brand new) you would have to set the heat at 350 or below.At this point, I feel pretty good about the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Quality, Good Value","review":"I've been cooking with this set for a couple of months now, so I can't speak to the long-term durability, but I have been impressed with the easy clean-up and ease of use. It is heavier than I enticipated, which makes it a little less user friendly for me, but may be an indication of higher quality. I bought this set to replace a \\"Duncan Hines\\" stainless steel set that I had owned since 1970! That one stood the test of time in my book, but handles had deteriorated and were not such that could be repaired or replaced easily. They held up well, cooked well and clean-up was not too bad, but this new set definitely beats the old for non-stick and clean-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Analon's home run","review":"Wow!

There is no sense of place. Powers usually makes you enjoy his locations and they become part of the story. Despite knowing the general location, there is not a single thing interesting about the location.2. Boring characters. Some of the Mossad agents are mildly interesting, but the protagonist and the villains are cardboard. I didn't care about them at all. I didn't even care who ended up victorious.3. Bad use of magical background. Time travel, other dimensions, psychics. Sounds good right? The Anubis Gates meets Last Call? Not even close. Everything is meagerly developed. Supposedly the bad guys want to become gods, but the whole thing is discussed in one or two paragraphs.4. Boring plot. There is no excitement, no sense of dread, no sense of wonder at all.Overall this book was a total dud compared to his other books. Good writing as usual, but not much else.Tim,What happened here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Days to Never","review":"I'm your run of the mill thriller reader and this is my first Tim Powers novel.

I finished it but had I had something else to read at the time I could just have as easily not botherd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"One of Powers' better books. As is typical of Powers' works, reality is underpinned by the supernatural and many apparently mundane events are actually manifestations of important supernatural events. As is usual, the heroes are ordinary, decent people propelled into bizarre events unwittingly and opposed by corrupt seekers after immortality or ultimate power. The plot of this book concerns ghosts, time travel, and efforts to control the future by manipulating the past. Characters include Albert Einstein and his illegitimate daughter, Charlie Chaplin, and agents of the Mossad. Like all of Powers' books, the basic plot is ingenious and echoes Shakespeare, in this case, The Tempest. The quality of writing and characterization is good. Enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Power to Him","review":"I really agree wiith the person who said it's tricky writing a review so soon after reading a Tim Powers book so I really won't.

I will give it 2 stars because of the originality in the contents and the characters; but at the same time this is what I also didn't like. I couldn't possibly imagine Einstein and Charlie Chaplin playing with the occult, the ghosts and the spirits. Why Grammar didn't destroy the machine years ago only to wait until now? And what of Lepidot and his premonitions? It seems to me that the author took a lot of time writing and narrating the first part of the book, only to wrap up the ending and make it a little confusing.

Along with his annoying girlfriend (Birds of Prey's Rachel Skarsten), Jack is taking night classes, but sadly his professor (genre stalwart Robert Englund) has accidentally unleashed a demonic force that is horribly transforming him, and soon enough it's up to Jack to put his rage to some monster-slaying use.

When his accidental plumbing job awakens monsters from their long sleep and they start attacking his night school college student buddies, Jack finds it in himself to figh off the monsters as a way of conquering his own personal demons.

It was very reminiscent of the Evil Dead movies; over-the-top blood & gore, thrills & chills, and raunchy humor throughout. What more could you ask for? The people behind the creation of this movie love this genre and it shows. They know how to stretch a dollar as well, as this movie looks a lot more expensive than it was. And they have Freddy Krueger, himself, Robert Englund! Hopefully, this is the first of many in a series of Jack Brooks' adventures!! I say order some pizza and invite over the friends to check this one out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ive ever seen.","review":"I thought the movie looked and sounded cool by the dvd case. But the acual movie sucked. Plot was horrible, the action was horrible, hardly any action...Bad acting. Movie straight up sucked. Dont wast your money or your time. Its long too, or at least it seemed long...really really bad movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Brook's Monster SUPRISE!!","review":"I was totally suprised at how good this movie was. It had some Evil Dead feel, not Ash just film feel. I don't usually purchase on the fly, but in this case I'm glad I did. The only flaw I see is the story is a really slow build, I see why (story and suspence) however it could have been cut down just a little, and the flow would have been awesome. I would chuck that up to every story has to have a begining kind of thing though. I would say if/when there is a sequal, the story should have a quicker flow, just my assumption.Robert Englund stole the show in my opinion. He was over the top and as I've never seen him. I'm glad that with the Elm Street remake and some else as Freddy, Mr. Englund is having fun.Highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A throwback monster bash from our Canuck cousins 3.5 stars","review":"For a low budget probably straight to video cash grab, JBMS succeeds surprisingly. The excellent looking rubber suited monsters coupled with the no-nonsense story and welcome sense of humor result in a very easy to watch and very short excercise in 80s style splatter. If you are a fan of Street Trash, The Hidden, and countless others then you should at least give this one a rental. Robert Englund is becoming the Boris Karloff of modern indie horror cinema and delivers the laughs along with a great characterization. The opening two scenes promise a little more than the 20 minute finale delivers, and certain moments (psychologist's office) slow down the proceedings a little bit. The cast performs capably and humorously, and the production values are just right. A slew of extras round out the nicely slipcased DVD from AB. If they make a sequel I would watch it for sure, as I found this to be a definite Halloween treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a great little booklet to read about emotional dependency. In our society we are fed lies about what love is and about what relationships should look and feel like. This booklet is jam packed with insights and truths about the way emotional dependency looks and feels. It's great for anyone who wants to understand relationship dynamics and to cultivate healthy relationships. It's especially good for counselors and counselees since emotional dependency is so common in the counselor/counselee relationship. One of the added bonuses about ordering this is that you get enough booklets to share with other people in need!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry but the CD is scratch","review":"El review lo voy a hacer en espanol porque me es mas facil.

The Rebel is written in Classic Melinda style. Quick and easy to read and very entertaining. As with all the Roswell books, it is Full of surprising twists, suspense, humour and romance. The Rebel brings Alex back to us and explores the emotions felt and expressed by each group member when Trevor is introduced as Michael's older brother from their home planet. Liz is definately not dealing well with Max's connection with the collective conscienceness and finds comfort in someone elses arms. Melinda ends The Rebel with her usual \\"cliffhanger\\".

Strange camera angles & director seems to have a thing about shoes.Many shots of shoes.No feet in them just a shoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I enjoy good photography, dogs and Greece has got to be one of the most photogenic places on earth. This book promised to be a great one but I found that ultimately I was disappointed. Although some of the pictures of the dogs were likeable, this book didn't really seem to bring out the beauty of the Greek Islands.Furthermore I found the author's attitude that somehow being a stray dog on a Greek Island is an easy and desirable existence to be naive and silly at best. Greece has a pretty bad record on animal welfare and I shudder to think how the dogs are really treated when not being photographed. Being homeless, hungry and subject to human abuse all the time is not a desirable situation for any animal, even on a fantastic Greek Island."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent belt","review":"I agree fully with the previous reviews. The belt is clearly of high quality and comes at a reasonable price. Also, wanted to mention the belt is 2.25\\" wide. The miniature Maglite holsters will just barely fit on it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Advertised","review":"My old belt has metal buckles and these are plastic.

I put this on over my pants regular belt and belt buckle adjusted (a lil looser) it and it was surprisingly comfortable I attached my paddle style holster to it and it felt like it wasn't even there! There was no dragging on my pants anymore, I no longer have to pull up my pants every 15 min and it detaches without almost ripping my undies off! Overall great buy solved all my hip concealment issues for one very fare price. I would buy it again and would recommend it to anyone with the same issues or looking for a impressive amount of bang for there buck"},{"rating":"1","title":"it looks cool.","review":"Ithought this was a regular belt and its super wide. WAY too wide to fit in my belt loops. other than that it seemed well made. IDK really, i only kept it for a day before sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"This is no fashion item, it's a belt for people who are getting things done...or at least planning to. The nylon material is thick and feels high quality, it's definitely very strong. The stout buckle clicks together assuredly and it doesn't seem like it will fail any time soon.The overall fit & finish of the belt is not perfect, but for under $10 I can't really complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"Good Product, Works as intended. Just fair warning, the buckles are plastic, but it is very sturdy. Attaches to the bottom of my Load Bearing Vest great, attached a drop leg hoster to it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke before I'd even gotten it on","review":"One of the snaps that hold the extra belt snug broke off when I first went to adjust the belt. This is obviously a very cheaply made item. Also the metal clips on the belt are loose and rattle, so if you wanted to have a belt that didn't jangle like you have a pocket full of loose change, this isn't the belt for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product for the price","review":"i love this and i would highly recommend it to anyone needing a sturdy, well constructed belt. unlike other web belts ive owned....it was a dream to adjust and when you snap the buckle together you *know* its secured. whoever designed this knew what the hell they were doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could put NO stars I would! TERRIBLE!","review":"Don't listen to those other reviews (they are obviously written by friends and family). After looking through several other books on Amazon related to the same topic, I was interested in this book because the reviews were so positive... but the reviews are highly misleading.This book felt dated and the material seemed to be focused more on what kind of online business to start as opposed to turning your retail business idea or store into a online store. The author is also from Singapore and often refers to businesses there. For someone in the States, I find it hard to relate.Anyway, I could go on and on in detail about the many reasons why this book was a complete waste of money, but I won't bother. Save your time and cash for something that's actually of value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Money","review":"This book is truly worthless. First, it's written in broken English. I know the author is not a native English speaker, but that's what editors are for! Reading all of the misspellings, grammatical mistakes and incorrect idiomatic expressions was like fingernails on a chalkboard. Additionally, the book is full of platitudes and generalizations - very little in the way of actionable, how-to advice. Lastly, I put the book down when I got to the chapter on E-Commerce Solution, where the author blatantly tries to sell you his home-made software. Effectively, you're paying for a thinly-veiled sales pitch. Don't fall for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst toaster ever","review":"I bought this toaster when I replaced my kitchen appliances and wanted all matching appliances. This toaster has wide slots and is no good for evenly toasting bread. My husband is not pleased and has threatened to throw it out and bring in our old (inexpensive) toaster that toasts evenly and will toast bagels as well as sliced bread. I love my Viking stove and fridge, but never would I buy the Viking toaster. I am now looking for something with a similar look that toasts evenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning -- arrived damaged -- no replacement","review":"Opened the package--which seemed sufficient--interior box in good shape--but the top of the toaster was dented. And Stainless Steel has brown spots on it. Appears that we got someone else's return. Amazon site would not allow us to order a replacement--return only. So, we will go to another retailer. From a distance the toaster looks great on the counter w/ our matching mixer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, Inventive, Different","review":"Lain gets better into cyberspace. It's almost dangerous for the little girl as she starts to abandon her physical self. \\"The Wired\\" offers some insight into the goings on of a twisted Nazi-like professors who prays on children and some Men-in- Black type antagonists who may or may not be these internet based Knights. The second installment of Lain gives us more of the stuff that makes Lain, for me, great animation. In story it's similar to Ghost in the Shell. The tone is almost like Neon Evangelon. There is, however, a distinct lack of overt, bash-you-over the head violence. There is action, but there are also deep themes at play. English band BOA provides killer opening music, and the production values are top-notch. A great departure from the girl with big guns and or breasts that has become standard issue in Japanese animation. I can't wait for the next set of episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sci-fi mind trip","review":"This collection of the 5th-7th layers (episodes) of the outstanding Japanese series Lain is one wild ride. It's a mind-bending trip that defies reality as we know it. As we learn more about the wired, and how Lain seems have a very important - and mysterious - part to play in the convergence of real life and the wired, we are taken on a journey that makes us question our own existence. I give it two thumbs up, four stars, and a big giant \\"Wahoo!\\" (Now I just need to see the first four layers...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little off, but still great","review":"The first volume of Lain was really well done with moments of different placing. However, there wasn't much of it in this volume. The first episode deals with Lain's sister. Is there two of her? Yes, but which one is real and whats the point of it? The second episode opens up questions as Lain talks with the creator of 'kids'. A special program that has something to do with those children. The last episode was a little off base, but necesesary. Those men with the red lasers are actually helping Lain and want to find out more about her. There was some nice realistic virtual graphics in the last epsiode and Lain is actually now fully aware of the wired (Just look at her room). At first I kinda hated this volume, but then I looked back on it and said 'Hey, that was cool! Why didn't I notice that?'. I guess thats just the way Lain is. It is grows on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous, limited, and confusing anime ...","review":"This series, about a girl on the 'wired' (internet of sorts) finding intrigue and danger, is far from intriguing or dangerous. The animation is minimal and choice of shots inadequate to maximize storytelling without animation. Perhaps one of the greatest problems is the limited story carries on for far too many episodes. The coloring is too bright too often which makes the different animation levels pop out against each other in an awkward way. All the drawings are crisp and well constructed, and the designs are decently pleasing. For this price, I wouldn't recommend 'Lain'...perhaps if twice as many episodes were per DVD it would be a favorable purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic Messiah","review":"I needed a new score for Handel's Messiah, that I'd sung over forty-five years ago. I'm delighted to find it's available and as I remember it. It's a classic and it feels so good to see that it still exists and hasn't been made \\"new & improved\\" as so many things are. (See the Episcopal Church, for example... )"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Messiah: An Oratorio Complete Vocal Score","review":"I want to commend the shipper who sent this to me swiftly. It is a pleasure to listen to the CD following the music. I began to see patterns in the composition of the music that corresponded to the scripture cited that I had not been sensitive to before. When singing a part in this music, it is easy to get so focused on one's own part that one misses the fact that the notes themselves weave a tapestry on the page and to the ear that tell a story as rich as the verse.Schirmer's Edition is easy to work with and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Higher 'Messiah'","review":"This Schirmer edition of Handel's Messiah is among the better chorus/piano editions I've seen. It maintains loyalty to the original piece, presenting it in the classical format. At the same time, I find the text easy to read, and the overall size of the book to be just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Piano Score of Handel's Messiah'","review":"This is pretty much the standard 'Messiah' piano/vocal score used in America. I've been using a copy of this edition for nigh on twenty years and it's gotten plenty of use; it is sturdy enough that it shows no sign of falling apart. The printing is clear and easy to read. There is no distracting German text as in some editions. The piano reduction is good and fairly easy to play. And the price is certainly right.Scott Morrison"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly printed score","review":"This edition of Handel's Messiah is easy to read for both singer and accompanist. It is easy to follow because each voice has its own line. Each aria is listed by voice. The choruses begin on separate pages and the bars are numbered for easy reference for vocalist and choirs to learn. It is a pleasure to use. I have recommended it to others who want to learn the Messiah. It is a permanent part of my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality, Prompt delivery","review":"I ordered two copies December 9th so my wife and I could participate in the annual free Messiah Sing-Along here in town ([...]).
