In the '80's, they wore peasant blouses and wrote and recorded a trememdous number of songs about restless ghosts-- WITHOUT A SINGLE HINT OF SELF-DEPRECATING IRONY! If you can look past that and listen to the Klaxon with an open mind, you'll find an angsty, melancholy treasure that evokes imagery of dark mills, tired souls, and lost loves. Forget that \\"Oooh, look at me, I'm a vampire\\" crap -- this is goth from scratch, fresh from the kitchen the way your mom used to make it. AATT's best album, IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nadia saga goes to hell","review":"In the past 2 weeks, I watched every dvd of the Nadia series and just finished with the motion picture today. I loved the series UNTIL the ripoff motion picture.I agree with all the other reviewers' negative comments. The makers of this film insult the fans of the series.Here are the biggest things offensive about this movie:1. First third are scenes from the earlier episodes. Total waste.2. Opening credits and song vastly inferior to the tv show.3. Nadia left Jean and became a gofer for a newspaper???? Huh???? After almost being ruler of Atlantis she becomes that?4. Grandis, Samson, & Hanson turn against Jean and are thugs again?5. No Marie, King, or any of the Nautilus crew?6. Villian so dull. Gargoyle 1,000,000 times more interesting.7. Terrible story.8. At end of film, Nadia again leaves Jean???!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than you think","review":"I think I found out the problem with this movie. No one thinks first before watching it. This movie really takes place in 1893, not after 1902,so this is actually before Nadia anf Jean get married. So, i Bet Nadia feels more independent when she marries.Anyway this movie is actually pretty good it has a surprise ending and the songs in the film are great (get the soundtrack) So please, before you watch this , think first.

This book by Tom Filsinger, the creator of the card and dice game, is a truly indepth look at the creative mind at work.Tom is a psychology professor and a game creator. So he wrote a book about the psychology of creativity. Tom describes his creativity process and how he got started creating a universe set in the future with wrestlers from different races across the galaxy.You will see what makes his imagination go and his philosophy on the subject. His genuine love for creativity and belief that it must be cultivated in all children is very evident.It is a very easy and fun book to read. Having played the game or even being a wrestling fan is not required. When you're finished you may find out that you too are a Dark Menace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into Imagination","review":"This is a great read for fans of Tom Filsinger's Champions of the Galaxy game.

(1999's \\"Dark Side of the Spoon\\"), Tapes of Wrath is a must have for any and every Ministry fan. The only downside is that there are absolutely no extras whatsoever, which isn't surprising considering this was more than likely a quick cash in attempt by Warner Bros. before subsequently dumping the band from the label. Despite that, all the videos one would expect, such as \\"Stigmata\\", \\"Burning Inside\\", \\"Jesus Built My Hot Rod\\", \\"N.W.O.\\", \\"Just One Fix\\", and \\"Reload\\" are here, as well as the videos for \\"Crackin' Up\\" and \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\\" from the Ministry side project the Revolting Cocks. All in all, even though there is no extra material to be found on this DVD, Tapes of Wrath is still a must own for Ministry fans one and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ministry FANS will love this DVD","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD. I've been a Ministry fan from first listen and this brings back memories of Al with his not-so-tough persona and lots of guts in music. Of course its not a complete story because it does exclude the earliest and the latest stuff, but Al and Paul are the first to admit their embarrasment with their first album and Dark Side of the Spoon wasn't out yet. Any real Ministry fan won't gripe about the production value of the DVD or lack of extras because most of this music isn't about being perfectly clear, its about being out there. This is straight forward Ministry. Enjoy Fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tapes of Trash!","review":"This is quite possibly the WORST DVD in my collection. Stereo Sound (What happened to Dolby 5.1?), poor visuals (but that was expected), absolutely NO EXTRAS... I will definitely think twice before purchasing ANYTHING further from Ministry, which is really unfortunate, as they used to be one of my favorite bands. The REVCO vids at the end was the sole nice touch to an otherwise unfortunate purchase. This DVD makes me really wonder if a REVCO DVD were to ever come out&#65533;would I purchase it?...see if you can borrow it from a friend or rent it, because it isn&#65533;t worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ministry-Tapes of Wrath","review":"Why does Ministry continue to try to pretend that their first few albums don't exist? This is their best stuff! Before they got all whacked-out, their first few albums contained some GREAT music - Work For Love, Everyday is Halloween, etc. Now they just pretend that \\"must have been a different band\\" and try to distance themselves from it. How come? They USED to make some GREAT music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth buying!!","review":"This video collection is awesome..something I have been waiting for quite some time. The quality and sound is more than I expected...I was not disappointed...in watching the videos I could see the stages in which Al mutated beginning with Over the Shoulder in the mid 80's up to Bad Blood in the 90's and beyond...in listening and watching this DVD, you simply must turn up your home theater system and wake up the neighbors, in addition to popping open some brewskis! I did!! A real must have for the Ministry fan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ok video","review":"I liked \\"Since you didn't feel like showing up\\" much better.

I think Al Jourgenson has made some of the most original music ever made. (This is hidden from view by the hardcore image the group has.)But the videos are... well, basically I think that if you hired a random film school student and turned him loose with some concert footage and a random video clip archive, you'd probably get some better videos. I honestly don't understand what they are doing. All of it is violent, underexposed, handheld footage from documentary TV, cut together seemingly with little system or idea.It is not *all* bad. \\"Just One Fix\\" for instance is genuinely frightening. But what is a closeup of writhing maggots doing in \\"Lay Lady Lay\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book for a beginning","review":"After going over this book and CD many times I took the 216 test.

All chapters have sections that have screen shots and how to instructions. However, if you are trying to pass the 70-217 you need more than step by step how to instructions. You need answers to why something works, and this book does not provide those answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the book, you'll love the movie...","review":"Some people, unfortunately, have a difficult time with Sendak's subject matter (as is reflected by the mixed reviews below). All I can say is that the movies are very nice adaptations of the books. True, the animation and voiceovers are somewhat unelegant, but my two children (Boy-4, and girl-2) loved the books and now watch the DVD with great pleasure.If the kids don't have a problem, perhaps the grownups should learn to lighten up a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Performance","review":"I found Peter Schikele's music and narration of \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" jarring.

Really don't know about this one.","review":"This book has a very promising plot, but what would have been a unique, insightful view of relationships (romantic and otherwise, gay and otherwise)is really undermined by humor that falls short of its mark--and not to mention an annoyingly self-satisfied main character, who goes through the entire story learning absolutely nothing from his experiences. Isn't change what fiction is all about? It doesn't happen here; no one undergoes even a smidge of self-discovery. If anything, the only thing that changes is the living arrangements. What's the moral then? That gay men are sex-starved and one-dimensional?

Several friends recommended it, it seemed like a good and fun topic, and yet I could not make it past chapter 4. Rettenmund's writing style reminds me of the articles you read in the Sunday magazine section of your newspaper: The articles go on for pages and pages to say something that could be said in two paragraphs.

Personally it drove me crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting","review":"It is too bad amazon.com does not offer \\"0 stars\\" as an option...the average above would be lower.

This book nearly killed it. The writing was awful and the characters were horrible. I felt really bad for Matthew Rettenmund's thesaurus because I'm sure it was mangled by the time he got through with writing this book. The book was full of unrealistic dialouge and painfully unwitty and unfunny observations. The main character was frustratingly arrogant and unbearable.

People need to be warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I loved this book! Even though I don't have much else to base it against, I thought it was great!

I have had several compliments, and when I tell friends how inexpensive they were, they are all surprised! I would give it five stars, but the only complaint I have is that each of the table parts are labeled with stickers...they didn't peel off nice and clean, and it took me a while to get the last remnants of sticker shreds off each piece.

I bought the Philly playoff game where Mario scores 5g and 2a. The one I wanted the most isn't on here. It's when Mario scores in every possible way during a N.J. game. I don't understand why no history of the team as a whole like the NFL discs I have. This doesn't cover the whole history before Mario. Not a complete edition but a must if you don't have.

It's a shame there aren't any games from the pre-Lemieux Pens, and I really wish Game 1 from the 1992 Stanley Cup finals was included with the Pens comeback from 0-3 and 1-4, Mario's bank shot off Belfour's leg, Jagr's fantastic goal, and Mario's game-winner with seconds left. I don't think that was even an option on the online poll to determine the games. I'd also love to see more of the Jagr-led Pens, no matter how out of favor he is now with some Pens fans. 10 games just isn't enough-the only solution is more DVDs of great Pens games!"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Greatest games... you decide.","review":"First of all I would like to say as a Penguins fan it's always nice to have games with super stars like Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr on hand to watch when you feel like it. It's great to be able to have old great matches on DVD (my VHS recordings of vintage games have been ruin by fungus).10 Greatest Penguins games? Well, I don't know about that because I can recall matches in the past that I would of like to see on this DVD set... for example, the 1992 playoffs against the Bruins where Mario had 2 awesome goals, and Jagr did this back-handed goal by extending both arms to the opposite side of the net (if I remembered correctly).Well anyway, it's still a good DVD set to have. One set of DVDs where you can watch legends like Lemieux and Jagr... and upcoming greats like Crosby and Malkin.Maybe I'm just asking for too much..."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor choice of games","review":"I was looking forward to buying this, but must say how disapointed I am in the game selection. There are only 3 games on there worthy of consideration, with several obvious poor choices. The 4 overtime game againts the capitals? who wants to sit through that? Your kidding me, right? Marios comeback from retirement? Surely there are better choices. The Francis goal against the rangers that saved the series and game 1 from the 92 finals are clearly much more exciting games than either of those.

Having also been a student of Kuniba, I see a large number of inconsistencies in the text and illustrations.Craig's general info is very good regarding sword nomenclature and philosophy, however, so I consider it a decent addition to any library concerning Japanese Swordsmanship, as long as the reader is aware of some of the drawbacks regarding Mugai-ryu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I found this book to be informative, and well done.

The first story was nice and contained and ended with a definitive note. The second ended with hope, but not finality. I really hope that the second story, which is a sequel to a story from Pardox I, gets continued someday in some way because I want those 2 main characters from those 2 stories to have a chance to find each other again. If you like fantasy stories, these should be right up your alley. I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that. I say that if you liked Paradox I, you will probably like Paradox II. Have at it because I don't think you'll regret it. The only thing I didn't really like had nothing to do with the stories themselves. This book has no chapter demarcations and I prefer a Kindle book to have them as it makes knowing how far along you are easier than simply going by locations and the percentage."},{"rating":"1","title":"No benefit...potential hazards","review":"I am a physician( M.D.)starting my fourth bottle of this product, which I started on the advice of my physician brother-in-law.

After 4 days of two pills two times per day, as recommended, I was in pain. Not just the gastrointestinal stuff that others have mentioned, I also had horrendous pain in my upper legs and knees. Pain to the point that I was in tears. Originally I took the product for pain in my hip where I am arthritic. After going on line and reading the reviews posted here, I decided not to take Move Free anymore. Lo and behold, the leg pain was gone in 24 hours, as quickly as it appeared.

Be sure and let the batteries drain completely once a month or the recharge will be useless. Try to find a replacement battery. I did after emailing several companies.

I got it back, fixed.The indiglo feature broke AGAIN this week. Also I had to replace the band last week as it essentially fell apart, but I wear this watch every day. This is common for a cheapo leather strap so you can't hold that against Timex.I guess if you want a throw away watch and don't care about the Indiglo feature, go ahead, buy.If you want something to last for years like I did, and you really did care about being able to tell time in the dark, move on!UPDATE (6/20/12): This thing is WORTHLESS - I now have to reset the time every week or two as it seems to lose about 3 minutes a week.

Be AWARE this is not a FAMILY FRIENDLY DVD in my opinion. I was looking forward to something like Wallace and Gromit, Chicken Run, etc, but this one should have been rated at the very least PG-13. I turned it off after the first few minutes watching with my 8 and 10 year old boys. I did not care for the manner in which the female reindeer were animated, a bit of language, and the more adult situations with a party and Santa BBQing in an apron that looks like a lacy g-string. Just be careful if your plan is to purchase and view with children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbie the Reindeer...","review":"I do NOT like this video.

We actually like \\"The Lost Tribe\\" better than \\"Hooves\\"; it is wackier and has more action - and Vikings! Blitzen's evil is delightful; his comparison of power and toast just cracked me up! There's more than a hint of Monty Python about \\"Lost Tribe\\" (the Viking flashback sequences are a key example).We found the US voice versions really flat and always listen to the UK versions; I think that the US version was done so that American audiences would have voices that they recognized, but Jane Horrocks' voice beats Britney Spears' voice hands down!One note - neither of the stories is actually about Christmas, but they ARE about reindeer and the North Pole. Our two year old loves the films, and we like them quite well, but what you think of them will depend on what you were expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the US Voice Overs??","review":"This is a fantastic short that I've seen before on TV and thought wow I'll buy the DVD. No real regrets but what a shock and disappointment I got when I noticed a distinct change in voice overs. What they've done is taken away those wonderful characterful voices from the original and dubbed over weak and uninvolving American voices. Who do we think we are changing something this good just because they are not home grown accents. This is arrogant and to be frank all I dislike about this great but often self-centered country of ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be sure to switch to UK vocal track","review":"This show is much more enjoyable if you go to the menu and choose UK Vocal Track. It is not a children's show but rather reflects quirky British humor. Akin to Wallace and Gromit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch all the way!","review":"By far the most enjoyable incarnation of Burn Up. If you were let down by the amazingly bad wrap up of the Burn Up W series, don't shy away from Excess. No previous knowledge of the Burn Up universe is required, but it certainly doesn't hurt. The storyline from Burn Up W continues into Excess, but-- again, no previous knowledge is required.The animation is excellent. Flawless. Spectacular direction and execution. Character designs have been tweaked and the series has a much more \\"serious\\" feel to it. If you think you'll miss the silly humor of the Burn Up W episodes, you may want to try before you buy.As for the rest of us... Excess is dead-on. A very strong set of episodes. Extras are solid.

My view is that he provides a fair and balanced view of historical developments in the area and the problems that need to be resolved. Like in any relationship it comes down to respect and trust, not an easy thing to achieve between two parties with such a history of hatred and suspicion. Still, in spite of the obvious difficulties Carter remains an unwavering optimist, a man of faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words of Truth about the Apartheid in Palestine - by a high IQ President","review":"President Carter, known to have one of the highest IQ's among all American Presidents, has written his book after years of experience in the Political field and international arena. His book serves as an eye opener to all those who really want to know what's happening in the occupied territories, looking at the events in the Middle East through the eyes of an American icon who had earned the confidence of the American people and was elected as their President.AIPAC, the Jewish lobbies, and their repesentatives in the Congress and American Mainstrean Media are always quick to slam the book and accuse it of anti-semitism before even reading it; a very-well known accusation.I invite all educated, honest, peace-loving people to read this book who was written by a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant American, not a Middle-Eastern, to learn some elements about the truth of the conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"As a U.S. Marine having served in the region, and a student of history, I was pleased to finally read a historically accurate account of Israeli's atrocities committed. After reading many of these reviews, it is clear to see that there are certain Zionist fanatics who believe they have a biblical birthright to the disputed territory. It is sad to see the disregard for the Palestinians, and the cause for a Palestinian state. President Carter's book gives a good account, provokes insightful discourse, and lays out many important facts. Bravo, Mr. President. I just hope we can achieve peace in that area before the U.S. military is forced into more engagement due to Israeli arrogance and ignorance. As a soldier and citizen of the United States, I have taken a vow never to pick up my rifle for Israel. Note-I didn't say Jewish or Jew-I said Israel, so don't label me as an anti-Semite, as my mother is Jewish, and my sister-in-law, an Israeli born Jew, does not agree with Israeli incursions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diferent Viewpoint","review":"President Carter certainly brings a different overall picture of the problematic middle east. It seems that all of the information we get leans toward the Israeli side, whereas, Mr. Carter shows a more balanced view of the situation. A view that brings forth some justifyable reasons of why the palestineans have to fight the way that they do. I do not understand why our government doesn't push for a more equal give and take from both sides instead of being so one-sided with the Israeli's."},{"rating":"2","title":"courage too late","review":"When the isreal amen corner comes out against a book full force by a former presdient, who was very subservient to israel, its apparent Mr. carter has used this as a form of contrition.

Too bad mr. carter, you allowed them to also run your foreign policy, see how grateful they are now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carter Airs his Amoral, Ahistorical Views","review":"Nothing can say more about this book than the company it keeps. Look at the books bought by people who bought this book and you see the strain of anti-Semitism throughout. Carter spreads the claptrap that the US is at fault for Palestinians strapping bombs on their children and the mentally infirm due to our support of Israel. He fails to make a connection between cause and effect -- ex: Israel building a fence causes suicide bombers, when it is clearly the bombers that created a requirement for the fence -- in an Orwellian explanation of past events that strip them of their true context to fit his world view. Don't waste your money on this book or the ones bought by its adherents."},{"rating":"1","title":"The BIG Lie BIG Time! Good reading for Jihadists.","review":"I am really surprised that Jimmy Carter was not out touting this book with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the recent Holocaust denial conference in Teheran.Our former president has finally gotten his licks in, and bared his anti-semetism for all to see.

That said, the book was about what I expected, not very well written, lacking in historical insight and chock full of unsupported opinions. Most offensive is Carter's insistance in portraying that Palestine was some kind of autonomous entity prior to the Balfour declaration and the subsequent establishment of the Zionist state when the British rule ended in 1948. In fact, what is commonly referred to as historical Palestine had been for centuries a serfdom controlled by generations of elite Syrian families such as the Husseini clan. This fundamental inaccuracy makes most of Carter's statements downright laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"You really have to wonder when a former President declares in this book that Israel first attacked Jordan in the Six Day War. Mr. Carter, it is undisputed fact that Israel pleaded with Jordan not to enter the war and that Jordan initiated hostilities by attacking Israel. Only one of many glaring mistatements of historical fact. Carter never mentions his book that his PAC The Carter Center took $10,000,000 from Saudi Arabia. Hmmmmm...You have to wonder why The Carter Center has never criticised the Saudis--one of the most rampant human rights violators in the world. Carter you are a despot and a weakling for refusing to debate Professor Alan Dershowitz on the truth of the factual basis for your book. For someone who wants to open dialogue on the Israeli-Palestinian issue, how come you--a former (thank God) U.S. President, are scared to debate your book???????????? Go back to Plains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and fair addition to the history of the Israelie Palestenian conflect","review":"This book is a great addition to anyone intrested in Human Rights, history and the Israeli Palestinian issue. Mr Carter did a great job in explaining the historical facts in a deplomatic way. Actually he was'nt at all harsh on Israel and its goverment he was just saying facts, since the history of the state of Israel is filled-up with bloodshed, ethnic cleansing and human rights violation. But as peace seeking person he avoided drilling down on these atrosities that were committed against Palestine and the Palestinine people.I beleive a former Presendent of the United States of America and a Noble Prize winner demands from us much more respect than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"President Carter's attempt for peace","review":"President Carter has written the history of our dealings with the Mideast problem. He writes that the problem is Israel and its refusal to honestly attempt a peace treaty with the Palestinians. Israel continues to build illegal settlements in the occupied territories and is now in what is a land grab by building a wall around the Palestinians.Carter exposes the power of the Israeli lobby that controls and intimidates our Congress and American news media.This is a must read book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bumbling, Stumbling Idiot Speaks Out","review":"Jimmy Carter, the worst President in this century has once again revealed his naive, dictator loving and semite stupidity..Do people forget that he opened the door for the Islamic Fascists in the Middle East by pulling the rug out from under the Shah of Iran..(who had his problems to be sure but was more modern and open minded than any other leader in the Middle East with the exception of Sadat)He left us with double digit inflation, interest rates and high unemployment...His foreign policy told the world that we were a paper tiger who could be pushed around...Now he embraces dictators around the world, praise Hamas and puts most of the blame on the ONLY democracy in the Middle East..What a guy, what a joke!...An American version of Neville Chamberlain (except that Chamberlain was not an anti-semite)Thank God for Ronald Reagan who repaired much of the damage done by this fan of fascists..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book full of lies by a failed president","review":"Nobody is mentioning the fact that the Carter foundation has been receiving millions from Saudi Arabia, and Jimmy admitted that he put millions in his private bank account. He had to do something to please his Saudi benefactors, hence this book. This book has been critisized extensively and there is little to add. Something not widely known is that as an ex president Carter has traveled all over the world for many years and always to the worst dictatorships, to kiss the asses of the worst murderers since the Nazis. And of course, he is an anti Semite, you just have to read between his lines. But he is also very stupid, if he thinks that he could discredit Israel and get away with it. The Jews are not weak any more, and when the time comes, they'll get rid of this miserable commie traitor and the other anti semite cowards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very regretful","review":"One would expect a better, more weighed aproach from Carter....Instead, he chose the easiest path - blame one side and get away with it.Not worth a penny, let alone the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall of a man's integrity","review":"Instead of doing what he's best at, bringing people together, we witness the fall of a man.

The elder Georgia statesman is still mentally in a pre 9/11 world. This book unfortunately shows his age and dated perspective, not the wisdom of a peacemaker in modern times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good companion volume for Mein Kampf - Mel Gibson stocking stuffer","review":"If this book is not an anti-semitic screed then I don't know what is. Carter obviously has a violent hatred for the Jewish people. Like most such types, he just does not have the courage to come out and say it. It's amazing the publisher actually went to press with a book with such a title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sadness","review":"No peace has ever been in the \\"holy land\\" nor will there ever be.

I had previously researched the Iraeali-Palenstian conflict years ago, so, I already knew the history. President Carter has showed his courage, love of both Israel and Palestine by writing this book. I beg you to read this book, and then research the conflict. Google the conflict. Carter is right on the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Jimmy Carter is a great humanitarian, Christian and scholar, but I was so disappointed in several of his statements in this book. I am a liberal Christian like Carter, but one who knows that what is going on between Palestine and Israel is not in the least like Apartheid in South Africa. I can only continue to pray that at some point Palestine's leaders will begin to truly negotiate for peace.

His book inappropriately inflames reader's thinking by detailing the difficulties born by Palestinians as a result of Israeli policies necessary to provide essential protection for its civilian population from the suicide bombers recruited, financed, trained, sent into Israel with murderous objectives, and then glorified at home. If Carter's intentions were truly to advance the process of coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians he would have provided a treatise for readers to appreciate the issues in the current situation filtered through a full account of ALL the facts on the ground and the history of what preceded them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misguided attempt at humor??","review":"I can't remember the last time I have read a book that is filled with more historical inaccuracies, and naive interpretations than this one. I truly hope that no one who reads Carter's book believes it to be factually accurate. There appears to have been little if any effort on Carter's part to take an objective look at the middle east & recognize the fact that the majority of Palestinians and Israelis are equally innocent pawns in a larger battle between extremist dictators (who have an interest in maintaining a volatile middle east) and democratic (predominantly \\"Western\\") leaders (who at least in recent years-- have been trying to get the darn crisis to end).Much like Carter's failed economic policies and past negotiations with the North Korean government --- this book is an unfortunate joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the man who helped Khomeini into power by doublecrossing the Shah...","review":"and now wants to bring the same trouble to Israel.

Current US foreign policy in regards to the region is simply an extension of right-wing Israeli policy. This has not worked thus far. Hopefully future US policy can be more impartial leading the road to peace. Bashing Carter's Presidency, former profession, et al is nothing but shooting the messenger and ignoring the facts on the ground. Until the moderates in all camps start to have more influence we will have nothing but more bloodshed. Imagine Northern Ireland with Ian Paisley calling the shots. Thankfully he is sidelined and there is peace. Thank you, Jimmy Carter, for having the courage to stand up to those whom the status quo is the only acceptable opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Carter, unlike most American presidents, is able to look past the views and opinions of mainstream American media. The negative reviews that have been written around Carter's book are clearly by upset, uncultured, and ignorant individuals that have never spent a single moment inside the occupied territories. Before you criticize Carter's book, go visit the region and see for yourself what has been happening to the Palestinians since Israel's inception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Republican salutes this american for not bowing to lobbyists","review":"Being a repuplican, I am proud of this ex president who contributes to restore the American image around the world.

I did not like his presidency, its legacy nor how he handled the Hijacking towards the end of his presidency.That saidI found this book to be the best, all around go-to book that explains EVERYTHING concerning Israel, its neighbors and the history of the conflict and how it leads up to today. Carter's bias is little and generally he gives both sides and history a very fair shake, so fair in fact that I have read many inflamatory comments and reviews that he is a Jew hater, israel hater or arab hater. This books sits next to The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt and a few books by Niall Ferguson in my library in my study.If you want a concise, fair and truely balanced view of what problems exist in the middle east then by all means read this book! He took pains to back every bit that he could with UN resolutions in his appedix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - Courage To State The Obvious","review":"Unfortunately, Carter is sure to be vilified for stating the obvious because the media bias will question his credibility and will call him biased at best and an anti-semite at worst. I thought the book was fair, balanced and thought provoking. You may not agree with all he has to say but you have to give him kudos for his courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating read","review":"i love reading books by this guy - the first candidate i volunteered for. in palestine peace not apartheid, president carter discusses the developments in israel and palestine. as only carter can, he offers first hand accounts of meetings and numerous events. these, for there own sake, are well worth the purchase of this book. carter has the courage to call a spade a spade and provides anecdotes for the reader to absorb and evaluate. not all that we have been told in the last 40 years is quite as it seems. if i had one wish, it would be that carter's book contained greater documentation, more analysis, in sum, greater scholarship. frankly, that level of devotion is rarely found in works by such individuals. he accomplished his objective in 200 pages, although i surmise it could fill thousands of pages. with recognition of its strengths and limitations, i believe that this is an excellent read, especially those of us on the west side of the atlantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Americans","review":"This book should be required reading for all Americans. Given our poor news coverage of middle eastern problems, the only way to become informed is to read books written by people committed to finding peaceful solutions through negotiations by both sides. This book gives a balanced and detailed analysis. Israel must return to the original 1949 boundaries and the Palestineans must be given a secure and economically viable state."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written, informative, and blunt","review":"I just finished reading it and thought that it was great. Mr. Carter does a great job of relaying his personal thoughts on the issue, from the perspective of a man who is arguably the most knowledgeable American on the subject. My only wish is that it would contain some context outside of his own observations, like reports in the news that could correlate with his insights.As someone who has not (yet) been to the Middle East, I can't imagine a better and more informative way to learn more.I wrote extensively on the subject here, including some favorite quotes:[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"It's funny how when a promising leader starts siding with the Palestinians, he's considered an anti-semite, bigot, racist, and many other different hateful terms.Yet when a book about Israeli rights, freedom, and zionism is published, it's factual, true, and moving.I say good job jimmy carter. continue to stand up for the true oppressed people of the middle east."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than Apartheid","review":"I read the whole book and in my opinion does not come close to the actual situation on the ground but it is a good starter for some one who is not familiar with the real situation.The book might get some negative reviews from people who have no clue or not been in that part of the world. The way of writing was very simple and easy to read.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is a Mess!","review":"Jimmy, who once dined in restaurants that were \\"white only\\" and did nothing in Georgia to change the \\"apartheid\\" during his lifetime, is now an \\"expert\\" on the middle east? I think Mr. Carter needs to return to \\"Israel 101\\" as he does not even have his facts correct. This man, wrote a book and is so beligerant about the questions on his sources that he refuses to respond. This is a work of a man who clarly is in cahoots with the radical Islamofacists and this is not a book that should be consider worthy of praise. In fact, it should be filed in the \\"fiction\\" section of the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage of Old Age","review":"In U.S., if one dislikes as much (or little) as the weather in Israel, is considered an antisemite. And any disagreement with official Israeli doctrine is ridiculed by purposely associating such disagreements with widely discredited hatred groups and individuals such as David Duke. The most vigorous criticism of the Carter's book comes (no surprise here!) mostly from the Jewish sources. They express an outrage in disputing copy rights of a map used in the book, but not a single fact presented by the author.The book is an eye opener for most Americans, who have seen the Israeli-Palestinian conflict filtered by skilful propaganda of our mass media that is heavily influenced by the Jewish lobby.Carter is old enough not to care any more about vicious attacks on his character by the media, which were inevitable to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"short, but good","review":"I think Carter did a pretty good job of explaining the situation, so if one is not familiar with it, it would be good to read. Also, the personal relationships he describes with other leaders, and trips to Israel and Palestine are very interesting.It is clear Carter has a very clear picture of Israel and sympathizes with Jews in all they've been through. What is interesting is that he , unlike most leaders, hasn't (at least since leaving office) used this as an excuse to go easy on them and allow them to escape criticism. He doesn't quite have the same sympathy with the Palestinian plight or understanding he has of Jews, but it is clear he has visited the Occupied Territories in a special effort to try and understand their situation better, which is far more than any leader has done."},{"rating":"2","title":"JIMMY HITS A MEGA BINGO, AND THE ZIONIST 'LOBBY' IS FLUMMOXED","review":"Go, Jimmy, go! It's about time that a major politico has had the guts to speak the truth about the ugly side of the Palestinian dispossession. As Norm Finkelstein has already noted elsewhere, Carter's book could have been even better, but as it is, it is still very good, well written and most useful. Carter's book title is most appropriate, as Israeli author Uri Davis also noted years ago when he wrote his revealing book, ISRAEL: AN APARTEID STATE. If the shoe fits, Zionist partisans should be 'proud' to wear it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy Carter: an ordinary fool of historical proportions","review":"This book is yet another profound failure of this ordinary bigot with a prestigious title. Let's make it clear: by majority of Americans, Jimmy Carter will be always remembered as one of the worse President this great country ever had. Yet, we may not grasp YET the extension of damage this person made... unfortunately, we may come to realization of this in few years when Islamic Republic of Iran starts threatening the USA with a nuclear bomb. And... who is the godfather of Iranian Islamo-fascism?Of course, Jimmy Carter, who made during his presidency a great effort to undermine a major American ally in the Middle East: the regime of a \\"human-rights violator\\" Shah Pahlavi and brought to power a peaceful democratic \\"freedom fighter\\" Ayatollah Khomeini and his fanatical Islamo-fascist gang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redemption of Failure","review":"Redemption of a FailureJimmy Carter loves everyone who loves him. He is so desperate to redeem his reputation that he embraces dictators who have savaged their own people.

Jimmy neglects to mention that as he was praising Kim Jung Il for seeking the \\"way of peace,\\" Kim was secretly creating nuclear weapons in violation of treaties signed during Jimmy's presidency. His latest book is filled with significant factual errors. Carter totally ignores the fact that Israel offered Arafat virtually everything he demanded at the Clinton/Barak/Arafat summit.

It is highly disturbing to me: Not because of any favoritism toward any group in the region, but because he states and evidently believes whole-heartedly that human actions can impact natural law.The notion that any action of any sort by any president can be based at all on the notion that the economy of the universe is going to be altered is frightening.

While his discourse can be dry, a person who wants a better understanding of the middle east situation should read this book.Unfortunately, Mr Carter, along with so many in the world turns a blind eye to the fact that many Palestinians care more about the destruction of Israel than they do about creating the first state the Palestinians have ever had in their history.

If he has any ethics at all he will withdraw the book and correct those mistakes. Israel has a story. Palestine has a story. They are both right and both wrong.

Jimmy Carter has simply stated what already goes without saying among informed observers of the conflict throughout the world: Israel's illegal occupation and colonization of Palestine, along with the apartheid policies and human rights violations, constitute the driving force of the conflict. End the occupation, and you can end the conflict.This book is an easy read (I read the whole thing in 2 days), honest, informative, and courageous. If the movement to end apartheid in Palestine is ever to move into the mainstream of American political culture (as has the movement to end apartheid in South-Africa), this book will have unquestionably played the role of a catalyst in this effort.

Carter's book is grossly biased and replete with factual errors. Given that Carter has access to virtually unlimited research assistance, one must assume that the factual errors are intentional -- part of an intellectually dishonest and reprehensible effort to mislead readers. It is well known that Carter is an apologist for Palestinian terrorists, and a hater of Israel -- so I suppose we should not be surprised that he would write a grossly misleading an biased book. But its still disappointing. The only useful thing Carter has done in his life is to promote habitat for humanity. He should put down the pen and go back to building houses.

Its complete garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"A disappointing and generally naive book by a former President eager to be back in the limelight.

Mr. Carter too is guilty of misleading the court of public opinion. A mere listing of all of Mr. Carter's mistakes and omissions would fill a volume the size of his book.\\"When a man, even a man of questionable intellect like Carter, who has been exposed to the information a President gets exposed to, still clings to the notion that Israel practices Apartheid, indicates some pathology.

My biggest problem is not with his description of Palestinian conditions, but his characterization of \\"apartheid.\\" Everyone knows that the connotation of \\"apartheid\\" is that of injustice. So blaming Israel for apartheid is like saying that they are unjust for taking measures to protect their own people. The fact that Israeli citizens' lives are threatened EVERYDAY cannot be disputed. Any country, including the US, would have reacted in a similar way. It is fine to disagree with Israeli policies, but cannot disagree that they have the right to protect their people, their families, their children. Israel is a small country, so when one family is affected by terrorism is affects many others.So while it the condition of the Palestinian people is unfortunate, everyone knows that the moment the people renounce terrorism and accept Israel's right to exist, their troubles caused by Israel will end.

It is almost as though Carter is applying for work with every tin-pot dictator in the Middle East. The lack of understanding of how the world works shown by Carter in this book makes it easy to understand why he is arguably the worst president in American history. The unending hostage crisis, the worst economy since the depression and oil crisis were his legacy before he decided to become an apologist for terrorists. Was he out of the country during 9-11.

What I value most about this book is that Carter acknowledges and explains that no party involved has been entirely right or honest. All have done wrong things. I think that's important to understand. He isn't taking sides as many people have accused him of doing.

He was an integral part of the mid-east peace process, and as such has merit to write a book of this nature. It is completely free of bias. He points out the flaws of both sides, as well as the good on both sides.

The book focuses on Palestine, but that does not mean it is one sided. Carter states deficiencies by the Palestinian government.Carter brings to the public the truth of the situation. He doesn't hide behind American-Israeli interests and instead steps out of the shadows of mainstream American media.

Those who argue that apartheid is not practiced by the Israeli government either don't want to admit to it or don't understand the meaning of the word. If you are of Palestinian descent, you legally have different (i.e., lesser) rights than a Jew in Israel. Institutionalized discrimination based on ethnicity is the definition of apartheid.People can debate all they want about his efficacy as a president, but let's please stick to the topic at hand. By writing a \\"controversial\\" book (which really wouldn't be considered controversial outside of the US and Israel) Carter is continuing his charge to draw public attention to addressing the problems of the disenfranchised and the underdogs. He is proving himself to be one of the most moral and honorable leaders of our day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and Balanced","review":"Despite all the clammer, I found this book to be surprisingly balanced, and if, like me, you dont know too much about the conflict, its really a useful guide.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested with the peace process in the Middle-East, and why we have yet to achieve peace and stability in this part of the world. Former president Carter does an excellent job descibing his past experiences in dealing with this situation. The book is refreshing because it doesn't take a Pro-Israeli stance to the peace effort. In todays media all we seem to get is a Pro-Israeli spin. It was nice to read something that described a situation from both sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally an honest voice!","review":"President Carter has finally shaken up the moribund conscience of the American public when it comes to the appropriately \\"aparthied\\" practices of the Israeli government. As a reader I could feel his pathos, anger and desire to bring peace. It is incredible that one country is allowed to flout all U.N. resolutions while we come down with the hammer on everyone else. The hypocrisy is incredible. It is about time that our Jewish friends quit labeling criticism of Israeli policies as anti-Semitism.

Their funding and influence to promote the APARTHEID Israel, effectively misinforms the entire country of what is going on in Palestine. The Racism that takes place their is apparent to the whole world, but not in the US.

There is no mention of the fact that Israel has reached out it's hand for peace with all of its Arab neighbors numerous times only to be met with violence and a constant commitment to their destruction. Remember one thing that sums up the entire situatuion Carters' book discusses: If the Arabs laid down their arms, there would be peace in the middle east.

Carter uses the approach that Israel has tanks, and fighter planes while all the palestinians have are rocks. This is false. The palestinian militias are armed with advanced technology smuggled in throught the philedelphia corridor from Egypt, not incuding weapons from Syria.

Now Carter disgraces himself once again and reveals himself to be an anti-Semite who places all blame on Israel. He blithely glosses over historical facts i.e. that Israel was attacked by the Arabs on the day the UN brought it into being and has continued to be attacked by Arabs all through its history.

We all saw what happened there. Does he wish the same awful fate for the Israelis? Even the book cover shows him facing against the anti-terror wall which the Israelis built, and which has cut the level of suicide bombers down to its lowest levels in decades.

Perhaps this failed one time president suffering from acute megalomania, tried to elevate himself to a level of the General Secretary.

That is a moronic call. It is about a society of people raised from birth to hate Jews, and that society is teaching the next generation to hate Jews. Every charge levelled against Israel is actually one that should be levelled against the Islamists who want only their race, their creed in control of every inch of the Middle East, then Europe, then....?

He also knows that the title will sell his book. That makes him an opportunist. Sure, tear down the wall separating Israel from the Palestinians, and Israel will be turned into a slaughterhouse.The Jewish people have every right to protect themselves from the unbridled hatred that has dogged them for thousands of years.

But they need a leader akin to a Nelson Mandela or Mahatma Gandhi. Israel is a civilized and secular nation. They want peace. Jimmy Carter's book will further incite the millions of brainwashed religious zealots that want to massacre Israel. The timing of this divisive book could not be worse.

What it boils down to in Carter's view is that it is Israel's harsh repression of the Palestinians that is causing all the problems. If the Israelis didn't repress them, the Palestinians wouldn't suicide bomb. This is a twisted view of the truth. When the U.N. partitioned the Holy Land, the Jews accepted, and the Arabs attacked the new country with the aim of destroying it. Time and time again, Israel has been attacked and threatened by the Arabs. Carter ignores this history as a factor in the present. He criticizes the separation wall because it cuts through a Christian holy site and takes Arab land, but he minimizes the fact that the wall was built to keep suicide bombers out.

Carter, as a \\"scholar,\\" continues to go for cheap dramatic thrills rather than historical accuracy. If you're pro-Palestinian and you want to learn actual facts about your heritage or your cause, don't be tempted to follow Carter blindly down his clearly ill-informed Yellow Brick Road to a land that does not exist.

Now that he is no longer an active President, instead of withdrawing to the background, Jimmy Carter is traveling around the world scheduling meetings with terror group such as Hamas AS IF he is representing the U.S. States Department.In my personal opinion, this book is basically just that. It's about a failed President who is trying to take political matter into his own hands. What is worse is that he did not provide an unbiased view of the situation. Israel was portrayed very unfairly in this book. There are many things Carter could do but instead he chose to be a political renegade running around in the world political arena."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the least bit anti-semitic","review":"This was the first comprehensive view I've seen on the middle east problem and the issue of the two-state nations of Israel and Palestine. It should be required reading for our foreign policy makers and should be read by anyone attempting to voice an opinion on what to do in the region. The critics who attempted to smear J. Carter as anti-semitic are so off-base and clearly didn't read or comprehend the message and the facts the former president was presenting. An excellent read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"palestine: peace not apartheid","review":"good book to read especially for those who are ignorant of what is going on in the middle east, and the crimes and miseries that are inflicted upon the palestinians under the name of peace or not peace. the question is: where was carter from this when he was president in office?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book","review":"When I bought this book I was impressed by the way the information was discussed, I even got it autographed by Mr. Jimmy carter when he came to Palestine :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Palestine: Peace Not Aparthieid","review":"This book is mandatory reading for all Americans. I have to say in all honesty that I have never been a Jimmy Carter fan although I have always felt he has been a kind and decent person. This book shows alot of courage on his part. He tells a story that we have to know and although he sugar coats it slightly it is a very informative look into why we are having the problems we are in the Mid-East. It has changed the way I Look at President Carter in a very positive way. Much of the rest of the world knows the situation in Israel/Palestine and now Americans have no excuse not to know. Thank you President Carter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opener","review":"Insightful chronicle on a media taboo subject, President Carter bares the ugly face of an apartheid country for all to see. The US foreign policy has a double standard for Israel, and this book exposes it. Highly recommended, I always voted Republican too. Sadly, I was a lost sheep led blindly astray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Anti-Israeli as the title suggests","review":"This book is far less Pro-Palestenian than what the title would suggests or what President Carter has come across as apparently saying on BookTV and on NPR.The book explains how the more \\"secular\\" Israeli nation under the Labor party till the mid-90's believed in \\"land for peace\\", while the Likud (and affiliated right wing quasi-religious) party has ignored all the promises the nation of Israel has made since the treaty with Egypt in 1979 (the book includes the text of all the UN resolutions, as well as the Oslo and other peace accords that the recent Israeli governments signed.The book also elaborates on how ALL the arab countries (Iran is NOT an arab country) have laid the basic framework for living in peace with Israel, but the latter is yet to act on the treaties it has agreed on"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book by one who has seen it","review":"Former President Jimmy Carter's new book, \\"Palestine: Peace not Apartheid\\" is a sign of hope in a dismal situation. President Carter has been involved personally in the Palestine/Israeli situation for decades and helped oversee the recent elections there. His book exposes the face of Apartheid in the 21st century. He helps bring to light the Palestinians who continue to suffer under the Israeli Apartheid regime; which takes a lot of courage. Perhaps now, more people will help to end a system that discriminates, based on ethnicity, the right to food, water, education and health care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to learn about the Middle East","review":"Teachers and parents should encourage young people to read this. President Carter is such a good man with sincere intentions. A role model. The irony is that I'm sometimes inspired to feel anger as I read about his valient attempts at peace while remembering the derogatory and slanderous falsehoods which our media told about him. I learner a lot from this book; about politics and about humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Art...","review":"This book is not worth it. The size of it is deceiving. It is not art, nor is it a real collectors item. The majority of the images appear in workout magazines and are easily accessible. There is no text (which implies it has one sole purpose) and the images in the magazines are much larger than what appears in this book. The only thing this book is truly useful for is cutting up and using for a high school girl's dream poster for her bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed amp module, no support","review":"Sounded great.

Another pop and failure occurred this week November 2003, with less than one year of use after repair. We do not \\"crank up\\" the volume, nor have we ever pushed the limits of the unit. From reading multiple other reviews online, it is obvious that a significant portion of the product units are defective because they all have the same repetitive problem.

Trying to get some support from JBL is VERY disappointing. Therefore, I would NOT recommend their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought this subwoofer because of my past experience with JBL speakers. This sub sounds great, but it won't last. I had my first one a week when it went dead. NO led lights, NO juice. I returned it and got a new one, thought it might just be defective.

I used to use a lot of JBL equipment with my sound company...that was in the 70's. I always have been a fan. I got this PB12 as a replacement for the PSW-D112 that I purchased in Feb 2001. It's amp blew out. Now after two years of limited use, this one has done the same. I guess it's time for a change of mind set.

But nevertheless, I have owned my PB12 for about two years now, and it works fine and still sounds great. A friend of mine is going on his third year (I think) with his PB12.Bottom line, if you trust JBL (I have almost all JBL and have never had problem with any of them and they all sound great) and believe that this product has possibly been improved since most of these reviews were written, then by all means BUY THIS SUB.

I had a PB12, same subwoofer except it was a down-firing design. Exact same circuit board! I mostly used it for TV audio. It died 3 months after the 1 year warranty was up. I found out on the internet that was typical, and JBL would not repair them! It was a flawed design!So I contacted the the Harman Consumer Group (JBL) and they sold me a replacement E250P for about $250. This one lasted almost 2 years! It has the exact same circuit board as the PB12, and the exact same fried componentsI Good luck with your JBL piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product while it works","review":"As others have indicated, this unit is fantastic when it's working. The problem is this unit is highly unreliable. I've had mine for approx 3 years and the unit has failed twice. The first failure was the power supply, which was replaced at my cost at a local service center. Now the unit apparently has a problem with the circuitry; it produces almost no sound, while the few decibels it does produce is nothing more than a distorted rattle (the cone is perfect). To make matters worse, my local service center is no more, and there are no service areas within a couple of hundred miles of my house. In order to find my \\"local\\" service center now, I get to place a long-distance call to JBL (no 800 phone number). No thanks. I've already spent $350 on a $250 unit only to have it fail again. I'll consider this a costly lesson in JBL's quality and customer service. Hopefully you're reading this as part of your homework before you make a purchase. I wish I had done that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it while it lasted","review":"While it worked this is an awesome sub. I had it for a little over 4 years, and was very pleased with the sound quality and deep rich bass. It has all the controls you could ask for, and fills a large room easily. It is a large unit so if space is a concern, look elsewhere.Had I written this review a year ago, I would have nothing but praise for this unit. Sadly, over the last year I started experiencing issues with it. It would randomly turn itself on and off, as if the sensing unit had failed. Then it started making random pops. Now, while it powers on, it produces no sound at all. There are no local service centers, and JBL customer support is almost non existent. I paid $250 for this product new. It appears it will cost me close to that to have it serviced.I guess it's time to look for a new sub :("},{"rating":"2","title":"So who needs E-Double?","review":"I loved this album, straight up and down.

It's one thing to enjoy women's physical features in a sexual connotation, but his whole personality is starting to irritate me as the years pass.

Her writing is beautiful, but you hardly notice it because the story is so compelling. The points she makes by telling the kids' stories come through, but you don't feel you're being preached to. Rather, you feel you're on the wild ride Maran went on with these kids, and as she did, you come to love and respect them in the process. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good read, parent or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Anyone Interested in This Issue","review":"I have been an addictions counselor for 25 years and have traditionally not read books on this subject because they tend to parrot one another. This book, however, is different. Those of us who work in this field know (if we are honest) that most adolescents do not respond favorably to treatment as we know it. This book tells us why and suggests how it might be more effective. As those of us in this field know, it will take much introspection and commitment on the part of parents, schools, the justice system and our government (and yes, even us treatment professionals) to acknowledge what works and what doesn't. Ms. Maran points out, and I believe, that this needs to be done on an collaborative level to be successful. It makes sense that we need to give our time and resources to the things that are important to us. We haven't given enough of either to this issue up to this point. Thanks to the author for pointing this out so eloquently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Timely Book","review":"Meredith Maran is no ivory-tower expert on teenage trouble and drug use. She's been there with her own son, and exeperienced the emotional turmoil every parent feels when an adolescent seems to be careening out of control. But Maran survived, and so did her son. His survival and maturation into a fine young man gave her the strength to become a fly on the wall following three kids--and their parents, friends, and counselors--through the maze of drug rehabilitation programs. Along the way, Maran provides insights every parent of a teenager needs to know. Dirty is a book from the heart by an author with a sharp mind, a keen eye, and a big heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"phone not recvd after 8 days","review":"Orderd on Sep 2 said two three days deliver today is 10th and have not received merchandise.

Perhaps I don't have a talent for reading Jane Austen book discussions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jane Austen Book Club","review":"Despite some portions of the book that are quite interesting and even humorous, on the whole I found the book to be profoundly boring. I would have set the book aside if it were not for the fact that my Book Group had chosen this as our monthly selection. So, I plowed through it. Come to find out the Book Group was unanimous in their appraisal that this was one boring book! The book reads like a soap opera and the movie does likewise.However, there is one redeeming value to the book: It does offer some insights into some of the possible dynamics of book groups. Yet, this is not justification enough to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"low class garbage","review":"When I saw Jane Austen in the title, I was hoping for a book that a Jane Austen fan would enjoy. In my opinion, this writer couldn't keep her mind out of the gutter and her language was low class. I didn't like the characters and there was no real story line. The sticker on my book said that it was an adult bestseller. But I am sure that is false advertising. Just pass this one by. It's not worth reading even if someone gives it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Lovely","review":"This book is a gem, and you don't have to be a Janeite to love it, although that of course adds to the pleasure of its irony, allusions, and the narrator's tone as well as that of the characters' dialogue. One disappointed Amazon reviewer suggests that one should read Jane Austen herself, instead, (and one should definitely read the unmatchable JA) but I really wonder if said reviewer would like Austen either; the very accusations made about the characters being \\"shallow and boring\\" are often the ones leveled by my freshman English Lit. students at Emma Woodhouse. . . Also, where are the \\"numerous vulgarities\\"? I can't recall even one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"I love Jane Austen, so I was interested in this book. I think I was a little let down. The point of view through the whole book was never clear. I found myself trying to figure out who was the narrator, especially in the first chapter. The author had some good ideas, but I feel like she could have fleshed them out a little. If you love Jane Austen, go ahead and read it, but don't expect too much out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but a little choppy at times","review":"Mostly, I enjoyed reading the Jane Austen Book Club. I felt like the story was a little choppy at times, since the narrative does jump back and forth between the different characters, so you never get a really full picture of any one of the women. But, I did think that the author did a good job of pulling the different themes of austen out into the different women. It's a fun read for an austen addict (like me) because it makes you revisit each of her books with the women as you read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Extremely disappointing. Boring characters with stupid names like Grigg and Allegra (the author even goes so far as to point out that she is named for a Shakespeare character, and not for the allergy medication) meet once a month to discuss their monthly Austen selection. However, there is very little discussion of the chosen books. Fowler sticks random quotes from or about Austen throughout the book in places where they don't make any sense. She ends the book with a chapter summarizing all of the Austen novels, rather than weave this information into the story. It's as if Fowler has collected all of this information on Austen and is determined to use it, even if she can't figure out how to do it in an interesting way. 'Look at me, I can quote Jane Austen.' This book was so boring, I want my money and my time back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if You Have Nothing Else to Do","review":"It's a quick read but totally unrewarding. I never became attached to the characters and the discussions on Austen weren't developed either. Pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen would be spinning in her grave","review":"Great concept. Rubbish book. Whichever book agent decided to give this book the go ahead was very wrong. Why?! It's using Jane Austen's name to talk a load of bull. The characters are under developed if that at all, and the writer has no idea what they're really talking about. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre book if you're desparate","review":"I bought the Jane Austen Book Club at the airport when I was making a connection, so I didn't have too much time to browse.

I accept that and will take my lashes later. I'm just so glad that I did finally sit down and read it (thank you, library!). It was a wonderful book, so fun and funny and well-written. It has been a long time since I read a book that had so many passages I wanted to read out loud so that others could share in my delight. It was nice to finally read a book I could just sit back and enjoy. My writer brain took a holiday and my reader brain took over. Lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jane Austen Book Club","review":"I am half way through this book, and it is excruciating. I will finish the book, because I always like to finish a book to be fair and see what happens. Thus far; however, I have found most of the characters to be weak and self-pitying. The only character that appeals to me is Sylvia. She shows real strength in a difficult time. I hope before this is over, something good will happen to her. As for the rest, I do not find them witty or interesting. To me, they compare in no way to a Jane Austen character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been a fan of Jane Austen since I was 15. I expected this book to discuss Austen's books. It does not. I feel that Jane Austen's name was used to sell this book. A real pity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not get the point of this book","review":"I read this book because it was a selection for a book club that I belong to. I was expecting a connection between Jane Austen's novels and the characters in the book. Although each one of the characters and an Austen novel were featured in a chapter I could not find the connection. Going back and forth between the past and present did not flow smoothly for me and I had to reread to figure out the time frame. The gratuitous sex and profanity did not add anything to the story line and could have been left out with no consequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"It says on the back that you don't have to have read any Austen but I would disagree.It's all pretty cheesy, the storyline is uninteresting and the characters are fairly one dimensional - I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Poorly developed in every way: uninteresting characters, terrible flow, dialogue amongst characters had little depth or continuity, and barely a plot to speak of. I couldn't care less about any of the characters, past, present, or future.I'm left wondering why I forced myself to read it through. Time spent reading this feels wasted...no...stolen. Glad the copy I read was borrowed from the library, that I didn't pay anything for it.It seems, almost, that it was written with the idea of being made into a movie. She should have just written it as a film script from the get go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleah :(","review":"My dedication to things Jane Austen led my sister to dutifully purchase this for my birthday. As I had previously coveted it in a bookshop, I was most pleased. Sadly, it was a total disappointment. In fact, it is one of the RARE books that I just have not had the will to finish. Given that, I suppose I cannot be counted on as an informed reviewer...but nevertheless...the characters didn't appeal to me and I found it disjointed and, to put it bluntly, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Jane Austen was a genius and, even all these years later, most of what Jane touches turns to gold, which explains how this piece of garbage became a bestseller. If Karen (shame on her) Fowler had marketed and sold Jane Austen toilet paper, the result would be almost as offensive to Austen's fans as this ridiculous book. After I finished it, I put it in the recycled bin, since I had no interested in keeping it in my house. I hope it's used to make toilet paper. It would be a fitting end to this pathetic novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This book was sooo disappointing. I was expecting something written more in the style of Jane Austen, but the author is nothing like her. The language was terrible (I've never read anything that used the F-word so much), and she couldn't seem to get her mind off sex. The characters are shallow, and by the end you still don't really care anything about them. She created opportunity for a relationship among two of the book club members but managed to make even that unromantic. It seemed like the author had 50 different ideas for short stories and used the \\"Jane Austen book club\\" as a way of telling her tales as the life experiences of the club members, but the stories are disjointed and have no real importance in the lives of the characters as we know them. It was a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prejudiced","review":"I often think that with a few notable exceptions English language fiction experienced its heyday in the 19th century and simply died in the mid-20th century.

The two stars are for the interesting list of Austen criticism in the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jane Austen Book Club: A Novel","review":"Boring and disappointing, I forced my self to read it since I spent the money on the book. The plot and the characters were just boring-who would publish this book and will they give me my money back?? One star is one too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish...","review":"Being a huge fan of Jane Austen, I was very excited about reading this. However, the farther I got, the more I felt like I had been \\"suckered\\" into reading it because of the title and supposed JA connection. There were some pretty disgusting things in it(and being a college student, I'm not that easily offended either), and I felt like it was not at all true to the spirit of Austen herself to include them. Besides this, most of the characters were about as lovable as Mr. Collins (Allegra especially just irritated the heck out of me!) If it weren't for the fact that this book was given to me, I would feel cheated out of my hard-earned money as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank Goodness It's Not Just Me","review":"I thought I had lost all critical faculties when I compared my reaction to this book with the critical rave reviews. I have been a Janite in my time and see this as another failed attempt to ride on her coatails. That aside, this is a shallow, trite, boring book. It gets two stars for its flashes of wit and sometime felicity of phrase and insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing waste of money","review":"I rushed out to buy this book, thinking it would be as wonderful as the local book reviewer declared it to be. Well. It isn't often that I fail to finish a book out of sheer boredom but this was one of those times. Not even the slyly incisive wit of the writing style could redeem it, or persuade me to keep going, following the stereotypical characters and their cliched backgrounds. I simply didn't care about any of them or feel any stimulation through their stilted engagement with the Austen novels. I put this book on a par with \\"A Year of Reading Proust\\" by Phyllis Rose - writing without passion or plot hanging off the coat-tails of true greatness. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke warm","review":"I read this book, egged on by professional reviews. As I plodded through I kept asking myself, am I enjoying it? Do I like it or not? Maybe I'm not in the mood for this. It did make me laugh out loud, sometimes unintentionally, as when 3/4s of the way through the book Sylvia is revealed to be a fully bilingual Latina. How funny that her ethnicity and history really don't color in any way her insights or her interactions with other characters. As a Mexican-American myself, I am alway educating my beloved British husband in the ways of multiple perspectives. Sylvia's ethnicity seemed a good natured attempt of the author to incorporate the actual history and ethnicity of California, but it seems she has no knowledge of minority perspectives; unless, of course, that is only Allegra's right.Next time I'll stick to books recommended by friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I expected to like this book much better than I did, based on the premise. Both the development of the contemporary characters and the treatment of Jane Austen's works were superficial. And, sometimes, what seems like an original idea for narration turns out to be an impediment to enjoyment. The author gives us a first person plural narrator and I spent so much time trying to figure out who the actual narrator was that it kept me from being able to enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"I read this for a book club and it was torture trying to get through it. I disliked everything about this book. The characters were shallow and boring and I didn't care about them at all. Despite being Californians, all of them spoke in a faux-British-lite voice that made it impossible to separate them from each other. The author tosses in numerous vulgarities when describing bodily functions of humans and animals (maybe she thinks this makes her novel \\"hip\\" or \\"cool\\"- I don't know). Since the book is about a bunch of women, of course, there has to be the obligatory sexual trauma thrown in. As I was reading I couldn't help envying the fact that the characters were reading artistic works of literature in their book club while I am stuck reading this stupid, witless, pointless waste of time in mine. Don't bother with this book- read Jane Austen instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too trashy","review":"Authors are free to write anything they choose, but not drag Jane Austen into the mud.The premise was intriguing, but the story gets tacky. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't get better!","review":"This was my book club's choice for this November. Started reading, kept reading hoping it would improve. Never did. It stinks. At Page 156, I decided not to waste anymore time on this drivel. Can't wait til our meeting to find out if other's felt the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful.","review":"I do wish the author had dropped the painfully forced Jane Austen conceit and just expanded on her own characters.The book is poorly edited and proofread (hint: there *is* a difference between \\"confirmation\\" and \\"conformation\\"), and anyone who knows anything at all about dogs and dog shows will be annoyed beyond belief.Don't bother on this one. Go read Pride and Prejudice again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Disappointing read with flat characters. Stories go nowhere. The book lacked depth. Although the concept was good, the story lines were not fully explored and characters were not developed. After being in a book club for over 5 years, we feel that Fowler's story doesn't begin to touch on the interconnections of book club members and to the similarities members feel with the characters they read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've been tricked!","review":"I thought this would be a light, humorous read centered on Jane Austen but it is instead about a boring gaggle of women (+ one man) and all of their life drama and sexual trauma. I got a little beyond page 50 but I'd rather re-read War and Peace. I was looking forward to some fun reading while sitting by the fire this evening but perhaps I'll just toss this one in. Time is precious, don't waste it on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the investment ...","review":"This book is not worth the investment of time or money, unless you have a wealth of both.The author was apparently hoping for success through the strength of her character studies; that is the only logic that can explain the thin plot. The problem is, she doesn't really know these characters. By the end of the book, you've spent so little time with any of them that you don't feel like you know them, nothing of note has happened, and the characters' stories that you have heard have been moderately interesting but not particularly revealing or moving.It's like a garden party where the food was fair but there wasn't much of it and as you're driving home you realize how glad you are to be out of there."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Which I Write A Review","review":"I don't get why this was supposedly such a fine work of literature. I don't get the sophomoric Jane Austen discussions, I don't get a handle on the characters, I don't get the \\"book club discussion questions\\" at the end. I didn't find the \\"subversive wit and a wise observer of human interaction\\" of the author, and the \\"the heady literary chat\\" was probably way above my own head. I never knew there was such a thing called \\"Janeites\\"-- so maybe this would appeal to people who are obsessed with Austen. I've never been a huge fan.As for the The Washington Post's Book World review, \\"It's just as hard to explain quite why The Jane Austen Book Club is so wonderful.\\" - True. I agree with that! \\"But that it is wonderful will soon be widely recognized, indeed, a truth universally acknowledged.\\" Wow- isn't that some neat prophesying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, poor Jane","review":"A book dedicated to the wit, charm, sophistication and style of Austen's novels, this one fails to win hearts or minds using any of the above criteria. The characters are unlikeable (except maybe for the dogs), and the book is thin and insubstantially written, with no detectable \\"voice\\" or style. The nice irony of this book is that it will probably be read by a great many book clubs, although the sheer banality of the story is enough to put one off book clubs forever.Read Austen instead. And when you're done, read some of the feminist Austen scholars quoted in the back of this book, to get a sense of what a real engagement with Austen's work might look like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should I have read more Jane Austen?","review":"I'm not an Austen reader but I picked this up because the author was from my home town. It was a little predictable and perhaps I was lost on the connections to the Austen novels. My book club gave it hoe-hum reviews as well, but none of us are Austen readers. I do like the incorporation of the man into the bookclub and the snide remarks about his contributions to the potluck dinners. So much like a book club to judge that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slice of Life in the Central Valley","review":"I didn't approach this as a new Jane Austen book, nor, like some reviewers, did I feel that the title was exploitive of the works of Jane Austen. I felt the book club was an intriguing device for pulling the characters together. I appreciated Fowler's insights into women of \\"une certaine age\\", of which I am one. And I loved the glimpes of California's Central valley. I found the anecdotal approach a brilliant way to see into the hearts of the characters. All in all, an enjoyable read with many laughs and insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't pull me in...","review":"I just couldn't get very interested in these characters, I found the book to be rather boring. My book group selected this one, I myself have not read Jane Austen, but all of our members gave a similar rating even the Austen lovers. It was a disapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fowler rocks","review":"This was a great read. Karen Joy Fowler has used the Austen movels to great advantage, showcasing one per chapter and successfully making her narrative resonate with the book under discussion. I think the structure works marvelously well. AND her book drove me back to Austen. I reread several novels and read two for the first time: Emma and Northanger Abbey. To my way of thinking, Fowler is having a literary conversation with Austen across time in a manner that the reader gets to witness and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless - Poor Jane !!!","review":"I LOVE, simply LOVE Jane Austen... Unfortunalety, I decided to read this book because of her. I guess that the author thought the same: people will buy this because of Austen's name...Poor thing, dead for almost 200 years and people milking her name for idiotic reasons...I gave up on page 168. It was going nowhere. The story is completely lukewarm, there is no conflict, the characters don't inspire any sort of feeling, nothing makes your continue reading it.I think this was the most shameless attempt to get money from a beloved author that is no longer alive to defend herself.Skip this one... go read or reread Jane's books instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How deep is it?","review":"I was not thrilled with this book.

This is one of the most boring books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie, forget the book.","review":"Book clubs, meet-ups, etc are quite prevalent these days. The title alone seems interesting. But alas the book does not deliver. Only a small portion of the book is spent on book club meetings, where the conversation is scattershot and shallow, although perhaps little more could be expected with the myriad of similar characters produced by Austen in her works. Much of the book is devoted to rather lackluster, meandering mini-biographies of the club members.It is only the sub-plots of Sylvia's separation from Daniel and dog-breeder Jocelyn's interest in the only male of the group Griggs that give the book any real interest or continuity. The book doesn't run out of steam because it never gets off the ground - there's no focus to speak of.In this case, the recent movie of the same name is far more interesting and better done. While retaining a good bit of the plot, what little there is, the character interactions are far more engaging. See the movie, forget the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the end first!","review":"If you have not ever read the books or if it's been a long time since you read them - take a look at the back of the book first.

Likewise with audio books: If, after listening for two hours, I am bored and unengaged I give up. I listen to many audio books and very rarely do I give up on any, but after 2 hours of this book I felt that life is too short to endure any more of this.. The narrators voice was dull and the story just didn't keep me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad idea gone horribly wrong.","review":"I can't honestly say that this is the worst book in the history of the printed page, because I haven't actually read all those other books.

You don't have to be familiar with Austen's world to appreciate Fowler's world. This novel had me laughing out loud on several occasions.I'm dissapointed, but not surprosed, to see that in the movie versions the characters are all younger by about 10 years.

The characters are boring, the writing is mediocre, the plot is uninspired, and the narrator keeps changing without any logic.

As for Jane Austen herself, I can imagine her rolling in her grave at being mentioned in the same sentence with Karen Dull Fowler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in many ways","review":"First let me confess that I've not made an effort to become a fan of Austen. That, alone, might put into context a reader's reaction to my less than thrilled review of this book.I stumbled in the first chapter when the first person narrator introduced all six book club members in the third person, not accounting for herself. I presumed it was some kind of literary game, but found it annoying. I don't think it was resolved.While I did finish the book, I was grumbling. It seemed light, slight, entertaining in parts, contained some wonderful lines and observations, but ultimately did not satisfy in any genre. How did all those wonderful writers get coopted into the 'blurb community'?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"The only good part of this book are the quotations about Jane Austen in the back. That said, this book has no interesting dialog, there are few comments about Austen's books and they are random and are usually a vehicle to comment on the character making the statement. Also the action jumps all over the place affecting the flow of the narrative. Add to that the fact that you probably won't care in the slightest about these lackluster, poorly defined people. Very sorry I bought the book and wasted time reading 70 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of blah","review":"I expected more from this book. It was sort of interesting sometimes, but not overall.

It's not worth retail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and could not get into this","review":"I could not really get into this book. It jumped from character to character, and it was a little interesting learning about the lives of some of the book club, but then the story jumped to another person, or jumped so far into the future that I felt left out of their lives again. Half of the book the characters spent discussing their thoughts on Jane Austen's novels, and if you are not familiar with or interested in her novels I am sure that part would be very boring for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"We were not amused!","review":"The premise was cute, a novel based on the lives of members of a Jane Austen bookclub.

However, the concept wasn't well developed. There were also many writing errors in the book, and the book kept going back and forth from the characters pasts to a little bit about their meetings in the book club in the present. All in all, it was very disappointing, so much so that I didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex and the Suburbs","review":"Reading this book was like having affair.

Sadly, it was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"I have to say that our book club picked this book and just found that nothing happened in it. There was no character development and the book left you wondering what the whole point of it was. We were unsure why the author chose to include-at the back of the book-comments made by other people on Jane Austen. It seemed irrelevant to us. The book was very boring and it took us weeks to finish because we just had no incentive to pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please STOP!","review":"I have read all of Jane Austen's books~ I have read 57 books this year alone~ I am an avid reader~ This book killed me! I literally found myself falling asleep each time I picked it up, not twenty words along~ It went absolutely no where~ The women were downright rude and catty, and coming from myself, who can be a bit catty, it was torture for me~ I am in a book club, and by no means was this book indicative of the book clubs I'm acquainted with~ The discussions were pointless, the descriptions were endless the subject matter useless~I find it an insult to the memory and credit of Jane Austen that this particular book has her name embedded all over it~ Truly a waste of my reading time, a time that is quite precious to me~"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful---stay away","review":"I bought this book because I was looking for something to read while traveling and it looked like it would be light and witty. Despite the glowing reviews on the cover, there was nothing about it that I could recommend. It went from one badly written sentence to another, and as another reviewer wrote, I didn't care about any of the characters. Any attempts at wit were transparent and unnecessary. I finished the book because I had paid money for it, but when I tried to hand it onto a friend who was desperate for something to read, she read the first chapter and thought leaving it at our hostel would be a better idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this large print edition","review":"I ordered this not knowing it was Large Print, but that's not the problem, the problem is that it's a very bad printing job; there are even two pages totally blank and missing completely.This publisher should be embarrassed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen is writhing in her grave...........","review":"This book is trite and shallow (yes, it takes both to fully encompass its \\"banalness\\"). In Austen's books you always saw the humanity of the characters and felt for them...these characters are so underdeveloped you do not care what they say or what happens to them. Any allusions to Austen or parallels to her characters are really stretching it. This is rather on the level of Danielle Steel. FLUFF"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly worth it","review":"After reading the reviews of this book, I couldn't wait to read it. I wish I had waited, a long time. The book seemed contrived. An easy to follow plot line without surprises along the way. A much better book based on the same premise - a ladies' book club - is And The Ladies Of The Club."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Look At Normal Life","review":"A story of a book club that only reads Jane Austen's novels, Fowler's book turns out to be very enjoyable. I had a very strong feeling when finished that this book needs a number of readings along with re-readings of the Austen books, which are represented one for each chapter. In addition to changing the Austen novel each chapter, Fowler chooses a different person in the club to focus on with scenes from the character's past. Clearly the overall emphasis on social interaction is very much like Austen's emphasis, but this book is of our time, and I found it very touching, making me often smile. Not a supper serious book with any action, but rather a story of normality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My hopes were high as I opened this book. They quickly plummeted. The idea behind the book is genius; it's unfortunate that the author didn't fully develop its potential. I found the plot weak and the characters insipid. I enjoy Jane Austen's work. Read her novels firsthand and skip this snoring regurgitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn :-0","review":"I wanted to like this book, but it just bored me to death. I kept reading and reading, hoping to find something that would make it interesting, unfortunately, that something never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Is Better","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I bought the movie first. I found the movie to be engaging, funny, charming and truly worthy of any Austen fan.The book, however, is none of those. It is boring, a struggle to get through and had I bought the book first I would have never bought the movie.The movie presented a balance of the characters lives versus the disussions of the novels themselves. The book is more about the characters and less about the novels.In short, had I known, I would have never purchased the book and been content with the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was There A Point?","review":"I was unable to discover the point of this novel. As a Jane Austen fan, I was hoping for more discussion of the Austen novels. There were some interesting insights, which is keeping me from giving this book one star, but not enough. I didn't care about any of the characters or their stories, especially since their stories were so poorly told. I find it hard to believe that a film was produced out of this material. Don't waste your time with The Jane Austen Book Club, read Persuasion or Pride and Prejudice, again, instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Name Dropping and nothing more","review":"A tiny bit has to do with Jane Austen and her very insightful novels about people and their personalities. This is a lot of tripe mixed in with a bit about knowing what Jane Austen's books are about. Ho hum... Really a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was ok","review":"Beleive it or not this time I prefer the movie compare to the book. Did not really get into it. The characters didnot interest me as much as the movie were able to do. Get the movie it will entertain you for 2 hrs better than the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I plodded my way through this book because I hate to give up and I had nothing else around to read. I found the characters boring and their discussions of the books completely uninspired. Also, the author has the annoying habit of telling you too much instead of letting you figure it out for yourself. The only reason I would recommend this book to anyone was for the interesting information at the end--after the novel is finished the author provides information about what other people have thought of Jane Austen as well as a short synopsis of each of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"If you want to read Austen buy Pride and Prejudice not this book. TJABC is long on slapstick and short on things Austen. It pales in comparison to Austen's razor wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point of this book?","review":"A friend gave me her copy of THE JANE AUSTEN BOOK CLUB, saying that she found it unreadable but that, since I loved the writing of Jane Austen, I probably would enjoy it.I didn't enjoy it. I hated it.What was the point of this book? It's not about Jane Austen, and it's barely about the members of this so-called \\"Book Club.\\"The characters hardly are developed and, in consequence, there is no way that they can engage a reader.These characters rarely interact with one another and their backstories, insofar as these are revealed, are boring.I find it difficult to believe those people who claim to admire this book, thinking that their claims are some sort of pseudo-intellectual version of the \\"Emperor's New Clothes.\\"As far as I can see, the choice of this title totally exploits the excellent reputation of Jane Austen, an author who no longer is around to defend herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me disengaged","review":"Although I love Jane Austen and have read all of her novels at least once, I did not love this book. I actually barely liked it. For me the high points were moments of discussion of the novels (although there really wasn't that much brought up that an avid reader wouldn't have thought of or discussed already)and parts of the characters' back stories. At moments when Fowler brings their pasts to life she gives her characters true dimension and is able to make the reader chuckle or wince. However, like some other reviewers my biggest problem with the novel is that I just didn't care about the characters in their present. It didn't matter if they ended up happy or sad. I didn't feel their joys or pain- they were just flat. I kept reading for hope of a pleasing ending, but it just seemed too wrapped up for me and as a whole was not too memorable at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unsatisfying","review":"I read this with my book club. As Austen lovers, we all had high hopes for the book, but they were dashed by the end of the first chapter....and it went downhill from there. The characters are dull and unsympathetic, the writing poor (one never does find out from whose perspective it's written-- it seems to change without notice), and we kept waiting for the Austen parallels which never materialized. Very disappointing book. If you're looking for a good read, choose The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see the connection to Jane Austen","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading this book, but after the first few chapters, I realized that it was not what I was expecting. The book was very slow & choppy. I also felt that the author was \\"stretching\\" the connection with Jane Austen, when there was very little correlation. I had to skip a few pages towards the end just to keep myself from falling asleep.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"A good book though not a great one. Although there was much talk of Austen, I could have done with more of it. And I'm sure that the characters' stories in many ways were parallel to Austen's novels, but I just didn't have the time to really think about it enough to really make those connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"jane austen book club","review":"This is possibly the worse book I have ever tried to read. I don't often give up on books, but this one had nothing to recommend it whatsoever. My daughter, also an avid reader, had unbeknown to me already given up on it but hadn't liked to tell me since I had bought it for her. If Ms Fowler's name was Emma at least I could have said 'Badly done Emma, badly done indeed'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I wanted to give it zero stars, but the program wouldn't let me. The author used the paltry ploy of borrowing Austen's name to sell a few books. My husband fell for it an bought it for me. I could barely get through the first few chapters. No Jane heroine would behave in such a passive manner as the people in this book. Not a redeeming quality among the characters, and after several chapters it seemed the plot was non-existent. You should also be warned that the book contains some disturbing tales of physical abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown!","review":"I love Jane Austen and was excited to read this book. The first 50 or so pages were pretty good. I liked the characters and the premise but halfway through, the stories meandered. It was a bunch of flashbacks and recollections. Would authors today just please write a story told in linear fashion!!! Flashbacks and recollections really do not advance the plot and the plot is a problem here as other readers have mentioned. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because of the reviews about Jane Austen herself in the back. And to the writer on the book jacket who said this story was similar to one that Austen might write ---PUH LEEZE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I made it through 2 1/2 discs before the unnecessary cussing made me throw in the towel. I skipped to the end and listened to the 7th disc. And I hadn't missed anything--there was no plot. It's mostly just a bunch of people thinking about sex. Who cares? The book has weak structure, with the book club and an out-of-place first-person narrator apparent attempts to tie the characters together. How could this possibly be compared to Jane Austen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"chick-lit lite","review":"What a disappointment... chick-lit wrapped in literary pretense.Thin characters, thin dialogue, thin book --- more than a novella, not quite a novel.Only 250 of the short pages are story. The additional pages have quotes about Jane Austen and synopses of her novels.I'm going back to Jane Austen and Barbara Pym...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cheat","review":"Complete misuse of Jane Austen's name! Unlike Austen's books, this is no page turner! The book is really a cheat in the end, the Jane Austen hook a marketing ploy of sorts that never lives up to the quality of promise. Story and characters are slim, developments built around Jane Austen books and themes serve as a literary device, but it just wasn't that well executed in terms of adding much more in terms of deeper insights into characters, even complimenting the realities of their lives, much less into the fictional world of Jane Austen itself, which served a fascinating possibility based on the book's title. And as an Austen fan, I fell for that as a buyer. As a reader, none of it panned out thematically. I can't understand how this book earned any glowing reviews. It is a trifle, at best and not remarkable at all in terms of the author's writing style, plot, intelligence or wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez, a molestation scene in Chapter 1......","review":"Many of us who love and read Austen are going to be repulsed/offended by the themes of this book. The first chapter describes in detail a molestation scene of a 15 year old girl by a young man. Not exactly something that I want to read/think about (graphically) in a book. This one goes back to the bookstore. Too much vulgarity for me. Don't pick this up; it's trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I miss??","review":"This was hardly the page turner I expected from the reviews of this book..(Obviously friends and family of the author) A fan of Jane Austen, this book doesn't begin to even compare...Slim characters and a slimmer story line...with references to the great works written by Austen. Don't be fooled by the title (as I was) This book is on sale for a reason. Save your time.I want my money back.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw it out","review":"Because of its offensive sexual material, I threw this book out after reading one chapter. I teach English literature and found the book a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept...and not much else","review":"I admit I generally like a little plot with my books. It took me two attempts to make it through this one, because the characters don't interact that much; each meeting of the book club is accompanied by a few more flashbacks. The characters I found a little thin, and some were unconvincing. (We're told repeatedly that Allegra is more emotionally volatile than the others, but she doesn't actually act that way, and she speaks in the same dry understated way that some of the others do.) By the time I finally limped toward the end, convinced by the glowing reviews that there had to be something more here, I felt I'd been had. It's a shame that such a great idea was wasted on such a weak story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I enjoyed this book, though as I was a bit rusty on my Austen, I wish I had known of the summary of plot lines included at the end. I also thought a few loose ends were left at the story's end, and perhaps it could have been a bit longer so as to flesh out the characters a bit more & resolve a few items at the end. But, overall, a lot of fun and very well done. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This may well have been the worst book I ever read. The premise is interesting, and it could have been a great book, but Fowler's writing style is obnoxious. Her incorrect overuse of commas makes the book difficult to read. Her third person/first person game is annoying as well. Did anyone edit this book? The authors who attached their names to the blurbs must have owed Fowler a favor. Quite often the publisher writes the blurbs, and the author's select the one to which their name will be attached. They may have not even read the book, just a synopsis. I think the publisher and the author knew that a book with Jane Austen in the title would sell, and they didn't care much about the quality of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hook, line, and sinker","review":"Yes, I too was lured in by the many sterling reveiws on the cover of this book. The old adage of not judging a book by its cover holds true for this one. The premise was promising: the book club meeting to discuss each of Jane Austen's six books. The development of the characters was so thin; they were almost like vapor. To me, the author seemed to have this great idea and then didn't follow through. In the hands of someone else this could have been a meaningful book. I finished the book, not because I wanted to, but on principle. I will be disinclined to read anything else by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one!!!","review":"The Jane Austen Book Club is a complete wash if you like to read real Jane Austen books. It is dull, the characters are irritating and the plot (is there one?) goes nowhere. There is no motivation to get from beginning to end. Spend your time on other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misuse and abuse of Miss Austen's wonderful novels","review":"This is a trite book with barely a plot and minimal character development. As a Jane Austen fan, I am horrified that this awful book was able to misuse Jane Austen's name in order to sell books.The concept was brilliant, but the execution was very poor. Count me amongst the highly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for good literary fiction...","review":"I picked this book up because I've really enjoyed some of the literary fiction I've read lately (such as The Secret Life of Bees and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time), and was looking for something else in the same vein.Book Club? Austen? Non-glossy cover? I was in.Yeah, but no. The novel is mostly disjointed, jumping from one ill-drawn character sketch to another. And the thing that bugs me most is -- who the heck is narrating? It's told from a first-person point of view, but you have no idea who the narrator is. Other authors can pull that off (such as Toni Morrison, in Jazz), but it doesn't work for Fowler. If you want good character development, read Margaret Atwood.If you want Austen -- well, read Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept falls short of my expectations","review":"This story of a group of adults that meet over a summer to discuss the works of Jane Austen had a lot of promise, I thought.Every month they meet at someone's home to discuss one of Austen's novels. And each chapter delves a little into the life of one of the club's members. These characters, on the face of it, are an interesting and varied group: the lesbian, the divorcee, the quiet man, among others. Although the author does tell us about them, I never really felt \\"attached\\" to these people. There seemed to be an emotional dimension that was missing between these Austen fans and myself. And the ending is a little too tidy for my taste.But don't get me wrong. I still enjoyed reading this novel. I read all of the works written by Jane Austen a few years ago, and it was nice to be reminded of how great those novels actually are through this book club.Overall, a nice book, a good concept, but no emotional ties developed with these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get beyond first audio cd--ugh","review":"I'm not that hard to please but driving in silence was better than listening to this uninspired sequence of words. Feels like the characters are held at arms length. The actress doesn't help. Her haughty tone just pushed me further away. But maybe she just couldn't redeem the material and did the best she could. In either case, I couldn't listen any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read","review":"I'm a little surprised by the low reviews this book has received...I am listening to the audio version and am enchanted by the style of the author and the way she weaves the different stories through the lives of her characters. I suppose if you've watched the movie first you probably have different expectation and could be disappointed. But I personally find her clever, candid and tongue-in-cheek humor to be refreshing and delightful! I do plan to watch the movie also; it's on my Netflix queue, but it's always a gamble as to which could possibly \\"ruin\\" the other for me...the narrator's tones and expressions certainly do help in bringing it to life. I like it, and barring a totally contrived and awful ending, I suspect I'll feel the same way at the end of the book as I do now, in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The film is better","review":"I enjoyed the film based upon the book, so decided to buy the book. So often, a great deal has to be left out of the film and of course, details are changed, so I was looking forward to reading the book.I set this book aside after only a few chapters. I found it vulgar and \\"angry\\" whereas the film was not. It will be donated at the next charity pick-up...not worthy of a place on my bookshelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Start - Lost Opportunity","review":"It's a classic quick summer read. Good beginning with a start on developing each member of the book club; but then it simply doesn't go anywhere. The last chapter is thrown at you like the author was told to wrap it up quick and be done with it! However, if you're on the library list waiting for the book you really want to read, and you need a short diversion... this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I've read a lot of books about book clubs and how the books bring out the characters. This is not one of them. This book, in one word, was pointless. It didn't add anything to me. It didn't teach me anything. It didn't show me some witty insight into the human experience. It had barely developed characters barely delving into Austen's books. But true to Austen, people were getting paired up by the end. The End."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise but.....","review":"I was really looking forward to this read, being a fan of Austen as well as book clubs. While I thought the writing was strong enough and tinged with a good sense of humor, I found it mildly boring and fairly plotless. Couldn't come to really care about those characters. Just kept going to find out about Jocelyn and Grigg (I am a traditional romantic at heart) and to find out who was the narrator??? Unless I missed something, the narrator was never identified?? Frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"well....","review":"I can say i liked the characters in this book. The part i could have done without was the whole Jane Austen theme. Would have been a good book otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jane Austen Book Club","review":"I would actually give this a minus 1 star if that was a choice. This book has too many vulgar words which only detract from the story.It's not a book I could finish nor recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jane Austin Book Club","review":"I, like some other Amazon reviewers, was drawn to this book by professional reviewers but was extremely disappointed. The characters were trite and rather than a job, reading it became an odious assignment that in the end, I could even make myself complete. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does this have to do with Jane?","review":"There are so many books out right now related to Jane Austen and the books she wrote so I guess this author was trying to capitalize -- or cash in -- on this trend. I seriously wish that someone would make this writer take the name \\"Jane Austen\\" out of the title. It just isn't good enough to deserve to use her name. I tried to read this book when it first came out a few years ago and couldn't get past the first few chapters. I recently picked it up to try again and had the same reaction. This time I did make myself read the whole thing just to be fair to the author in case I should discover some redeeming value in later chapters. I never found much to like. Firstly, it has very little to do with Jane Austen's books and secondly, it's not all that great a story. Everyone else I know who's read it has had a pretty similar reaction so I'm not alone. Don't bother! Skip the book and go directly to the DVD (not something I usually recommend). The movie is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"In need of plot and character development","review":"It's interesting that many reviewers disappointed in this book are Austen fans hoping to \\"hear about Austen, and Austen's brilliant characters\\". The marketing for this book doesn't really give such lofty expectations, does it? Nevertheless, on its own, the book is only mildly interesting, the characters and conversations are strange and flighty, and there doesn't seem to be any real plot. I didn't find myself in the least involved or interested in these barely-developed characters.As for the author depicting the book club members to mimic Jane Austen characters, this idea is a serious stretch. I don't see the resemblance and wouldn't even have recognized such had I not read the reviews! Overall this book seems to be scattered, certainly an easy read, but the plot and character development are pretty well non-existent."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the point is... what?","review":"Whatever it is, it's not found in this book.I'm a Jane Austen fan, so I gravitated towards this book like George W. Bush to a Baptist convention. My excitement immediately stalled, though, within twenty pages. The characters sit around and talk or go to meaningless sci-fi seminars where they bash Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The characters neither grow nor change, they remain stagnant throughout the book and the prologue to the book seems a thrown-together synopsis the author created because she didn't want to answer the question \\"Whatever happened to...?\\"I usually never say this, but, SKIP THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrowed at the Library. Could not get 1/2 though it.","review":"I really tryed to like this book. Interesting how the reviews are so spread out between 1,2,3,4 and 5 stars. Once I got to the chapter about Prudie I could not take any more. It was pointless. It went back to the library tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated -- I did not get past page 25","review":"Sorry - I tend to make snap judgments about books, and I can usually tell within about 30 pages whether a book is worth my time or not. I found the writing style choppy, jumping back and forth between past and present time, and just knew that this book was not my cup of tea. So I stopped there and returned it to the library. The past events in the characters' lives, which the author felt so compelled to mention, seemed completely insignificant to me -- instead of shedding some light on the characters, which I imagine was the point of the digressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it got me to read Austen","review":"The best I can say about this book is that it got me to read Jane Austen. Karen Fowler can write well, but this story falls flat and goes nowhere. It is a kind of chick lit light. Even readers who like this book admit it lacks a plot, and I'll add that it lacks any likable, interesting, or understandable characters. We get snippets of background on each of the six members of the book club, but that doesn't help our understanding of their present circumstances or behavior. All of the discussions of Austen's books are superficial - the discussion questions at the back, as bad as they are, are better than anything in the story. Fowler also makes a strange tie-in to science fiction, presumably because she is also a science fiction writer? All of the characters are confused about life and love, but not in an interesting and insightful way. If Fowler was trying to write a modern parody of a generic Jane Austen book, then I would say it is too generic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is all I liked about this book.","review":"About halfway into the novel I realized the book is probably only as popular as it is because of the title. After all, us Jane Austen fans only have a handful of her books to read and re-read, so we have to get more of her in some other way... but this book by Fowler certainly is not the answer. There are some clever parallels between Austen's themes and the characters in this book, but not enough to make it interesting. In fact, I never came to like ANY of the six characters in this book, and the sparse references to Austen didn't make this book worth the while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Reading","review":"There is only one known portrait of Jane Austen. Likewise, little is known about her outside of her writings. This has bred endless curiosity on the part of some and it is about this type of folks that Karen Joy Fowler's novel The Jane Austen Book Club is about.Only one of the members of this fictious club is a man. Much of the novel revolves the relationship between the female members and the lone male. Fowler does a wonderful job with her rich characterizations; no cardboard characters here.One of the best aspects of this book is that the novel is followed up by an essay about Jane Austen and her works. There is also an excellent series of thought provoking Questions For Discussion concerning the works of Jane Austen.This is an excellent, if unusual, work."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"Maybe my hopes were too high considering I love everything Jane Austen, but this book was such a disappointment. I give the author credit for the occasional humorous elements, however, most of the book was quite boring. It was also pretty predictable; I had to skip pages to keep from falling asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packs a lot in for what seems like a little book","review":"In concept, each chapter revolves around the monthly meeting of 6 adults to review a different Jane Austen book. In truth, there is very little about the books themselves, and much more about the individuals who make up the book club. Each chapter is casually divided into sub-stories, revealing ever increasing details about each of the members.You don't need to be a fan, or even that familiar, with Jane Austen, but I imagine it would add even more to the enjoyment of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drab","review":"I adore Jane Austen and was more than willing to try to enjoy this book if only for that reason (though I read a wide range of fiction and non-fiction). Right from the start I was irritated because the author described a Rhodesian ridgeback barking mere feet away from where the club members were in discussion. As the owner of a ridgeback, I know that absolutely nobody can talk or hear a thing while it barks. But that complaint is slight compared with the utter banality of the shallow storyline and the tedious characters. I only regret going to the trouble and expense of buying a hardback copy. If I could I'd award this book no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must be a Jane Austen fan!","review":"For all this is a well written book, the real joy of reading this lies in the subtle parallel's between each of the members of the book club with Jane Austen's 6 novels. If you haven't read Emma, Mansfield Park, Sense & Sensibility, Persuasion, Pride & Prejudice, and Northanger Abbey, you will be missing many of the references. Fowler does a very good job at using the Austen novels as a framework without developing the plots into modern copies of the original. She does not pretend to duplicate Austen's style and I think you would be disappointed if she did.It is a good book and an easy read. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Being a Jane Austen fan and having read some reviews in literary magazines, I thought I was really going to enjoy this novel. However, the characters and their plots are very weak and you are always expecting the stories to improve, but ...Sylvia, Jocelyn, Allegra are certainly not Austen characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing overall","review":"We bought the BluRay version because the cover artwork says \\"IMAX Large Screen Format\\" to play on our new 52\\" Sony Bravia expecting brilliant colors, music and narration. It is 4:3 Full Screen format adapted 'FROM' IMAX, lousy color, definately NOT BluRay quality and does not get our approval. It's a mis-leading title so buyer beware. A full screen DVD comes with it and is no better than the BluRay. Actually they look and sound identical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Realistic","review":"The author has a utopian view of the world of real estate that is far from reality. She acts as if one does everything in her book clients will come flocking to one's door. If it were this easy, everyone would be a real estate agent. As proof, I visited the author's website, and she has only one house listed for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book with a new standard for real estate sales","review":"Marilyn has done it again with this book. I read her book about equity sharing which was also written in a straight-forward but comprehensive manner. I have read every major book on the market about selling real estate; this book finally delves into every single aspect of the profession and how to make real estate sales a truly profitable and rewarding profession. I especially enjoyed the New Ideal she recommends for more ethical client representation. Also, she tells you exactly how to set up your business as if it is your own sole proprietorship (which it really is even if you work for a company) and how to computerize your business to the maximum.

As with most of the Complete Idiots Guide books it was very well written for the everyday reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good some bad some ugly","review":"There is some great advice for the novice agent in this book. But I think the author/agent speaks from two sides of her mouth. She promotes good ethics and attention to detail in terms of contracts and client-care. BUT, her own business is based on facilitating For Sale By Owners and an a la carte approach to representation. Both of these approaches to Agency undercut our business and our income. We spend a lot of money in this business, and are at great risk of frivilous lawsuits, burn out, and even our personal safety. Undercutting the traditional 6% (or even 5%) commission by offering limited services for a reduced rate undermines our whole industry. Any author/agent who supports cut rate real estate services should be read with skepticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish. . .pure rubbish","review":"I'll make this short and sweet. . .if you've been in the real estate biz for any amount of time go ahead and read this book purely for the laughs you'll get. I must agree with another reviewer about Ms. Sullivan's \\"utopian view.\\" It's quite obvious upon reading this piece of rubbish that she never sold real estate full time.If you are new to the business please RUN from this book. Again, it bears very little resemblance to the daily life of a truly successful real estate sales person. Even her terminology is messed up.

The author is more focused on being a discount agent in her private practice. She is also is very focus on the technical aspects of real estate and real estate law. It is like taking the real estate exam all over again. I was not looking for hours of useless information like in liscensing school. I was hoping she was going to share really solid techniques to make more money but alas they where limited.I would recommend Success as a Real Estate Agent for Dummies by Dirk Zeller. It is well constructed and packed with how to's and systems to increase your income. His insights into prospecting, lead follow up, time management and sales presentations is outstanding. A truly must read for any agent. Save you money on this book and invest it into the \\"original\\" guide the Dummies book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nursing 2000 Drug Handbook - CDROM","review":"I am positive that I would have nothing negative to say about the actual handbook itself, but the CD-ROM is absolutely worthless.

Evangelion combined big robots fighting with religion and psychology to dazzle many viewers worldwide.

Although I wish the price for this paperback was a bit less, it's worth the money. I'm currently using a more technical book on the subject for one of my classes, and this book certainly helped clarify basic principles and applications due to the simple manner in which the author examines and explains the ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"As much Bass as you want","review":"I always dreamed of a \\"real\\" subwoofer...and I found it !

Charles Main--the focus of the book--must deal with his status as traitor, as well as the death of his lover and raising his infant son, while he tries to find a place in the American West. Madeleine, Orry's widow, tries to fight racism and provide for the freedmen of her plantation. Meanwhile, Bent and Ashton are still looking for revenge, which is the running theme of the novel. Revenge against the North, against other races, against each other; the horrible feelings of a defeated and broken world. John Jakes concludes his fascinating historical/sociological trilogy with great changes and complications and eventual conclusion for his characters that span almost every aspect of America at the time. Grade: A-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I swear someone else wrote this book. It was so full of revenge and deaths that if you make it to the end you will be so glad that there isn't a 4th book in the series.

John Jakes makes his characters and the Hazzard and Mains seem as if you could know them as real people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"As other reviewers note, this story takes place mostly in the west. Having (unfortunately) read all three books in the trilogy, this one was most disappointing of all. There were long, long passages that were simply too boring to read (particularly Charles' tramping about out west), and I found myself skipping ahead to find parts more interesting (like Ashton's adventures). Jakes' depiction of the Reconstruction Era is downright offensive. He almost completely overlooks the political corruption and scandal of the period in favor of promoting ideals that did not yet exist (and wouldn't for another century). Like all Jakes' novels, this book says more about the author's own agenda than it does about the period he's trying to depict."},{"rating":"2","title":"its good","review":"its not as sick as last night in town, but its really good. this was the first cd taht i bought from ETID and it never left my cd player for weeks.

I am seriously amazed so many people are rating this 5 stars.I saw them open for As I Lay Dying early this year and boy did they SUCK. Their set dragged on for ages and I was just waiting for it to be over from the first song. The guitarist with the beer gut couldn't play for crap. In fact none of them can. The vocalist is perhaps the worst I've ever heard. Super whiny and annoying yells and screams. No creative riffing, terrible vocals, everything about ETID sucks.To call them \\"metalcore\\" or \\"metal\\" like so many are is an insult to the genre. Real quality metalcore would be stuff like Caliban, Heaven Shall Burn, and As I Lay Dying. ETID belongs in the \\"crapcore\\" category with bands like the Blood Brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of noise doesn't make for good music","review":"It sounds like the members of ETID don't know about the musical terms: rhythm and pitch. The music has absolutely no sense of rhythm and the \\"singer\\" screams and does nothing else. At least Daryl Palumbo of Glassjaw can sing. ETID shouldn't make any more music until they understand rhythm and pitch. Also, what the f**k is up with faux death metal lyrics and modern hardcore? Hardcore lyrics used to actually mean something. For examples check out the Dead Kennedys, bands similar to DKs and more recently, Boysetsfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish they would Die","review":"These guys are terrible. They give good metal bands a bad name and really the whole genre of hardcore if you ask me. This cd reminds me of trying to take a dump when your constipated but only a pebble of crap comes out so you go to your bed with a pain in your stomach.You really have to wonder how a band that blows this much manages to get signed and have a solid fanbase.It just goes to show you how stupid the industry is.If you have a chance pick up the new Trivium cd \\"Ascendancy\\" and then you will hear a truly talented band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"First of all this is not a hardcore album it is a fashioncore album.Second it is by far the best cd that i have ever heard in my life!!!!This cd made everytime i die my favorite band in the world.Its not as heavy as Last Night In Town but is a better all around cd.The minuete you put on the cd you will be hooked on it. The intelligent lyrics are harsh and some what hard to understand but read them carefully and you will. If you buy this cd you wont regret it at least i didnt."},{"rating":"2","title":"bringin back the rock","review":"I'm not really sure how to describe this. The music is definitely hardcore, but it borrows heavily from the attitude and swagger of Guns N Roses. I would say they consider themselves more rock n roll than hardcore or metalcore. So yeah, buy the album and rock out with out c*ck out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Fo Sho!","review":"Before anyone else reviews this album, get a copy of the lyrics and read along with the CD (like you used to with those stupid sing a long book and tapes when you were a snotty nosed brat).

Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"This record blew me away. I just started geting into this scene a few weeks ago and ETID was the first real band I liked.

Enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn, this is good. haha","review":"Im really diggin the new Everytime I Die album. You have to give it a few listens to catch most of the things that are occuring in the album. The music is on many different levels. The tone changes from mathcore to screamo, with some breakdowns thrown in for good measure. If you are a fan of ETID then i recommend that you definitely get get this album. Also, if you are just getting into hardcore and you want to give something new a try, then this is for you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD ever","review":"k these guys i heard were pretty good so i went and bought the cd from a local media play, worst mistake of my life to buy this. I would not even pay $1 for this cd. The lead singers voice never changes pitch when singing, every song sounds the excact same, and his scream is the worst scream in the entire world. Then the guitar players sound like they wanted to make a band one day so they just went and learned the guitar and they just suck. Not good music, not good guitar, not good voice, not good anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow......","review":"They sound like hatebreed and other bands with no talented singers that resort to screaming in absence of good vocality. Such tasteless trash..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Generic Album","review":"I bought this album upon advice from a friend or two. And it is hard to say exactly how poor Hot Damn is. From the opening track to the final, it is mediocre and generic.First of all, one can not speak of any amount of variance among the tracks. All feature the singer simply yelling in an aggravating pitch, with the same power chords ripping out of the speakers on each. There is absolutely no melody, which some metalcore bands, such As I Lay Dying can pull off. Howvever, there is no such luck for Every Time I Die.I even gave this album four or five listens, in which I still found nothing redeeming or unique. No interesting bridges, harmony, or even the slightest amount of skilled guitar work. The entire album is simply basic, something that could easily be created by any amatuer hardcore novices.Save your money and find something worth your while, because Hot Damn is most certainly not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a fan of this metalized style of hardcore!","review":"This record has like three songs I like, which includes the video song Ebolorama. While there are a lot of rhythm changes, they're too metalized, it's progressive and technical, but it's not really groove laden like more of a thrashy type or punky type of hardcore style. It's more mechanical like how a death metal band plays, it's a real stiff kind of a robotic kind of sound. All these types of bands doing the metalcore thing are more metal than hardcore and tend to draw from the same well musically like Norma Jean, Converge, Atreyu and etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure drivel!!!!","review":"Wow!!! I'm amazed at how pathetic this music is. This has got to be the biggest insult to the entire genre, and there are some lousy bands out there. There is no melody, no respectable vocals, and most of all there is no talent in this band at all. If you like hardcore you should check out Sworn Enemy...that is a good band, but this is pure drivel and don't deserve a cent of your hard-earned money. You should also know the only reason I gave it one star was because I had to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your gun cause god won't show","review":"This cd is freaking perfect.

But as i kept listening to it, it sort of grew on me. And then my the 4th or 5th listen it was my favorite cd. I didnt think ETID next cd after the awesome \\"Last Night In Town\\" would compare and i was right. \\"Hot Damn\\" surpasses it. ETID packs a punch on both albums dont get me wrong but \\"Hot Damn\\" is just a better written album. It has some of the deepest, most thought out lyrics ive ever heard not to mention the unbelieveable breakdowns. I would tell you my favorite song if i had one but to tell you the truth I love them all. \\"Hot Damn\\" is one of the best albums ever in any music genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"this is a rock and roll takeover!\\"","review":"well, I guess I should start by saying I loved last night in town, so it's no big surprise that I'm pretty happy with hot damn. Fans of every time I die won't be dissapointed. that said...At first, the tracks do resemble each other, but after some more spins, the record starts to really take shape.the vocals are a little less insane, and the music is a little more straightforward than the last album, abandoning some of the more choatic guitar work(kind of a shame). the bottum line is, I can't get this cd out of my player. it's got clever lyrics and lots of style.artwork is a little silly though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"No, it's not near-perfect and original. It's hard to be original when you're up on stage just yelling into a microphone with d-tuned guitars making every song sound somewhat alike. I DO NOT like ETID for a lot of reasons. These guys tend to be the favorite of every indie scene kid trying to branch out into some other genre. It's probably the lyrics. I find nothing satisfying about the lyrics, the tone, or the message that this band conveys. There are plenty of truly excellent hardcore bands that are more original than this, but that shouldn't matter. Botch, Converge, Coalesce, and older Cave-In blow these guys away."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute crap","review":"i am had the displeasure of seeing these guys live w/lamb of god on an ozzfest off date show.... i must say this is some of the worst \\"hardcore\\" ever they are so unoriginal and at a complete loss of talent. live they stunk up it up worse than Atreyu did and as we all know they suck live. the album from ETID takes things to a whole different level, at least live i didn't have to hear that obnoxious whining repeated over and over on the album, overall this is one of the worst knock-off hardcore bands on earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"so much craziness.","review":"definitely one of the best bands on the scene - last time i saw them, i got my glasses kicked off my face the crowd was going so wild. they bring something new to a genre that needs new ideas. great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRACK LISTING","review":"1.

Not only that, but, my husband and I also think so. The music is wonderful: our favorites are Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and The Foolish Frog (sung by Pete Seeger) both children and adults will enjoy. It's such a huge step up from some of the trash that's out there. I highly recommend this DVD for young children. I can't wait to see what else Scholastic puts out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This dvd wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting it to be more like the cassette that came with our book but it wasn't. I read this book and played the tape with my daughter when she was little and it calmed her down so I thought the dvd would be a nice addition but the way they sang it was totally different. She had no interest in it. The other stories are old in production also. Wish it would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I guess the fact my 21 month old seems to like the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom video should be enough. I keep trying to like it because the idea of it sounds so cute. I originally bought a set with book and cassette tape. My son likes to listen to me read the \\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\\" rhyme but seems to find the drawings in the book uninteresting. I thought the drawings and rhyme in the book might improve with some snappy video animation and music--but the animation on this video is poor quality, cheap, and slow. My husband calls the video, especially the music, \\"odious.\\" So far, my 21 month old likes the first 2 cartoons on the video (Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and Trashy Town) but he won't sit through the final two (I can't blame him).

My almost 2 1/2 year old daughter is a bit of a Chicka Chicka Boom Boom fanatic, and this DVD is perfect for her (and us)! She has memorized the entire song, and even acts out the parts of the letters when they get hurt. I find the beat fairly entertaining myself, and even catch myself singing it under my breath at work. The other stories on this DVD aren't too bad either. She loves The Caterpillar and the Polliwog (or as she calls it, the pollihog), and our entire family finds The Foolish Frog pretty dang funny. I would definately recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it!","review":"My kids are 6 and 2, and this is one video they will both watch together. Chicka chicka boom boom is so catchy, I find myself singing along with it. We all like it a lot. My son also loves Trashy Town, which is about a garbage man driving around picking up trash in his garbage truck. The other stories are entertaining as well, but the first two are my kids' favorites. I like some of the Scholastic videos a lot, and this is one of my two favorites (along with Good Night Gorilla). I recommend it to anyone with young children. Also, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom helps younger children learn the alphabet as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what their second album is","review":"About 4 years ago when I bought this cd, I could not wait to throw it in my cd player. But after listening to the whole thing, I lost it, and never wanted to see it again. The lyrics and flow that M.O.P. offered was not the problem. It was the production. Besides \\"Stick To Ya Gunz\\" every production is terrible, leaving the cd to be terrible. But now M.O.P. second LP \\"Warriorz\\" is out, and it's a thousand times better, Primo made up for his crummy production and M.O.P. got out of their freshman slump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Send ya back to ToysR'Us 2 Get Your Cabbage Patched, Kid!","review":"Stick to ya gunz, featuring a disgusting Kool GRap is the best song on the album, and the quality is consitent throughout.

I couldn't get much past page 18 where she defined \\"te\\" like Yoda, \\"do or do not do, there is no try\\". To me \\"doing\\" anything deliberately and with force is NOT a part of practicing Tao, period. After that definition I began questioning everything I read. Too many of her definitions were based on absolutes and force. I started to read about te in _Simple Taoism: A Guide to Living in Balance_ and realized that Diane Dreher might not know what she was talking about so much. So I came here to see if this was true. From the first review I read, I'm satisfied that what I felt about her writing is true. I will return the book immediately.However, remember I didn't get much past page 18.

But a little self serving? In my life I have felt making comparisons is more harmful than anything. This book on almost every page says \\"A Tao does this... a non Tao person is this and that\\" I feel it puts certain people down because they are not one specific way. Being \\"One with the Tao\\" is not about comparison or elimination. I could not finish reading more than 60-70% of this book. There are however, some very good exercises for someone new to this, in that right I do recommend it :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much on personal politics","review":"I whole heartedly agree with the other reviewer on 'preaching militant environmentalism'. I, too, thought it was way out of place. The other disturbing aspect that kept me from focusing on the book was the smarmy comment about what a positive thing it was to be a part of an anti war movement during the Viet Nam war. Now, whether I agree or not, I just thought this was really pressing an opinion on a subject I surely did not buy this book for. Had I known these smug, self righteous opinions were to be a part of this book I would never have purchased it. Is it truly following the Tao by trying to inject your personal political agenda on others? Am I supposed to follow your path or find my own way?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a decent introduction to modern Taoism.","review":"This book has quotations from the \\"Tao Te Jing\\" interspersed with personal experiences amd anecdotes.I would rank about 90 - 95% of this book as excelent.Unfortunately; Ms. Dreher fell into preaching militant environmentalism in that 5-10% that I have no use for.I am 100% in favor of protecting the environment for future generations.

At the time known as Agnetha Bjorn Benny And Frida the group messed around with different techniques to find the perfect sound for the group. Although not found in this album there are a few songs such as :RING RING , ANOTHER TOWN ANOTHER TRAIN AND NINA PRETTY BALLERINA show that this rookie group could go far if they worked more on their melody. This is a reasonable beginning but not too flash. Definately not a very good ABBA album but still they were only just starting out and the albums after that pretty much showed how well they could be. Die hard fans will love it but the rest of us stick to greatest hits albums to get the better of the songs on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BEST IS YET TO COME: RING, RING IS A SOPHMORIC EFFORT","review":"I originally purchased this album on vinyl (anyone remember that format?) from a Swedish record dealer during the late 1970s. At that time an ABBA obsessive, I was rather confused as to why \\"Ring, Ring\\" had never been released in the U.S. After hearing the tracks on this album, I understood why Atlantic had chosen against issuing it stateside. While some of the songs, particularly \\"Ring, Ring\\" itself, Agnetha's compilation \\"Disillusion\\" and \\"I'm Just a Girl\\" are pleasant enough, others, such as \\"Rock 'n' Roll Band\\" and \\"Me and Bobby's...\\" are shockingly bad. To be fair, every ABBA LP contained at least one song that should have remained in the vaults, and this effort was issued very early in their collective career. The preponderence of awful songs on this album, however, makes it one to skip for all but the most die-hard fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite \\"debut\\" album","review":"Madonna and Britney Spears had great first albums.

That is very hard to beat. It does have a couple drawbacks though:The remote control is awful. I dont know who designed it but it needs some serious improvements. Buttons our in awful places. Many buttons you will need to use our so small you have to be looking at the remote right up close to find it. The other main problem is the loading time. Once you put a new CD or DVD in, it seems to take forever to load. At the menu screens, you press a button and wait for about 7 seconds.

No, my complaint is based on Universal's having released the set in the wrong aspect ratio; the releases are presented full-frame, despite the theatrical releases' having been shot (and exhibited) widescreen (naysayers can confirm by checking out DVD Savant's review). Would it have been so much trouble to have released nice, correctly cropped, anamorphic prints, especially since they would have cost no more to produce than pan-and-scan?

I realized about 10 minutes into the first disc that \\"Route 66: The Ultimate DVD Collection\\" was a low-budget, amateur production. Jittery, grainy, low-res video and warbling audio gives it the feel of a bad elementary school film, and the narrator's sleep-inducing monotone voice (along with the rest of the audio) suffers from a complete lack of EQ, mixing, and mastering - very difficult to understand.

They wanted to charge me $80 to have it repaired because apparently water got into the motherboard of the watch. My husband sails so maybe he had water splash on it on occassion, but he's never swam with it.

It is, however, the one used in a high end cookware stores to display their enameled cast ironware so I knew it had to be well made. I ended up buying a cheapy version that I had to assemble and I wasted $100.00. It was unstable and eventually twisted.So I ended up buying this stand from Amazon. The stand comes fully assembled and is very well made and stable. The Amazon price is excellent compared to competitor sites and the shipping price currently charged is extremely competitive. Other sites charge much, much more for shipping which adds significantly to the total cost.I find that when my Le Creuset collection is stored on a stand it is easily accessible and I am more apt to use it. Cast iron is wonderful to cook with, but extremely heavy to lug around, so when I stored it in my cupboards I found I didn't use it much.I'm delighted with this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"STRONG 6-TIER COOKSTAND","review":"I saw this in a William-Sonoma store, but it was heavy and hard to fit into my car, so I ordered the same stand for Amazon (free shipping!) and got it two days later. I'm pleased with the construction. It holds several potsand lids at once. I learned not to pile up skillets, bc the handles stick out, which makes for a loud hard clatter as they fall.

Something to consider - if you have small children or pets (like me), it might be kind of tempting for them. Fortunately my pets are older and they haven't paid much attention. Delivery took about 11 days. It did come sooner than the tracking estimate. Comes fully assembled, just pull it out of a large box. Very happy with it, and have received several compliments on it already.

Upon removal of the sticker, I noticed a dark rectangular area left behind. It almost appears as if the rest of the material 'faded' but the original, darker color was preserved under the sticker. I tried to wash it out, but no luck. Now of course I cannot return it. I am stuck with a very expensive rag at this point.

The Hardyz and Dudleyz was amazing. Some chairs and ladders, but plenty of tables. This match is one of the firstmatches that showed the WWF what the Dudleyz could really do and proved the Hardyz were great performers and No Mercy wasn't a one-time spectacle. The street fight was another amazing match and matches the Table Match as one of the best matches of the night. Tacks and barbed wire and blood forged this match into what I believe were HHH greatest performance and Cactus Jacks's greatest performance in MSG.

Throughout most of 99, the ppv's were pretty boring and preditable. The majority of Royal Rumble was neither boring or predictable. The introduction of Tazz was a great way to start the event. The swimsuit contest was very entertaining and the table match was spectacular. The WWF title match lived up to all of the hype beforehand. It was possibly the most hardcore match that has ever take place in the WWF. The use of thumb tacks and barbed wire is more recognised in an ECW ring. The rumble itself was a bit disappointing. After great rumbles from 97 and 98 it was a bit of a let down. never the less, it did not spoil a great PPV which renewed my interest in wrestling."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT RUMBLE!

All the matches were excellent from the very beginning, and it also came from Madison Squrae Garden, the base of WWF since 1985. The Street Fight was awesome, and proved that HHH really does have a lot of guts when it comes to performing, the Royal Rumble itself was tense and exciting, and even the mid-card matches were excellent, the Table Match stands out in this category.Howeevr, there were two things that let this PPV down badly. The first was the showing of Mae Young's puppies, what was the point? This completely ruined the atmosphere altogether. The second was the Tag Team Championship match between The Outlaws and The Acolytes. The atmosphere was here, and the match had some good spots, so I can't understand why it would end so quickly. Why not have a good, clean ending like all the other matches?However, despite these minor flaws, this PPV is definitely a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royal Rumble 2000 Review","review":"This is a very good buy, made back when WWF was still way on top of things there. Nearly every match was above average. The Tazz vs Kurt Angle match was a nice start for everything. Both the Hardyz vs Dudleyz match and the Cactus Jack vs Triple H matches have to be seen to be believed. Those two were worth the price of the DVD alone. Plus, the Royal Rumble match itself was, as always, entertaining. On top of that, Chris Jericho made his match fun to watch as well (as he usually does).

It was extremely annoying. Um, \\"For Dummies?\\" How about ONE exercise at a time. SHOW how to do it. Then do ALL the reps of that one until it's finished. THEN proceed to do the same with the next one. What is the purpose of mixing and matching them all up? I don't feel like watching it a dozen times through just to be able to follow it.

They are too quick and too complex. I do a Leslie Sansome exercise dvd for my warm-up and skip the warm-ups. It's really good that this dvd is set up so you can do that. The strength training exercises are much easier to follow, but she does not demonstrate a basic version of the exercise until about halfway through. Basic versions are shown only briefly. This would be an excellent dvd if the warm-ups were simplified and the basic versions were demonstrated at the beginning.

She does give \\"basic\\" modifications for some exercises, but even the basics were too hard for me.To be fair, I think this program is probably pretty good--and I will keep working on it as I progress in my weight loss program--but if you are are a true sedentary beginner and looking for something to get you started, you might want to try something else first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely NOT for the beginner","review":"Dummies.

The exercises are done at an incredible break-neck speed, and the camera angles vary constantly so it's impossible to see what she is doing. The video IS entertaining I admit, it's funny to watch someone working out so fast, but for someone who wants a serious beginners workout video, go get a TamiLee video. Because of the speed of the presenter, she has placed speed over accuracy. I just stood there ready to throw something at the TV.

This is also a great DVD for you if you're looking to do strength training and become more toned.The only thing I dislike about the DVD is that the warm-up routines are hard to follow.

Some great blues, but also some more poppy tunes like \\"Wrapping Paper\\" and \\"Anyone For Tennis\\" that will suprise and delight listeners. This is one of the best bands of the late '60s, and is still everywhere, appearing most recently in car commercials (\\"I Feel Free\\") and a computer commercial (\\"White Room\\").

However, Cream is not one of those bands, and listening to this disc reminded me how very rich and muscular the best of that period's music could be, before it evolved into art rock like Yes, and that ilk. With the exception of Clapton's work with Derek and the Dominos, and I don't think any of these guys ever played as well as they did here, and I can't say enough about how good these songs are, even the goofy ones.

This collection spans thier 66-69 carear together(I was born only a year after thier last song was published in 1969 so I missed 'em.). Songs like \\"I'm so Glad\\", \\"I feel Free\\" Where Ginger Baker played his melodic drum kit, and the haunting \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" as well as the ever classic hit \\"White room\\" and of course \\"Crossroads\\" are my favorite songs and easily stick in my mind enough for me to play the CD once more.

In there day,they were one of the best super groups out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Range of Songs","review":"The songs were great and easy to learn words to even if you are not a Cream fan by age.

I wish i could have bought my copy from here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential listening","review":"As someone who grew up with Cream, this album is a delight. Eric Clapton has always had the limelight, but to me the true hero of this group was always Ginger Baker. His drumming is like no other then and now (listen to 'we're going wrong' particularly). Jack Bruce was also under-rated, particularly on the live albums. His 6 string base lines can rival Clapton. This album features most of the popular tracks for Cream, with for me none better than 'CrossRoads'. However, 'spoonful', I'm so glad', 'Sitting on top of the world', 'politican' and 'born under a bad sign' highlight the blues roots of Cream and provide the best tracks on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"review of LIVE CREAM cd","review":"Ive yet to find any live Cream recordings that are any where near as good as Crossroads and Spoonful on Wheels of Fire. All the other stuff lacks the moral power of experiencing new space. Does anyone out there know of any other recordings that are on the same page ?

You can check the mp3 offer for this CD to see what songs are included. I purchased this CD used so I am not out alot of money. The audio quality of this CD is poor. There is no low end, there is no high end and there is no dynamic range. In my opinion this CD does not qualify as high fidelity. Not worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Sloppy Art and Poor Writing Insult the Series","review":"The orginal 8 episode Bubblegum Crisis is a masterpiece of great futuristic anime and one of my all time favorites. The art in this new version 2040 is a total insult to the franchise and looks worse than the Flintstones or Scooby-Doo. I mean you have these monsters that look like a paper cut out with a couple of holes and bolt, and none of the great writing that came with the original. I almost never bash anime but in this case the art is so bad it deserves it. It is like someone just picked up the title to make a quick yen and spent no time, money, or thought on it because they were counting on the fame of the original to sell it. I am sure they made their money because of that but this is truly the worst quality anime I have ever seen, yes, the worst. Don't reward these makers of junk who insult the awesome original Bubblegum Crisis."},{"rating":"2","title":"So starts the legacy","review":"This first DVD is awesome.

I bought and read the book in the early 80's and it is one of the books that I read every so often. It is fascinating in its account of ancient Rome and the gladiators as well as its story of the three individuals involved with Eugeni. I recently saw the movie \\"Gladiator\\" and it prompted me to pick up The Far Arena and read it again. I never tire of the story of Eugeni. If you can get your hands on a copy of this book, do so! You can't have mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!","review":"I was disappointed with this book as an experienced watercolor artist. I am in this field for > 35 years.

I only found very limited scope of discussions in his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got lost!!","review":"I am a beginner. I tried to follow this book and got lost.The explanations about the images sometimes did not illustrate the concepts. The focus shifted to something else.

But it is just not right for me.Probably it is only suitable for tropical watercolourists. Only one kind of light and shadow effect was mentioned. The scope was too narrow. No much I could gain as a watercolour painter. It didn't fit the word 'Mastering'. But I could understand because many 'so called' masters could not write proper concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"SpeedyLock--Nightmare","review":"I have wanted a serger for years and finally got one.The threading guide was helpful, but took forever (about 1 hour)to do. Finally, I was able to use it...but had such difficultywith the tension knobs. It was always either too tight or too loose. The tension control is really hard to operate and hard to get it right.I am returning the machine and going to look for one with automatic tension controls. It will make my life easier. DO not get this machine if you do not want a headache with the tension knobs because it may also ruin your project."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starter serger","review":"I've owned this serger model for over a year now, and I love it. It's easy to use, not too complicated to thread, and a good price. I've used mine on nearly 100 different projects, and have had no problems. The trick is to sit down and figure out what you're doing on test pieces of fabric before using it on your final piece. That's what worked for me. Then you can figure out your tension and differential needs from there. With a little patience and practice, this machine is great. It comes with a video, which I must admit I've yet to watch. I probably would like it even more if I sat down and watched the video. (Sadly, it's a VHS instead of DVD- my only complaint.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serger for beginners--not!","review":"I specifically chose this serger because it was advertised for beginners. I didn't want a machine with all the bells and whistles, I had some industrial-type sewing to do, and chose this serger because it was basic and fast. Okay, so it's fast. However, I highly recommend that if you are a beginner, you DON'T buy this machine. I was having so many problems that I attempted to contact customer service/technical support. Haha! Three or four days later I got a response that began, \\"Dear Ms Kerr.\\" I'm not Ms. Kerr. If she's reading this, the answer to her problems is that they're all her fault. The response I got did not address the questions I asked, and merely repeated what was in the rather inadequate manual. Oh, and I discovered the solution to one of the problems was to IGNORE one of the instructions in the \\"instructional\\" video (which was also very poorly produced). In short, unless you have serger experience and like threading and rethreading don't buy this serger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Embittered Darkness.","review":"Get this for the first six tracks and throw the rest on from time to time; though they're clearly outmatched by the initial volley of 'Embittered Darkness,' the others are worth a look or two from raw black metal fans. Purchasing this is a pretty simple matter: you either get Striborg or you don't, and none of his albums will convince you more than any other. Still, I'm inclined to say that this one is a bit more bearable than many others; check it out and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Australian Black Metal","review":"Truly one of the absolute worst black metal albums ever.

Cevin Key has always been an innovative producer, from Skinny Puppy through all his various side & solo projects. This album reminds me most of Doubting Thomas \\"The Infidel\\", perhaps my favorite Skinny Puppy side project. Lush instrumentals, great use of samples, dramatic song structure, it's all here.

From the first day it's been a well used toy. We've had it for two years and have since had a second child who is now discovering all of its secrets. It is very interactive, and there are many different ways for the kids to play with it. It's an object of intense fascination. My 1 year old sings along with it. Naturally, what I like best is that once you've covered the speaker port with packing tape, it's just the right volume: not too loud! We paid about 10 dollars for ours, but I would gladly have paid a 100 if I'd known just how much value we'd be getting out of this little piano. At $[...] it's a steal, especially when I consider some of the pricy, boutique-type toys that we purchased in the initial flush of parenthood and which are now gathering dust in the back corner of the kids' bedroom (we stopped making that mistake!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy piano!","review":"This was for our grandaughter, newly adopted from Guatemala.

I had been looking at it for a year, and it looked so adorable. When we got it, she loved it. We played with it for about a week, and it was awesome. She loved the lights and music, and I loved that it had actual pitches as well as pre-programmed songs and activities. Within a week it stopped working; I was hoping it was just the batteries, but all sound stopped short, so I feared it wasn't. I changed the batteries but it didn't help. In looking into replacement options, the cost of shipping was prohibitive, so we never got it fixed, and they are too expensive just to replace. So there it is. It won't make a peep, not even a flicker of a light. I have an adult keyboard and she likes to play on that, so I'm glad she still has a way to experiment with music, but I (and my aunt) were SO disappointed that her own little baby piano quit working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!","review":"I originally had this piano as a hand me down and it had several problems so thinking it was just because it was used I decided to buy a new one.

So I had it exchanged only the have the same thing happen a second time after two months. The third time it did it all over again so I gave up on it and sold it at a yard sale. Our daughter absolutely adored this and played it very very often. She kept playing with it even after broken, since the rest of it did. However the songs would stop the minute it \\"hits\\" blue keys, after a while she got annoyed. Now I'm pregnant with our second and this toy keeps \\"haunting\\" us.

Having a background in music myself, I appreciate the extent to which this toy teaches music. My only reservations about this toy are the sturdiness and the price. It has been durable enough for my toddler, but I wish it was another inch or two higher and the legs were slightly more substantial. That said, it has never tipped or fallen on my child.

I think it will continue to be a favorite for a long time. And the price is slightly higher than a lot of infant toys, but it's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"You should see our little man dance when he plays with this! It has a lot of different songs and settings, so you don't hear the same thing over and over. It even has a \\"learn to play\\" setting. (My husband and I are learning to play Itsy Bitsy Spider pretty well). I like that my son used it at 9 months, when he got it, and there are activities that will keep him interested for months to come. My only complaint is that it is fairly light weight, so we have to keep it against a wall so that our son doesn't lean on it and push it out from under himself and fall. If kids play with it seated it's fine, but our little man is learning to stand and walk, so try keeping him seated!

It is clear that many jobs Americans would do at a fair wage and benefits have been taken over by illegal aliens who are willing to work for substandard wages. There is no way present levels of legal immigration, illegal aliens and their progeny can be accommodated in the U.S. without changing the America we know and love irretrievably forever.Many argue that America has many open spaces and can accommodate many more people. That's a good thing because we are already projected to add 200 million more by the end of this century. At that point perhaps there will be more converts to the Wooldridge thesis, when it is probably too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great deck!","review":"this was the second deck i bought. this is an amazing deck, not only is it eye candy it is an amazing and acurate deck, i recomend this to anyone who collects, is a newbie, or a long time reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A detailed history of America's \\"second war of independence\\"","review":"The latest addition to the \\"Greenwood Guides to Historic events, 1500-1900\\" series, The War Of 1812 is collaboratively written by author David S.

In fact, it is one of the very first entries in that line of crazy stereo recordings. My old and worn LP is a lot of fun in stereo, but this CD release is the MONO version, thus defeating the purpose of even calling it a stereo action recording. While the musical arrangements are absolutely top notch, there is much less life in this mono version than in the stereo edition. Hopefully this will be rectified at some point in the future, but I doubt it. The rediscovery of cocktail music which led to its resurgent craze in the mid to late 90s has died down...too bad. I hope the stereo tape is not lost to the ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stereo Action","review":"This is an interesting orchestral Stereo action recording. There are lots of strings.

All the videos I've seen so far are of excellent quality.My real beef is with the menu system -- nothing special, just text over a plain background. You are given the option to choose a band and view the videos done by that band in order (chronologically by album), or you can watch all the videos done by either T&N or the imprint BEC recordings -- first alphabetically by band, then chronologically by album.

At times I had a real vision of their home, their neighborhood and daily routines. The only criticism I have with the book is the syntax. Some of the sentences end with a preposition.

I even saw them in concert in Aug. 1999, and it was a great show. However, they didn't play any music off of this album and there is a reason why. This is without a doubt the worst music I have ever heard. There are 9 songs on the album, and each one of them are terrible. The first time I listened to this album I laughed so hard that I was in tears. \\"Cold War\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Poisoning\\" are the worst.

This album seriously wounded the band, and the subsequent tour pretty much killed it off. It's really a pity that it came to such a disasterous end. As for the album, the only song that's really good is James Young's sole contribution Heavy Metal Poisoning, a funny, rocking take on right wing religious fundie types irrational hatred of heavy metal music (remember this was the 80's when heavy metal was \\"killing\\" our kids...now their target is rap music). Mr. Roboto is really annoying, and Don't Let It End is the worst ballad Styx ever did. This album is pretty much DeYoung's baby, and the tour was as well. They actually acted parts on stage inbetween songs on the tour (which was in arenas, not small venues), and the fans were furious. The rift it caused in the band never healed, even to this day.

However, I bought it for 3 dollars on vinyl and I don't regret it for a moment. It's worth it just for Mr Roboto. For the most part Mr Roboto is a pretty good song. Then at the end, it's utterly and completely ruined by the silliest ending I know. The singer sings \\"Now everyone can see / My true Identity! / I'M KILROY! / KILROY! / KILROY!/ Kilroy.\\" This may just sound dumb, but I swear that when I heard this I was on the floor in convulsive laughter. Indeed the problem that permeates the entire CD is that Styx took themselves too seriously. This is a very stupid story (for added hilarity, it is included in the liner notes), and the sound is so very dated that it's like watching a band's career crash like the hindenburg. Mr Roboto is the funniest thing I've ever heard, the album is terrible, make your own call."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the funniest concept albums ever made.","review":"Quite possibly the worst concept album in history, and boy there's a lot of tough competition out there. Essentially this broadway style musical masquerading as a \\"rock opera\\" has some of the most unintentionally funny music I've ever heard. The irony of this idiotic album: a rock opera as rocking and cool as a Cats revival concerning the fascist outlawing of rock music, is completely lost on the Styx boys, well Dennis DeYoung anyway. I love how DeYoung keeps singing about the \\"kids\\" comming across like somebodys dad trying to be cool while chaperoning a highschool prom. Had Styx purposefully made this a comedy it probably wouldn't have been as hilarious. As it is though, it's up there with Joe's Garage by Frank Zappa with which it shares the same theme, although we're not laughing with Styx, but at them. Not so much a satire as a farce and undoubtedly the source for much of the movie Spinal Tap and comedy band Ween's early career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, is this album bad","review":"The concept is horrible and completely unoriginal.

I am a keyboard fool myself, and like most 80's music this Styx album reflects the era. I have liked Styx since the mid 70's and this album adapted to the ever changing technology quite well. Volkswagon just recently used Mr. Roboto for one of their car commercials. If someone thought it would be cool enough for that it must be OK....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best Stuff From My Favorite Band","review":"It's difficult to give a bad review to my favorite band especially where so many reviewers who aren't even Styx fans trashed it already. This album was probably my second least favorite, Miracles being my least favorite. I like Heavy Metal Poisoning. I usually like JY's contribution on each album anyway. I have a live version of Cold War that is much better than the studio version. I like the reprise of Don't Let End more than the hit song. This album needed another rocker. There's a reason Styx doesn't play anything from this album live. Try Equinox or Pieces of Eight. If you like your music a little weirder, try Serpent is Rising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Concept","review":"I guess Styx were either copying Kiss' \\"Music From The Elder\\" or had some strange fascination with Meat Loaf because it sounds like both. The songs weren't the problem here, their is enough good songs. The biggest problem was taking this silly concept album and make it a Opera-rock show in concert. It was so ridiculous that it ended their popularity, just as it almost ended Kiss' with \\"Music From The Elder\\". But in hindsight it's a good record from Styx besides the amateur sci-fi storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was There...It Deserved To Be Trashed","review":"I had been listening to Styx for 6 years and had all of their releases when Kilroy came crashing through with Mr Roboto. I'm not putting anybody down for liking that song, but it and the majority of the rest had such a negative impact on the longtime fans. Mr Roboto in retrospect isn't *horrible*, it just isn't Styx if you know what I mean. Cold War is absolutely the worst Styx song of all time. I can't believe Tommy would write or allow such garbage. Don't Let It End is respectable. High Time is more garbage. Heavy Metal Poisoning and Double Life are the best 2 songs (written by JY of course). Just Get Through the Night is actually pretty decent. Haven't We Been Here Before might be acceptable if there weren't so many light songs already here. The real shame is they had the talent, proven guitar work and awesome drumming by John to avoid such a quick fall from grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more and better songs.","review":"Well, I bought this CD because I love Mr. Roboto and thought the story was interesting. The problem is the record doesn't stand on its own, unlike other great Rock Operas. The songs aren't that great and don't grab the listeners attention. The role playing by the different members of STYX isn't that intriguing. And it needs to be longer. The story begins after the interesting stuff has happened: Music is persecuted, Moral Majority takes over, people become reliant on machines. The bulk of the plot is listed as back story. How great would it have been to have a number by Kilroy while he's in prison? It just needed more. This would have been a great idea for a movie had the songs been greater in quantity and quality. I was hoping this record would rank up with the Rock Opera great such as the Wall and Quadrophenia, but it ended coming up quite short."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love Styx, skip this one!","review":"For all the reasons you could possibly love 70's Styx you could loathe this one for all the same reasons. This album has nothing that the classic Styx albums have. The crackling solos, heavy riffs and intelligent harmonizing vocals are replaced with a mechanically overproduced overly eighties approach which lacks substance. With DeYoung doing what Lionel Richie did to the Commodores, this band didn't stand a chance after it was reduced to a ballady sappy sad shell of a rock band. Listening to this album is about as pleasurable as a root canal. It acually makes 1979's Cornerstone sound like a good album, and that's hard to do. I love Styx, so I prefer to think of this as a DeYoung solo experiment gone dreadfully wrong. 'Nuff said, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kilroy was definitely here...","review":"One of the best albums by Styx; a good mix of soft and harder rock, with some great vocal work and harmonies.

There was nothing wrong with their music before, and it's not like they were going poor. Don't Let it End was a nice ballad, and Tommy's Haven't we been here Before? was a slow relaxing track, but that just doesn't cut it. Double life was kind of funny in an interesting way, but that's it. The rest is just disco as a lame attempt to get popular. Maybe this was the reason Tommy left for Nugent and Spades. They were back on the trail in '99 with Brave New World, but from 83'-98', Styx was on a big break from music. Welcome back Styx!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kilrory should have stayed home","review":"Styx keyboardist Dennis DeYoung finally acknowledges that he'd rather be writing broadway musicals than rock albums on the ridiculous 1984-esque \\"Killroy Was Here.\\" Styx was getting pretty desperate in their fight against musical irrelevance by this time. But DeYoung's attempt at \\"significance\\" is a laughable. Granted, the title song has good guilty pleasure appeal, but the rest of it is simply disposable.

And he will come up with a bunch of points like 50 points in a game which is ridiculous.Fourth, whenever the player attempt an unsuccessful steal or blocks the shot of the court, it is counted as a turnover.The only thing improvement from the previous games is in terms of the fast break and the inside scoring moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG u guys all suck","review":"OMG OMG OMG NBA LIve has crrrrrrrazy graphics. awesome just totally awesome. u stupid retards out there r really stupid.

Overall his theology is okay, but then again, some of it was off kilter. When I'm reading a book I'm looking for a) original ideas, or b) old ideas reiterated in a fresh way. This book had none of the former and a few of the latter. Two books concerned with the relation between the manger and the cross that I'd recommend over Ayers' book are Christ Our Mediator by C.J.

Hopefully, the next set will finish off where this one missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"FRED & GINGER - Still the best","review":"Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, their names go together like peanut butter and jelly even after 70 years. No other dance team comes close.This set has four of their five best films. If I had my choice, I would substitute \\"Barkleys of Broadway\\" with \\"The Gay Divorcee\\", but I guess they had to have something special for Volume II (in \\"Flying Down to Rio\\" and \\"Roberta\\" they weren't even the top billing).The wonderful humor in these movies has not lost any of its charm after all these years, unlike many of Groucho Marx's jokes which are dated. And of course the dancing will always be timeless. If you are a fan of musicals, this set is a MUST!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnificent Collection!","review":"This beautiful box set of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies include: Top Hat, Swing Time, The Barkleys of Broadway, Follow the Fleet, and Shall We Dance.

A definite buy for any Astaire and/or Rogers fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need More Ginger","review":"This collection is way overdue! There is a great deal of deserved credit and comment given to Fred. So, what about Ginger? There's some, but not anywhere near enough. This was a PARTNERSHIP! Each gave a great deal to that end, and without each talent, we wouldn't call them the most favored of all dance partners.So, for the other 5 of their movies, let's have some more Ginger, especially in the Carefree DVD. And, let's have more of Ginger's other great films on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"They omitted Gay Divorcee","review":"I can't believe they did not include Gay Divorcee, the first and one of the best of the Astaire-Rogers productions that included the classics, Night and Day and The Continental.The Night and Day dance number is one of the most exquisite dance sequences ever choreographed.Pandro Berman must be sick in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"These were not worth buying","review":"I saw all of the movies in this box set and they were all boring. Don't believe the hype. I read the reviews on this box set and they were wonderful. I bought them because of the reviews and boy did I ever waste my money on such bad movies. Save your money and do not buy this box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"years ahead of their time","review":"Odd, charming CD. Alt.country meets chanson (or should it be chansonne?) in the form of singer/songwriter/guitarist T. Durbin and his partner Bernadette Colomine. Band name presumably refers to the French nightclub dance routine - not Native Americans per se. Literate, idiosyncratic songs, perhaps best conveyed by some of the song titles: \\"Merle's Cravate,\\" \\"Last Night I Was Bad Person's Plaything\\" \\"My Baby - Il Est Souvent Au Lit,\\" plus covers of \\"Je N'Ai Besoin De Personne En Harley-Davidson\\" (the Brigit Bardot song) and Cole Porter's \\"I've Got You under My Skin.\\" Durbin and Colomine's second effort appears as \\"Shoofly.\\" Definitely worth taking a flyer on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Look into Life","review":"This book was outstanding and superb when it came to telling a story. I was moved deeply and found myself crying after I finished reading it. I gained a deeper understanding and I felt emotions that were portrayed by the author. I actually had the opportunity to meet Elizabeth Jaranyi and I was put to awe with her stories and incredible strength. She is a wonderful person and tells an amazing story that brings the past alive and it haunts me to this very day what happened to all these people and it gave to a better understanding of the long term effects on the people and the generations to come. I thank her for writing this book and allowing the rest of us to learn from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Massage Music!","review":"I first heard this CD while recieving a massage a few years ago.

Issue after issue, it's nothing but \\"beautiful\\" celebrities (an \\"overkill\\" with Penelope Cruz in every issue); what celebrity got married or divorced; overpriced fashion; jewelry; make-up; hair-do; etc. People in English has similar contents; but it also has stories on current events, politics, and other news worthy stories.

Amazon said i could not return unless it was in new condition. if it was in new condition, i wouldn't need to return. they (amazon) suggested i try to sell the wetbags as \\"used\\" on their site. anyone want a non-functioning wetbag?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stitching unravelled after first wash","review":"I ordered two of these. The size is perfect for taking on outings and I thought I'd love them. However, the serging inside the bag unravelled on both of them after the first wash (in the washer, not dryer)! It was very disappointing! Happily, I was able to return them for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon is great...this is Meh","review":"Not a bad little player for music...However the interface is very outdated and has horribly crappy battery life. The biggest drawback I found was when listening Audio books it constantly lost it's place.

This is a bit of snoozer. Not Judith Ivory's most exciting romance, and she's written some great books. But this one....well, nothing much....happens. Doing a load of wash ended up being more interesting.James came across as a stalker in the first half, and I didn't find his intentions very honorable. I thought he was a bit creepy. I am also not fond of stories where the heroine justifies selling sex for an income - although I was aware this was the story line before I picked it up. Guess I should have followed my gut.As far as the age difference- I didn't see what the big deal was. They were both adults- what's 7 years? 15 years would have been an age difference. They weren't even a generation apart. I just didn't think this was remarkable, even for the time period.I didn't finish the book, so take my review with a grain of salt. Maybe it improves in the second half, but I'm off to put the clothes in the dryer now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wasn't interested!","review":"Normally, I really enjoy Judith Ivory's books. I even thought the twist that the heroine was older would make the book more interesting-- have more depth etc. However, it was just plain boring. The hero was not the typical romantic \\"hero\\" and I guess that is what I really didn't care for. I like being caught up in the whole story, the whirlwind romance etc and this was just not that story. I've read some of the other reviews and agreed that if you need the torrid romance, the suspense, the damsel in distress etc then this is not the story for you. Obviously it wasn't for me but that doesn't mean it won't be for someone else-- well then fair reader.. fore warned is forearmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual, Unique and compelling-highly recommended","review":"I've read literally hundreds from this genre and this is one of the most unique books I've run across. It is set in Victorian England but the psychological perspective from both the hero and heroine are easy to identify with, deep, almost profound. The struggles both emotional and mental are engrossing. I found myself staring off into space really thinking about their world views and perspectives. You care about these characters almost immediately and Judith Ivory has a gift for painting characters in such a way that you have a strong sense of not only what they look like but also how who they are inside. It's as if their essense glows from the inside out and affects how others perceive them. I really enjoyed this book. The plot is very unique and you are never quite sure (especially since the heroine is adamantly opposed to the match) how it will turn out. I can't remember liking two characters more. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular, gripping, sexy!","review":"The sexual tension in this book never let up. I was enthralled with the hero, a real man who knows life from the perspective of an explorer, yet who, when faced with the woman of his dreams, finds himself old-fashioned in every way -- protective, possessive, and determined. Judith Ivory has captured the essence of sexual obsession and devoted love. You must read SLEEPING BEAUTY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 4 1/2 stars.......","review":"Aaaahh James, what can I say? He was everything the perfect hero should be. Perfect in his physique, his style, intelligence, coloring, he always said the right thing and loved her with no doubt in his mind or yours. Judith Ivory wove a very different tale from your usual romance novel. This book read like a waltz. I dropped 1/2 a star for the quickie ending, but I've found that to be somewhat of an Ivory trademark. She spends so much time on telling the story in such depth, that she suddenly faces a deadline and nears what should be the last page and she rushes to just settle the conflict quickly and neatly. I'm no expert, but if Ivory could get around that problem, she'd be a keeper in my book.That being said, I still highly recommend Sleeping Beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad.","review":"How embarassing. You'd think these guys, most of whom who claim to have been great enough to earn co-arrangment credits along with Van Vliet, would be too busy creating their own fine and dandy material to have time for stuff already 30+ years old. Use the Mallard name again, produce some NEW music. Eh?Don's moved on, shame they haven't.John French, you're talented & smart! Why in God's name are you making an ass of yourself by poorly imitating the Captain's vocals? They were given the chance to tackle the stuff again, why not leave it at instrumentals?

Contrary to another reviewer's opinion, this book is NOTHING like the Feynman lectures. Those books are so well written they can be read and understood by people with no background in physics. This text is complex and elegant in some places, but not something I would really recommend for a beginner (ie. someone unfamiliar with abstract models of computation).

Unfortunately, some people lack the required intelligence or background and some probably both to understand such good books and for this reason they give very bad rates. I accept that this is not an easy book, but what I don't accept is to rate a book with 1 star since you couldn't get what it gives.This is one of the best (or at least one of the few) book on theoritical computer science. It is worth to buy it even for the np-completeness chapter that you cannot find anywhere easily. It touches the hardest subjects on this field, and it is of course not an easy book.

The book starts easily enough with an introduction to sets and languages, but by the time Chapter 3 rolls around, the writing degenerates into the hectoring style of Russell and Whitehead... pages and pages of non-intuitive academic proofs, and making simple concepts needlessly complex in the name of Formality. The concepts the authors are presenting are fascinating, but in order to get to them you have to spend way too much time shuffling symbols. By the time we've made it to Chapters 6 and 7 (the good ones) we've lost most of the students in the muddy bootcamp of Chapters 3 and 4.Don't buy this book, and don't use it to teach; the Sipser book is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"The book is comprehensive. It is however not easy to follow and even simple concepts are hidden under mathematical terminology. More time is taken up understanding the math than is needed to understand the concept.

There are too few solved examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor explination coupled with insufficient examples","review":"This book is a poor choice for the student who does NOT already know the bulk of this material. The authors claim to make this material open to the undergraduate with \\"no special mathematical experience\\", however they have done little to achieve this goal. Instead, we have brief introductions to specific topics, lengthy proofs of already established theories, and little to help the student in their efforts on the advanced problems. To compound this misjudgement, there are no solutions, partial or full, nor hints to the problems, as many qualified books provide. The unfortunate part is that misguided professors will choose this book based on its title and claims, not its shotty content."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book written for students","review":"This is one of the worst book written for students I have ever seen.

I don't know how or why two obviously educated people can write a book that is so lackluster. This book turned my course into an absolute nightmare. I instead turned to another book, which ended up saving me.

I think it is written well, and is not to difficult to follow if you have a background in Computer Science (in my school, shout out to Stony Brook, this book is used in a 300 level course). However, the book's examples are to few and far between, and there are no solutions to the problems at the end of each chapter. It's hard to recommend this book as a text for a course, but I think it would make a good supplement. If you are taking a class in theory this could give you some additional insight. But go to the library, don't spend the cash.And also... who the hell is this geek on the cover? It doesn't reveal his identity anywhere in the book.

His analysis encompasses not only the rise of steroids and other 'performance enhancers' but answers the questions...why? how? when???! His coverage of labor negotiations, the umpires strike fiasco, the birth of Long Ball adoration, and scathing portrayals of the commissioner and club owners does the best job I have read in making sense of the past decade in baseball.

Often, these issues are glossed over or discussed perfunctorily in a talk-show format. The media will discuss the issues and note them as a concern, but there is also a game on tonight.

I then purchased the Sanyo DWM-370 and it does EVERYTHING that I wanted from a DVD player. Unlike most of the other DVD players out there that offer so-called MP3 player capability, the DWM-370 is the only one I've seen so far that will actually list the Directories/Sub-directories/FULL song names! If you can find the Sanyo # DWM-370, get it before you waste your money on an Apex/Sony/etc that just don't compare.

The combination of the harshness of Buzz's guitars and vocals paired with Lustmord's wonderfully built soundscapes makes this record one to be enjoyed by many.

It's too bad it doesn't come with soundclips somewhere because I never would've bought it if I had been able to preview.To mix ambient with that gawdawful metal is a failed experiment in my view.

This is among Fairport's best, with rockers and ballads deeply rooted in traditional songs. Sandy Denny's vocals are haunting throughout (she quit the band after the recording), and Richard Thompson's guitar stellar and stinging, but always within the Brit-folk and Celtic idiom here -- no Dylan covers or contemporary rockers. The lead instrument throughout is really Dave Swarbrick's ever-present fiddle, which snakes in and out of the melodies and dances with Thompson and Denny. It's been a long time since I listened to the album in its entirety, and it's great to hear it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still wonderful listening after all these years!!!","review":"Liege and Lief continues to be my all time favourite album of all time!!

The vocal melodies, while simplistic and repeat a bunch of times, are interesting enough to keep my attention, and interesting enough to tell a good story. The female singer is really good. Some of the arrangements are really good as well. They can let loose and jam out with the best of them.Fairport Convention sound like they were big fans of Bob Dylan's style of songwriting at the time- sing more or less the same melody over and over while changing the lyrics each time in order to build a story for the lyrically-minded people. An album worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasing","review":"This album is a good addition to my collection. It is sweet and makes good music to cook to. i would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charm in the Simplicity","review":"This CD is reproduced from the LP of one of the very first folk rock groups that drew directly from English-Irish-Scot lineage. On it is a rousing rendition of the ill-fated & adulterous affair of the farmhand Matty Groves with the Lady of the House; an atmospheric version of the vampire Reynardine leading his victim over the misty mountain; and the intiguing Tam Lin, with a text replete with alchemical-like references. The rock backup music is a bit primitive judging by today's standards, but there's charm in the simplicity. Highly recommended for the folk/ethnic music connoisseur. Oh yes--the bonus track Sir Patrick Spens is a wonderful folk ballad. Sandy Denny's purist vocals provides the perfect delivery for this material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Harmony","review":"One of the best Christian groups.

It did confirm some things I already knew, i.e. you need a plan, you need to keep active and you need to keep healthy. These are hardly new concepts.

It lacked any meaningful advice or planning tools for self discovery. It is great reading for the American aristocracy. But I don't qualify."},{"rating":"1","title":"Act Three (if you have lots of money)","review":"I was eager to read this book, but quickly discovered that most of the advice and insight provided really only would only be helpful to people who are dripping with money. Not everyone can afford a psycho-therapist or a consulting firm to give them advice on making the transition to retirement. How many of us can afford a private spa to cool off after workouts? How many of us can expect to find diversion in retirement by being on the board of directors?Also, in several places you will find the myth that people who don't work have a meaningful life. This is absolutely not true.The one plus for the book are the resources given Appendix B. Some of the things listed look like they have value to the non-wealthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Body Toning","review":"I like this workout for its full body approach. The first part of the workout is standing pilates work. Some is a like ballet, and some is like old school aerobics. Together it's a fun routine that is not hard to follow. It gets my heart rate up a little, but not enough to really replace a cadio workout. The mat section is pretty short, but it does have a few exercises for most of the major groups. Some of the exercises are difficult especially the first time, but there are some modifications. The people in the workout are colorful and not that annoying, and the guy playing the drums for the workout is very entertaining. I think this is a great workout for cross training days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"I've been doing pilates with an instructor 1:1 for a few months.

I bought it for the pilates so I expected the pilates to constitute the main portion of the video...it wasn't!! The short session of pilates was the video's only saving grace.And what's up with the cutaways to the drummer when you are trying to follow the routine? The music is not the focal point of this video, the exercise should be. I recommend the Hilary Burnett's Matwork series for true pilates - it's excellent and challenging.JennB(Barbados)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout","review":"I found this tape to be great and easy to follow. I used this everyday and a combination of running a couple times a week to lose post baby weight. It combines pilates moves with an elevated heart rate to burn calories.

First of all, I agree with the reviewer that said that this is not for those with \\"sensitive knees\\" (like myself). Mine were aching by the end of the video (and not the \\"good\\" kind of workout ache). I was also turned off by the other \\"class members\\" on the video--they look like strippers. I've never been to a gym where everyone looks like THAT. The instruction was poor, form was not emphasized and the video feels more like power yoga than real pilates. I'm going to try to return it for a different DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners","review":"I bought this video to supplement my regular running schedule and use it on days when I can't make it to the gym or outside to run. It's not intensive enough to make me work up a real sweat but I think it's a nice way for a beginning exerciser to get the blood flowing and to elevate the heart rate. If you are looking for a serious core/ab workout, this isn't the video for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Intermediate Level Workout","review":"Yes, so it may not be the most Pilates oriented video, but it is a workout. Neither too easy or too hard, I reccommend this motivating video for anyone who doesn't want to make a trip to the gym. Excercizes are modified for beginners and advanced people can use weight to reap the benefit. Unlike some video, this does not get repetitive and really makes working out fun. Combining dance with abdominal excersizes is a great combination. Try It!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not pilates","review":"This is more of an aerobic workout than pilates. The instructor continiously trys to convince you that you are doing pilates but really you are doing aerobics. There is a short pilates mat workout at the end that is good but the rest is not pilates. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to Change it Up","review":"I have a few pilates tapes that I quickly got bored of.

The cardio is horrible, i didn't break a sweat at all. The foot work made me pull something in my leg so but yet after that i continued doing it because i thought well its probboly just a muscle getting used to working out again but no. It's hard being 16 trying to get fit because you need way more cardio. This dvd is called \\"fat burning\\" pilates, my only question is wheres the fat burning? the abbs part is a killer but besides that its not worth it. Your better off with Crunchs's Dance Party dvd, now thats fun and makes you sweat."},{"rating":"1","title":"UCK... Not worth the money... CHEESY..","review":"I have alot of dvd/fitness videos and this by far was returned before I opened it. I borrowed it from the library and after 3 minutes shut it off... The dvd had a good concept but I don't believe it was anything close to true 'pilates'... The outfits were CHEESY and just enough to cover the private parts etc.. the models in my opinion did not look really fit and the outfits did no justice... I was surprised of the poor production on this crunch dvd..usually I like their product... Don't waste your hard earned money on this one... I don't usually write reviews but had to step up on this one.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Blended Workout","review":"The instructor, Ellen, is friendly and gives easy-to-follow directions, and the video is primarily cardio-pilates, with a great mat workout at the end. It was initially challenging, but has become easier (and still fun).The camera work is decent though sometimes the directing bothers me, especially when getting an artistic pan (shot) of the room - or the drummer - interferes with my ability to actually see what the instructor is doing.I sometimes use the DVD for just the mat workout - situps, buns, stretching. Overall enjoyable, especially if used as part of a rotating series of exercise DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great workout from Ellen","review":"Ellen is definately my favorite instructor. This is another great workout which is relatively easy, yet effective. You do lots and lots of squats, which REALLY helps to get your thighs buff fast...take it from me, I just had a baby. The squats are bearable though because she breaks them up with alot of standing moves to work your abs. Overall, if you learn how to maintain correct \\"pilates posture\\" (which she reminds you to do through the video) you will get great results from this, especially if you are a beginner. For intermediate to advanced, this is great for a \\"light day\\". Also I highly recommend Ellen's \\"Burn and Firm Pilates\\" for those of you who want more intensity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"This is an overall good workout. It seems simple but its effective. The only thing I do not like is that when a new move starts the camera is sometimes focused on the drummer so you do not know what to do, unless you have done it a few times. I have not used it long enough to see any actual body changes but I know my heart is benefiting from it. Also, for someone who dislikes fancy, complicated moves, this suits me well."},{"rating":"2","title":"crunch fat burning pilates","review":"I think that this video is a fun video and effective at the same time. You feel like you have done your workout, but don't feel like you have worked yourself to death. It is enjoyable, and moves quickly so you don't feel like you have been doing the same move forever. Worth my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have it on VHS","review":"I love this workout! I can tell when I've had a bad day and I'm tired because I can't get through the first part of the mat exercise! My legs just shake! I love the burn, and I know that means it's working!Also, very fun! Makes the time go fast. At first, a bit hard to get the rythm, but once picked up, I feel very coordinated!Love it, plan to get it on DVD when my VHS burns out. I'm also curious about the pilates/yoga blend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout","review":"I really loved this workout.It builds up a sweat, works out the abs and the music makes the whole workout a breeze.

It sure is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone/","review":"Hard to follow and there were moves I could tell if you did this video often you could really hurt yourself. I don't think I like the crunch line to be truthful. They are affordable though. It was just not my kind of workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Well....","review":"Fat Burning Pilates is a combination of aerobic exercises and Pilates exercises. Pilates professionals with extensive Pilates method training know that Pilates IS aerobic when you practice intermediate-advanced levels with the right energy and rhythm. So, why dilute the power of real Pilates with various exercises that Joseph Pilates never practiced? Yes, it is certainly good to cross-train and enjoy various physical activities. But cross-training during a single Pilates workout will not get you the full and excellent benefits of the Pilates method.If you practice real Pilates with the energy and discipline that Joseph Pilates taught his students, then you will be ready to go on and do some aerobic activity after your workout. Or vice versa, you can do aerobics then Pilates.There are principles involved when practicing the Pilates method. If you ecclectically mix real Pilates with other excercise techniques, then you will forfeit many of the great rewards of Joseph Pilates' method."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Variation on Real Pilates","review":"The production is good. But as a studio owner and certified instructor from the New York School, I see a growing division between traditional Pilates (the way Joseph Pilates originally created his method) and variations of traditional Pilates. This DVD is a depiction of nontraditional Pilates. The exercise orders are not Joseph Pilates' original exercise orders, there is not a seamless flow between exercises, and there is music playing. Joseph Pilates did not play music because each exercises has its own rhythm, dynamic, and tempo to be determined by the instructor during a given lesson.It is important to protect the public interest by labeling products properly. Most other professions have a state licensing board to protect the public interest, but the art and practice of the Pilates method does not. To properly describe this video, perhaps video producers should call this workout a Pilates-based exercise routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Fat Burning?","review":"Here is an important fact: when someone first starts learning Pilates, it is NOT possible to burn fat. There's just too much to learn at the beginning of your Pilates studies, so your heart rate and respiraiton rate do not have an opportunity to rise above certain levels. Even for $11 plus change, this video cannot achieve what its title indicates.This is just a Pilates mat video; it does not include Pilates equipment. The Pilates equipment helps your muscles work more deeply and vigorously (when first learning the method) until you understand the method well enough to complete an intermediate or advanced mat routine. When you can perform an intermediate or advanced Pilates mat workout proficiently, THEN you can get your heart rate up and gradually burn fat.After giving this DVD a close look, I have to say that Fat Burning Pilates cannot deliver on the claim explicit in its title."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"I originally bought this years ago in VHS and needed to to upgrade to DVD. As far as the workout goes, it is excellent. I have many, many workout DVD's by many different instructors. Ellen Barret is by far my most favorite. She is very easy to follow along with. I never feel as though I am falling behind or don't understand the moves.The exercises are simple and she narrates very well. With all her DVD's I have after doing them a couple of times I only need to listen to achieve the workout. I don't need to constantly watch the TV. Which makes for a better workout.If you are looking to start a new exercise program I would wait on this one. It is long. About a 45 min runtime. I would start off (and I did) with \\"Crunch- Pick your Spot Pilates\\". After a couple of weeks then slip this one in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant sweat session","review":"I would absolutely reccomend this workout for those who want to come away feeling wonderful after a workout and actually able to get on with the day without feeling like you've just been thrown under a bus. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the camera person focuses on the bongo player just when Ellen is cueing us to a different exercise move. This happened a few times during the workout and caused me to lose my focus and had to \\"catch up\\". Ellen is wonderful and delightful to workout with! She helps you feel good about your efforts no matter where you are in your fitness level. I discovered her trying out the Zen Workout she produced on Fitness T.V. and realized when I was done that I've never felt so good and \\"relaxed\\" after a workout! My mind and body really did feel transformed. Keep up the good work Ellen! I'll keep working out with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd","review":"This dvd is odd. I am a huge Ellen Barrett fan but this was a no go for me. Firstly, what's with the drums? There is a man playing bongos (or something like that) throughout the entire dvd. It's not relaxing at all. Secondly, it incorporates a lot of aerobics. If you are looking for a pilates dvd and you like Ellen, try the one in in the crunch series where she is wearing the pink outfit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best, and way too repetitive","review":"Definitely an interesting idea for a video - cardio mixed in with Pilates work. But I have to say that the cardio section is pretty disappointing. I didn't feel that it did a good job of working different muscle groups. All of the movements were based around doing squats...over...and over again. I think my thighs got a good work out but I'm not sure about the rest of my body. And the movements in the cardio section were extremely repetitive - to the point where I completely lost interest and was just counting down until the end of the section.The (very) brief mat work portion of the video is better, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who hasn't done some pilates before, as the instructor doesn't give very detailed instructions during this part.I'll still bust out this video when I want a change in routine sometimes, but I'm always instantly reminded of why I don't like it. One of my least favorite crunch videos so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"No taste then after taste","review":"I was looking for some apple snacks and read the good reviews on this brand so bought a 24 pack. I just received them today, opened up a package and I am enormously disappointed. They are crunchy, as the package said, but this is where the good points end. They do not have a very strong apple taste, in fact my first thought was 'burned' something. I don't know why but this was how it tasted to me. Also, after each bite, there is a mildly bitter after taste. I have tried several dried apple products and have never experienced a bitter after taste until this product. I am very sorry to have wasted so much money on so many of them. For anyone who still wants to try them, I will give you a tip - they are sold elsewhere on Amazon.com in a package of 12 instead of the 24 sold here. 11 would have been a lot easier to get rid of than 23. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy!","review":"These are sweet and crunchy and I love them.

UNFORTUNATELY I UNDERSTAND THAT AMAZON WILL NO LONGER CARRY THIS PRODUCT. THIS DISAPPOINTS ME GREATLY. ALTHOUGH THESE ARE EXPENSIVE, I WOULD STILL BUY THEM JUST FOR USE WHEN HIKING OR BIRDWATCHING.

It also managed to slice my hand open as the arm broke off its pivot point and whacked me.

Sometines it breaks the clay target maybe 1 or 2 out of a box of 90. Which I can live with. Even the launchers at the club do that.

I do, however, believe some of her discussions about social and emotional issues were lacking and in some ways, outdated. A particular example of this is her explaining what to do about coping with bullys. I found it appalling that in this day in age, her advice is to warn the bully you will strike back, and then do so upon further harassment by the bully. \\"Take one final swoop\\" and then go find a grown up. Sounds like an outdated mode of coping, one that in today's society would get you suspended from school, at the least, fatally wounded at the worst.

It's the story of the Inquisitor Eisenhorn. The book is rich, lavish and vivid in details, and it brings the book to a \\"reality feel\\" (and that's hard to do in a fiction). I gave Hereticus 5 stars, since it brings back an amazing story (Xenos style) and has lots of twists, the first half of this book is amazing, and is the best part of the whole trilogy, it has a unique reality feel, it's sad that the Eisenhorn trilogy had to stop here, Dan had finally the perfect balance of story telling, description and style with this book. The book will please anyone from a new fan to a old WH40K expert.

This still stands as one of the best though. Nearly all these artists were popular when this was released in 1990, and many still are. When you can get Eurythmics, Springsteen, Pretenders, Mellencamp, Sting, and Madonna on the same collection for a cause, you can't go wrong. Plus my two favorite tracks from U2 and Stevie Nicks. The Run-DMC track seems to be the most popular from this, and though I like it, it is rap, and tends to stand out. Be that good or bad is your call. Overall I actually like \\"A Very Special Christmas 3\\" even more, but this first one is still very special."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of the series","review":"To me, the first time is always the best. In this series of Christmas charity albums I mean. However, I am horrified at the other reviewers who repeatedly state that the best tracks on the album are Madonna's version of Santa Baby (please - Eartha Kitt where are you), and Stevie Nicks' Silent Night (sung like she is going to fall asleep - and I like Stevie Nicks). Whitney Houston is alright but come on - The Pretenders' version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Sting's Gabriels Message and Alison Moyet's Coventry Carol are by far the best tracks on the album (in my humble opinion of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"One bad thing about ordering something like this is you can't see what the content is.

The best song on this, hands down, is \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" by The Pretenders. Quite possibly the best version of this song I've ever heard. Also good shows by U2, Eurythmics, and Bob Seger.My one complaint is about Stevie Nicks' version of \\"Silent Night.\\" She takes out the lines, \\"Christ the Savior is Born\\" and \\"Jesus Lord, at thy birth,\\" and replaces them with, \\"sleep in heavenly peace.\\" I really get irritated when religious Christmas songs are changed to sound more secular. And this is coming from someone who isn't religious. It's just a pet peeve, but it ruins the song for me. It's otherwise very beautiful, and if she would have kept with the original lyrics, it would have been perfect.Madonna and Bon Jovi do nothing for me, but I've never liked those songs anyway, so I'd skip over them regardless of who sang them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best in this series.","review":"I agree with those saying this one is the best one. I play \\"Merry Christmas Baby\\" by Bruce Springsteen til I cannot get enough. I love most all the songs on this cd. And Run DMC's \\"Christmas in Hollis\\" was just great. Love it. I have some of the others in the series also. I do recommend the one with Chris Cornell singing \\"Ave Maria\\". He has such a deep, rich voice. That is the 3rd one, I think, the gold one.

Those who are looking for justification for the reconciliation of homosexual practices with the Christian faith will probably be pleased with this book, at least part of it. However, it should be noted that as I recall the author has been removed from the Roman Catholic priesthood since the publication of this book. In addition, potential readers should be aware that this book not only defends homosexual practices but at least implies a defense of pederasty. It claims that Christ approved of a sexual relationship between a Roman centurion and his servant who was likely only a boy. I think few on either side of the homosexual debate in the Church will welcome this interpretation, particularly coming from a former priest in light of recent events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Convinced","review":"The Bible reveals the character and purpose of God.The Broken Image by Leanne Payne was much more helpful to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading for every Christian","review":"Great book, easy for the non-expert to follow.

This is an excellent introduction to the subject of what the bible says about homosexuality. It is thin and easy to read but still pitched at an intelligent level. Helminiak states up front that this is not intended to be an academic tomb; therefore the book, while well researched, keeps references to the appendix.Using the historical-critical method of biblical interpretation, this book asks and answers the questions: \\"What did the authors of scripture mean by their prohibitions of homosexuality and why were these prohibitions made?\\" and \\"What relevance, if any, does this have to today's world?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hum, which Bible is this man reading?","review":"This author is twisting what the Bible states about homosexuality.

The acting is cheesy 1969 the camera work is cutting edge for the time and the plots take you back to that golden age of childhood. I was not of the age to be partaking of the adult audience's vices, but I still thought the show was funny. Now as an adult I enjoy looking back and catching the inuendo humor. None the less, this series was fantastic and if you were a fan of the original broadcast, you'll enjoy this.Strengths: All episodes on 3 DVD'sWeakness.

They ranged anywhere from 23 minutes in the early 80's to 25+ minutes in the 50's and 60's. These shows (clocking in at just over 21 minutes are *obviously* a surreptitious packaging of the syndicated series as re-released by Nick At Night. Beware. They did this with Alf and without ANY warning about it. I don't know what's missing from these shows: it's been too long. But Alf lost some of its funniest lines thanks to the re-editing.

To be able to lay there watching this with the kids was truly wonderful - to enjoy this simple yet fun movie, with no hint of bad language, mobile phones, computers etc was an experience I will cherish.

I use all the features including the calorie counter and the feature that measures calories burned during a workout. I have compared the heartrate monitor to all of the other heartrate monitors in the gym (attached to the bikes and treadmills)it has always been within 2 beats per minute of those. There are a few things to know before you purchase one: they are a bit large, it sticks up off of my writ quite a bit and tends to catch on things; when I first got it it was uncomfortable because of the size it tended to hurt the top of my wrist and hand; also, the petite band is pretty petite, I have it on the last notch and it fits OK but would be more comfortable if I could move it one more notch. Overall I would highly recommend this tool. It has helped me safely lose 25 pounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Mio Shape Select is awesome!","review":"I love being able to take my heart rate in seconds without having to wear a chest strap.The watch is easy to program, easy to use, easy to read- even in the dark or underwater with the backlight.The calorie counter is also very helpful (and motivating!)The only delta is that even though I ordered it in the petite size, the face of the watch is still rather large and at times slightly uncomfortable to wear because the large watch face limits wrist movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Heart Rate monitor watch","review":"I really love it. The band can be a little uncomfortable. I haven't figured out how to track calories burned yet, but I am working on it. It is awesome for making sure I stay on track with my heart rate when I am working out. It is a lot easier than trying to count my own heart rate over the sound of my treadmill or bike going. I like the fact that I don't have to strap anything around me either."},{"rating":"2","title":"MioPINK is cool","review":"I really like this watch. It's a little big larger than I expected, but I like the instant pulse readout and timer features. Kinda pricey... but I guess you get what you pay for, and overall, it's a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mio - Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"Okay, I have owned the Mio for 9 months now and I agree with all of the above complaints, it is not accurate, it can be difficult to run and check heart rate at same time, it's big and clunky looking, etc, etc.My biggest beef is that this watch broke 6 months into the game. The heart rate monitor got stuck and rendered the watch useless. I returned it to Mio (with my $10.00 check) and 2 months later, i still have not got my watch back. I complain regularly and they reassure me that it is being repaired in their factory. They assured me that finally after I threw a fit, it would be shipped last week. still no watch. The watch not only sucks, but the company sucks as well. save your money and buy an ironman."},{"rating":"1","title":"mio pink watch","review":"The band is not made for small wrist women, it's made for children. It does not always pick up your heartrate. It's difficult to use since you have to take your heart rate during your workout.

My only complaint is that the finger sensors that read heart rate sometimes take two tries to read heart rate...but I have a similar problem with hard held heart rate monitors...maybe it's just me.I would buy the Mio again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Accurate","review":"After struggling with heart rate monitor straps, this watch is a dream. It is so easy to use and will provide your heart rate without having to stop running.Only drawback is that numbers are a little small. But, all in all it is a great product and I highly recommend it for runners who don't want to deal with a chest strap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Buy","review":"I easily overlooked all of the issues that other people had with this watch. It was close enough to being accurate since I was not looking for soemthing exact. My two complaints are that it was not waterresistant at all even though it claimed to be and that after buying a new second watch that one broke within 4 months. This is an unrelaible and cheaply manufactured item. Spend a little more and get a watch that has a chest strap. They may be tedious but they work and they dont break down"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stopwatch will work better","review":"Though the concept of a Heart Rate Monitor without a chest strap sounds convenient, the MIO is of absolutely no use during your workout. You have to stop your activity (be it running, biking or walking) to measure your current Heart rate, as your hand has to be steady. The calories feature does not measure the calories burned accurately and was off almost by 100 calories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Waster","review":"I read all the reviews and thought, OK- mixed. no problem. The wristband was small, but fit- I have small wrists. It's actually not that large of a face (I have many watches that are MUCH larger)- Those weren't the problems. It's that it doesn't work! It was hard just to get a reading sitting down...trying to get a reading while working out- impossible! you have to be completely still for this bad-boy to work.Sent it back- waste of money. Don't waste your time, spring for the Garmin, you'll be a much happier person and much more intune with your heart rate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so \\"heart rate monitor\\"","review":"What a complete waste of money! I received this as a gift... Tried it out for a couple days - did quite a few workouts with it... I couldn't get a heart rate reading EVER!!! What is the point of having it if I can't pick up a beat? Don't bother... Even the feature about tracking calories and such - way too much work and wasteful. Just get a regular monitor that goes around your chest and a little notebook for a food diary. This watch was a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only It Worked","review":"I had been researching watches with heart rate monitors for a while before settling on the Mio. It had everything that I wanted and I loved that there was no strap to wear! However, that might also be this product's biggest flaw. The petite size fits my wrist nicely and all of the stopwatch and timer functions are great, but it refuses to give me my heart rate unless I'm standing perfectly still (and have been for a while). This watch will not measure my heart rate while I'm exercising or walking. Even getting a reading immediately after a walk is difficult. I thought about returning it, but still need a stopwatch for workouts, so decided to keep it. Still, I had been hoping for something so much more. Not exactly the product that I had imagined. If you need a watch that will give you a reading during a workout, this isn't the product for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh ! what a joy devine.","review":"This wonderful CD dominates my car stereo.

It claims that you can upload video to your computer. However, there seem to be some issues with Windows not recognizing the camera. I have done numerous reads now on this through the internet (wish I had researched this area before buying the camera) and it is either a problem with the Win XP Service Pack 2, the IEEE1394 firewire (which JVC doesn't give a cable for this if you do decide to buy a firewire that will work with the JVCs) or the capture card, which does not seem to come with the camera, but they admit on a JVC site that it is needed. Why they haven't worked out these problems yet, I don't know. But if you google \\"computer won't hook up to JVC camcorder\\", you will find that it is a big issue with many JVC owners.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid!","review":"I think what makes this book so hard to put down is that it provides so much detail on a previously unexplored topic, life inside one of the most amazing shows on earth and the performers within. I would not recommend the book unless you've seen the Cirque, because the athletic and artistic skills of the performers cannot be described in a book, and you won't be in sufficient awe of them without having seen them perform.The fact that the Cirque itself seems so closed to mainstream media makes this book all the more alluring. Schreiber earned the performers trust through genuine friendship and only then do they open up to him. And Mark's developing friendships with the performers makes a good backdrop to learning about the peformers - their backgrounds, versatile and brutal training, and their ecclectic personas.The story does ramble a bit at time, but returns quickly when it does.

There's so much in this movie: The Lord depicted as a little girl, and a older shepherd, Jeremiah crying for a sign from God, then appears Baruch, the torture of the king, the jails, etc.More of God's prophecies could have been part of the movie, but that's okay.

I've only heard of him in passing so watching this movie was an all new experience for me and I'm very glad that I watched it.Patrick Dempsey played Jeremiah and brought him to life for me on screen. He went through so much to follow what God had asked him to do, even though he was scared, even though he was timid. Dempsey brought him to life in just the manner needed.The movie is one to watch if you don't know about this story. I think it's one that needs to be told far more often. Jeremiah tried to save the people of Israel and they failed to heed his warning, but were given a glimmer of hope that is fulfilled later on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremiah","review":"Of 'The Bible' series by Lube Productions, this has to be one of their finest. The scene where Jeremiah, who at the start of his priestly ministry, prophesied to the assembled worshippers and the dissolute King was one of the most profound I have seen. Patrick Dempsey is well cast for his role as the unflinching prophet who contends with spirital apostasy, political intrigue and the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. (One can only speculate, but I would dearly like to see a film made by Lube about Elijah!). This film is a worthy addition to the video library of anyone who likes Biblical dramas. Care and attention was paid to historical and Biblical accuracy, without the sleaze and 'extra-curricular' activities indulged by many earlier films about the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning about animals is REALLY. LOTS. OF FUN (toot toot)","review":"Whoever sang the songs that this train plays has really earned her dough. She warbles, she falsettos, she vibratos.. she sells it, man. She's a much more enthusiastic singer than the woman in the Fisher Price Fake Noah's Ark, I tell you this much. I really appreciate when someone goes above and beyond the call of duty for things that don't really matter, like singing a stupid animal song on a kid's toy.The toy itself is good, as well. My son loves to throw the gorilla at me (I think the Gorilla is actually from the fake Noah's Ark) and my daughter likes to throw the little chimp at my face. It teaches hand-eye coordination and.. ?I'm not sure. Learning about animals, I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for everyone.","review":"I got this toy for my son when he was learning to crawl to motivate him to go after that. It did that and now 10 months later he still has a blast with this toy. He is 16 months old and doesn't play so much with the animals but with the main train part. He loves to push it everywhere, even though it can go on its own. He also loves listening and dancing to the music it makes. This toy is very durable and great entertainment for children while teaching children through song about different animals.The only complaint, as others have mentioned, is that the back part of the train does not stay attached. This part of the train ends up buried in the toy box more often than it is found attached to the train. However, a great toy no matter how your child choses to play with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choo-Choo Train","review":"Adorable, bright, strong, and big train set! Larger than I imagined.

It arrived within 2 days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for toddlers, but not much educational value","review":"This classic toy from Fisher-Price will likely delight kids 7 or 8 months and older. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my first-born when he was 7 months old and he got hooked on it right from the beginning. It moves and it sings. The \\"come aboard the anmial train\\" song can get tiresome to an adult quickly, but apparently kids don't mind, which is good. There're actually not many ways to play this toy, and it has very limited to no educational value, but I have to admit it's a fun toy for babies and toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TOY !!","review":"I bought this train last year for christmas for my 7mth old son he loved it then and even more now.

Bargain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine didn't work right!","review":"I was so excited to give this to my 10 month old for Christmas. He loved it! However...it didn't work right. It's supposed to move in one mode and be stationary in the other. Ours moved no matter what position the swith was in. When we put the volume on the lower setting it couldn't be heard at all, you could only see the smokestack light up, but no sound. AND when placing animals in the engine in the front...NOTHING happened. We even tried pushing the panel down ourselves...didn't do anything. The box said it sang 5 songs...ours only sang one. Yes, I made sure the tag you have to remove to make it play in normal mode was completely removed, and I even put in brand new batteries. I returned it and got a new one.

She's having alot of fun with it. It's a toy that she can grow with. Right now she plays with the train in the stationary position, and I imagine as she gets older she'll want the train to move. It's very durable, she tosses the pieces all over! The sounds the toy makes are not nearly as annoying as some toys. ( Like a certain puppy she received!!!) I also felt the toy was a great value . It's one of the nices toys she has. I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Song Will Drive You Nuts","review":"My son never really got into this toy, which is ironic because he got like three of them for Christmas from various relatives, two of which we took back. He was only 6 months then, but is a year now and still doesn't really care about it. Maybe it's better for older kids as others have mentioned. The song it plays is nauseating at best. What is it with the voices on kids toys? Why is it a rule that if it is for a kid the voice has to be sickeningly obnoxious? My son likes soothing, normal sounding voices. He is weirded out by loud, annoying songs like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another plastic noise maker with no purpose","review":"To be fair this toy has proved durable... and the animals that come with the train are posable, rugged and nicely designed... but the train is too loud with a very limited selection of annoying electronica music/singing. Not sure what kids could possibly learn from this toy. It looks \\"cute\\" and seems like a good idea... but has limited play potential... I'd suggest just buying some animals and a wood train and playing with those... the electronics don't add anything. Very typical of Fisher Price toys these days... all plastic with lots of pointless and annoying electronica music/singing and almost no educational element. Save your money and buy something quality elsewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great..","review":"In store, it looked neat & I was happy when my inlaws bought it for our son last Christmas when he was a newborn, but I figured by 6 months he'd be ready to enjoy it. I was wrong, as he's now a year old & still doesn't really care for it. The songs are catchy, it runs on carpet, but that's about it. The animals that come with it aren't really much of anything & have very little movememnt with them, my son actually isn't a fan of the clicking noise they make. He's enjoyed putting others things in the train, but that's about it. Doesn't seem to care about the music or the movement, even when we've showed him. Overall, it's one of those dreadful in the way toys that always end up under your feet. After Christmas, I look foward to finally being able to pack the train away just to have it out of the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"I was really excited to get the Fisher-Price Amazing animals sing and go choo choo for my grandson.

I am disappointed considering how well its rated and the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and annoying","review":"We got this toy as a present for our daughter's 6-months birthday. She is turning 1 year now and still is not interested in this train. The music is too loud even on the low setting and the songs are just annoying. The animals are very heavy and hard to manipulate. Most of the animals don't have much range of motion (except the giraffe). I personally have hard time finding educational value for this toy - just a bright plastic noise-maker. I have never seen my daughter pick it for play from her toy collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not engaging","review":"I purchased this toy for my six month old based upon the great reviews it received. My son who is now 9 months still has no desire to play with this toy. At first, he liked taking the animals off the train and putting them in his mouth but to be honest I have found that this toy has to be put away until he is more around 18 months. Then maybe he will like moving the train around the room but I doubt it. My son is more of an auditory and tactile person than visual. It was not worth the expense. The best toy out there are the rings that hard plastic rings that can link together and that are easy to carry with him and the soft toys he can put in his mouth. He plays more with my dogs Ty Dolls (beanie babies) because they have more texture varities to them than even the soft teethers for baby do. I hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it, but....","review":"i got this toy, and we love it!!! from my 3 year old to my 8 month old.... unfortunatly on day two of owning it, one of the elephants ears fell off.... so while i'm disapointed with that, i'm still very happy about everything else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fisher Price is the best!","review":"I saw this product in a local store and ordered it here due to the lower pricing and no shipping cost. Fisher Price makes the best children products and we have always been satisfied. This product is no exception. I purchased it for my 7 month old but my 3 yr old seems to like it just as much. It sings, makes animal sounds and runs by itself which we hope will encourage our 7 month old to chase it when crawling. Excellent product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Fisher-Price Amazing Animals Sing & Go Choo-ChooMy granddaughter (10 mo) has as much fun pushing this choo choo as watching it run on it's own.

She also takes the train apart but hasn't started putting it back together yet. There are a lot of toys here, all the legs are moveable, as well as the elephant's trunk and ears. The monkey rattles. Music and lights too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Fun, and Entertaining Toy!!!","review":"My mom bought this train for my baby when she was born. It went along with my safari themed room and I absolutely love it. It's really cute and very entertaining to my daughter. Since then, we have bought all the other peices to the train and it makes a really fun and adorable toy. She's now 10 months and plays with all the animals and loves to watch the train move across the floor. The animal noises and movable parts are also great aspects of the train. I recommend this toy to anyone!!!! So does my daughter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute toy","review":"My 2 year old still loves this toy. She has played with it since she was 9 months old. It is a very cute toy and seems very durable. The animals are really cute as well and their legs click as they move them. A very young baby would enjoy just holding the animals and moving their legs. It is very easy to operate and comes with settings that control whether it moves forward or stays in one place. It is very easy for a young child to start as they just push down on the the smoke stack (I guess that is what it is called). It has a cute All Aboard song it plays as it moves forward. It has other songs too for when it is in the non moving mode. It seems a little on the pricey side for what it is, but I think it has been worth it since she continues to play and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing and Go and Cover your Ears","review":"The only problem we see with the toy is the singing voice. It is not very pleasant. We bought this for our granddaughter and her dad immediately felt this was going to be hard to listen to over and over again as his daughter played with it.

The toy seems like something that could be enjoyed for many years and would be good for creative imaginations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big hit at our house!","review":"My 8 mo old son got this for Christmas and was instantly in love with it, and still plays with it all the time at 1 yr.

Very well made, durable and colorful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute animals","review":"My 6 1/2 month old really enjoys watching the train go by (there is an off switch feature too). The plastic Monkey, Elephant and Giraffe that came with the train are really cute and their parts move. However, she can only chew on the animal toys at this stage. Also, the song can be a little repetitive but is easy to learn (my 5 year old can sing it verbatim). I would recommend this toy for an infant who is already crawling and can follow the train on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not run on my carpet.","review":"I did not request this toy for my son, but got it anyway. He does like trains, but doesn't really consider this a train. He pushes the button to get it to move and it doesn't start up right away and then it struggles on the carpet.

I would say it is one of the cutest toys for toddlers on the market right now (being that Fisher-Price has been my favorite brand for toys). Very educational, it gives the kids the sense of rhythm, all of the animals have moving parts. I do not agree with other reviewers saying that music will drive you crazy.

Great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for a 2-year-old","review":"My daughter received this for her 2nd birthday, and it's been a big hit with her. She is a little scared of the train, but she loves the animals. We've been getting her more used to the train by putting the animals in and then sending it off down the hall. She runs after them to \\"rescue\\" the animals :-) Then she goes and gets the train so we can do it all again. It's a fun toy for increasing fine motor skills (pressing the buttons), sensory awareness (the animals have different textures on them and make sounds when their joints are moved) and visual perception if the child is trying to take animals out of the train or put them in as it is driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Biblical Case For Limited Atonement","review":"John Owen was a Puritan theologian whose writings are powerful and deep. His love for Jesus and his love for Scripture shine through in all his works.

Did Jesus die for the elect or for the whole of humanity? Is the atoning work of Christ for the salvation of all of mankind or only the elect?No arguments, no questions, no passages of Scripture are left untouched by John Owen. This 312 page book deals with every facet of the arguments for and against limited atonement. I would encourage anyone to read this book and if you are truly part of the elect (2 Peter 1:10) then you will truly enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death of Death","review":"This book is difficult to read due to the facts that it was written over 200 years ago and so the language is difficult to plow through.

His are simple poems of love, the countryside, clouds, mountains, rivers, about the absence of Leonor, his beloved wife, who died early. This is the Spain which suffers in silence, without the tormented and exhalted screams of other poets, like Leon Felipe. The small towns and cities where Machado spent most of his life come alive in his easy, lucid verses. As said before, the absence of Leonor covers his poetry with the longing of persons, places and things long gone. Not experimental, urban, or visionary poetry: only the intelligent reflections of the poet on his surroundings, past and present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antonio Machado-Selected Poems","review":"I bought this collection of Machado's poems after enjoying \\"Last Night I Had a Dream\\" from a different anthology. This edition has both the Spanish and the English translation on facing pages, and knowing very little Spanish, I had to read them in English. Machado's poems are achingly beautiful when he writes of his native Castile in Spain; I can't judge how good the translation is to the original, but the poems are certainly beautiful in English. Selections from his proverbs require quite a bit of reflection, and here I felt at a distinct loss at not being able to read the Spanish.

One of the group members Larry meets a young lady, whom he calls Peter Pan, online. During a game on the internet, she suddenly disappears and Larry is convinced that there has been foul play. He and his friends try to solve this mystery and they find themselves in a lot of trouble and in the middle of a murder investigation.In this computer age, this is a very interesting book to read. The young kids, inspite of all the trouble they got into, persisted in solving this mystery and it was exciting to read about their adventures and how they finally solved this mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very helpful perspective","review":"I thought this book was very helpful with its ABC approach at helping to stop the behavior that leads to the binge. Its model of a chain helps one figure out the path that lead to the binge right from the begining of the day and learn how to prevent it. I would suggest this book to anyone that is looking for a little bit different approach on overcoming binge eating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and beautiful","review":"Romulo Gallegos, one of the best South American writers, splendidly describes the Venezuelan plains and the passionate love that emerges there. Dona Barbara -a ruthless and tough woman once hurt by men- symbolizes the wildness of the plains and Santos Luzardo -the polite and sensitive doctor from the city- the opposite side of the same coin. They meet at the plains and develop a wonderful story of love and power, surrounded by the most beautyful landscapes of the world: The venezuelan plains.You wont be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Civilization and Barbarism again...","review":"The archtypes in Doña Bárbara are a little to spelled out for the reader. Gallegos seemed determined to guide all critique of his novel to one outcome. Barbara representing barbarism and Santos Luzardo representing civilization. It is also an interesting view of the Llano venezolana. This work, published in 1929, was written well before Gallegos became president of Venezuela, and thus views the governmental power as inept and currupt. Good vs. Evil, Witchcraft vs. Modern Thought are themes that occur if one is interested in such things."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book EVER!! A reader from Erie, PA","review":"Dona Barbara is the best book ever. Its very intense and overriding but at the same time soft, mysterious and full of intrigue.

It is the sort of book I should imagine some men drool over - a beautiful murderess constantly undressing and making love as he peeps through uncurtained windows, then she marries her victims and kills them. There is no real belief that one person could follow someone through life and never be spotted and never really lose his quarry. There is no engagement with the characters.Certainly would never read another book by this author. Relieved that I can go back to my satisfying Norwegian thrillers, my Donna Leon's, Michael Connelly et al."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped Off All Over Again!","review":"Good golly, with the film being as bad as it was, was I insane to even attempt reading this book? Yeah, probably.At least in the book, the characters' motivations are explained in much more detail and are more understandable. Also, the Eye is twenty years older than Joanna (who's bisexual in the book and has meaningful relationships with women) and follows her for about a decade instead of six months. Things that were difficult to understand in the movie, like why he stops her wedding to the wine mogul, are fully explained in the book.Unfortunately, being able to understand the characters doesn't make them any more likeable. It's a tawdry tale with an excessive amount of gratuitous profanity. And, like the movie, the ending really STINKS. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Different than the Movie","review":"Since this was a novel that a movie had been based on (not a novelization,) I had high expectations. I (though I have never quite figured out why) have always loved the movie form of Eye of the Beholder, I thought I would love the book as well. However, I was greatly disappointed.The movie is about as different as possible from the book. The Eye in the book is much more unbalanced. In the book he follows Joanna Eris for purely selfish reasons whereas in the movie he is trying to help her. In the book, he intentionally kills at times where in the movie were totally accidental. Even though most people found the movie to be quite bad, the book was even worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"The Nutshell Murderer dollhouses are so mesmerizing with their mix of innocence and the macabre that it's no wonder the filmakers felt they had to share them. Along with telling the story of the dollhouses, they tell the inspiring story of the woman who made them, Frances Glessner Lee. Lee is a forgotten pioneer in modern police and forensics techniques, so it is wonderful to see her story told.The best part of the film though is how the filmmakers feature and follow real detectives and forensic pathologists doing mundane, thankless--and definitely not glamorous-- work to find justice for murder victims and their families. Their dedication to their work is very moving.In the end, I feel this is a film about passion. The passion for creation, deduction, and justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"shame on the author","review":"Diving into maya 6 unexperienced, without an aid is terribly confusing, but diving into maya 6 with this book is not that much better -- it is like a nonswimmer being thrown into the deep end of the pool with a deflated lifesaver.Sure, the directions are pretty easy to follow, but the problems arise when there are MISSING directions! I was having a headache trying to get something to work like it supposedly did in the book, when I realized that the author FORGOT to include a vital step! I would not have been able to get ahead if I had not figured out the problem on my own (through trial and error). Shame Shame SHAME on the author!

I sincerely envy this photographer's daily life, and at the same time thank him for sharing with us his passion of capturing the many facets of male beauty. These youthful models are not offensively erotic and a pleasure to behold. These black & white images clearly demonstrate what a talented eye Lozon has for showcasing these young and muscular men in very provocative and arresting photos.

The stand for the fan holds the batteries. The whole battery compartment tilts down to form a U-shaped stand/leg for the fan. As soon as I started to tilt it down the whole battery cover popped off. It's only secured by a few tiny tabs. There is no way the battery compartment is anything approaching water resistant. There is no way you could use this in any kind of rainy or wet situation. I'm not saying it should be submersible. I'm merely saying that if rain got on this fan in any way it would be done for.

I do not recommend this fan if you want to use it with batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Installation requires a Miracle","review":"I bought this fan, model 1054, for use in our tent. But we can use it only at home, plugging it in with the adaptor. The battery compartment is poorly made, and as you install batteries they keep popping out. Also, the contacts don't line up correctly, so even after I got all the batteries in, the cover wouldn't close because one battery sticks up somewhat.I wish I had returned it for a refund, but we had taken it along on our trip and discarded the box, thinking this would be a GOOD and USABLE fan. Paying so much extra for the battery option was a waste of money and very frustrating.The model # 1078 has a much better battery compartment; we have it; it works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have burned down my house","review":"When it worked it moved quite a bit of air for a fan of its size but after about a year and a half of light to moderate usage the resistor for the switch burned out.

Recently however, the D batteries I have been buying don't fit properly in the battery compartment!! The bumps on the plus end of the battery are too short to reach across the partitions that stabilize the batteries in the holders. The bumps on the Walgreens batteries I buy have been reduced from 0.115\\" to .075\\". The old ones work and the new ones don't. The Energizer alkaline batteries I have on hand don't work either.

The box also clearly states it is a model 1054, so I did not receive the wrong or a substitute product.

When I used it with the A/C adapter it got so hot you could hardley pick it up. The fan itself moved very little air. It is so little if you hold it just inches from you you can barley feel the air. This is the worst fan ever. If its not on your lap when you use it forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fan!","review":"We usually camp out in the spring early summer or fall, instead of trying to camp out when it's super warm out. We decided to camp in July and bought this to help make the tent more comfortable overnight, and when we were in there in the rain (!!) It was a great investment. It folds nicely to pack easily, and had a great amount of air movement, especially during the rain, when the tent was muggy inside.The batteries were really tough to get in. I wouldn't have marked it down for that, but they were so tough, I thought I'd break the unit putting them in. Other than that, it was a great unit and totally worth the price.

We planned on hanging it on the golf cart to blow air on us as we played golf. The fan was quiet which was very good for the golf course, but it did not move any air. The blades on the fan are small which I believe is why you can't feel any air flow unless you put your face right up to the fan.

I installed a bracket to hang the 02-Cool fan in our bathroom window, and use it most of the time without plugging it in to the 110v outlet, as the outlet is too far away from the window to make it easy.

For the price, if you don't need battery function, you'll be disappointed, and this is a waste of money -- there's better fans, cheaper at Walmart, etc.If you want a battery fan, and you want as large as you can get, this is the best fan I've found. We use it to run in a car if we leave the dog behind in mildly warm temperatures, but don't want to take any chances. The batteries last a while on the low setting; it runs on 8 D's.Airflow is good, not good if it was compared to an AC fan, but excellent compared to other battery fans in its class.Finally, just to be clear, the 5 stars is based on what it's sweet spot is -- batteries. I am not including it's performance on AC -- didn't try it, not interested, and I can see how the electronics which are basic could get overloaded with AC power which other reviewers have said."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE","review":"I ordered two of these fans.

Dana Hill portrays Sherry, the oldest of their four daughters (a very young Tracey Gold, Tina Yothers and Viveka Davis round out the other children).Sherry is old enough to see what is happening, but too young to handle the aftermath. I believe that a Washington Post critic at the time, said Ms. Hill's portrayal was the finest adolescent dramatic performance ever filmed. One would be hard pressed to argue that point.Keaton and Finney were both nominated for Golden Globes. For the amazing dramatic peformances alone, this is a must-see.

It really upsets me to see her cardio workout, it's not fun at all, the music is ugly and not variety at all, maybe this is oriented for people who don't know a thing about latin music or dances but please don't buy this thinking you are going to learn latin moves, cause you wont.

Well, Cardio Salsa is lots of fun, but my heart rate didn't get above 130 the entire workout. I did burn a couple of hundred calories though and it definitely kept me moving.The dance combinations were fairly easy in the beginning when she takes you through the seperate steps and got pretty intricate when you put them all together. I have NO rhythm, but was able to follow along with most of it. I imagine after three or four viewing, I will be able to follow along better and that should increase my calorie burn and help get my heart rate a little higher. I felt like I got a nice light workout that made me sweat. There wasn't a lot of jumping around, which my knees definitely appreciated.This is definitely going into heavy rotation at my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"Great workout but I can't do more than 20 minutes.

She keeps talking about feeling the rhythym, they need more fun beats to lose yourself in. I am not quick enough to pick up all the steps when she is teaching them, it is easier when they are all put together. Coreography is fine, but the step by step process trips me up. I was expecting this to be better, more fun. It was more frustrating than it was fun. The only reason you break a sweat is trying to keep up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Workout","review":"I teach an aerobics class in junior high and have purchased many tapes to get an idea of things to do and also for my own workouts. Most of them pan around the room so you don't always know what you're supposed to be doing or use routines that change quickly, don't repeat and are too hard to follow. Watching this routine, you would think it is easy, but when you try to do it yourself, it really gives you a workout. The steps are low impact, but it is really strenuous after a while. The feet and arms of the leader are always in the picture so you can see what she is doing and most of the combinations are easy to pick up. It's a good workout and is not boring like so many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cardio on a new level!","review":"I am not used to working out and am new to workout videos and this video has not yet failed to challenge me! Some of the steps are a little difficult to do and/or to modify with my knee and ankle problems, but I still love doing it! For me it is important to have fun while I'm exercising, but it's more important to exercise! This video takes the work out of working out and you can actually use the moves on the dance floor! I am sometimes a little sore in the legs after doing it, but it's the good kind of pain and I feel like I'm making progress by using this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much fun","review":"I didn't care for this workout video. It was a bit cheesy and over the top. I tried a couple of the moves and just couldn't get into it.

However it does not qualify as a workout- too easy and you barely break a sweat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow","review":"I bought this DVD hoping to improve my dancing skills while also getting a workout. Either I have 2 left feet, or this DVD just isn't as easy to follow as its editorial comments suggest (\\"not difficult to learn\\"). I own many other aerobic workout videos and have no trouble following them. This one, however, at a fast pace, without slowing down to teach each one. Overall, I am disappointed and I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"High energy workout that burns calories without high impact","review":"This is a high-energy workout that was easy to follow and not to hard on your body while still burning lots of calories and breaking a nice sweat. (I have been nursing a foot injury for the past 7 months and kept up just fine--I just left out any hops/jumps.) It was a nice balance of aerobics and dance, leaning towards aerobics. I thought the instructor did a good job of starting with basic foot patterns and then adding hips, arms, more steps and cha-chas, etc. If you don't have a dance background or haven't gone to many aerobics classes, you might get lost in a few places, but just remember that as long as you're moving, you're burning calories! If you want a break from your normal aerobic routine, give this DVD a try. I would even consider buying this one.P.S. As a fun side note, this video also features the same stoned drummer in the background that I am pretty sure was also in the \\"Yoga Booty Ballet\\" video I recently rented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult for beginners","review":"I bought this DVD hoping to add some variety to my collection of excercise videos. The music is good and the instructor is energetic, however I found it's rather difficult for someone who is unfamiliar with latin moves or someone who does not do advanced aerobics. After about 2 months I can only do some of the moves, despite watching the video in slow motion and rewinding a lot (to figure out how she does the dance steps). I would recommend this DVD only for those who are experienced in dance or have had extensive experience with aerobics."},{"rating":"1","title":"shrug","review":"This is an ok aerobic workout.You'll get your heartrate up.I don't really recommend it though.Here's why:- hard to take seriously. Which is ok, but I don't think they're trying to be funny, which makes me feel bad when I have to laugh.- music could be.. better.- girlfriend's feet move faster than a ferret on speed. Which is impressive, but hard to mimic. I take comfort in the fact that many of the backup dancers drop some of the steps too.- It's a pretty long workout. I usually have time for about a half an hour at best, and we're nowhere near the cooldown at that point.When I finally made it to the end of the video, though, the cooldown was a pleasant surprise. Very nice. Kind of relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"When I watched the short clip, her accent irritated me somewhat but I got the dvd anyway. After receiving the product & going through the workout a couple of times, I find her much more agreeable than even Jennifer Galardi, i.e. inCrunch - Fat Burning Dance Party.She's more natural, yet personal. Would look out for more of fitness/dance dvds.In terms of the workout, it's pretty fun & the moves are not hard to follow.Not the best latin dance instructional vid, nor is it the best fitness workout, but it strikes a fair enough balance to be worth trying out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to follow","review":"I was very excited when I first got this in the mail but as I went through it, I got more and more disappointed. It was very hard to follow the instructor. Unless you are already familiar with the salsa dancing, you will get lost!! If you can keep up, it will give you an intense workout, but good luck. I do not recommend this DVD to the average person trying to lose weight!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So where are the moves?","review":"This video hypes all the great dance moves it is going to teach you... The salsa and mambo steps are very basic and the rest of the material is just boring. The hand movements are rather comical. The music is OK, but not particularly inspiring. I get much better dance moves at my gym class. Money wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Workout? what workout?","review":"I wouldn't consider this a workout--unless you call \\"marching in place\\" exercise. I was hoping to learn some dance moves while I burned calories, but I got neither. The instructor moves WAY too fast and doesn't spend enough time teaching the moves. And even if you can master the moves, the workout itself isn't strenuous enough to really get any results. I seriously doubt that any of the other \\"class members\\" got their rock-hard bodies from doing this workout. That brings me to my last complaint--the Crunch people. They look like strippers. What's wrong with using real people like Billy Blanks' Tae Bo videos?! It's much less intimidating. I'm thinking of keeping this to try and learn the moves in case I ever go to Miami(maybe I can play the DVD in slow motion?), but I won't be using it as an exercise video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gym class rather than Latin Dance!","review":"It's not so fun as described, I found this DVD is more like a gym class rather than a latin dance's. As a Latin Dance fan, I found those practices and instructions are not formal to Latin Dance, from the feelings to steps. And I notice that the only male dancer is doing good, but he's hidden in the crowd \\"so well.\\" One, two, three, four... gym class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best cardio video","review":"I was disappointed. Not the best or most fun exercise video. The moves are rather boring. The music isn't the best either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected !!","review":"I am a fan of salsa music and i thought that this dvd would be fun to try and put in a part of my work outs. The instructor was just wayyyy too much. too loud , too hyper. she came off very corny at times. lol. the video is just dumb. i dont know ,i just found her annoying.The music was good and all but i just cant take her. I dont do this video often. Once in a blue. It really wasnt as good as thought it was gonna be. i have other crunch video but come on now. they need better instructors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This was too fast-paced for me. I had a very hard time trying to follow the steps. Also, I didn't feel like I was doing \\"salsa\\" at all. The instructor says at the end that \\"now you can use these steps on the dance floor!\\" However, you'd probably just get laughed at if you tried, because they don't look like dance steps at all.If you really want to try salsa dancing as a workout, sign up for a salsa dancing class and skip this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for skilled dancers","review":"I am an intermediate amateur salsa dancer and she still lost me within the first few minutes when she assumed that I could just segue into grapevines in opposing directions and box steps with no breakdown or slowing down of the moves to get the hang of it. I turned it off in frustration. This workout is really only right for someone with dance training who can follow an un-taught dance routine without skipping a beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaps of fun :-)","review":"This is a fun workout but it's really geared to beginners or intermediates. If you are more advanced, you might get bored and you'll probably find it way too easy. Giselle is fun. I have all of her workouts and this is another great one from her. Who better to teach Salsa? There is even a drummer on the stage too so there is always a great beat. Giselle cues very clearly so you can follow easily and she breaks down all the combinations to make them easier to learn. It's about 40 minutes and like I said - it's heaps of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cardio Salsa","review":"This 40 minutes workout is good break in your routine. It is not the best cardio especially if your are seriously into aerobics, but it is a refreshing change perhaps once a week and, the next day you hurt in places that you didn't before you did this routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosie from Loudon Tn.","review":"The salsa music really gets you motivated. You have to have some coordination, but its alot of fun. Being latin I had no trouble. It might be a little fast for some, but the instructor gets you through it and you will burn calories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential for fun...if your feet can keep up","review":"This workout has potential to be a nice break from the monotony of standard cardio aerobic workouts---if you are keen on programs requring speedy feet and minimal movement/step breakdown. Don't expect this to mimic the salsa dancing you might do with another person at a club but if you take the time to breakdown Giselle's lightening fast moves I am sure they transfer to actual dance.This DVD is split into sections: Salsa, Merengue, Samba and Salsa-Merengue combinations. If done back to back this completes an appoximately 35 minute workout. With time I began to enjoy this program but like many reviewers found the learning curve very steep.I no longer use this program much but for those into the Salsa/Latin dance genre it does have potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow","review":"This workout is about 40 minutes. Not too long and not too short. Giselle is easy to follow and after you get used to the routine, you can ramp it up and it does a nice job of giving you a decent workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Librarian-Quest for the Spear","review":"This is a \\"fun ride\\" adventure spoof.

If they go missing, as they always seem to do sooner or later, he is charged with recovering them. His boss is played by Bob Newhart, his mother by Olympia Dukakis. Jane Curtin is the one who schedules his travel and collects his receipts. It's not Indiana Jones but it's a good TV movie with laughs and witty dialogue as well as chases and breathtaking escapes.

I hope they make more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light-Hearted Fun and Adventure","review":"The Librarian series should provide good fun for fans of the Indiana Jones genre, and \\"Quest for the Spear\\" does a fine job of introducing the premise and the continuing characters. Notably, we meet the nerdy-but-adventurous Flynn Carson (Noah Wyle), who is persuaded to abandon his comfortable niche as a professional student and apply for a job at the mysterious Metropolitan Library--which does indeed have books but is mainly dedicated to safeguarding legendary artefacts such as Pandora's Box and the Sword Excalibur. When the Spear of Destiny is stolen, Flynn, as the Librarian, must trek through the Amazon and over the Himalayas to thwart the villains determined to use the spear for evil purposes.

I was expecting an exciting and adventurous movie particularly with the terrific actors and actresses involved. Boy, was I ever disappointed! No matter how good the acting, it did not make up for the woeful and I mean woeful dialogue. I did not even make it through one-third of the movie before I had enough. The premise was terrific but the implementation was terrible. Perhaps I was expecting a different slant of Raiders of the Lost Ark but got a TV pilot that never saw, and rightly so, the light of day.

Don't waste your money on this awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of time...","review":"The only reason I watched the entire movie is because as a rule, I never leave a book or a movie unfinished. This one REALLY tempted me to break my rule... thats how bad it is. Rather than for prime-time viewing, this movie seems like it was scripted by, directed by, and made for 12 year olds. It looks and feels highly juvenile, immature, and really really stupid. I could trash this movie for hours, but I'll just leave it at this. I'm surprised so many people liked this movie, so go ahead try your luck.. maybe you'll like it too, but (as another reviewer pointed) if you dont like B-schlock movies, stay away.. stay FAR away... you have been warned... :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Librarian - Quest for the Spear","review":"A great escape movie.

They immediately go from a short greeting to a passion love scene in the bed. There is no mention of this in scripture. There is no reason to assume that this great JEWISH HEROINE gave up her dignity and pride. All scripture tells us is that she was brought to the chamber and then chosen as the QUEEN. It is reckless and sexist to assume that she was not as virtuos and dignified as the prophets DANIEL, ELIAS, JEREMIAH, SAMUEL, EZECHIEL,ISAIAH ETC..... I find it impossible to believe the GREAT woman so easily tossed her virtue aside. I think she was made queen and did it all with great dignity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but production low-budget?","review":"Enjoyed this biblical account of Queen Esther and her influence over and protection of the nation of Israel.I felt the production could have been a bit more interesting and graphical.

I hoped this would be it, but I was disappointed.It's probably one of the more biblical versions, but the quality of the production and some of the license taken with the story is annoying. The false noses on some of the Jewish characters is laughable, and most of the acting is terrible. The most annoying part is the way the film makes King Ahasuerus out as some weak, whiney young man who over-reacts to everything like a toddler, and can't think for himself.I work in youth ministry, and I was hoping to show clips of this as we study Esther.

Then the zombie kids eat up an old lady and turns her into a giant zombie and they then have to battle a zombie poodle.A hit and miss film. Some parts in the movie are really cool and others make this movie seem to dumb. Gore was ok for a R rated film, story is rather dumb and no hot chicks in this film.

By the time the two later characters become zombies, the budget is so depleted they throw a man in a poodle suit with werewolf hands. The production values are poor, the plot is predictable, and it's not even bad enough to be funny. All in all, the movie was a real disappointment, which is particularly bad, since I rented it HOPING it would be bad (but in an ironic, funny way).Skip this film, especially if you have any desire to respect Phyllis Diller, who plays Ms. Poopinplatz; an absolute travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic early 90s","review":"Bloodletting is a classic of the early 1990s, the temporary goth anthem that is the title.

It's disturbing yet beautiful and I don't know what draws me into the track. It has such a cynical view on the world, yet somehow it really appeals to me.However, I will give one warning: If you don't like dark music that is also humorless, you're not going to enjoy \\"Bloodletting.\\" Aside from the fact that it arguably takes it self a bit too seriously, and some tracks come off as rather average on here, but there are plenty of great cuts -- particularly \\"The Sky Is a Poisonous Garden\\" and \\"Darkening of the Light.\\" It is well written and performed, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for true music lovers","review":"This cd is awesome!

I was heading home on a trip to Montana with my church youth group in 1992 and during the journey I heard the song \\"Joey\\". I was so taken by Johnette Napolitano's vocals, sing-a-long vocals, and infectious pop hooks. After I got home from the trip, I went out and bought a cassette version of the album Bloodletting and loved every second of it. After all these years, I can still listen to Bloodletting without getting sick and tired of the music. I love the raw, post-punk sounds of the album like \\"Caroline\\" and \\"Days and Days\\" as much as the dark, sinister, goth-like sounds of \\"Bloodletting the Vampire Song\\" and \\"The Beast\\". There is not a single track on the album that I do like. They each have their own charm and character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where the roots of alternative began!","review":"As a 28 year-old, I find myself caught between the \\"heavy-Metal\\" age that gave up its crown to the young upstart \\"alternative\\" style of music in the late 80's & early 90's. It has been a long process to find music today that appeals to me: I can't take much more of classic rock, I've been listening to that for far too many years. I bought the \\"Bloodletting\\" cd in 1990 after a friend in the military had loaned it to me, and I loved it. Through the years I have bought the cd or tape four times and lost it four times. I can say that the purchase of this cd for the fifth time is money well spent. This album, in retrospect, tied together that missing void between \\"metal\\" and \\"alternative\\" and keeps me on the look-out for similar sounds. \\"Bloodletting is worth the price and the five-star rating.

So when the DVD came out I was really hoping that it had been restored/remastered. Nope. It looks like they made the DVD from the lousy VHS - and this time I was REALLY disappointed.

I listen to more new music in a month than most people listen to in a year and I blow waaaay to much money on cd's. I must say that there are so many crappy corporate commercial bands on the radio today that really suck.I heard the song \\"Pencil Fight\\" on the radio in Chicago and went out and grabbed their cd. I have to say I was floored! This Atomship band is amazing and I will put them right up there with Tool even this early in their career. I went to see their live show too and they freaking Rock! They sound just like the cd live which is amazing. I love this band and totally respect what they are doing and not caving in to this Corporate run business. Hats off to Atomship on your first record which is a masterpiece. If you are reading this and thinking about buying it, go buy it and I promise you will love this cd. It Rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool jams.","review":"This album kind of walks the line between metal, stoner rock, and the BLS type driving rock, with a hint of nu-metal sprinkled in. It isnt the greatest album of all time, but the riffs in particular kkep you interested as they drive you forward to the next verse. The lyrics are cool, although at times, a bit, i dont know....unimaginative. One particular example of this is Mothra. The lyrics are cool, but the part where he is actually saying Mothra....i like things to be a bit less obvious i guess. However, that being said, the album, including the lyrics is, as i said before, very cool, and will keep you interested throughout. A nice find from, after a little investigation, a band with quite a bit of inner turmoil. This is the only release under the name Atomship, though you will find further efforts from these guys in Papercut Massacre, Watership Down, and i think one or two other name changes throughout their history.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing unknown talent","review":"this band has amazing talent, but i had never heard their names before, not on radio, not online, not anywhere, until i reviewed an \\"imix\\" on itunes. this group is awsome. their drummer is insanely talented; just listen to \\"whitfield\\" and the drumming outro. all of the songs are impressive; if you're a fan of rock, pick this one up. they're not very hard or metal, but they do deliver an impressive album. i don't know if the group is still together or not, but regardless, this is one you don't want to pass up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like Disturbed with acoustic guitars","review":"When I heard Pencil Fight on the radio I thought it was Disturbed using acoustic guitars. These guys are just as good as Disturbed or Cold. Dragonfly is a good song, and I think this one should be on the radio instead of Pencil Fight. This band has the same talent that System Of A Down has for being able to be beautifully atmospheric and then shifting to blistering heaviness within one song. I mean that drummer can do death metal speeds sometimes. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally some decent music!","review":"Okay, I'm not much of a music reviewer, but I just had to write and recommend these guys. Like many people, I've all but stopped listening to the radio because of some of the crap that gets pushed these days. I saw Atomship open for Cold last month, and they completely blew me away (and stole the show from Cold, I might add). I just got my hands on this CD, and I am definitely not disappointed. If there was more good music like this being played on the radio, maybe I'd start listening again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Syd Barrett......","review":"This is real nice, gentle, well crafted psychedelia. Sounds like it fell right out of the '60's. If Syd Barrett hadn't had mental problems/became an acid casualty, he might have fulfilled his potential, and ended up sounding something like this. There's a fair bit of melancholia here, but it's not as sad as it SOUNDS. I also hear some Robyn Hitchcock & John Lennon influences. Beautiful, shimmering vibrato guitars and breathy sung-spoke vocals abound here, as on all Clientele albums. The place I would recommend to start, though....is with the more recent \\"Strange Geometry\\", which is sheer genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Smashing","review":"The Violet Hour is one of the most cohesive albums by a band in years. Nicely non-linear dynamics like a post-modern version of The Kinks Face To Face without the rockers. The Clientele are incredible and hopefully will keep up the good work. There is nothing like riding a vintage Vespa or a Lambretta in full mod kit and gear at an ungodly rainy moonlit dark hour of the morning listening to this album!

Can a corporate view purport to speak for spirituality? Or a high-tech, watch tapes of others mentality? We live in an age where the information elite feels NO compunction about how they gather information or what they do with it. Spirituality, if it is real, does not and cannot include this. Real spirituality (a) respects others (b) asks permission to use source material and acknowledges it (c) does not seek to profit at others' expense. Am I saying this is the case with this book? You can form your own opinion.

Bob gets it right with the best set of tunes since the low-fi days. In fact this almost feels like theres a little bit of history in most of the songs, both old and new GBV. But the difference? Bob lets Goug Gillard rock out all over the place with great guitar mastery (check out Christian Animation Torch Carriers, Cheyenne, Back to the Lake, Everywhere with Helicopter, and Eureka Signs). There are great shorts songs via GBV of Old. Theres the beauty of \\"Pretty Bombs\\" the rock of the above mentioned songs along with \\"Skin Parade\\", \\"Zap\\" and oh what the heck. With the garbage thats out there today this stands out. Much better than the last 2 hifi recordings (even though they were better than 90% of the garbage out there. Buy this and rock!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another breath of fresh air. . . .","review":"Let me first state that after reading about GBV for several years, my first GBV purchase was Isolation Drills. I was crushed by the fabulous melodies, great guitar sounds (the guy from Jackson Hole is soft when he says Gillard's guitar work and sound is lousy, go back to your hole and stick to things you know about), and Pollard's vocals. I also acquired Bee Thousand a few months ago. That said, those of you who think BT is the end all, be all, need to get over it!! The songs are good, but recording quality detracts from the experience. Song snippets are fun, but never fully developed, as such the melodies suffer a little. Don't get me wrong, BT is great, but I prefer Drills and Universal Truths. Great songs as usual (Cheyenne, Christian Animation..., Eureka Signs, ...Helicopter, Universal Truths...). Overall still marginally prefer Drills, but either way its hard to lose with Pollard & GBV. The man is still THE ANSWER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the Everlasting Big Kick","review":"Ah, whether to proclaim Bob Pollard King of Short Songs, Head-Bop Caesar, Cut-to-the-Quick God of Hook, or Emperor of Thigh Melodics--aye, there's the rub. On this album, UTAC, Pollard and The Guided By Voices offer to you songs of lo and fi, pulled from the acres of the Pop Plantation. Consider at the outset: \\"Wings of Thorn\\"; \\"Christian Animation Torch Carriers\\" (hard-core tuneage done up anthem-like); \\"Storm Vibrations\\"; \\"Back to the Lake\\" (music of the spheres, like something out of the Magnapop Bible, King Bob Version)--best of all, if you don't mind me saying, being \\"Wire Greyhounds\\". Those of you who, like me, when asked for the primest GBV reach single-handedly for \\"Under the Bushes, Under the Stars,\\" prepare for similar heights. It is strong, it is sturdy, it is always true. Announce it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best but a dang good album","review":"A very very fine album with probably 3-4 classic GBV songs. Sort of a cross between Under the Bushes Under the Stars and Isolation Drills. The sound--just a tad on the flat side--hovers somewhere between lo and hi fi but it isn't really detrimental to your enjoyment of the album unless you're one of those folks who refuse to listen to anything by GBV after Bushes/Stars. If that's the case, check out Jim Shelley/Book of Kills for great homemade pop 'cause Bob Pollard ain't gonna re-visit his early 90s days again, nor should he. I think the lyrics stand as some of Pollard's best ever. He occasionally achieves true poetry on Universal Truths. I know I'm in the minority here, but I think this is a better album than Earthquake Glue which I think has been slightly over-rated thus far by critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"UPON FURTHER REVIEW, THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR","review":"Ive had this mess of an album for over 2 months. Robert Pollard is back with yet another Who-inspired lenghty mess of an album. Pollard, one of the best songwriters of the early 90's, has missed again. Gone are the wonderful melodies of GBVs early work. Now we have 3 chord / power-chord guitar driven boredom. This band has the worst guitarist I've ever heard. Bee Thousand and Alien Lanes were brilliant. Not much since then has been worth much with the exception of Isolation Drills. Even still, Pollard has succeeded in becoming as boring as the Who. I cannot understand how someone who has heard Bee Thousand, Alien Lanes, Propeller and Vampire on Titus can even listen to this without wanting to toss the cd. ...

Too bad. There are many songs here, but few of them will make it into my ipod. I wish Bob Pollard would remember the muse that inspired \\"Teenage FBI\\", Hold On Hope\\" (my favorite song and recently used quite effectively on \\"Scrubs\\") and \\"Brides Have Hit Glass\\" .Forget the 30 second song..let the tune grow, even Elvis Costello gave up on them after Get Happy.

I have heard previous releases by this band, and got this latest CD on the recommendation of a friend, but I am extremely disappointed. IMO, too much effort is put into trying to make themselves sound interesting and creative, and the result is the same tired sounds you would hear from any run-of-the-mill indie band. There's really nothing about this CD that makes it anything more exciting than a coaster for that stiff drink I need because I now realize I wasted 15 bucks on this cacophonous rasp.

These lists too need updating so we can look for books that reflect today's market.But most of the essays on writing frustrated me. The authors only state what to do and rarely give much explanation on HOW to do it. The essays are much too short and not at all comprehensive.

Carver was The Man in the 1980s, widely celebrated for his realistic, gritty portrayals of everyday life among average white folks, and I liked his stuff when I first read it back then too. But this time, I was no longer enchanted. His stories often seem dull, flat, too focused on minor details. And the picture of life among hard-drinking, clock-punching regular people that emerges hardly seems like the whole picture. A few of the stories are very good, like \\"Vitamins\\" for example. And there is the weird story about the guys who go on fishing trip and find a girl's body, then just ignore it for a couple of days while they continue to fish and fool around. This seems to touch on something essential between men and women. But other stories seem trivial and fragmentary. Maybe I am being a little too harsh on Carver - he certainly has many fans, and I used to like his writing - but this is my honest reaction to it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpolished stories from the drawer","review":"I hate to give Carver a bad review, especially because I loved the stories in \\"What we talk about when we talk about love\\", but every story I read in this volume, and I admit I have not read them all, was a huge let down.They dont pick up and end threadless, leaving me with a big HUH? You might say, I am just too ignorant, but I love short stories, and dont want to give this book a thumbs down, but here it is. No good.

Carver's minamalist approach just does not have the kind of eloquence and magic that grabs me. Also, so many of the stories are centered around dysfunctional families, and feature alcaholism, and couples breaking up. Carver is very redundant, both in subject matter and method. I feel like Carver used the same formula for a lot of these stories, then plugged in slighty varying charachters in slighty varying circumstances. I am finding myself asking,\\"How many times can Carver beat a dead horse??\\". In short, I find this to be tiresome. Strike that. It is maddening."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fruitless, frustrating read.","review":"I am sorry to say that I have tried several times to read that book, recommended by an excellent writer friend of mine, and simply failed to finish it every time. My dislike of Raymond Carver(like my dislike for New York) feels to me like a shortcoming but there you have it. There are no points to Carver's stories and I find it infinitely arid and unrewarding to read short pointless stories with no aim. Lack of resolution you call it? To me, it goes against the very appeal of reading. I can't remember the stories, I can't remember the characters and I don't care. Doesn't that mean that Carver fails somewhere? Why do we read if not to be entertained, moved, to learn something, to travel to another universe? I'm a lifelong reader, but the supposed wonders of Mr. Carver fly way over my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Master Storyteller","review":"This is one of the best collections of short stories that I have ever read. Carver's characters are people that we walk past on the street everyday -- people with real lives and real problems.

Think of Hemingway's \\"Hills Like White Elephants\\". I remember giving Cathedral to a friend at U of Delaware who said he didn't like it. Why?- It's too depressing. But that's not quite true, it's real. I was and still am a \\"student\\" of contemporarystory writers, and these are very rewarding reads. There is a lot of truth in his writing.

The hero finds out about her wishes, and tries to satisfy them, with hilariously funny results. There are several laugh-out-loud moments in the book, and it makes for a funny, yet romantic story. Eventually, of course, the heroine realizes that there is more to love than wild, dangerous adventures(and that being locked up in a gothic castle with a ghost might not be as much fun as just reading about it), and appreciates the true romantic nature of her future spouse.

The premise is fabulous, the universe is wonderful, but the characters... Oh, the characters. I felt like I was watching a bunch of braindead, immature caricatures rather than a group of intelligent and mature adults. Also, our protagonist, who is supposed to be a brilliant scientist, takes until page 252 to figure out what we all realized back on page 101. The plot drags needlessly in some places, and races along too quickly in others. The real frustration is that with a good editor, this book could have been a gem. But instead, it's just a disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent First Novel","review":"Every time you read a first novel you take a chance. With Bell's firs novel, I must admit, this was a chance worth taking. This is an excellent book. The characters are both vivid and complex and the dialogues are truly authentic. The plot, though somewhat anticipated, keeps you on the edge till the very end.I would recommend this book and will await Bell's next novel.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid, but an improvement","review":"\\"Ravishing Grimness\\" was awful and this album corrects many of those problems, but still doesn't rise above burnt out and so ends up being pleasant black-metal-y background music. Fenriz and company have the black metal science refined to formula, and the resulting pop sounds nearly like surf music from an apocalyptic world. Guitars saw through toneful and melodic riffing but always return to a Celtic-Frost-influenced darkness and disharmony. It's bouncy in rhythm and the vocals are as always great, but there's nothing here to draw a repeat listen. It is wiser to enjoy this band at their prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same as Brainy Baby's video","review":"The Brainy Baby, Spanish, uses the same footage as Bilingual Baby by Small Fry video.

It really holds his attention.5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...Sorry. :(","review":"I bought this video based on the high reviews it got. However, my three year old [who loves all of our other spanish learning videos] hated it and refuses to watch it. She thinks it is very boring and I kind of agree. So, it may be a great video, but since my kid won't watch it, it does us no good at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 19 month old little girl loves this video.","review":"Hi all, I have never done this before but I thought I would come here and give you my input on the video. I think its very well done and thought out video. I like how they show the translations in the bottom right of the video in small print so as not to distract your child. My Daughter loves it. The other night I tried to watch something else and she just about had a fit untill I put the video in! I give it a 5 star rating. I want to try the German video next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for children","review":"I have twin gilrs who are 19 months old and it's difficult for them to sit through a video besides seasame street. When I put the Bilingual video on for them they loved it I have never seen them so interested in what they were watching before, I was amazed and even more so when one of the girls woke up the next morning and repeated a phrase she had heard. Being hispanic I am teaching them both languages. I highly recommend this video for parents and children who want to learn. It's educational without being boring. Gotta get it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"My seven and three year old were interested but some of the images in this video were confusing. It's definitely not worth buying. You're better off getting it from the library or buying some cartoons in Spanish instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great part of our Spanish repertoir.","review":"We are and English-speaking household but I try to provide a lot of Spanish exposure for my kids to start them learning. This one hasn't been quite as popular with my kids as some others (Baby Einstein, Mozart Numbers & Shapes), but I like it a lot and think it will grow on them as they learn more Spanish. The thing I like about this one is that it introduces sentences and not just individual words. It speaks the Spanish word with a real-life picture to teach the work, and repeats with several different images. It then puts words together and says the whole Spanish. For example, it will go over \\"dog\\" and \\"play\\" and \\"ball\\", and then do \\"the dog plays with the ball\\". The images are attractive and catch kids' interest, the Spanish words and spoken by a soothing female voice, and the background music is pleasant. In short, painless Spanish education appropriate for young and very young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"Trying to find quality CD's & Videos to teach my 2-year-old has been challenging.

It automatically zooms in to the maximum. So now basically I can't use it any more. I initially thought maybe it's due to my operation somehow although I'm sure I'm gentle on it. However, after I searched online, I found that I'm not the only lucky one. Some poor dude said if he wants to use it, he has to put one finger on the \\"zoom out\\" button all the time in order to cancel out the automatic zoom in. I called JVC, and they said this is not a recognized defect for them, and they will charge me just for an \\"evaluation\\". I'd rather just throw away this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoom trouble too","review":"I am experiencing the same zooming trouble as everyone else. When I called JVC they denied the problem. Judging from the reviews here on Amazon.com, there seems to be a very real problem. I bought the camera because it was simple, afforadable, and I'm not much of a techno person. I used it well for over a year when the zoom problem started. Being in the military, you don't get much pay, so I was hoping this camera would serve me for a long time- I was wrong. I will not buy JVC products again! Anyone for a class action lawsuit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zooming out of control","review":"I have exactly the same problem as you guys are having.

It worked fine till about a month ago. The first thing that I noticed is that the camera would zoom in all by itself. I had to have my finger firmly holding the zoom out button so that it would not zoom in. Reading about it now, I find out that this is a common problem with this particular camcorder. Wish I had read reviews from people who had been using this for a while. Most of the reviews (when I bought it) were from people who were happy with it and had it for less than couple of weeks.It was good while it lasted. But I would never buy JVC again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoom issue is a deal breaker","review":"I bet this would be a decent camcorder, if the zoom issue wasn't there. It's apparently a major glitch with this model. I bought mine new, used it without incident for about three or four months and then it began zooming at will. It zooms all the way in when you turn it on, and won't stay at any other level of zoom. I sent it in under the parts warranty, but JVC authorized service people wanted over $200 for labor. I paid to have it fixed, it came back still broken, sent it back in, and within two months it started doing the same thing. I despise this camcorder and JVC. Their customer service people are rude, they routinely do not returns calls or emails and they sell a very expensive product that doesn't work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this item!","review":"I purchased a JVC GR-DX77us last july and to be fair, its video-taping capabilities are good, and the resolution is good. However, I have not been able to get the video capture feature to work on the camcorder. I tried both the USB and the 1394 firewire, and they both kept losing contact with various computers--turns out the problem was the plug board is pretty loose and either the plugs or the board loses contact regularly, playing havoc with your computer. I was not able to download one minute of footage.Dont expect any great help from JVC customer support either, every inquiry or request to them turned into an escalation to buy something else, 4 out of 5 times it was for accessories that were supposed to have been included in the camera kit.stay away from this model, and JVCs in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever - not just among pirate games","review":"This is literally the worst game that I have ever played of ANY genre. Comparing it to the original Pirates! by Sid Meier is very nearly an insult to that classic game. Simply put, this game has a terrible user interface, gameplay is difficult and BORING (gameplay refers to ship-to-ship combat, navigating through towns and swordfighting) and is incredibly BUGGY (as in constant crashing). Honestly, this is an insult for Bethesda to release to the gaming public in light of their other games (as in the Elder Scrolls series). Unfortunately, if a pirate game is what you are looking for, then this is about the only game out right now. I'd recommend, however, that you save your money and wait to get a game worth playing. Or at least a game thats FUN to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You Could Want in a Pirate Game","review":"Yes, this game is not easy - although there are plenty of walkthroughs available on the web. Thanks to those who have played for a long time and made the effort to share their knowledge, you almost don't mind that the manufacturer never bothered to issue a player's guide.Yes, it does require you to pay attention - the suggestion to use a notebook is quite a good one! There is so much going on and you visit so many places, talk with so many people and with lots of story lines to keep track of, a notebook would be a great asset.Yes, the graphics are amazing! Especially for those of us with older computers. The detail is awesome and if you take advantage of the first person perspective, you'll feel as if you really are on a ship in the middle of (pick one) a battle, heavy weather, open seas, etc.No, you won't finish it in one sitting - unless you don't get up for several days running.Sea Dogs is one fine piece of work and one fine game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea Dogs A epic story of a pirates life","review":"I think this is one of the best rgp/pirates games i have ever played.

Try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Great!!!!","review":"I just got this game a week ago, and I can't stop playing it. I had some trouble in the beggining because you start out with a really small ship. I learned that if a big ship attacks you, it will probably be slower, so just run away.

This one was fun and seemed to have some good potential. But that's only when you can get it to work. I have a machine that should run this game very smoothly and even with everything upgraded it freezes all the time and is more buggy than any other game I've played. And the patch 1.06 only caused more problems than it fixed. Also techincal support for it was basically non existant. I've also gone to the forums for the game and the general feeling is that they created the game and then went AWOL when the customers looked for help with the problems in it.

Having watched it made me realize how I fee that most U.S. movies directed at children and other innocents are twisted and pathological. What happened to the movies which taught empathy and love for other species as \\"Bambi\\" did? I value respecting of animals very highly and this movie advocates good inter-species relations.

I only wish there were more than ten songs and that Loretta had a hand in writing more of the material.

Wow, was I ever wrong. This album is filled with songs that will have you listening over and over again, and the production of each song is so incredible that you can do nothing but listen in awe. Give the CD a chance, at least a few listens before you judge it because the songs only sound better with time. Also, don't judge the cd based on the first single, because on the surface 'where is the love' seems to be just another bubblegum pop type song, even though it's actually as well crafted and original as any of the songs on this cd.

Worse: No","review":"I read A lot of people criticing this album becuase it is not what they are used to hearing from the Black Eyed Peas. It does have a more vibe pop feeling to it (partly because Timberlake is singing Background vocals on where is the love). The addition of the beautiful Fergie adds a different feeling to this music, which makes it good in my opinion. Also people have been critizing this album because it is degrading of people with handicaps (Track 3 Lets Get Retarded). That is one of the most laughable things Ive heard in my laugh. Lets get retarded is about as bad as saying Lets get hype or something along those lines. If they says Cripples suck or something like that then I would see it was time to break out the picketing signs.

I'm not into urban very much, but I love this album. I enjoy the Peas' top 40 hits, especially \\"Let's get retarded\\". The one, non-charting hit that especially impressed me is \\"The boogie that be\\". It's got a fantastic beat and I really dig those funky sirens. They totally make the song! Although it's a very basic dance track that doesn't have a lot of instrumentation, it has such a great sound that totally makes up for it! It reminds me of Daft Punk's \\"Face to face\\", off their album \\"Discovery\\". If you liked \\"Boogie that be\\" you will love \\"Face to face\\". Anyway, Elephunk is an excellent CD.

The first time I listened to it I thought it was ok, but after having it for 5 months I have deleted every song from my playlist except \\"Hands Up\\" and \\"Let's Get Retarded.\\" These aren't even good songs, they're just catchy. The \\"funk\\" influenced songs sound forced and repetitive, and some of the songs flat out suck. With \\"Elephunk,\\" the Black-Eyed Peas have gone from a respectable \\"Roots\\"-like psuedo-underground outfit to a weak, commercial, radio-friendly, Justin Timberlake-featuring crew.

While \\"shut up\\", \\"hey mama\\", and \\"where is the love\\" got the radio play they deserve, I can't say that I think many other songs from this album will be released. I find the lyrics pretty lame and elementary - bubble gum pop (funk?). Especially \\"smells like funk\\" - this song may perhaps turn you off the entire album. I know that BEP has a pretty strong fan base, so they must be doing something right, but from someone who bought the cd for the 3 aforementionned songs, I would encourage you to preview before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisely good","review":"When I first heard the BEPs, I didnt really like them, now that I listened to a friends cd fully and bought my own I love them.

Songs like \\"Hey Mama\\", \\"Let's Get It Started\\", \\"Shut Up\\" and \\"The Boogie That Be\\" alone make this release worth buying.

To me it sounds like typical generic hip hop, with lyrics about women and women's bodies and other unoriginal ideas. No clever rhymes, and \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" is simply one of the most offensive titles I've ever heard.Poor judgment in including a new fourth member can be forgiven, but pandering to the lowest common denominator in order to fit in cannot.

An electrifying, tapping tracks, Elephunk brings in the sitar, flute and an Indian vocalist for the famous 'Bhangra style' in Elephunk theme. Hey Mama has great vocals with background music to soothe the soul. Smells like Funk is a silly song I feel. Let's Get Retarded is uh oh and can warm up for the party. Anxiety is too rock.

Then there's the nba playoffs commercial, xm radio commercial, and the garfield movie commercial.

After listening to Behind The Front, I couldn't stop and it kept getting better with Bridging The Gap (especially with the awesome lineup of guests!). Then came in Elephunk. I was so excited to listen to it after I listened to Let's Get Retarded. Guess what happened? I wanted to punch Will.I.Am in the face for making such a WACK album. I swear, they have no edge anymore, no Premier, no nothing. Except the stupid errand boy, Justin Timberlake.

But after I heard the disgusting \\"Let's Get Retarted\\", I stopped liking this CD because of a rhyme \\"bop your head like epilepsy\\", not to mention how often they use the word \\"retarted\\" as an insult. That is fully disgusting anyone can do that. And now that I think about it, they say many other politically incorrect things. Even though I like some artists that say more swearwords than the Black Eyed Peas, the Black Eyed Peas lyrics are much more rude technically, and this is just going way overboard.

He told me that their first album \\"Behind The Front\\" was the best, but I didn't really like it that much. Then he gave me \\"Bridging the Gap\\" and that was also, just average. Then he gave me \\"Elephunk\\", which is the worst one yet; except for the huge hit \\"Let's Get It Started\\". That song is probably the best song to have been made in the last 50 years. The original version, \\"Let's Get Retarded\\" is very derogetory and shameful. Making fun of the physically challenged is the lowest you can go.

This record could be as big as Missy E's last joint, but nobody is gonna hear this cause nobody on the street can play it. I went to all the biggest hip-hop stores in brooklyn and manhattan and the people in charge just shrug their shoulders. Can't get it.

I know this stuff is supposed to be cutting edge but it just gives me a headcahe. BEPs should have waited until they had better material.

The Peas delivery complicated lyrics over smooth production, which creates a clean sound of music in an era where garbage fills Hip-Hop. A few songs could be made a little stronger like &#65533;Anxiety&#65533;, &#65533;Latin Girls&#65533; (Which is still catchy) but where they lack the slack is picked up in &#65533;The Boogie That Be&#65533; and &#65533;Smells Like Funk&#65533;.BEP like The Roots are making music while other groups in Hip-Hop are re-working formulas for financial success, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sold Out","review":"In my opinion, I've never seen any hip-hop artist sell out like the Black Eyed Peas did in Elephunk.

They carry great beats with awesome lyrics that MAKE you get up and dance. \\"Elephunk\\" is certainly a great attribute to the music today, and I can't wait until \\"Monkey Business\\" comes out! I've already pre-ordered it on iTunes! If you're a person who likes to get up and just dance to a cool beat, this CD for you. Even if you don't like to dance, this is a great CD to listen to. I would definitely buy this album if I didn't already have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I really love this album. I mean except for Lets Get Retarded and Sexy I love this CD.

The only good songs you can find in it are Where Is The Love, Shut Up (which I love)and Hey Mama (but better the single version). I don't like Let's Get Retarded (become Let's Get It Started coz the other was quite offensive and the sound wasn't that good)so I dunno why they chose it as single..maybe coz they couldn't find something better in the record!! The rest is pure crap, rubbish to throw away in an half a second. I hope I'm saving you from totally wasting money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is a waste.","review":"Your better off buying real hip hop music. Black eye peas are not even a hip hop group.

CD came on time and in great shape as described. Really great price too!! Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Improvement","review":"This little EP has convinced me not to give up on this band yet. Although still heavier on instrumentals than YWDTIOK and FWANO, the new music on this EB manages to do a far better job of integrating these instrumentals into the group's traditional brilliant song conmstructs. It's also considerably more sparing in its reliance on the female vocalist, also in keeping with their previous work. Track 3, which we know from Summer Make Good, even sounds better within the context of this new music than it does in their disastrous previous album. All in all, I'm quite impressed, and will be eagerly awaiting Mum's next full release; hopefully it'll be more of this rather than a continuation of direction the band took with Summer Make Good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Steeler Gift!","review":"Great DVD.....great gift for Steeler fans !!!

It contains a lot of footage from the first 40 years before the franchise won its first playoff game as well as great coverage of the 70s up through last season.

This disc is packed with good highlights and interviews, mostly with players. There is plenty of footage of the 70s teams I am most familiar with. It was great to see Joe Greene and Jack Lambert and Dwight White and Mel Blount and those guys on camera again in the interviews. The highlight film of Super Bowl XIII contains much of the game and all the key plays. Compared with other sports videos I have, this one provides a lot of time and good content for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate for diehard fans!","review":"I bought this for a diehard Steelers fan.

Product assembly details are bad. You end up looking at the picture on the box and assembling by trial and error. The only well built part was the target itself. Super thick, excellent grade steel. The reset mechanism was lousy, didnt look like it would work for more than a few visits to the range. The height is super short and the base is not heavy enough to stand on itself on hard range surfaces. Unfortunately the range I go to is not soft enough to drive the stakes in. Had to return the item unused to Amazon and hoping I can get a refund.

You will eventually figure it out, maybe, and end up with a lopsided target that sometimes works and usually doesn't reset. The instructions are also quite specific that the minimum distance from the shooter to the target is 30 yards. I'm not an expert shooter, but I'm reasonably competent, and I don't even attempt to hit a target this small at such distances with a handgun. If you use cheap ammunition, hitting this target from 30 yards (90 feet) will be mostly luck, since the ammunition won't be that accurate. Who are these people kidding? I understand the recommendation, though, because the steel is rather soft and easily dents. Shooting at an uneven steel surface is dangerous! Regardless, use only lead bullets, not jacketed ammunition. You'll probably have more fun hanging paper plates by string from a simple stand. Cheap and you know when you hit them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"ITs only 45 minutes. And with that only minutes of 3d recording.

Little did I know that when you search on \\"Sleeping Bag,\\" toys would be displayed along with actual sleeping bags. This item is a toy. Silly me for not reading the description and just looking at the picture. I suppose when I buy books in the future I should also verify that it actually is a book and I'm not ordering a picture of a book to hang on my wall, because that would do me about as much good as a toy sleeping bag when I need an actual sleeping bag for a five-year-old tomorrow.The toy itself is actually cute and well-made.

This book is great for colors and animals and the repetitive nature of the ryhmes make it easy for the child to learn. Since she knew and loved the english version, this was a great wya to learn some french.I recomend this with Bonsoir Lune (Goodnight Moon), Devine Combien Je t' Aime (Guess How Much I Love You) andLa Chenille Qui Fait Des Trous (The Very Hungry Caterpillar).

There are no standout cuts on this album, and overall, the whole thing is pretty flat. However, the thing that makes most people diss her latterday albums is simply the fact that being in the spotlight for so long has gone to her head. In the case of this album, the only reason why they don't equal the greatness of classics like Control, Rhythm Nation or Janet is because she was pretty young and hadn't yet developed her signature style. More importantly, she hadn't yet become acquainted with Jimmy Jam Harris and Terry Lewis, who are most responsible for developing the signature sound of the above mentioned albums.The point basically is that it's better to be unpolished than to polish yourself and then refuse to bow out after the polish wears off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Sophomore CD","review":"Janet Jackson's Dream Street is found to be overrated and missed by most Janet fans. The CD is solid, but there was only one song that made it to her 1984 appearance on American Bandstand, which was Don't Stand Another Chance. The song that doesn't belong on the CD is Communication, in which she songs about how communication is changing. Her brother Marlon Jackson backs her up and produces one song All My Love To You, which does have a Jackson beat. This CD is not a waste of your money but could remind you on how better she could have done, and how she is today, which is a big difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good at all","review":"I would rate this Janet's weakest album, her first was kinda cute and had more of a glance and style than this one... it sounds really flat all over, and to me has nothing funky at all, just eeky electrosounds from the eighties, whereas the eighties have produced some really awesome funky music, check out Change, Chic, SOS Band, Loose Ends, Luther, Alexander O'Neal, Cherelle, etc.This album gives me the chills and not in a good way, thank god Janet decided to work with Jam & Lewis after this mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"an underrated gem!","review":"This album could have been her own \\"Ooops..I Did It Again\\" had she been marketed right. It has that typical 80s sound, but it's pure delight just hearing her sweet, innocent, girly voice. Puts a smile on my face each day. I really don't understand why this album wasn't a success. It had potential...no matter how cheesy the lyrics were. It's pure, unadulterated, fun pop bliss. She could have been a successful teen star like Britney, Donny Osmond, and all those other bubblegum pop stars.BEST ONES!1) Don't Stand Another Chance- the track that sounds out the most. it makes you want to dance.2) Pretty Boy- i really like this song. i just love 80s music.3) Fast Girls- another song you can dance to4) If It Takes All Night5) Hold Back the Tears- it sounds like it would be on the Fame soundtrack.Honorable mention: Two To The Power Of Love"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album That Reflects The 80's Sound","review":"One of Miss Jan's best albums, spawning excellant hits like \\"Two To The Power\\", \\"Fast Girls\\", and \\"Don't Stand Another Chance\\", plus a great megamix of \\"Pretty Boy\\" and \\"Fast Girls\\", \\"French Blue\\", (not on the album). My favorite song is \\"If It Takes All Night\\". The 80's sound is most obvious on tracks like \\"Communication\\", but is still strong throughout the entire album. Definately a great buy for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Album By Miss Janet","review":"This album, it's only for Janet's fans, because it really doesn't fullfil Janet's talents. The songs sounds like Donna Summer's dropouts, or typical sounds of the 80's that don't apport nothin' new, although if you're a Janet fan buy it, so you can see this leading lady at her worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Little Pigs","review":"My grandson (16 months) loves this toy. We have so much interaction with it - the pigs and wolf go to the beach, on the plane, in a bucket, everywhere.

A great toy - will be getting this for a gift for my great niece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for a 1 year old","review":"Both my nephews loved this toy!

The little pigs, all color coordinated with their respective houses and numbers on their chests from smallest to biggest, are adorable. The pigs squeak when squeezed, the only thing that my son seems to like about this toy. Now, I refuse to hold that against this set. Possibly my son is too young for this toy, having received it for his first Christmas? Maybe he just simply doesn't like it? However, I can see where it could be a very engaging little toy. Though I haven't tried washing the houses yet, I love the fact that they can go in the washing machine. Having 5 dogs and all the dog hair that goes along with them, having a toy that can be thrown in the washing machine is a dream. My complaint with the toy? One of the little pigs came with the paint chipped off a part of his belly which is only getting worse with time, even though my son really doesn't play with them. Aside from that, the set seems quite durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"babies are not interested in it","review":"I bought it for my 21month twins.

I bought this to have a soft non-noisy toy on the plane for a trip we were taking. I do not recommend using this toy for that purpose. At least not for a busy 15 month old. He kept throwing the pigs and dropping them under the seats, I almost lost one! But, once we had it at home, he's better at playing with it and sits and loves when we go through the 3 little pig story.

This is my second of these bags. My previous one was stolen abroad and I wanted one exactly like it.It has plenty of space. The sliding bottom \\"drawer\\" is a clever way to create space and protect the laptop if dropped.

This show is very well done, and it leaves you guessing until the last moment. My biggest disappointment was when I discovered that it had no captions or subtitles. When will the dvd makers realize that this is a very important tool when viewing a dvd?! The cast of stars in this show is impressive, and all do a great job in bringing the story to life. It's well acted, and the cinematography is spectacular. A great show, but since it is a murder mystery, small kids might be shook up with the violence that unfolds. Well worth watching, even without captions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DEADLY BUT ENTERTAINING TRIP DOWN THE NILE","review":"AGATHA CHRISTIE SENDS HERCULE POIROT DOWN THE NILE WITH SOME INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN \\"DEATH ON THE NILE\\" WORTH A WATCH.

Ustinov, B. Davies, M. Farrow, M. Smith, D. Niven and G. Kennedy. We can remebre all of them for all times. I think this film is a treasure and a tribute at the same time. A classic film for a good expert in mystery movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder Mystery Superb!","review":"I'm an Agatha Christie fan, and DEATH ON THE NILE is also one of my favorite movies. In this follow up to the fascinating MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, Peter Ustinov plays a more dapper Hercule Poirot, who is only one of the passengers on a steamer going down the Nile in Egypt. Rich and much loathed newlywed Linnet Doyle and her husband Simon are aboard, and when Linnet is murdered, it seems that everyone had a motive for doing her in. Tremendous fun and guessing follow as Poirot and Colonel Race, played to a T by David Niven, try and sort out the clues as two more people are killed. Stellar story and acting, with a wonderful cast that includes, Bette Davis, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow, Maggie Smith, Simon MacCorindale, George Kennedy, Olivia Hussey, and Jane Bilken make up the guilty suspects. Great murder mystery in an exotic location. Enjoy this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!","review":"An all time favorite movie, always a treat to watch it again.

(Thank the Lord?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"They Should Have Gone Down With The Boat","review":"In spite of a distinguished cast and a script which remains faithful the author's famous novel, Death on the Nile is remarkably lackluster. Ustinov plays the celebrated Poriot largely for laughs, and the supporting players (a truly stellar cast, including Bette Davis and Angela Lansbury) largely follow suit; in consequence, the complicated and justly famous plot seems more a vehicle for its cast than the driving story it actually is. Easy on the eyes, fairly mindless, and certainly no Murder on the Orient Express."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agatha Christie would turn in her grave","review":"I love Peter Ustinov but NOT as Poirot. He looks more like Santa Claus without the suit. OMG if I had to hear Mia Farrow whine one more second I'd tear my hair out. Agatha Christie wrote Poirot as the central character of her books and her words were so descriptive we knew him well. Ustinov wants to play him as a stooge who only gets smart in the end. Poirot is murdered in this who-done-it, by too many well-known faded actors who chew up the scenery and spit Poirot out. Want Poirot as Christie wrote him? Check out David Suchet."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't order from this seller","review":"I order 3 movies from this seller; I had broken my leg and needed something to do; I also reordered from other sellers the same day and three days later...I received the others quickly...I received the others I order 3 days later..still no order from this seller finally on the last day 3wks later I received 2 of the movies I ordered but still a full month later ..

The basic idea is great, ie a diary for a special journey. But it leaves much to be desired. Firstly, the plastic cover is peeling off, and the back cover pocket has torn.

Too many journeys (22!) in the opening Travel Schedule, and there could be a field to jot down the reservation code and the seat numbers.

However, I feel this book will be useful to me in my treating of patients, and I will enthusiastically recommend it to patients suffering from PTSD, as well as their families.

Thank you-Timothy Kendrick author-PTSD: Pathways Through the Secret Door"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare pleasure","review":"It is unfortunately an uncommon experience to find a compelling and utterly suspensful thriller with a well defined and believable heroine. \\"Out of Nowhere\\" is just such a thriller. It has a fascinating heroine and a real sense of danger to her. Her circumstances seem highly believable and, in this age of paranoia and terrorism, her inability to trust actually seems relatable. I don't want to rehash the plot in this review, but I do very much recommend this novel. It's engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLLLLLLLLY!!!!

The two problems I see are this: 1) the author is VERY wordy and this story needed to be edited down by about 1/3. It is 540 pages where 230 would have made a much better read. 2) If you were a leading lawyer in a powerful law firm and it was found that the firm was laudering drug money, which lead to the death of your ex-wife and daughter, would you stay at that firm?? It doesn't seem plausible to me that a powerful man who (in the story) sees his daughter as the most important thing in his life wouldn't have left that firm for another?? It's important because the daughter in witness protection renters his life which leads to obvious problems and such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggling to finish","review":"This book is so long and drawn out, where the author just rambles on and on about background info that is so dull and obvious. There is gratuitous violence (including the bludgeoning of a dog) and bland, almost obligatory sex scenes. I'm trying to finish (less than 50 pages to go) but it's been rough. I do want to know how it turns out, but I know the end will be an utter disapointment, because that's how the entire book has been. I'm going to kick myself for investing this much time in it.

Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"I'm taking a class in sexual communities history and this is one of the books I have to read.

Overall a great book, and if you're looking to learn a lot about lesbianism in the US...this is a wonderful book to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful survey of lesbian history","review":"I read this book when I was newly out and went through the \\"read everything remotely queer\\" stage.

Yes the solvent and lube and cleaning patches are fine but when you put the cleaning rod together and try to run it through your barrel with the patch attached at the end, the patch barely touches the bore. Imagine running a tissue over the receiver to clean it. It'll brush off some settled dust and that's it. And because of that one thing, this kit is totally useless. I suppose you can buy this for the other items but you will absolutely have to buy a Boresnake. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"I purchased this product a few days ago and there are multiple problems with it. First off my order was 2 days late, second both of the tabs that hold the box closed are broken, third one of the attachments is broken.

It definitely was not as good as his last two outings. But I like Mr. Hamilton's style and will continue to purchase his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Frenetic Search for Lost Love!","review":"There's something about Alex McKnight that resonates with me. Maybe it's his bad attitude. Maybe it's his sarcasm. Or maybe it's that in the end, he's a sucker like me. In this outing, author Steve Hamilton takes on a ride through Alex's past. Through the streets of Detroit, Alex and his old friend, Randy Wilkins, are off on a crazy search for a girl Randy knew when he played for the Tigers. When Randy gets shot, Alex tenaciously searches for answers. The plot falls short because the set-up isn't that believable and the ending is too abrupt. Furthermore, Randy's personality is quite annoying. I'm glad he got shot. An enjoyable read, but not Hamilton's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is by far the worst book in the McKnight series","review":"I've read all of Hamilton's McKnight novels and this one is the worst. It took me well over 300 pages to get into this novel and by that point I'd spent so much time reading the book I just wanted to be finished and done with. I've thoroughly enjoyed all of his other novels but this one just seemed to have no purpose, couldn't grab my attention, and was just a painful read. If I wasn't such a fan of his earlier books I would have put this book down after the first 40 pages. I still own this book but wouldn't put anyone through the torture of reading it. If you have yet to read the McKnight series read his first novel, A Cold Day in Paradise, it's a classic mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gino Vannelli","review":"I got this for my wife, she loves him and turned me on to him.

The information is accurate and insightful. The book turns wannabes into informed, prepared competitors! As an adult male, I find the book particularly helpful, as it is not pitched toward pre-teenage girls like many other excellent books. The step by step approaches to getting photos, contacting agents, going to go-sees and auditions, were great.

Even the title sucks, cause its so enormous. And the music sounds like a techno jug-band hoedown. And the lyrics are just too dopey, even for the era it came out in.

Starts off with Josie being at a commercial filming that involves children. Josie refers to the star of the commercial using a dirty name in front of a child who repeats this to the star. Josie is then fired -- funny? No, dumb. Josie walks onto the balcony of a public building and the glass door shuts and locks behind her. She panics and tries to uproot a potted tree to use to bust down the door. However, after a few minutes someone spots her through the glass door and lets her in, but her clothes are then a mess -- funny? No, dumb.

I teach elementary school and I have no idea how a child who is learning how to tell time can possibly learn with this watch. Every time you move, the animation feature appears and the time disappears. I found it frustrating to tell the time even as an adult. I can't return them since I live overseas and I can't even give them away. They are trash for the landfill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"The idea of the watch is wonderful, but the execution is, well..., lame. This is primarily because it is hard to read in any light, and setting it is very difficult. It was inexpensive so I thought it would be fun for my daughter even if, as other reviews said, the animation was easily set off, but the fact that it is hard to read just about makes it useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Piece of Junk - Do not buy Timex Watches","review":"The watch is supposed to be water resistant, but it leaked the first time my daughter took it swimming.

It didn't want to stay upright unless you had it set to the middle position. One click back or forward and it would fall over.

I'll miss the portability of it but not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, runs well but...","review":"The fan was just what I was looking for. Small enough to fit in the window. It worked just fine and I was pleased until later when I turned on my TV. I noticed there was some kind of electrical interference on my TV screen. The kind one might get running, say, a vacuum cleaner. I turned off the fan and the problem with my TV stopped.Well, I thought, I'll run an extension cord from a different room and that should solve the problem -- it didn't. Since the fan also runs on batteries, I got some D batteries and tried again. No luck.

Like in the film TRAFFIC, Fleischman's main characters understand the folly of the US government's sometimes shady attempts to curb the flow of drugs across the borders. But Fleischman also explores the corruption within the news agencies when his hero is asked to overlook some all too obvious details. Fleischman writes with confidence and tenderness, walking a fine line that welcomes both male and female readers into his writer's world. A great read -- fiction with factual inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Anyone who is interested in this album and is not sure whether to buy it or not: You have to buy it!

It would seem the answer is 100%, as that is what has happened here! I bought this cd thinking it was Buddaheads, a high octane, killer blues/rock group in the vein of Hendrix, Trower,or SRV. What I got was Buddahead; a lightweight,pop type group. Apparently amazon is as clueless as I was because they have this cd grouped with Lance Lopez, another kickass blues/rocker. Since fans of either group are very unlikely to care for the music of the other,this warning works both ways.

Everthing from the absolutely ridiculous & unwitty title (Becstacsy)to the stale production and tacky graphics and photos reeked of mediocrity. These mostly void-of-personality songs sounds like they were written by a 12 year old (with the exception of the quite good All Over Me). Universal sitting on a goldmine? Hmm-I highly doubt it. Comparisons to Kylie are laughable, even Kristine W. almost dismissive - these sound like MUSAK versions of much better songs - she has a long way to go- mainly on working with better writers and finding something new to put on the table-because Becky has two things that are evidently going for her - talent, and looks, which is what it takes..and a good song.

They ran me in circles for the 3 months and then told me my phone was out of warranty and that I would have to buy a new one. Not likely. A quick email to the local BBB motivated them to replace my handset which I am still waiting on. Thanks BBB, never again Uniden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone","review":"Several years ago we bought the 3 phone set with the main base for use in our home. We live on a large piece of property with a couple of separate buildings. The phone has a nice range and has worked well in places I wouldn't have thought it would. I bought this extra handset to use in my workshop.

This is a remarkable phone system! Absolutely the best one I have ever purchased in my life. I do not want to live without the do not disturb function, which mutes the answering machine but records your incoming messages without the phone ringing. I work at night and now I can get some peaceful sleep in the morning without being interupted before I get up. Too many features to list, just make sure you read the manual thoroughly to get them most use of all the features and set it up to you preferences. If you need a multi handset phone this one is a gem! Love the amber colored keypad buttons too. I just keep telling my friends how great my new phone is, now I want to tell everyone to get one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product....","review":"I absolutely love these phone handsets. I already owned the base with the answering machine and one extra handset; but I wanted to add on to allow my family to take advantage of the intercom feature. I have a 3-level home and three kids, yelling up and down the stairs is usually a futile attempt at getting their attention. This phone allows me to ring whichever handset I want and also allows conferencing between 3 handsets at once. The speaker feature is very clear and the ability to retrieve my messages from any handset is an awesome extra.Bottom line: Excellent product at an unbeatable price!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very competent electronics","review":"I bought this to complete a 4-phone system, the maximum it'll take.The sound quality is great, nice choice of ringtones.

You could hear the person that was calling you or that you were calling but THEY COULDN'T HEAR YOU! I figured that it was the ear piece volume that was either low or broken. It must have been the broken, because I couldn't find the volume for the handset ear piece volume! And believe me, I DID read the intruction manual! WORST MONEY EVER SPENT!

So, the second time I poached eggs I applied some cooking oil on the cups, but the eggs still stuck. I had to pry them out with a knife or small spatula. Then the cups were very difficult to clean.

The \\"possessive\\" theme, with the hero (although I'm not sure that I would call him that) continuously saying \\"You belong to me\\" or \\"You're mine\\" to the heroine, is completely disturbing. The author seems to be conveying the idea that as long as someone loves you it's okay to make these statements.

One can easily use the strobe set with a sync cable (included, although it's short) or by using an on-camera flash that will trip the slave function of the strobe lamps.

There was nothing wrong with them, but elsewhere in the book the idea seemed to be to think outside the box and forget specific styles, as in the section on using flexible weapons. When he got down to specific techniques it blunted that challenge a bit.But that's a nitpick.

Its examples promote a number of good techniques for segmenting business and presentation logic, but break down a bit when illustrating how application logic should be segmented into procedures.Use this as a good place to get started, then follow-up with individuals who have built larger scale PL/SQL Web Toolkit applications (via Oracle user groups, OTN, or newgroups) for additional insight on good application architecture. I would also recommend getting a good book on DHTML, CSS, and JavaScript to round out the picture (such as Danny Goodman's Dynamic HTML from O'Reilly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanda Kingsbury","review":"I have Essential Tremors and am no longer able to write.

He got this castle from Nana for Christmas(the version with the play figures and accessories too). He has played with this more than any toy he received! The fold up feature is so nice- he carries it around to play. Great for imagination! I was worried about losing all the little accessories, but they fit in the castle for storage and so far, so good. This is a GREAT castle for this age child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy!","review":"My 3 year old son got this castle for Christmas and loves it! He plays with it on a daily basis. Even his little brother (just turned two) and older sister (seven) enjoy it. It's very sturdy and doesn't make any noise! We have a few of the accessories to go with the castle, and I like the idea of adding to the set in the future. My son loves to make the trap doors and other surprises work. His favorite thing to do is line up his toy dinosaurs with the dragon and have them attack the castle. The knights fight off the beasts with their swords and the cannon. Sometimes, sadly, they get eaten. It's fun for us to watch him play, to see and hear his imagination at work. This is a great toy, probably the best toy any of our kids have recieved in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"Provides a lot of entertainment for imaginative youngsters.

My only complaint is that after playing with if for only about a week, the draw-bridge does not stay closed now (it is always down because it won't latch for some reason). This is very dissapointing because my son is not at all rough with his toys. He still loves to play with it but gets upset that he can't control the draw-bridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"NUMBER ONE TOY PURCHASED OF CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR","review":"MY SON LOVES THIS TOY THE MOST OF ALL OF THE IMAGINEXT TOYS WE PURCHASED...

He and his 6 year old sister have had many wonderful adventures already with this set. The castle has many interactive parts --- working drawbridge, a trap door that drops guys down to the dungeon, secret doors, etc. The whole set is very sturdy and can take quite a bit of abuse. When I first got the toy in the mail, I was concerned that it was a bit big, but it really does fold together into a nice compact piece. I agree with a previous poster that it would be nice if there was a latch to keep it closed, and my son does have some difficulty putting some of the armor on the knights. But he plays with this set daily, and I would not hesitate to recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, Great value, and lots of fun.","review":"I bought this castle for my 4 year old son at Christmas. He plays with this toy everyday hours on end. We have fun finding guys to buy to go with this castle. I recommend this product to people who have kids who are into knights, dragon's, and castle's. I give this a thumbs up. The thing I love about it the most is that it folds up to take less room. He loves it because it is made with trap doors and stairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I recently saw the movie for the first time, which I thought was fantastic. Couldn't get the soundtrack out of my head for the next several days, so I decided I had to buy it. Got it on iTunes for $9.99, as one of the other reviewers suggested, and it was easy to burn to CD from there. Definitely don't pay what these people are asking, even though the soundtrack is so good, it would be worth it, if there was no other alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful soundtrack to a beautifully stylish film","review":"Stewart Copeland's soundtrack to Rumblefish is such an essential part of the movie that listening to it brings back all of the gorgeous imagery from Coppola's film. The one and only song on the soundtrack, \\"Don't Box Me In\\", features the unique vocals of Wall of Voodoo's Stan Ridgeway, himself a great storyteller. The mostly percussive soundtrack (of course!) has a wonderful flow mirroring the reflective nature of the film then ramping up the pace to match moments of chaos and danger. This is a very lovely and enjoyable record, probably more suited to fans of Philip Glass, Eno and Krautrock than Police groupies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passport to Knowledge","review":"The time is at hand for all thinking people to arise from their bondage to the error thoughts which have enslaved them.

This is my second Corona. I use these headlamps almost daily around our property as I am often out and about in the night. Before I retired I used one exclusively in wildland firefighting and it held up well in a very demanding and dirty environment. So, if you require a durable h-lamp with relatively long life on the batteries in a compact and comfortable package then you won't be disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE, DON'T BUY IT","review":"I bought this from Princeton Tec through Amazon. This was not a knock-off product as other reviews may suggest. My purpose was to use this while ice fishing at night. I liked that it came with quality Duracell batteries, and that it was bright. Why the poor review?...IT STOPPED WORKING IN THE FIRST 30 MINUTES OF USE!! Within the first half-hour of the first fishing trip I turned the light on and off maybe 5 times before the on-off button would no longer work...the light wouldn't turn off. I thought maybe it could be reset if I pulled the batteries out and put them back in, but then it wouldn't turn on again. I let it sit in my warm house for a few days, and still doesn't work. Tried new batteries, doesn't work. I do not recommend this product to anyone. The function buttons (on-off, and mode) were difficult to push while I was wearing it, and as I also found out, the buttons are not quality engineered and fail quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lamp","review":"I use this lamp every week when I'm hiking or just doing things where I need light at head. It's really worth the money. It is surprisingly bright. It has the ability to light up the trail in front of you. The beam pattern is more flood than a spot light. The weather-proof is great. I was out on the Appalachian Trail for a week during rain. It held up without a problem. Battery life is great, too. No complaints from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promises even flood of light, delivers uneven narrow beam","review":"The Corona's description says it \\"floods your entire field of vision with an even distribution of light\\". Not even close. It uses eight narrow-focus LEDs that point in the exact same direction so you get a tiny dot of light directly in front of the lamp and little or no illumination anywhere else. It's like a maglight that's been set to narrow beam. Worse, the dot is bright blue in the center and yellow around the edges.I've had a Princeton Tec Apex for coming up on a decade. It's been almost perfect the whole time, but as a close work light the beam is too narrow so I bought the Corona based on the description. It was a mistake. The Apex has a wider, more even field of illumination with more even color than the Corona, so the Corona is going straight back. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Advertised","review":"I clicked on \\"Princeton Tec Corona 8 LED Headlamp\\" and added it to my shopping cart, but the headlamp that was delivered to me was a cheapo Princeton Tec Scout.\\" Be very careful when ordering. The pictures are very deceptive."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes only to be let down","review":"I was very excited when I received this headlamp and had high expectations due to the numerous positive reviews I've read. However after opening the light and testing it for a few minutes in my apartment it stopped working completely. I changed the batteries and it still wouldn't turn on. There were no signs of shipping damage or manufacturing defect that I could see so it must have been an internal failure. Princeton tec's warranty for this product would allow me to send it them to be repaired but it would take 3 weeks for me to get it back. I went with a Petzl MYO RXP 2 will be getting it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted","review":"Very nice headlamp. Comfortable, the top strap really helps.

This is such a well written book, and I love everything about it.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Franklin's Island","review":"Such a great book.

It's an amazing read for anyone above the age of 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on your interests.","review":"If it was just my own opinion, I'd give this book 5 stars, but I really like animals and shapeshifters and such and for someone who wasn't so interested in that could easily get bored. I like the laid back parts on the beach or in the cages because it feels more real. Adventures aren't action after exciting action after exciting action. Lots of it IS down time. Now, don't get confused, there is plenty going on and definitely some scenes full of action, but there are times to where the story is just... developed. I think this book is worth reading, and I, personally enjoyed it. i found the writing beautiful and the plot fascinating. However, if you are a struggling reader or have difficulties with attention span, this is probably a book you'll never finish. See for yourself though, and find out if the lost-on-a-deserted-island story with a major twist is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!!!","review":"I loved the book, Dr. Franklin's Island, by Ann Halam.

But im not strong stomached either. Overall though i think it is dumb, thinking about it realistically or i guess just visualising it it is completly ridiculas!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun sci-fi novel","review":"Dr. Franklin's Island was very much like a version of Dr. Moreau's Island for teens. I didn't expect to like it nearly as much as I did. From the very first chapter I found myself sucked in to the story and caught up in the action. I read in disbelief as Semi and Miranda learned of what was to happen to them. The book moves very quickly and, though the subject the book deals with is highly unbelievable, Ann Halam manages to write a very realistic - and horrifying - story of genetic engineering. I could seriously have nightmares after reading this book! The ending, I thought, was left a little bit open... so maybe we can look forward to sequels? Let's hope so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Franklin's Island","review":"Although I read the book over a year and a half ago, I still think about it greatly. Recently finishing reading The island of Dr. Moreau which inspired Dr.F's island. The author filled in the details of the experiments which Wells left out. The book was exciting to read. If you enjoy sci-fi and drama this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Franklins Island","review":"This book was good, but its not my favorite book ever. It was surprising at some points in the story but sometimes boring. In the beginning of the book it got interesting because you wanted to know more about the plane crash that Semi, Arnie and Miranda got into. They were the only 3 that survived. I would recommend this book to basically anyone, but I don't know how they'd feel about it. Some people may have other opinions than me but thats what I thought of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh..","review":"Oh man, what a joke. It has a good start, and then she starts trying to talk science, except that apparently she can't. Ok, so sci fi isn't supposed to be realistic, but it should at least be relatively logical and/or have some figment of rationality or believability to it. This does not. It's pretty funny though. I can see it becoming a hit on Comedy Central someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first Spiderman soundtrack!","review":"I bought Spiderman 2 soundtrack first day before opening night of Spiderman 2 and I really enjoyed the songs that were on. The only thing I don't get is that some of the songs weren't even in the movie but still it doesn't matter it's really good including Danny Elfman's amazing score.

Well, although at first I was not too impressed, I listened to it a few times and realized it's a good cd. I especially like the first five songs with Dashboard's Confessional's Vindicated being my favorite. The train song is really good and the Jet song, which I believe was the only song actually used in the movie, was also good. Those first five songs make it four stars for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Soundtrack","review":"The soundtrack to the movie \\"Spiderman 2\\" is a really great album. It's the only place to find Dashboard Confessional's wicked song \\"Vindicated\\" other than purchasing their single. I love Train and the song \\"Ordinary\\" was no disappointment. The song by Hoobastank is no match for \\"The Reason\\" and is rather mediocre. I was pretty shocked at Maroon 5's song \\"Woman\\". I love this band but that song stinks. Yellowcard proved themselves once again with \\"Gifts and Curses\\", creating one of the best songs on the album. The rest of the cd is so-so but that is overshadowed by a few outstanding singles. The last two tracks are orchestrations of the Spiderman and Doc Ock Suite. They are also great. I highly reccommend this cd especially if you enjoyed the original Spiderman soundtrack and the Daredevil soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes me back...to 2004.","review":"Every time I listen to this soundtrack, I'm taken back to that magical summer of 2004. Such fond memories. Great movie, great soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be Titled Music Not From The Movie","review":"This is a very poor \\"soundtrack\\" as the majority of the music presented isn't from the movie. In addition, only two of Danny Elfman's excellent score tracks appear on this so called \\"soundtrack\\". What's funny is that there is only one real song featured in the movie - Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head. Now look at the official movie soundtrack listings and tell me where this song appears. This is a very poor excuse for a soundtrack and should be titled, \\"Music NOT from the Motion Picture\\". Stay away from this version, but definitely get the score if they ever put it out.Update: Good news for those wanting the actual music from the movie. Months after this \\"soundtrack\\" came out, the real one came out with the actual score from the movie and the one song - Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head - featured in the movie.

Don't waste the money on the soundtrack just get the movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great just like the movie.","review":"I just got this CD after seeing the movie. I wanted the ending credits song. (Vedicated by Dashboard Confessional) I think they did a great job at the selection of artists on the CD considering Peter Parker's personality. He is so Emo. Although I wouldn't recommend this CD to just anyone. You definitely have to have a sort of taste for more of the punk rock persuasion. Even then I'm afraid that some people will be stand offish to the pop-punk qualities of the CD. But in the end there is a reason why they are so popular. Give it a chance! It might surprise you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One really cool soundtrack!!!","review":"Although I haven't watched the movie yet, I can say that they've put a really decent soundtrack togetehr. You get Maroon and Train on it, a kinda pop-rockers whom I really like. Then you also get Jet, great aussie rockers. But the best is yet to come. There are also songs from Lostprophets and Smile Empty Soul, both being one of my favourite bands. And on the end, you geat a really great, super, fantastic song from Ana, titled We Are. This song is a really great pop song and I listened it quite a few times.This is why thsi cd is worth getting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity itself....","review":"The music is utterly mediocre run of the mill pap. When will movie soundtracks get more creative? Why is it only Quentin Tarantino who can cook up good soundtracks? The great crime here is that this CD didn't include that awesome Chinese violin lady from the movie who performed the Spider Man theme in a wonderfully atonal and comedic manner. They also didn't have the lounge version of the theme, from the closing credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Vindicated / I Am Right -- But a Bit Too Much Loud Rock","review":"This CD contains some great music from the movie but also some other \\"inspired by\\" tracks that aren't really very good. The first song, \\"Vindicated,\\" is excellent, as are the two instrumental pieces. I'd say \\"Ordinary\\" is also a pretty good piece.I'd say this CD's main failing is a bit too much loud, sound-alike rock that's easy to push into the background, especially if you're listening to it while working on the computer or something. I'm not one of those people who hates all rock, but a lot of this stuff is just really noisy and boring. If you are someone who doesn't like a lot of loud rock, you definitely won't want this, although the CD might still be worth it for the good tracks. If you are someone who generally likes it, you probably still won't like this.I'd say if you can get this one cheap, go for it, but definitely don't shell out a lot of cash for it, or buy it over some other CD that you'd like to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME GOOD SONGS BUT...","review":"First I want to say that I bought this cd because I like a lot the music from Jet and Midtown and decided to give it a try because it has a modest group selection. When I heard the first song \\"Vindicated\\" I said WOW this cd is going to be awsome, the second song is very boring as Hoobastank song. I have to admit that Jet's song is totally great! also Midtown song, but all the other songs are just boring. I recomend you to first listen the song samples because this cd for me anly has 3 good songs that aren't worth the money, download them better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Worry!

Anna Oxygen makes great neo-new wave intrepreted pop art with very tight hooks and cosmic aerobic energy to boot. She sings a very talented, mean souful and operatic scale, recalling Lene Lovich (and there's some Kate Bushisms going on as well) over catchy electronic Keytar driven melodies ala OMD, Yaz, and newer cut and paste aesthetics as well. Quirky songs of check out girls and scientists are catchy and will remain with you for days. Buy this album now!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality.","review":"I would never suggest anyone to buy this slide whistle. The entire lower half of the slide-range isn't even usuable, it makes a terrible shrieking sound. The rest of the notes play inconsistently, only if you pull the slide at a weird angle. After much frustration, I opened it up and took a look inside to see what the problem was. The plastic diaphragm that vibrates to make the sound still had stubs on it from where the mold injected the plastic, which deformed the shape of the diaphragm as it was pushed up against the tube, allowing air to bypass the diaphragm altogether, preventing it from making a good sound.This is a complete waste of money, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Licorice","review":"A good sweet light licorice with light aftertaste. Mild and not salted and as a result, not quite as tasty as some of the better katjesdrop. My 98 year old mother liked them and had no difficulty gumming them.

I actually never thought much of him, but that was before I owned this cd. Something about his delivery makes it seem as if he's playing and singing right next to you. This includes many great songs, including \\"Wild World\\", \\"Morning Has Broken\\", \\"Can't Keep It In\\", and \\"Moonshadow\\". Overall it's a nice simple collection.

I was 17 years old at the time. I drove away in silence, with another friend. He turned on the radio and we heard \\" Wild World\\" for the first time. Cat Stevens was just another artist during those days....he didn't compete with the Allman Brothers or Canned Heat or Santana.... For some reason I decided to buy the CD...the result was a flood of feelings....i listen over and over to \\"Father and Son\\"...I find it hard to believe he gave up on music.....His music and lyrics are something special.....I think a gift to all of us....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant Sound","review":"I love the music of Cat Stevens, but would not recommend this particular CD.

This watch meets all the requirements. I like to be able to wake up in the middle of the night and know what time it is, and this watch is perfect for that. The velcro strap makes it comfortable to sleep in, wrap on a beach bag handle, pull off quickly in a pinch, etc. etc. My one quibble with it is that the velcro is getting a little hairy and unruly. I cannot see it lasting as long as the watch itself. Still -- a minor criticism. I'd buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific watch for the money","review":"I'm an old woman who doesn't like ditzy watches. This watch has a big face, and actual numbers. No slashes or dashes. When i look at my wrist I can see what time it is right away. The velcro strap is easy on and off, and the watch weighs practically nothing.

I would not recommend this watch to anyone unless you plan on using it very gently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for rugged outdoor use","review":"Bought this watch from Amazon about 5 months ago. After a few months the plastic case inlet part that holds the band pen broke.

It is easy to read, keeps great time, and the battery has lasted for almost three years now.The band is my only complaint. As with most velcro, after a few hundred (or thousand as it actually may be) openings and closings, it begins to get less secure. I find I have to tighten it up more often than I used to.

This is my first trap thrower, so take this into consideration.I also bought the wobbler unit, but took it back off the thrower for now.

The seat is amazingly comfortable for all sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product","review":"The assembly instructions are very poor. You have to figure most of it out as you go. They don't include any lock washers either. Once I got it together it is a nice looking machine but A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY. It breaks OVER 50 percent of the birds it throws. I have adjusted the tension spring as week as I can and still throw a bird but it still breaks most of the birds. I have contacted customer service three times now but they they have made no reply.

If your into shooting trap this machine is worth the large price tag. The 3/4 cock is much easier to re-cock than the full cock, especially if you have women or kids working the thrower.

It throws flawlessly all day long, First day out we threw about 750 clays, maybe 10 clays broke. I think it was more the clays than the thrower causing it.

Featuring members from since defunct but relatively well regarded Boston based groups Kudgel and Green Magnet School, Black Helicopter have played with the likes of Sonic Youth, Shellac, and Mission of Burma. And yet, paradoxically, despite their impressive resume, Black Helicopter stands out as anything but. The phenomenally derivative and incredibly trite Invisible Jet is about as profound as a 13 year old girl's diary and equally as relevant. In all a less than mediocre record from a band that had the potential to produce something fantastic. Ultimately, however, they end up sounding like less than the sum of their influences.

Using a magnifying glass to see details results in seeing images broken into printing dots that are pretty BIG. This way one has an impression of seeing paintings without really seeing them as they break down upon a closer look. This is an interesting phenomena in itself but it's decreasing the book's value as of a document. Of course this doesn't apply to all reproductions.Another matter is color quality, although this complaint could apply to the majority of art books.Suggestion:As for this reviewer art books published by an Italian house \\"Electa\\" reproduce colors to such a standard, other publisher should blush. \\"Electa\\" had published a book containing images from San Marco, that was also published in English.

The Travelling people have been living in the traditional way for centuries in Ireland and yes, some have made their way to the States. Obviously, there are good and bad in every culture, but it seems that the writer of this book is trying to blame Travellers for every major scam in America. This is ridiculous. It is also insulting to the majority of the Travellers, who are law-abiding, respectable citizens who mind their own business. The book was obviously written with the explicit purpose of slanderizing the Irish Travellers, which is a shame. If the writer had done more research, as opposed to just cranking out a sensationalist tabloid essay, he would have found that a small minority of scams are carried out by Travellers, however, Travellers often get blamed for scams that they have no responsibility for ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a scam!","review":"The book is racist and ignorant at best. It is hypocritical at worst because it is itself a scam. It plays up the stereotypes that people have about traveling people and feeds on the fears about those who are mysterious and different. There are better sources of information about travelers. I suggest visiting The Patrin at http://www.geocities.com/Paris/5121/reading.htm for recommended books.

To my dismay, it seems that the noise is picked up in any environment because the motor mechanism is simply very very loud. The noise is captured on tape and is so loud it is hard to filter out without ruining the sound track.I purchased a Panasonic GS14 and while the CCD isn't as good as the JVC's, there is no motor noise at all.

Thinking about business organizations as rational individuals responding to incentives and new information simply fits the facts. The three basic elements developed in this book allow managers to translate this logical thinking into operational decisions: allocating decision rights, measuring performance, and compensating individuals and groups. The power of this approach in analyzing common management problems equips the reader with a rich set of tools for identifying and solving them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks because I have not received the book so far","review":"It would be nice to receive the book if you pay for it, right?You guys suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring book I've ever read","review":"A had to buy this book through my University but actually A had to buy another one to figure things out because this book is not only boring but also incomplete, biased, thin and expensive, not well illustrated... basically one of the worse book I've ever had!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"freakin awesome soundtrack=go and buy it right now!","review":"along with the jackass the movie soundtrack and the haggard soundtrack this is one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard, ever. every song on this soundtrack is cool plus there are clips from the movie on it. go and buy this today, after all, you wouldn't want to feel like a jackass for not buying it now would you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This soundtrack is great","review":"When I saw the second jackass movie the songs were so amazing and I just had to have the soundtrack.

It is written using Cajun dialect in the dialog which if you are not from the area (or have someone who is to help) might pose a difficulty. It is about a young girl befriending an Indian girl in the Bayou Barataria area. The story tells how the Indian girl works her way into the family and makes a place for herself. It shows how the people made a living on the bayou fishing, hunting, and trapping. It gives a wonderful depiction of how they celebrated holidays and lived out daily life. It shows the unique Cajun culture in a day when being called a cajun was an insult.

They are not used together in the same dish. Ethiopian dishes are made with one or the other, but not both. Also. the ingredients were listed in a completely different sequence, which changes the taste considerably, not to mention how much the lack of chili peppers changes the balance, keeping it way too bland, and without any heat.Fortunately, i live in Los Angeles where there is an Ethiopian section of town where injera and classic berbere can be purchased.

It's a page-turner, definitely easy to read and down-to-earth when it comes to human emotions and honest soul-searching. The hero is refreshingly shy, clumsy and willing to make mistakes....I loved the heroine Jackie, she was so convincing in all her \\"unpretentious spontaneity,\\" and even Richard managed to outdo her, at times, with his primroses, butterflies and rabbits - for a start. It was a dramatic ending, but the author worked up to it just fine, in my opinion. My mom usually doesn't like the same books as I do, but she did admit it was \\"different\\" and couldn't put it down once she'd started...and we both agreed the characters were intriguing and very well developed (the women more so than Richard, in fact)."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Professional\\" Grade Chips","review":"I was a little hesitant about buying poker chips off the web but after speaking (by telephone 800 number listed in their profile) with one of the sellers I felt comfortable enough to buy one of these 650 chip sets.

If there is real money being bet then I would opt for a more substantial deck. The dice are OK as well but are not casino grade. The aluminium case has a felt like lining and is adequate for the job. Overall I am pleased with the set considering the total cost involved. Buyers should check the shipping charges to their address to insure they know the total cost before buying.

To all you readers, I hope you will give Pine Hollow a try. This book displays teen views and problems in real life, plus it talks about horses. Also for me, if i wanted more INFORMATION about horses, I would just get a real book on horses. I think it is great what Ms. Bryant is doing with her new series.

To be specific, when I'm having online game parties (3~4 computers) connected to an outside server, this router looses it. It's annoying, but it's easily fixed by unplugging and plugging it back in.Like I said, if you're not hosting network parties at your place, then this is a great router!NOTE: Definately make sure the firmware in this router is up to date.

The router was attached to a Linksys Cable Modem and a Linksys 5-port hub was connected to one of the router ports in my home office. I had the exact same experience as Mark did when contacting Linksys help.I would give the router 5 stars for it's performance, but being it crashed after six months, not so good tech support and their terrible RMA process, I knocked it down to 2 stars.I wonder about my Linksys cable modem and hub...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Problems but quick response for resolution","review":"1st order was a bad unit - company quickly re-shipped and corrected the issue.Lessons learned - more complete communications needed - Nice recovery"},{"rating":"2","title":"works as expected","review":"I plugged it in and read in the software and everything worked fine.

Plus, the author displays a talent for telling a good, creepy story in very few words! Some of the premises are far-fetched, but hey, it's primarily targeted as a kids' book, right? I also recommend the first book, \\"The Oozing Eyeball...\\" Both books will satisfy fans of \\"Scary Tales to Tell in the Dark\\" series.

Invited 2 neighbor boys over for cake and afterwards opened the presents - this one was the one they all wanted to play with. Didn't have helium so blew it up using the enclosed straw- so far so good. I thought they'd toss it around the living room (gently, but what do I know) , but they ran outside with it. 5 fun-filled soaring tosses and 3 minutes later it was torn from edge to edge and that was the end of that. Just looked at their web site - says you can tape it together and should be OK, but previous reviewer seems to have had a poor resolution with that. If this was made with a little (or a lot) more durability, this would be a great fun toy. If you have kids who will toss it around gently, it IS fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Inflated it and it did not even resemble a circle shape.

The first one did not last very long, but at least it was a lot of fun to throw while it lasted. This one is simply not the same. The outside plastic ring that keeps the hover disc's circular shape is so flimsy you cannot even throw it without the entire thing buckling in your hands. Our first one had a nice firm outer ring that would enable you to throw it with a good heave. This one is practically useless.

Well, we went to the store, filled it with helium, took it to the park (it was not at all windy) and my son threw it in the air and it hovered...and hovered...and hovered...all the way across the river!!! Needless to say my son was extremely upset and for that matter so was I!! I wrote the company but have not heard back from them.

You get the feeling the author used to be involved in the mafia or something, but I don't even think he was that sophisticated. All in all, I'll say this book lacked depth and disappointed.

He meant the book to be a call for people to demand the system stop punishing people who kill violent criminals to avoid being victimized by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save Your Life","review":"Has anyone ever been in this position?

She has the perfect remedy for her chubby hubby (no..it's not Prozac...or Viagra!).This classic Rankin/Bass animated tale surrounds the story of a Christmas that almost wasn't. The jokes are corny but the short, silly vaudeville sequence of the Heat Mizer and the Snow Mizer dancing and singing has made this feature a cherished classic for both children and generations of adults.(I'm waiting for a live action Hollywood remake of this one with Jack Nicholson cast as the Snow Mizer and Danny Devito as Heat Mizer)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Holiday Tradition","review":"What do you do when Santa Claus decides to take the year off because the North Pole is too cold?

Great to have it combined with Nestor, another classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids","review":"You might think that stories about Santa and Rudolph and Nestor the Donkey are just for kids. Year Without a Santa Claus appeared on TV while I was in grad school, and my friends and I were immediately fans of it and watched it year after year as we tried to complete our Ph.D's. As other reviewers have mentioned, it has a great cast, worthy of a Broadway hit, all of whom obviously took their work seriously. Nothing shoddy here. Lots of humor and cleverly written songs. The Mini-Me version chorus lines of the Miser Brothers are hysterical. The song \\"Believe in Santa Claus\\" may well bring a tear to your eye. Ditto the other two entries on the disc. Red Skelton was well into his 60's when he starred in Rudolph's Shiny New Year, and his touching rendition of \\"The Moving Finger Writes\\", concerning the inexorable passage of time, was particularly poignant for me, who just turned 50 in 2001. Great, sophisticated family entertainment, never dumbed down for the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"year without santa dvd","review":"i received the santa movie dvd very fast and it was in great shape.i would tell people that it was a great experience. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heat miser is the man","review":"I grew up watching this classic of christmas and taped it some years ago when my children were young...good thing for it was not shown for a few years and it was my boy and girl's favorite.

Probably the most memorable part of this particular story (Santa decides to take a vacation) is the Heat Miser/Snow Miser song. Anyone who grew up during the seventies will gleefully remember the animated puppet productions by Rankin/Bass about Frosty and Rudolf and, of course, Santa Claus. However, enjoyment of these stories is not limited to the thirty-something crowd. Last year, when \\"Rudolf, the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" came out on DVD, I purchased it to savour and reminisce with my friends. To my surprise, my nephews and niece (ages 3, 5, and 7) LOVED it.

Baby New Year is so cute (in Rudolph's Shiny New Year). Ok have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best.","review":"I grew up watching this & the other Rankin & Bass Christmas specials so there is a nostalgia element to my rating. One of the best qualities of this movie is that it is unpolished. It isn't perfect stop motion animation and that is what gives it its charm. I really enjoyed The Nightmare Before Christmas ( i own it too) but the flawless stop motion took away from it, a little, for me. Sometimes imperfection IS perfection. The story here is pretty straight forward, read the synopsis and you've got it. The most memorable parts of this move, of course, are snow and heat miser. They stole the show even though they don't have much screen time over all. This movie has a child like magic and charm (with out being childish) that just isn't anywhere to be found anymore. The Christmas movies today could take a page or two from the older classic Christmas shows (fred claus was awful imo).Charming, fun, simple and full of Christmas spirit, I highly recommend giving it a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This DVD has a wonderful selection of holiday puppet animation. Most people have seen the Santa and Rudolph movies but are unfamiliar with the story of Nestor. This is my favorite Christmas movie. The story of Nestor is a charming Christmas story told from the point of view of an orphaned donkey that must journey to Bethlehem and with the guidance of a cherub learns his oversized ears have a very unique purpose.

However, the last batch I bought--all of them developed holes in the heels after about two days of use.

(I got the CD here on Amazon, but it's also available on iTunes [am I allowed to say that???]) This music is just so fun to listen to, dance to, drive to, sing along with--you name it. Even the songs with lyrics that convey longing, loss, or uncertainty, the music somehow radiates happiness, so it's a great album to have on hand when you need a pick-me-up. It's witty and a bit quirky and definitely has the hooks to get you grooving, but it's fresh--not at all cheesy.

However, Bardo Pond have always been trailblazers in the realm of psychedelic rock, each album contributing new sounds to their bag of tricks. I remember being amazed at how many changes and variations occured on Dilate, and yet they still managed to have a consistent, whole sound. Popping in Ellipse, I found myself bored as track after track provided nothing that hadn't been thoroughly explored by the group in previous outings. Indeed, it seems like they took the first track off Dilate and multiplied it six times, each track starting on a mellow riff and building to a loud, emotional finish. I'll give them that its their most consistent sounding recording to date, but I feel that it results in a stagnant, repetitive and unimaginative album. Very disappointing in light of brilliant and exciting works such as Lapsed or Dilate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Packaging...","review":"I've purchased other CDs from the Sepia label, so I was a fairly high level of sound quality (Sepia is generally near the top of the import labels that record from old records). Unfortunately, this album fell far below their usual standard.The sound is okay on the instrumental sections, but breaks up whenever Monica Lewis sings. Each of her words end in a garbled, crackling due to sound distortion on the recording. It's barely listenable.There aren't a lot of Monica Lewis albums to choose from, so I'm giving them a second star for making some of her work available.All in all, you're better off copying her songs that are posted at youtube."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need a clarification","review":"Good day friend, I wish you success in your businessI received the box with my products, but there is none of the rear bushings.ENERGY SUSPENSION 16.18110G MASTER SET FOR HONDA CIVICThey were in the package? or not they contain?I ask because according to the product description says all I need to come and see all the back missing.I hope your news to get the feed backI\`m sorry but don\`t speak inglish.Regards,jonathanmarro"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Information","review":"Would love to purchase this Item howerver it states nothing about the type of electrical hook up.

The reviews were so positive and glowing that I thought I'd just take the plunge- after all I know the Light Crust Doughboy's work from the 1940's (nice stuff!) and I dug the Ventures from way,way back.I'm sad to say that this CD is as low on energy as any I've heard in recent memory. Nokie Edwards is relegated to acoustic guitar for the most part and Tom Brumley is primarily restrained by the anemic rhythm section. Bland electric keyboards shackle any enthusiasm the music might generate and the arrangements are weak........... what a huge disappointment. This could have been a sparkling, energetic romp but for the most part is a real slog. Do the other reviewers even know what exciting Western Swing is? I wonder.."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Raw Metallica","review":"I saw this video for the first time when it was released in 1987. It truly exposes the rawness of early Metallica. I believe they where at their greatest at this point. There is a lot of bootleg video in this Cliff'Em All VHS. A true Metallica fan would eat it up. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did Cliff have to go?","review":"Cliff was obviously the most talented part of Metallica, and established them as the heavy metal Behemoths of the eighties and early ninties. While he died in '86 (RIP) his influence on Metallica survived, and is one reason why 'Justice' and black album were great. This video captures Cliff at some of his finest monents with Metallica, and it is clear that he wont be forgotten any time soon. Cliff 'Em All proves how important Burton was to Metallica, and without him, they would have sounded much, much different. They say only the good die young, like Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, and Kurt Cobain (that last could be argued), Cliff Burtons influence will not vanish in the realm of rock.Oh yeah, there was one reviewer who said this was missing something. I do agree that this should have had Orion (the bass solo kicks ass in that), but I dont think its a big problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE THING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN","review":"This video is indispensible for those who want to remember Metallica as the great band they once were. Featuring bootleg performances of songs from Cliff Burtons days with the band as well as photos and rare footage CLIFF EM ALL is the sort of no frills, no BS you got from Metallica before they let everything go to their heads and started releasing mediocre material. Its great to see Dave Mustaine on lead guitar early on. But all Metallica is these days is Kirk Hammett and a couple of middle aged egomaniacs. Sad really. Cliff would be turning in his grave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliff is missed","review":"Like the box cover says \\"the audio quality aint all that happening but, the feeling is there\\" and they aren't kidding.

Long Live Cliff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember the good old days?","review":"Yes this DVD was dedicated to the memory of Cliff Burton, but it's also a tribute to old-school Metallica. Ah... the good old days. When it was all about the music. This DVD is excellent. Some people complain about poor quality, both visual and audio, but if you consider how old the footage is (and bootlegs nontheless), you'll be amazed at the quality. After reading other reviews I expected something pretty bad. Man, was I amazed!Yes, maybe this is not the ideal DVD to turn someone who has never heard of Metallica, but the bottom line is that if you're a true fan, you will not be dissappointed with buying this.

I was a senior at Castro Valley High in 1977. There was this shy, Quiet, long haired, red headed kid named Cliff Burton. He carried a Guitar case everywhere he went. I had no idea what an innovative musical bass master he was to become! His amazing talents are shown on this DVD, along with a personal side thats very cool! Dave Mustane also appears on some of the early show footage. We will never know what Cliff could have accomplished, due to his untimely and tragic passing. This DVD captures his and Metallica's early greatness! I for one miss Cliff Burton!

I too am a fan, not only of the band but also the DVD format. This recording may well be 'raw' and 'gutsy' but I found it disappointing. It does no justice to the band or the format.

I wish I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"METALLICA AT THEIR VERY BEST","review":"James, Dave, Lars, and, of course, the late great Cliff Burton himself.

I, and no doubt millions of other Christians love Jesus because of his grace and never-ending love. How easy it would be to so focus on these aspects of God and to lose sight of why He is truly so great. Plantinga's book reminds us of the monumental problem that Jesus has saved us from--Sin. Sin is a loaded word. Many people have and still abuse it. Plantinga does not. Plantinga eloquently terms it \\"Vandalism of God's Shalom\\"--God's perfect created order. This metaphor shocked me at first, but then opened my eyes. This is a book that will challenge any reader. It is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fascinating exploration of sin.","review":"This book was ranked as Christianity Today's Book of the Year for 1996, and it is well deserving of the honor. Plantinga has done a remarkable job of describing sin in all its various forms as well as its myriad of subtle dynamics and seductions.His general thesis is that sin is a disruption of the shalom of God - anything that detracts from the way things are supposed to be. So the Christian task in counteracting the forces of sin in the world is to do whatever possible to restore shalom.Sin may not seem like a cheery topic, but this book is truly edifying. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and direct teaching on the doctrine of sin","review":"I read this book every couple of years, and some particular, personally relevant chapters I read more often than that. I highly recommend it as a devotional aid in understanding our great Problem in its various dimensions, and in gaining a clearer picture of the depth of God's love to offer a way of deliverance from sin. This book, by centering the reader on sin, indirectly leads the reader to the Cross. There are not a lot of books from seminary that I regularly recommend to friends and church members, but this is certainly one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this saw!","review":"I bought this saw to cut down sheets of plywood before bringing them into the bsmt where there is a table saw.

I remember these days - I remember Commodores, Tandy TRS-80s, Apple IIs and IBM PCs. There was a day when we had computers without Microsoft. There were plenty of ways it could have gone. Without this sneaky deal Bill Gates made with IBM to provide something he didn't even have - and then to go out and BUY an operating system from a guy in a warehouse for $50,000 Microsoft never would have gotten going. Bill Gates wasn't a great innovater or computer genius. He was a geek like so many of the rest of us. He just made the right deal at the right time and scammed his way to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRULY A CLASSIC!!","review":"This is such a great, well scripted movie.

I saw that movie and hoped I was ordering the exact same one, but I'm guessing this might be the closest anyone can get to that original version.While this brighter, star-studded and polished version is certainly worthy of anyones attention for its historic references, timeline, etc. I believe the first version had more facts.I bought this for the library so show my grandkids and hopefully motivate them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done...","review":"This is a pretty close account of how our technology (of today) started. I too watched this movie when it came out on cable (TNT) and enjoyed it. I would say this movie is about 85-90% accurate at the time when Microsoft and Apple came about. Very good acting from all actors. If you are interested in how the two giants started, this is the movie to start with. This movie is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average movie","review":"This was made for TNT in 1999. It never ceases to surprise me how good most of the cable movies are and this is no exception. Noah Wyle plays Steve Jobs and Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates. I don't know how much of this movie is true. It's based on a book. Still, it was entertaining and I'm guessing most of it is fact based.Jobs and Gates are two very different people in personality. Jobs seems more creative and Gates more logical. Both are power hungry and will get it by any means. Lots of subterfuge. But Jobs bothered me more because of the way he treated his girlfriend and his daughter by her. I couldn't understand how he could be so cold toward them. Especially considering his own background. I don't want to reveal too much in case anyone chooses to watch this film.Anyway, I do recommend this. It doesn't matter if you know much about computers or not. It's about how they built their empires and them as people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi Steve, Hi Bill, I had fun!","review":"Ok, so this movie is not the most entirely accurate documentary, because it's an adaptation. Some things are portrayed out of context, but I loved it. The story of personal computing through the adapted story of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. A few other people from that era are also portrayed. It's pretty much a movie for the PC as compared to what \\"The Right Stuff\\" is to the early space program. 4.6/5 Stars. I dig this movie, and if you like computers and software, you probably will too. Keep on Computing"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pirates Of Silicon Valley","review":"If you use a computer or enjoyed the social network film you will enjoy this.Not to be missed if you have windows on your pc or own an apple computerIt tells the story of how microsoft and apple developed and the rivalry betweeen Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Give it whirl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Handful of People Can Change the World","review":"This is the best made for TV movie I've ever seen. This is an excellent blend of truth and fiction, and a very entertaining one at that. No this is not pure fact, though a lot of changes make sense such as changing things around to lessen the number of characters in the movie (e.g. Steve Jobs was not there when Woz's computer caught on fire, it was I believe employee number 3 or so). What it does do is provide large brush strokes which give a very good overview of what happened, and certainly captures the essence of the characters and the ways they behaved (even Woz has commented on that). I find the acting and production to be high level for a TV movie. Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the sound track is excellent. Overall I'd say while not a historical documentary it's a great primer to get on interested in it and do further research (as I have), and it's highly entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LOVE COMPUTERS, YOU'LL LOVE THIS HISTORY OF SILICON VALLEY!","review":"BACK TO OUR ROOTS! For anyone who owns a computer and appreciates how far we've come with the Internet and all, this movie is a MUST!It's fascinating material about the history of Apple and Microsoft too.And if you love Silicon Valley, you might want to try a young adult book that's geared towards adults, too: THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY. It's part satire, and stars Steve Wozniak romping around the VALLEY with the TOONIES who escape from the computer (WHERE ELSE!), helping the good TOONIES capture the bad ones who have taken over ORANGE Computer Co. A fun romp with a lot of action and a lot of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to know how it started?","review":"A great \\"made for TV\\" movie, gives you the idea of how the PC world started.

If you want to know how Apple Computers and Microsoft got their starts, watch this and then read a little bit. Isn't it funny how everything is usually related? That is how Bill Gates and Steve Jobs got where they are today. And, as always, a movie with text at the end (you know, when the movie tells you what happened to the characters after the acting is over but before the credits) is never a letdown! Buy it, or just borrow it from someone who has it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it in Class","review":"I teach high school Economics and show this video to every class. I have seen it myself over 50 times and still love it every time. It is great for students to see what corporate giants have to go through to get where they are. I point out subtleties in the content- at the time we had no cell phones, answering machines, remote controls... I also love to point out the \\"stupid corporate guys\\" who had no clue or foresight. The philosophical differences in the 2 corporations is amazing. Don't know how accurate the details are, but it makes for a good dramatization.Not only that, the the music is outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longest Microsoft commercial I have ever seen!","review":"This movie had to be secretly directed by Bill Gates. Gates is portrayed as inteligent, kind, resourceful, hardworking, a business genius, and even wild and crazy. Jobs on the otherhand is given no redeeming qualities what-so-ever (Darth Vader school of personel management). I'm not saying Gates isn't intelligent--he's certainly been successful, but this film is so completely one sided that it ruins what might have been an above average TV movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational","review":"This movie was wonderful. I showed it to my math students as part of a project on computers. There is a stripper sceen and a little drug action so be careful showing it to kids. Beyond that it was wonderful. If you do not know that much about computers and their start, you will still enjoy this. We all know enough about windows and microsoft to be able to follow what goes on in the movie. I am going to buy it for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie for geeks and non-geeks.","review":"I thought this was a good movie. I love computers and technology so, obviously, a movie about the geeks and pirates that started Apple and Microsoft captured my attention. But I also think this is a good movie overall.

The other bookend, \\"Four Flusher\\", has almost as much energy. The rest of the album has quite a mix of styles. After hearing it for the first time a buddy thought the Doobies were from Texas!

The jam at the end of \\"Hangman\\" was featured in an episode of What's Happening - during a scene where the Doobies are playing a concert at the boys' alma mater where Rog and the gang go to school - along with some Doobies classics such as \\"Black Water\\", \\"Takin' It To The Streets\\" and \\"Echoes of Love\\".Some great stuff on this CD - the last the feature Tom Johnston prominantly, even though he did appear on the following album for 1 track.A++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective","review":"I bought this attachment hoping to make dusting easier.

It is a household vacuum dusting attachment which is more likely to be used in all rooms of the house, and especially good with blinds and shutters of all kinds, ledges, bookshelves, entertainment centers, around computers and electronic equipment and so on.

I paid $30 for it, because I thought having the reach of the hose combined with this would be great for doing our ceiling fans. But it's not. The brush isn't adjustable angle-wise, which makes dusting just about anything a labor of inflexibility (imagine dusting a plasma television with a broom, only you had to hold the broom parallel to the screen, rather than perpindicular). The product itself isn't very impressive. If I paid $10 for it, I'd be a lot more forgiving, but I paid three times that, and can only use it for about 10% of the dusting jobs my home requires.

The bristles are soft enough that you can use it on furniture without worrying about scratches. Only thing I was concerned about was that using it to vacuum literally my whole house, the vacuum itself got very hot and I think if I did it every week I'd end up burning out the motor. Overall though, it's an excellent attachment and well worth the $25. If you're anything like me, it's quite irritating to dust and see the particles floating around in the air.

It seems to effortlessly clean dust off everything without disrupting its placement or surface whatsoever.

My house is extremely dusty and has textured walls and ceilings. The dust builds up everywhere and I needed a good way to dust those surfaces that actually gets rid of the dust, instead of just moving it around with cloth cleaning. This brush is the perfect tool for that. I was able to do all my walls and ceilings, as well as do normal dusting of my furniture and everything. It's got a soft pad on the underneath side and won't scratch things. The soft outer bristles loosen the dust and the suction is so great it gets sucked right up one of the 2 holes. On flat surfaces I found it easier to roll it slightly to one side or the other or it'll attach itself like a vice! This is my favorite attachment by far, and really cuts down on the time it takes to clean. I can see myself wearing this out someday and having to buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it does the job","review":"What a pain in the backside to use these things.

The author has taken the musical, in a decade by decade series, from the twenties and into the current crop of shows. The last volume to be published in this series is Sing for Your Supper, the Broadway musical in the 1930s. It is an improvement over the last two volumes and a return to the good work of the previous editions. The two problems with the book, though, are the author's need to spend as much time on an Encores version of a thirties show as the original show itself and, at times, the author's boredom with the thirties as a time of no particular historical interest for the historian of Broadway musicals. When an author seems to lose interest on occasion, it makes it harder for the reader to maintain his. Still, it is a satisfying concluding volume with all of the author's wit, insight, opinions, and general knowledge well-displayed, mixed in with little gems of trivia for the musical fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one--try other Fripp material.","review":"I've been a fan of Robert Fripp and instrumental music for twenty-plus years. \\"Bewitched\\" should be avoided at all costs. Sometimes, an older recording with strong material can be forgiven--not the case with this one. The gosh-awful, quasi-sterile '80s production values don't help these boring, mechanical-sounding tunes in the least. Fripp and Summers have, collectively and individually, produced much more listenable and organic-sounding music. Try any of Fripp's soundscapes.

For Fripp fans, expect an album more along the lines of \\"Fripp shows up and adds some interesting accompaniment and a few solos.\\" For Fripp fans and collectors, the album has interesting points, but it's a step down from I Advance Masked, and not in the same ballpark as Fripp's contributions to, say, Another Green World or Scary Monsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven, yet rewarding.","review":"That is how I feel about this album. I was a young when it came out, and a big King Crimson/Robert Fripp fan. I was really upset when I first heard it, I saved all my lunch money for a week and half to get it! The first three songs aren't that great, though they have sort of grown on me. These 3 made up side one(remember vinyl?). Side two though is wonderful. Many of the songs are very meditative, such as Tribe, Bewitched, and so on.Maquillage has some beautiful acoustic guitar, Andy Summers really digs in, while Robert Fripp does his amazing patterns throughout the song.I suppose it may be hard to look( Listen) past the drum machines( we are talking 1984 here), but it will be a rewarding effort. Just skip the first 3 songs. You may wish to skip number 4, Train, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric dance and trance tracks.....","review":"The second collaborative album effort of Robert Fripp and Andy Summers, \\"Bewitched\\" is perhaps the more lively of the two, centering around the extended popish track \\"What Kind of Man Reads Playboy?\\" The use of the brand new (for '83/'84) Roland GR-700 guitar synth is very obvious; and the older GR-300 system (which was featured prominently on \\"I Advance Masked\\") still gets a good workout, and shines through as perhaps THE definitive voice as far as guitar synths were, and are concerned. I personally favour the two-part, 'woven' guitar work of Fripp and Belew (King Crimson), and that of Fripp and Summers on \\"I Advance Masked\\", but overall, \\"Bewitched\\" is an essential addition to the collection of any serious Fripp fan, and not to be over looked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost POLICE track","review":"The title track BEWITCHED is in reality an unissued recording from THE POLICE. It was recorded probably during the ZENYATTA MONDATTA sessions, and appeared as background music in the documentary video THE POLICE AROUND THE WORLD (1980). Guessing that this was pretty much Andy Summers on all noises, but the fact remains that this was recorded for possible release by THE POLICE, and ultimately resigned to incidental status. The rest of the album has more of a \\"band\\" sound than the previous FRIPP/SUMMERS union -- less experimental and more melodic. Great stuff from two great players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liars","review":"Please note that this DVD says \\"Language: English\\". I did. I ordered it. I started watching it.

Seriously?I gave up trying to roll it back onto the spool and opened up the other (I had purchased 2 of them), carefully took it out of the box, juggled it around and finally got it into the fax machine with little crinkling, and manually tightened it up.

The content is so good that if it were republished with the normal good quality Hal Leonard book construction I would buy it.One of the great things about the book's content is that the author really communicates the importance of rhythm, something that few books do.

A real page turner. Paints a good picture in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"This should be read by early teens and adults alike.","review":"Good story line with strong characters. I cried several times during this book. I loved the main character and her family so much. It was written so well, I thought it was a narrative on the authors own life. It wasn't. It was just a story. Read it, you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"For some reason I couldn't get \\"into\\" this book on my first two attempts to read it but I am so glad I perservered. It will move you to tears. Well written, good plot with a great twist at the end. While classed as a young adult read I believe it is a good read for all ages. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely for Preteens","review":"The plot in this book is good but the writing was not great. I think the book would appeal to a 10-12 year old or so (which is perhaps the intended audience). The foreshadowing was over the top and made it difficult to focus on what was currently happening in the story. Issues the main character had were easily resolved in not very realistic ways but this probably would not bother a typical preteen. The outcome was predictable and though the book was short, I found myself skimming just to finish it. So not great for avid reading adults but fine for adolescents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children of the Fog","review":"This book gave me shivers, it was so well written, like all of Cheryl's book once you start reading you can't put it down, she keeps you wanting to read more.

She starts off with a young girl's story and builds to a woman's shocking secret. The characters were real, the story kept on track. I felt Sarah's sorrow and the need to give her mother the peace she asked for in the end. The setting is fabulous. I felt I was there. The cover artist David Miller should be complimented as well. This is the best book I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't read it","review":"Sorry, there were too many inaccuracies. The girl is swimming. On the Pacific side of Vancouver Island? OK, maybe in a shallow, calm bay that could be possible. So I read on. Then she climbed aboard a raft that sizzled in the summer heat. Sorry, no way. Picky little details, but they kept jarring me from the story. If the author hasn't been there, then maybe some fact-checking would be the thing to do. Then there was a description of the girl and her mother \\"laughing like children\\". Well, one of them was a child so what else would she laugh like? I'm really sorry I couldn't get past these things. I really wanted to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous!","review":"I don't understand all the good reviews. This was a poorly written book with very little depth or detail. The story is utterly predictable, one dimensional, and sappy. It's as if it is merely an outline for a story that still needs to be fleshed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"For younger readers.","review":"I was not aware the book was for younger readers, but I would recommend it for that age group. It is beautifully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional!","review":"I underestimated this author. I was hoping this book would take me to my happy place with lots of scenes of whales. I would have been satisfied with minimal plot and predictability as long as I got plenty of whale action in there, haha. Oh boy! It was an emotional roller-coaster, starting off blissfully happy but with ominous foreshadowing. Then there is the first conflict, and you think this is the dark part of the story, and it seems manageable, but then it just gets so much worse, evoking anger and sadness! It is beautifully written and well edited. And yes, I did get my whale action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whale Song","review":"I thought that this was a delightful book. It has a youthful writing style and is told in the first person; and it isn't hard to guess that the author is retelling a personal story, but she does so beautifully. The language is simple and yet it draws you into it like a soft pile of cushions on a sleepy rainy day. The story itself is sad and tragic and yet there's a subtle hint of magic too. There is no complex plotline, just simple linear story telling at its best. The Native Canadian philosophies and teachings really added to this story, making it an endearing read for any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and touching","review":"Simply sublime. I agree with other reviewers that Whale Song is a touching and heartfelt story. The best possible kudos I can give this book are these: I will share this story with my own daughters when they come of age and will enjoy revisiting the story in years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first read from Cheryl Kaye Tardif","review":"I picked this book up on a whim, and could not put it down.Ms. Kaye-Tardif has a wonderfully unique writing style that I enjoyed very much, and I am looking forward to reading more novels by her.Whale Song is the story of Sarah Richardson, who at age 11, moves to Canada from Wyoming in the summer of 1977. She is befriended by a Native American girl and her Grandmother, and they take Sarah into their family and treat her as their own.Sarah's father, Jack, worked for a company studying marine biology and Sarah often went out on the Ocean with him listening to the sounds of Killer Whales, and seeing whales close up.I love this book so much, but know that I can't say much else about it without giving away main events in the novel. If you're looking for an easy, thought provoking read, I suggest you pick up Whale Song."},{"rating":"2","title":"After recently losing my mother myself this book brought great sadness, yet peace.","review":"Absolutely beautiful ending.

It was a turn pager and always something new going in the next chapter. Did not think about the ending until it really happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"This is one of those books that is very easy to get into and hard to put down. Each chapter leaves you wanting more and so you say just one more page...and that leads to a book that is read very quickly. Those are the kind of books I like. The kind where I get sucked into the pages, become part of the story and connect with the characters. I enjoyed hearing the stories from Nana (I LOVED this character), I smiled as I watched the relationship build between her and her crush. I related to her friendship to Goldie and the bond they shared. There were many aspects to this book that make it so good.I found that it was a little predictable but for some reason that doesn't matter. I really liked it. I give it a 4 star and encourage others young and old to give it a try. I'm guessing you will like it as much as I did. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Book","review":"Vancouver Island captured my heart when I visited some years ago. My main purpose was to see the Orcas. Whale Song brought back a lot of wonderful memories about the area and the whales. The book is a combination of folklore, loss, friendship and finding one's way. If there's any downside, it was an unjustified jail sentence that left me feeling almost angry that a daughter couldn't or wouldn't face her fears so an innocent man could be set free. Otherwise, it was a great read with wonderful characters. I also wished there was a little more depth to the ending. After such an easy paced beginning and middle, the ending felt rushed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Great books are hard to find - but this is one of them!

This book meets the criteria. I think this book really should be classified as a YA, but enjoyable for an adult.What happens when you are a teenager, you are moved to another country to live, and have to deal with bullies, and liking boys? And a mom who gets sicker and sicker. I don't want to say much more about this and spoil it.

I do not know what slowed me down more, the disjointed writing or the plot that seamed to just be thrown together. I only made it about half way into the book. I got to think after awhile that the author was leaving out about every third sentence, it just made that little sense.

This book is from one who knows the truth and has lived in the Middle East and, as a child, was forced to swallow lies and was subjected to horrible abuse in the name of the 'Unprophet,' (her words and book title). She knows first hand. Her English is somewhay 'splattered' but the true meaning of her words ring out loudly and will bite at your heart!

She is saying so many wierd lies, even the vierdest middleages' books about islam did not mention. It is a book of lies and imaginations .This book was written only for stainning Muhammad and his followers. and her only motive is her hate for IslamShe said Islam is cult. but none of the cult can reach 1.5 billion followers.

Nice travel pouch too!My only gripe: The cord is a little short if I want to keep my Zune in my pants pocket. I am 6'2\\" and the asymmetrical cord pulls out of my left ear when I walk.

They are 'in ear buds' which can be some what odd to get used to. They do come with 3 different size rubber covers so you can find one that is comfortable for you. I don't like to run with these because they move around too much, but they are fantastic for blocking ambient noises and produce rich sounds with good bass. I would recommend them for anyone who is not happy with the sound quality of regular earphones but doesn't want to upgrade to more expensive and bulky 'on ear' headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Comfortable","review":"I bought this item to wear on an eight hour flight to Honolulu. I couldn't have been more pleased. I started off with the mid-sized plugs and later moved to the small. I barely noticed I had them on. They were great in blocking out the cabin and airplane noise.

Now I'm no genius but if a mystery book is named \\"The Rasputin Relic\\" it isn't really a mystery what is in the bank vault. I'm not sure why the author dragged it out so long before the characters found out. It just made for boring reading. On top of this the characters seemed formulaic. A woman with a past, a cynical cop, a government agent with no heart, etc. Finally the ending completed eradicated any goodwill I had towards the book. I won't ruin the ending but I will say it is completely unbelievable.As a side note Hampton Roads publishers has a note in the back of the book that they are a publisher of books on \\"metaphysics and visionary fiction\\". It hardly seemed visionary to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"The blurb sounded promising, but only got halfway through it as the author clearly cannot write female characters. I cringed when rhostok brushed Nicole's breast whereby it hardened. That was unrealistic, as was her attempt at fighting him when he was consoling her. If she was sexually abused and such, that would never have happened so easily. These details are frustrating and I couldn't continue reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs better research","review":"The book Rasputin Relic suffers from an unrealistic plot and is in many ways poorly researched, showing little understanding of things Orthodox. I feel the writer should have investigated Orthodox Christian beliefs and Saints more carefully. Church Slavonic script is easy enough to read for anyone who can read modern Russian. The idea that someone who could read Russian couldn't read the name Rasputin written in Church Slavonic is unbelievable. Having Russian characters talk about Saints familiar to the western Churches rather than eastern Churches seemed strange, and the use of Church titles and ranks was all wrong - for example saying a Patriarch is the same as a Cardinal, when the reality is that a Patriarch is of equal rank to the pope. The writing itself was interesting but one had to suspend belief too much to enjoy it. A bit more research and a more carefully constructed plot would have made this book much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not for me","review":"I ordered this book through the recommendation of a friend.

Being able to view my own life as well as others with understanding and compassion for the life lessons we are working is invaluable.

For Pyros, is easily one of the most (if not THE most) innovative guitar players of the last 12 years. He has also lent his vast guitar capabilities to the music of Peter Murphy (Bauhaus), Scott Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots) and numerous film soundtracks. All of his talent is displayed on his first solo album GRATITUDE. \\"Hypocrisies, \\"Poisoned,\\" \\"Dminished,\\" and \\"New Day Clear\\" are easily four of the best rock songs that I have heard this year.

It's hard for a lot of musicians to have a successful solo career after hitting it big with a band. People think it's just not the same. Well the fact is it's not the same. Peter DiStefano's solo work is better the P4P ever was. Because not only does he display his amazing skills on the guitar, but his lyrics and singing style are a breath of fresh air in these days of trite, manufatured \\"music\\". The songs on this CD's are a result of Peter's life changing experiences, including beating drug addiction and cancer. I highly recommend Peter DiStefano's CD Gratitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the insight!","review":"I never met anyone who who was an astral-traveller, now I have.

Wow, being a postal carrier, could you imagine how many lives you could touch... what a fastinating journey to walk the earth AND other dimensions.

And I don't mean that I believe in ET! I gave this movie one star only because there was no less-than-one-star choice. I can't decide whether this is actually intended as tongue-in-cheek, but it is chock full of bad science, sprinkled liberally with comedy. The title, however, is very accurate - \\"Without Warning\\" - I sure didn't see it coming! By the way, if you would like to purchase a copy of this thriller, I happen to have one that was watched less than once (it was just too overwhelming and I couldn't sit through it all!).

Where the first movie took its subject, nuclear disarmament and terrorism, seriously, this cheese-fest doesn't respect the viewers' intelligence at all.

The most egregious of its inadequacies is the director's inability to tell such a simple story. Any scene of impending interest is killed; leaving the feeling that the director is trying to create a movie out of loosely related short vignettes, thus deliberately downplaying anything that could be mistaken for a plot. The only reason I finished this movie was because I could not believe how bad it was. I have turned off many a \\"better\\" movie.

Still, this book does a fairly good job.

The second half of the book takes place in Sierra Leonne where Phil is assigned as a UN Peacekeeper. Phil does a good job at getting the reader \\"oriented\\" about the civil war in Sierra Leonne and the unthinkable brutality of the combatants.The book all comes together as this Marine has to use all his skills and bravery to escape a nightmarish turn of events in Sierra Leonne.

This is just one more look into the incompetence of the United Nations, and the Brit military in general. When he departed and headed for safety he left behind several fellow UN soldiers to get on with it. He then made his way to safety and was choppered out after 6 days. For this he was decorated.

I tried having my son read The Hardy Boys since he seemed to like the mysteries (and our library ran out of The Boxcar Children books). He didn't care for them because the characters seemed too old, to hard for him to relate to. In The Boxcar Children the kids seem a bit younger, at least in how they interact with their world, making it easier for him to relate to the characters. It may be considered in the \\"reading level\\" of 8 to 12 year-olds but the content is aimed toward those a bit younger.

Pretty simple to set up and operates flawlessly.However, as soon as I upgraded to the new firmware from the DLink site, the product dropped connections so often that it is unusable. This happens with no encyption turned on, or using the 64 or 128 bit modes.This is a common problem with the new firmware, and DLink refuses to acknowledge the problem, or to post a \\"downgrade\\" to restore the original firmware. The problem has been visible on the Internet for a year.

I've got the AP set up in a loft space above the family room where the laptop is typically used: connectivity is excellent. My desktop box is a couple of rooms away, and connectivity is very good. Running Win98 on all PCs. No complaints at all so far. The AP is connected to a D-Link cable/dsl router/switch, which is connected to my cable modem.

I was angry that he used the words that \\"I\\" had fried it and I clarified with him. He said multiple times \\"Yes, the firmware fried the access point\\". To be completely sure I said \\"You are saying that your software fries your products, is that correct\\" to which he replied \\"Yes\\".On the upside, he said they will send me another access point.

The config software isn't very user-friendly but I'm sure there is a way around it. At the price for the D-Link DWL-1000AP it's not bad though. Signal strength is good through a few rooms and downstairs.

They said they never heard of this problem, yet I have read of many instances of this on the Net. They don't keep any older versions or original versions of their Firmwares on hand or on their website (how ridiculous is that!)

Before anyone in the Middle-East is being judged, it is time for the West to re-consider itself and its own history. To my knowledge no terrorist group from the erea in question has ever tranvelled abroad, took an army of 2 1/2 times the population of an entire region, and starved the civilians in concentration camps.Nevertheless, this is a book that libraries should buy, as it is a good reference.British terrorism against Boer civilians"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Byman forgot.....","review":"OOOPS!I know i will get a lot of flack from this, but if any of you will be honest in your research you will acknowledge that Mr Byman omitted Mossad and the CIA as terrorist organizations.No 2 countries at the present time pose as much danger to the world as the United States and Israel.

Crossing one's own time stream, which was once frowned upon, is used as a plot device, a shark is hitched to a buggy, and a woman singing, though the song is beautiful, is the best the Doctor can come up with to create resonating pitches to bring down a crashing spaceship.

Ms. Browder went into long tirades about faith and conversion (not sure I agree) and other things except how to help women who have lived with or currently live with men on the down low. She never explained how she helped her children get through it and it seems like she, at times, defended her ex-husband's behavior.

It's a good song that still sounds pretty good today.Years later, reminiscing about that cool 80's song, I elected to get the cd but, unfortunately, I was very disappointed. It's not that the other songs are neccessarily bad, it's just I find that \\"Welcome to Boomtown\\" has nothing in common with the other oversycopated, tinny sounding, overproduced sterotypical 80's fluff.This is one of those albums where the single completely outshines the rest of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest examples of intelligent art","review":"This is definitely music for those that enjoy intelligence and meaning in their aural pleasure!Cynical, insightful, thoughtful and very much a gut reaction to the execrable excesses of wealth generation and flaunting of the Reagan 80s.

The chapters: Chronology -- The Yüan Dynasty -- The Yüan Army -- The Civil Wars 1351-1368 -- The Ming Dynasty -- The Ming Army -- Strategy and tactics -- Six significant battles. The text focuses on telling Chinas military history; it is very weak on topics like weapons or battle tactics. The drawings by David Sque are good. The maps are primitive and not very useful. American units of measurement are used throughout the book, which is a nuisance for international readers. This book is the sequel to \\"Imperial Chinese Armies 590 - 1260\\" (MAA 295).

Beyonce should just keep her self-important mouth shut and just be a model.Too bad Lumidee doesn't even have THAT option to fall back on!Sorry, girl... you're gonna be working at Burger King in about two years. If you manage to have a career in two years, it's because people have dumbed themselves down so much that they can't can discern quality from a lack of it OR you miraculously found yourself some singing lessons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lumidee?

I though this girl was goign to be the next best thing. Thats until I heard this album. The album is garbage no doubt. She can't sing nor rap which she tries to do on track number 15. I mean she's beautiful and all, but looks don't mean nothing when you have no talent. Sorry Lumidee, your 15 minutes of fame is up. Next time, try to put out a more decent album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off KEY?!","review":"Lumidee says she sounds \\"off key\\" in \\"Uh Oooh\\" because the vocals were originally recorded for another track. Does she know the difference between off-key and off-BEAT? I didn't think there could be another singer more tone-deaf than J. Lo, but I guess I was wrong.

While the beats and music are great (for that we can probably credit the producers) the vocals are terrible.

It reminds me of the 'Summer time' by Fresh Prince...a feel good vibration from the song makes you wanna be outdoors and having fun.

Well, honey, this is an industry where it's all about who you know, not what you know. I guess mediocre wannabe teeny-bopper singers with no talent are good enough for you. Only 19? Hello? Brandy was 15 when her first CD came out, Monica only 14, Faith only 20, Mary J. Blige only 20 but guess what? They're still around and going strong because THEY can sing.There are only about 2 songs on the album worth listening to, \\"Never Leave\\" and \\"Honeestly\\", which sound like the same song anyway. What do I think? I think her rapping is ok but she can't sing to save her life. She would have been booed off \\"American Idol\\" had it not been for the whole \\"Latin Explosion\\", which glamourized half-a**ed, no-talent singers simply because they are Latino. God, even J-Lo can do better than this.Bottom line:If her first album is this weak I doubt we will be seeing much of her in 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Stand Almost Famous","review":"I recently heard Lumidee's album Almost Famous and after the first 5 tracks I had to cut it off, only because it sounded so horrible. This girl has no musical talent whatsoever. It even got on my Mom's nerves to play it around the house, and she usually likes most R&B/Rap that I listen to. I don't reccomend that anyone buy this cd, unless you're as tone deaf as she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE CAN'T EVEN SING!","review":"Her looks have nothing to do with the sh*tty quality of her \\"album.\\" This girl is obviously a joke, and she knows it.

You're officially fired from the music business Lumidee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS","review":"I'm going to go straight to the point with this review: this girl CANNOT sing. NOT AT ALL. The song \\"Never Leave You\\" (the only one I've heard) is the most PAINFUL ordeal I have ever have to go through. How this girl even got a record deal is unfathomable. I can't even find the words to describe how TERRIBLE her voice is. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD AT ALL COSTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"what were they thinking??","review":"I havent heard the entire CD but from listening to the first tracked released I can truly say that this woman only has a pretty face with no talent.

She is one of the most unique female artists out there right now, singing and laying down rap lyrics on her songs. She even does both on the same song a couple times by layin down some strong lyrics then singing her own hook. I don't find myself skipping any songs on the album, and besides (of course) Never Leave You, some of my favorite cuts are Crashin A Party (feat. Nore), Honestly, My Last Thug and Air To Breathe. All the beats are hot, I find myself noddin my head to almost all of them. It's an excellent first effort and I look for more to come from Lumidee. Definitely not a 1-hit wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut from a true talent","review":"Yep..This is the \\"Uh Oooh\\" girl. Don't just pass her off as a one hit wonder though..there are lots of great songs on this album. Lumidee has a unique, melodic voice that is really highlighted on this album. She sounds great over ballads and up-tempo songs. Favorites include Honestly, For keeps, and Me & You. Overall, a solid first effort from a promising star. Worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"So close, yet so far away.","review":"Doesn't the music industry have enough enertainers who sing songs with banging beats...but can't carry a tune to save their careers?

It's her voice. It's horrid! Is it just me or does \\"Honestly\\" sound like \\"Never Leave You (Uh Oooh)? Maybe it's a remix with a new name. The rest of the cd sounds too similar for me. I gave this CD one star because it's bad and I don't think she can improve her voice that much more for me to like her. I didn't buy this album, I simply listened to it on the internet. Good thing. I would have wasted 9 bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awwwwww I feel bad for her","review":"I have to admit that I was shocked when I heard the rest of the cd. It uncovered how bad of a singer she is. Well she won't last here but she'll make money overseas so I guess I shouldn't feel too bad for her. I blame this industry for putting out pretty faces with no talent. They fooled a lot of people into buying this because of 'Uh Oh' but now the people know the lack of talent here.

(And just who is using military imagery -- a pop-gun tank -- in a post-Butter-Battle world?)I give it two stars just because my kids enjoy reading about dinosaurs, though I steer them back to the real Seuss (which they do genuinely enjoy more -- albeit maybe because I enjoy them more) whenever possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"My daughter loves it and I love to read it to her.

It was rated at a reading level of 4.6 to 5 (American grade school level). I would not recommend this book to any kid, because of the graphic representations of suicide and the ethics of telling bald faced lies that seem to be treated lightly, humorously by the author.The character portrayed has serious psychological issues, to include excessive lying and disturbing thoughts of suicide. While the story may come across as \\"cute\\" to older, more mature readers, I felt the serious issues the main characters struggled with were anything but cute.Because the setting (and the author, for that matter) was in England, many of the terms would be diffucult for an American kid to understand; I was constantly explaining the British terms used, such as a pint (of beer), viaduct (vs. overpass), Mum (OK, that was easy), lift (elevator)etc. And my daughter thought the book was boring.

My Baby'z Mama, was the dumbest song I ever heard. Old School (...) wa stupid like a mug. I like the beat and tune, though. I show respect for Eazy, because he died. But if he was still alive, I would have told him all his albums are stupid, and corny, and his dis to Death Row, was weak as paper, while a year before, Dre totally humuliated him in Dre Day (good song, by the way.)

Others have said it's too short, but I disagree. For a tub book, it's the perfect amount of pages. You don't want your child to just sit there in the tub reading all night anyway, right?

The build is of the same thoughtfully engineered quality that you would expect from OXO and fits comfortably in my hand. Let me also say that I never realized how much I needed those non-slip rubber handles until I had them. Easy to clean and dishwasher safe too? Wow! Look no further!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great garlic press, fairly easy to clean.","review":"This press does its job well, and is very solid feeling, seems like it will last a long time. The press is fairly easy to clean - as the plastic teeth allow you to 'push' the pulp out of the press easily - the only thing i don't like that that if you don't put it upside down to dry, the handle retains water, that you have to shake out and let dry in several positions. This isn't a big deal, just kind of frustrating when you grab it and get your hands wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better brands","review":"It's big and clunky and it doesn't mash garlic very well.

There are presses that give you a smaller mince, but I prefer the feel of this one in my hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks...","review":"I'm typically a big fan of Oxo products, but with this garlic press they have missed the boat. I used a zyliss susi press for years until it just plain wore out. I bought the oxo because I liked the substantial weight. Unfortunately, the design does not match. It is no where near as good as the zyliss for pressing unpeeled garlic...no real problem I thought, it's not too onerous to peel the garlic before pressing. It's also not very good at pressing peeled garlic either. The plunger does not fit tightly so garlic squeezes out the sides as well as through the screen. It is not very efficient to clean, water collects in the hollow handles. The plating began to wear off within a few weeks. Overall, I'm disappointed...a first for me with an oxo product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, chrome finish starts peeling off into your food","review":"This garlic press was great, at first.

It matches all the other appliances i have, but beyond aesthetics its preforms great. I put a clove in and crush it a little then take it out to peel the skin after that throw it back in and press again and the garlic comes right out of the press. Easy to clean too, just turn your faucet on high and it will clear out the crushed remains. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handles Come Off & Fill With Filthy Water","review":"The handles on this thing are hollow. They are not attached to the press. They are held on by friction.

There's not enough direct throughput out of the holes of the garlic press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well constructed and pleasant to use","review":"This is a fantastic garlic press. It's construction is sturdy, it's definitely built to last. But it is still easy to use without a lot of brute force. I especially like the soft, non-slip grips. I have quite a few OXO products and many seem to have grips made out of this material and it's great. It makes the press very easy to hold onto, even with slippery hands, and provides a bit of cushioning that lets me use it without hurting my hand. I do agree with the previous reviewers who mentioned that you should wash this ASAP. From experience, I agree. It's very easy to clean up right after you've used it, especially if your faucet has a spray function with some pressure. However if you leave it the garlic does tend to dry out on this press and can get stuck in the small press holes. It's not impossible to clean (I've found some soaking will usually take care of the problem after a few hours) but rinsing right away eliminates the hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good!","review":"this is my first garlic press and it seems to work just right. i like the feature that pushes the garlic back the other direction to make cleaning easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"I think what needs to be said about this product have been said.

I bought it based on the reviews here and I am so glad that I did. I had previously purchased a Kuhn Rikon and it was near impossible for me to smash a clove of garlic; I had to ask my boyfriend to help. I also had a no name one that wasn't bad, but I thought maybe I was missing something when people raved about having a garlic press. I have a hard time mincing garlic with a knife, so I thought I would give this one a try even though the Zyliss had higher ratings on America's Test Kitchen. It really is very sturdy and since it has such a wide opening you can smash 2-3 cloves at a time. You barely have to exert much pressure and it cleans up pretty easily. I will probably have this one the rest of my life because it is so well made. I am very thrilled with this purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"soapy water with your garlic","review":"I thought this garlic press was awesome for about two weeks. One day as I was pressing garlic into a bowl of ingredients, soapy water began leaking out. The hollow handles, although comfortable, allow for water to collect.

While the press still works, it is no longer comfortable to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"curse it every time I use it","review":"The plastic and metal handles slip off almost every time I use it, and water gets caught in the space under these coverings on cleaning, resulting in dish water dripping out on next use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great....at first.","review":"I have owned this garlic press for about one year and the outside coating is flaking off so much that I cannot use it anymore.

It is solidly built and fairly easy to clean.Unfortunately, there is a very annoying product design flaw. Oddly enough, the handles fill with water when I wash the garlic press. The water leaks out into my food when I use the press. It also leaks into my utensil drawer. Yuck. To avoid the issue, I have to remove the handles entirely when I wash the press, and let them dry separately. I will probably fix this problem myself by sealing the handles with epoxy.***Update 11/19/12: I glued the handles some time ago and have had no further problems"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Duty, BUT NOT Enough!

However, and this is important, the quality of manufacture is lacking. The first thing that happened to my press is the handle covers came unglued. First one, then the other. You need those covers to mince the garlic; under them are two metal rods - not hand friendly. Had it maybe a couple of years, more likely one and a half, and then the handle snapped off. Not impressed. Going back to the Zyliss. It may be ugly after a few years, but it lasts and lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this!!!","review":"Most amazing garlic press ever. Crushes garlic?

Not wanting to be buying a new garlic press every couple years, I set out to find one that was made like a tank. I settled on this one because of the excellent reviews and because I like stainless steel kitchen tools. (Stainless steel also has the wonderful affect of neutralizing garlic oil which produces the odor that can be quite strong on ones hands after touching it. You can rub the exterior of this press on your fingers under cold water and elliminate any residual odor!) I've used it a half dozen times in the past few weeks and have to say it is a finely made tool. I love things that are made solidly and to last, as well as things that do their intended purpose flawlessly. This press is exactly that tool, and like my Cutco knives, it gives me a little bit of happiness every time I use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This press is easy to squeeze but the garlic will mash itself all over the place, not worth the time or money--the first OXO product i haven't thought was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely garlic press","review":"Before this garlic press joined my family, we had to dice all our garlic with a knife.

I definitely recommend this, even if you already own a garlic press."},{"rating":"1","title":"drip drip drip","review":"Most Oxo kitchen gadgets are great. But this one is maddening. As others have reported here, the handle retains water that can drip out into your guacamole or other favorite dish.

Either way, I bought it and when it is folded it is beautiful. But who wants a baby to spit up on a pretty blanket (Isn't that why we buy burp cloths?) And if you use the diaper part, what is the use of having the blanket on it. I personally thought that this would be an even tinier version of the mini and a perfect size for a newborn.

What a gift this book was for me, to find something so simple to read, easy to comprehend, and immediately applicable to more than just public speaking!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A FANTASTIC WAY FOR ANY PATS FAN TO SPEND AN AFTERNOON","review":"This is simply essential viewing for any Pats fan. I am a lifelong Pats fan from the UK and DVDs are a great way for me to relive the season from foreign shores. This amazing collection has it all, the games, the behind the scenes stuff, the interviews and all the play analysis too.There is so much stuff on here besides the Super Bowl itself, it would be a truly miserable pats fan who couldn't be satisfied with the range of content in this double DVD box. you really feel like you can relive the moment of glory from Super Bowl XXXIX from start to finish, the playoffs, the build up, training days, locker room footage, the victory parade in Boston, the ring ceremony, just everything is included in this massive set.A perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon in the off-season. I guarantee you will feel the way i did if you're a Patriot fan.....smiling from ear to ear and full of pride at the happy memories. An excellent buy for any Patriot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snip!

This is the best and most well balanced video I've seen on the life and accomplishments of America's premier underrated scientist/inventor. Watch this tape and then look around your house. You'll be amazed in the ways in which Tesla impacts our everyday lives. It'a about time that he receives the overdue recognition he so richly deserves. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of great information but....","review":"This film is a wonderful tribute to a man who has never received the credit he deserved for inventions that we still use and take for granted today. He was not primarily interested in money or the business side of his inventions and therefore, others whose names you will readily recognize, received credit and a place in history which should have been shared.My biggest problem with the movie was the irritating heavily-accented voice-overs of Mr. Tesla's diary entries, and quotes by Stacy Keach. I found it very distracting to have to try to interpret the accent, and would have found it much more entertaining if Mr. Keach would have simply used his normal speaking voice.Otherwise this film is worth watching and you will be amazed at the genius of Nikola Tesla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defines GENIUS","review":"First I want to say that the VHS is available thru PBS directly for $2.99 plus shipping and handling of less than $5.00.

I've seen \\"TESLA: The Hidden Secrets,\\" and the History Channel's MODERN MARVELS \\"Mad Electricity\\" episode, which I thoroughly enjoyed. If this is even better, it should be outstanding.Tesla is truly the definition of GENIUS, and I can't believe that he's so relatively unknown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one on Tesla, but only this on VHS...","review":"This can be obtained from PBS still,to the best of my knowledge.

It spreads one problem over several pages so you have to go back and search for the original information for the problem that is scattered over several pages. This book refuses to just give the equations in a straightforward manner... you have to figure that out on your own as well. I had to buy three other textbooks, Standard Deviants DVDs and Cliffs Notes just to understand the material because the book was NO help at all. The book will only show you one type of example, but then the HW problems ask you to solve what the book did not show or explain. Example: The example in the book illustrates how to perform annual compounding but does not explain or demonstrate other types of compounding such as monthly, then the HW problem will ask you to solve a monthly compounding problem, when the textbook itself never explains how to do this. Horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor textbook","review":"This is one of the worst textbooks that I have ever encountered. No doubt, the authors are very skilled in Financial Management, however they had very little skill in communicating these concepts to the uninitiated.I used this book for a Finance class in my M.B.A. program.

I would then give up and reference a different text and understand the concept in short-order. My classmates had similar problems with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another finance book","review":"This book is a nightmare; thoroughly confusing. Authors do not know how to teach!

I am constantly moving my head left to right so that the heat can touch every side of my hair all while running my fingers through so the heat can get to the inside of the hair. It's just too much work done on my part!...and that's not the worst partThe dryer is CONSTANTLY COLLAPSING on my head!! Not once, not twice, but all the time I'm under the dryer.

Out of the box, with no additional drivers, the keyboard, trackpoint, and trackpad were all supported by my Ubuntu Feisty box.However, the key feel quality was poor, and patchy across the keyboard, with an inconsistent feel between keys, and a generally flimsy feel. For the money, I would expect a more solid feel, much more like a real laptop.In comparison, the keyboard on my Dell M65 is rock solid and *extremely* high quality in feel. In turn this is beaten out by the Mac Book Pro keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little keyboard.","review":"I am a fan of keyboards with a short keystroke, and this one fits the bill.

Who knows if John would have gone in this direction with Alice had he had not died in 1967.This is avant gaurd jazz, but nothing like that of John Coltrane, who Alice played paino with in his last band, replacing McCoy Tyner. This music is big shells, filled with harps, saxes, a violin, all kinds of instruments to add to the free floating texutre. This material sounds as derived from early 1970s space rock as much as jazz.Rashid Ali's drumming did not provide enough of a backbone for John Coltrane's peicing sounds, but with Alice, it is a perfect wonder.

It is a hard pill to swallow (figuratively) that the only treatment is a lifelong regime of dessicated thyroid. Historic evidence of other societies other than Anglo-European shows a definitive lack of interest in science that may disagree with his hypothesis. This book calls to light the problems associated with hypothyroidism but does little to show how we actually arrived at this state (for example, why do we not see hypothyroidism in hunter-gatherer populations?).

Over and over, the book shows Xrays from 1924, 1918, 1957, photos of many patients from 1915, 1940's-1950's .... really, do we not have any more recent medical evidence/studies ???In my non-medical education opinion, this is a strange book and I dont recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I bought this for a friend.

This book will show and tell you what you can look for yourself and then you can present it to your Dr. Do not let a blood test determine your life.

Please, do not waste you money on this one. Go buy Mike Myers Server+ guide or the Exam Cram one. Both do a much better job then Trevor Kay's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Certified","review":"This book definitely helped me pass the Server+ exam. This book was really well organized and provided great explanations and tips on what to know for the exam. The only other study material I used was free practice tests I found on the web, but I found the questions in this book were better. It is a tricky examso make sure you study hard and understand each section in the book. Once you have mastered the sample questions in this bookyou will do fine on the exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book you will need!","review":"I took the exam August 6th and passed with no problems. The best part about this book is it stresses that it is important to know the right answer, but it's more important to know why the answer is right.

Was well worth the money and I highly recommend this study guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Server+ guide","review":"The Server+ bible does indeed seem to live up to all the other reviews written about it. It covers all the material clearly and has a large number of practice questions to make sure you understand it all.

Due to that, this book might have \\"seemed\\" to do a better job than it really would if I had little or no computer background."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is okay","review":"I read this book from cover to cover and found more then a fair share of errors.

It was inexpensive on the Amazon used market which compelled me to get it. Since I was an A+, N+, and Security + before starting this older edition I knew that the newer technologies were not given adequate coverage. I used this book with frequent web/wikipedia searches to successfully address the subject material. Only a few errors found. I recommend this book for experienced IT people. Less experienced folks should probably pay the extra money and get the current edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many ERRORS","review":"At one time there were some reviews here that detailed some of the many errors in this book. The errors were both technical (some were typos, but some where just incorrect information) and errors in grammar. Most errors in grammar are easily ignored, but there are so many in this book that they became a distraction to studying the material. However, the technical errors are much more likely to cause problems if you are using this book to study for the Server+ exam. Especially, the errors in the question and answer parts of the book (and there are many)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Date Don't Purchase","review":"This book was written over 13 years ago and as other reviewers have noted, the typo'd SK0-001 (not SKO-001), is obsolete and the current exam, as of this writing, is SK0-003.

If you need a historical piece this book is for you but for the price it's hardly worth it. There are some more current Kindle books that cover parts of the of the current SK0-003 Server+ exam and price is not reflective of quality.

I've always been partial to the classic appeal of analogs, and this one has both the good looks of a real dial and hands plus the rugged/accurate dependability of a digital. It's really handsome with the unique green dial face, white knock-out numerals, and calfskin brown leather band. Honestly, there's no need for you to spend $100 plus on some high-end brand.

I like it because it is easy to read outside in all types of lighting and it's indestructable. I have well received my money's worth for this watch.

I did have to change my network settings a bit, but the manual shows how all of that is done. Coupled with his DI-713P I get good signal strength anywhere in his home, even a little bit outside. Once I can afford Cable Speeds I will definately have this set-up, or whatever might replace the DWL-650 or DI-713P int he future.

This happened repeatedly until the card wouldn't work anymore. I called d-link, and they told me a brand new driver was put online, and I installed that one, and the card still didn't work. I took the advanced steps of removing the old driver from the system. Nothing. I purchase a Microsoft card, and it works amazing! All these smaller companies can't make the drivers properly for Windows XP, but Microsoft can guarantee compatability in the future.

Don't use the CD when installing on XP, but run windows update while the card is in the slot... there is a XP certified driver there, although I haven't noticed any improvement in range.

Also, complains when I try to return to a hardwire connection (even though I reboot in between).Perhaps there's a reason why they've (D-link) not yet received the Microsoft XP seal of approval.I'm sure there are better cards to be found.Our home has 8 computers, a few of which we built from components; we're serious computer users, yet I just spent a half a day getting this new card to play nicely with XP, and I'm not sure I've succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Customer Support and Terrible Quality","review":"At first, it worked fine.

I'd bypass the phone tech support because of the same problems other reviewers have cited elsewhere, but this limited tech support is generally true for all of these low-cost items. Lastly, however, the range is very limited. I'd have the connection dropped off intermittently 2 floors up/down or 2 rooms away from the router. I'd probably buy it again, nevertheless, because other made-for-home products (e.g., Linsys) are more or less the same.

In fact, after I installed the driver for the card, DHCP stopped working properly on my 100-base-T card's IP stack. In fact, even after uninstalling the driver, DHCP is still broken. Not sure what's going on, but I suspect this card's uncertified drivers have something to do with it.If you're running XP, I recommend before buying an 802.11 card that you check the vendor's web-site to see if their tech-support says something like \\"Windows will warn you that this driver might make your system unstable.

First PC, a NT 4 WS box (with SP6 installed as required) would only blue screen at boot time with the card installed.Tried on a Win98 SE box but drivers would never load properly.Sat on hold for tech support for 1 hour and decided I did not need this kind of grief.Bought Linksys gear and it all plug & played as expected. NT box is happy, Win98 box is happy, Toshiba (4 years old) laptop with Win95 is happy.Sorry, D-Link sucked on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't count on customer service from D-Link","review":"I was shipped a DWL-650 which never worked from the moment I got it. I sent it back to D-Link for replacement under warranty and have STILL not yet received my replacement unit. They tell me that there is physical damage to the unit and that I have to pay an additional amount to get the unit repaired and sent back. E-mails to the customer service department go unanswered. I recommend people try another company which stands behind its products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected","review":"I don't know much about rating the performance for this pretty much \\"basic\\" Wireless PC Card, but knowing that it is from D-Link I have more faith in it lasting longer without problems. I have had nothing but good experiences with D-Link products and I I will keep buying them until I am let down.Everything was easy to set-up and it works well with my works little wireless network."},{"rating":"1","title":"not supported under UNIX/Linux !!!","review":"D-Link created a confusion out there in the market area, selling the wirelss adapters with diffrent chipset using the same name for them.The first models (version A and B) used to have Prism chipset from Intersil (which are supported by POSIX sistems) but now they changed thei chipset with other vendors like Realtek without changing the name of the product - that's how I bought this thinking it is spported - unfortunaltelly it is not !"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad range","review":"I recently bought two dlink cards; the pc card version and the pci version to create a point-point wireless LAN. I was very disappointed with the short range; much below the advertised 50-100m. I had a lot of trouble getting the PCI card to work in my PC. Eventually I had to use a different motherboard since win2000 would freeze right after bootup if the PCI card was installed. Even when I got everything up and running I found that the range inside the house was very bad. I was getting absolutely no connectivity at 100 feet (33m) through walls. The advertised range is upto 100m (330 feet) indoors.I ended up returning both cards. Wasted time and effort... do not recommend a purchase unless all you want is connectivity within a 70 foot area."},{"rating":"1","title":"It crashed 3 different computers on install","review":"It didn't work for me. I tried it in 3 different laptops - 1 XP and 2 ME machines. It crashed all 3 - I never got it to install. I couldn't find any patches on their website and D-Link customer service never responded to email technical support requests. I returned the card. Love the Amazon return process! That was the best part about buying this card!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor connection/signal quality","review":"I bought this card off a yahoo.com store. It does not always connect to the available wireless network. It is not even compatible with Windows XP - the installation says so, it is not digitally verified by XP. While it is able to detect the network, it just won't get connected. I use it on my campus' wireless network. While people around me can connect to the network using their wireless card, mine just refuse to do it. Although sometimes it does connect, this is not a very reliable card."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't support 128-bit encryption","review":"Although the card worked (with my SMC router/access point), it does not support 128-bit WEP as advertised by D-Link. I have to return the product as I need the 128-bit to be able to use the card at work as well as home.I like the card, just not the fact that D-Link says they support 128-bit encryption when they don't. I called D-Link support and they acknowledged the discrepancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their web suggests good linux support but...","review":"The chipset in this model changes from revision to revision. When I checked their web I got the impression it had good linux support. Before I purchased I also got the same impression - but that was for some other revision of the card.So - the two stars is for that. I have no reason to believe that the hardware is not just fine - but I feel like D-link misled me into thinking this card had good linux support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Shoddy","review":"I suppose the range etc. are fine - I haven't tested it directly against other cards but qualitatively performance seems fine.It has an annoying installation where you have to have the CD-ROM available at the same time as the card. If you are installing on a laptop without a CD-ROM, by sharing the drivers from a networked CD-ROM, this will make installation more annoying and mystical.It has a very stupid and irritating constantly brightly flashing \\"active\\" light during normal operation.It installs a utility which can only be run by administrative users, but tries to run itself under any user, so that normal users get a stream of error windows filling their screen. It's very stupid in this day and age to assume that everyone on a machine will have administrative privileges.All in all, a thoroughly disappointing purchase. I've had good luck with D-Link products before, so the general lousiness of this particular one surprises me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time","review":"When you buy a product that says it supports \\"XP\\", you'd at least think the manufacturer would have tried it once. I installed this product on Dell Latitude, running W2k. Crashed and rebooted endlessly. Tried it on a Gateway 2000 running XP Home (First time I'd seen the new Blue Screen of Death). Tried it on an IBM ThinkPad, XP Pro. Same thing. Downloaded the new drivers from the website. No change. Either be prepared to return it, or find some spare space in your junk drawer. I have no way of knowing if these things have any wireless capability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Wireless PC Card","review":"I bought a D-LINK DI-713P Wireless Router to use with the DWL-650 and I was very disappointed with the 650. Signal degradation was immediate (30%) after only 30 feet. This was with Encryption TURNED OFF! I tried using another brand wireless card and was able to go all over my house (over 2000 sq ft) without any dropped signals. DLink makes a great wireless router DI-713P. Too bad I can't say the same about the DWL-650."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy install.. but whats the point?","review":"I will agree that the install was great.. NO issues at all.. However, if I have to sit UNDER THE access point to get reception then what was the point of wireless?? I could have just as easily \\"clicked\\" in.. I was VERY unhappy with the product.. But the uninstall was easy too.. maybe they knew something.. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Russian roulette configuration","review":"After many, many hours of frustration trying to get this thing to run; found out from an online forum that it needs to reside on it's own IRQ. Won't share. This is nowhere in product documentation. Got it to work and it was great - until I upgraded computers. Can't free up an IRQ on the new machine, so have to buy a new wireless card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivers do not work well on WinXP","review":"I could not get the configuration utility to work with Windows XP. I had to use the built-in settings in WinXP to get it to work. Event then it would work only sometimes. It seems to work better on WIN98. I have wasted a LOT of hours trying to get this thing to work. It seems to have a stronger signal then earlier DWL-650 cards, but that is useless with faulty drivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"this card [stinks]","review":"I frequently pull the card out of my laptop and this card doesn't work now, I have to prop it up in order for the OS to recognize it.

The two machines were running Win2K Professional Workstation, app. 60 feet from each other on the same floor in different rooms. My main problems:1. Initial setup was difficult due to poorly-written documentation.2. The access point only registered on the console machine when I connected it via a crossover patch cable to a standard Ethernet NIC.3. The remote machine never transmitted to the access point.4. ALL my attempts to get tech support (email, phone) were frustrating and ultimately fruitless.The network never went up. The entire project was a waste of money and a good deal of time. I am a network administrator and consultant, and will cheerfully embrace any opportunity I can find to steer clients away from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Marketing, Bad product","review":"I bought this item from Amazon.com based on the editorial reviews but found out that it does not even have proper drivers to work with Windows XP even though D-Link says the card works with XP but if you go ot the manufacturer's site, it tells you thet the drivers are not certified to work with XP. Also, the configuration manager utilty does not work on XP or windows 2000 so it was very difficult to get this card working with other wireless routers. I totally regret buying this card."},{"rating":"1","title":"This might crash your mail Box -","review":"I used this D-link 650 wireless card and found very serious defect.If an incoming email address is like abc.pqr@xyz.com and if you will reply this email (Am using Eudora) then it will crash your mail box becasue of Dot (.) between abc.pqr.
