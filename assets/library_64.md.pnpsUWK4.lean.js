Unbelievable!!!!Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, clean","review":"This is a nice water bottle in the sense that it keeps very clean when traveling. The only issue I had was that the paint chipped fairly easily when it hit against things. Bummer, because I wanted a pretty color and now it's pretty banged up. Oh well. It certainly does beat the hard plastic water bottles that get grimy pretty quickly. I was living in the tropics for 2 years and my Nalgene was disgusting! This bottle changed that and I didn't have to take it all apart and scrub it down every few days."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks","review":"I don't like to use plastic bottles for my children so I gave it try on this product but... it leaks from the sport cap. and it sweats a lot when I put cold drink inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottle","review":"I love these water bottles! I do my best to avoid plastics and this is one of the only stainless steel bottle I found that are dishwasher safe. I have several for my kids in the 12oz size, and 2 for myself in the 18oz size. The only thing I dislike about it is that it makes a chirping sound when I drink from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottle....Excellent Quality","review":"Just got the Klean Kanteen Stainless 27oz bottle.I must say the bottle in nicely made. Pretty sturdy and will stand up to everday use.The opening is large enough if you want to put some ice cubes in and allow a brush inside to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as cool as it looks","review":"I thought this would be a great addition to my workout routine and general efforts to stay better hydrated. Not necessarily so. First, when you add cold water, the outside of the container is just as cold -- not great when the weather outside is already cold. The metal surface also doesn't help when the weather is cold -- brrr. Need some sort of cozy to hold onto it. When drinking while exercising, you have to hold the bottle just right or the handle will poke you in the face. Heaven forbid you get really thirsty while you are less than focused on what you are reaching for and how you are holding the bottle. Finally, the cap has to be on the bottle to come close to a watertight seal -- which it's not. Definitely not a one-handed hydration option for exercisers! Not bad, but certainly not what I anticipated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I bought one last year and loved it, so I bought another for a Christmas present. The recipient loves it too. We like that it saves money and plastic bottles, doesn't taste like plastic, and is a constant reminder to drink more water during the day. It does taste a little metallic when you first use it, but once you wash it a couple times, that goes away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment!","review":"I received my Kleen Kanteen and thus far I am _very_ happy with it. The water does not taste metallic, it does not leak (unless it's open of course) and I don't have to worry about plastic getting into my water. This bottle is _not_ made for hot drinks. It will also sweat if cold, but to be honest, ANYthing will sweat when cold.Someone mentioned that stainless steel isn't magnetic. I'm going to put this link here for information regarding that.http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae546.cfm"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice water bottle","review":"I really like this bottle, I added a small carabiner to the loop on the stainless lid and it attaches to my rucksack and makes it much more convenient to clip on and take along. A very nice clean bottle. Also you can boil unsafe water right in it, try that in a Nalgne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"I've had this bottle for about a year now. It keep beverages cold for a good while (although it's very sweaty). The only thing I don't like is that the paint chipped easily and quickly without heavy use. Also at times there's a slight metallic taste. For BPA, metal free portable beverage, you're better off getting a glass bottle like the LifeFactory bottles with silicone covers or a BPA free plastic bottle with filters like the Seychelle bottles. I have no idea why there are so many good reviews on this site for these bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"klean kanteen","review":"I ordered 2 Kanteens, 1 27 oz and the other one is smaller and pink.

BPA 's have been linked to insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes!With Klean canteen you don't have to worry about drinking harmful chemicals. They are a great product and have a very sleek look as well. The only thing to keep in mind is that they don't smell very good when you first purchase them. However, once you wash them out a few times, they are good to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfied with this product","review":"The 18 oz. size is very handy. Fits in my bookbag pocket, as well as my bike waterbottle holder. It is also very sturdy. It doesn't break when dropped, unlike some plastic ones I've had, and the water doesn't get that \\"plastic\\" taste. Based on scientific evidence that there are a lot of bad plastics out there, the stainless steel is a great alternative from a health standpoint. I also ordered the sports cap, a nice addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Water Bottle for the whole family","review":"I originally bought the 18oz for my 2 year old daughter to use with the sport cap as an alternative to lugging around plastic bottles on the weekend since she liked to spill the entire open bottle on her shirt. She loves drinking from the sport cap and I have even stolen the bottle during the week to take water from home to work every day. The bottle fits in the outside pouch of the diaper bag and we even took it with us to Curacao for use on the beach. As a bonus- the bottle kept the water fairly cool even after 3 hours outside in the shady beach bag. Now I am getting the 12oz sport cap to replace the sippy cup she takes to school everyday. Now hopefully she won't fight me when I take the big one to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this water bottle!","review":"I bought the 18 ounce and the 40 ounce sizes, and I could not be more pleased. After seeing a news feature on the plastic pollution of our oceans, I knew I had to eliminate my use of plastic water bottles. The transition has been so easy. I love everything about this bottle. I like the contemporary sleek design, wide mouth, loop cap, and easy to grip wide neck. It only takes a moment to clean the bottle with warm soapy water each evening. Let it air dry over night, and you will be ready to go each morning. I disagree with the reviewer who said there was a metallic taste when he drank water out of this bottle. Clean the bottle thoroughly before your initial use per the manufacturer's directions. I am very particular about the taste of my water, and this water bottle does not adversely affect the taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"The Klean Kanteen Water Bottle arrived on time, but upon opening the package I found that the item was not packaged properly and it had dents and scratches on it. I did not expect such a poor quality product from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go with the Poly Cap","review":"Love the bottle, but don't like the stainless steel cap. The stainless steel cap screwing into the stainless bottle is so noisy that it couldn't possibly be used discretely in any type of indoor setting (class, library, etc.) I would recommend this bottle using the poly cap instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't do the job for me","review":"This product just didn't do the job for me. I didn't return it, but I probably should have because I'll probably just send it to Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the steel smell!","review":"Everytime I open the cap, there is a strong steel smell coming up! It's so digusting, it even blends with the water. In winter, this bottle can't hold any warmth. The hot water will just conduct through the steel. And the bottle, after using it for two days. It become so dirty, I don't know why, it's just getting sticky. When drinking, water does overflows The mouth is just too big to suit ours!! So when I go outdoor, it's not easily carribale and drinking!For anyone of you, I don't recommend this bottle. It does NOT worth 20 bucks at all!!!! You can just get a 5 dollars transparent plastic bottle that's definitely better than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"18oz klean kanteen","review":"I purchased the 18oz klean kanteen , the 27 oz. and the 40 oz. The reason i purchased the 18 oz. was so it could fit in my bicycle water bottle cage. It does fit, but so does the 27 oz., which really makes the 18 oz. irrelevant for me. The sport cap works well for drinking, but the clean cap lanyard that comes with the sports cap is not practical, and awkward. Would recommend the 27 oz. and the 40oz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"I've been using Nalgene bottles for years and decided to switch after reading up on health concerns and plastic containers.

It served the purpose. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good value proposition."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoy the taste of your water","review":"I no longer drink water out of plastic bottles and so I have several klean kanteens that I trade off carrying around. They don't break which makes them preferable to carrying glass bottles.

I have had my 1st one for a couple of years and it still works great. I got this one for the bigger size. (My other is a 27oz. + I just got a 12 oz. as well.) The top is a little tough if it gets closed too tightly, but I just put a carabiner through it and it makes it super easy to open! Also, you do have to watch out not to drop it. I dropped my first one a few times and it has a couple of little dents. Nothing major though. The water stays tasting good (instead of having that nice plastic flavor of some other bottles) and does not have added chemicals from the bottle. I would recommend getting one for yourself!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Color and Great Gift","review":"Bought this water bottle for my daughter who is a graduate student and a theater stage manager. She liked the color and the idea. Bright, bright red."},{"rating":"2","title":"I take it with me everywhere","review":"I stopped purchasing bottled water after getting one of these. I have it clipped to my computer bag. It just feels good that I'm helping the environment just a little by not buying bottled water.

Convenient and rugged water bottle. 40oz is more than enough for hydration for about 8 hours. Stainless steel makes it easy to clean. Only complaint is that it does not fit in cup holdersdefinitely will buy again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the bottle, shame they didnt get the order right","review":"Love Klean Kanteens, for the open mouths which work in a dishwasher, the bright colors that kids love, that they don't make the water taste metallic, and the different sizes available. So much to love!Annoyed about not getting what I ordered. The lid was wrong and the sports lid leaks.So now I have the choice of returning the whole thing because the lid is wrong, which seems a waste of postage and effort, or going somewhere else to buy the right lid for another $4 or whatever it is.Not much money, but annoying. Maybe use a different supplier?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undrinkable: Like Drinking From A Rusty Water Fountain","review":"I have cleaned the bottle at least a dozen times with warm water and mild soap. I took the manufacturer's suggestion and cleaned it with baking soda and vinegar. I took their additional suggestion of letting distilled water and vinegar sit in the bottle over night. I tried everything and still, the water is disgusting. I use double-filtered water in the bottle and I liken it to the water that you would taste from a rusty old drinking fountain in a run-down park. If the water tastes like metal, it's probably not very good for your health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sports bottle","review":"I love this kanteen. I feel virtuous because I'm not using plastic, the water tastes great, and it fits in my car drink holder. The only drawback is that when you drink, it makes this strange, rather loud sound. It doesn't matter when working out (can't hear over the music) but when I just bring along it can be a little strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottle works great, don't get sports cap though","review":"The bottle works great. The stainless steel keeps the water cool and doesn't have that plastic taste when in the sun like plastic bottles do. However, I would suggest NOT getting the sports cap as it doesn't work well at all. Something I hadn't considered was that you can not squeeze a steel bottle like plastic ones so water doesn't really come out of the sports cap unless you suck hard on it, which isn't fun and probably not very sanitary after awhile. I would suggest getting the poly loop cap."},{"rating":"1","title":"returning product- taste issue","review":"We purchased 6 bottles- 2 large bottles and 4 small ones. There is a metallic \\"feel\\" to the liquid when drinking the water (like touching a tooth filling with a fork or aluminum foil) and some of the screw lids introduce a rubber/silicone taste and smell. We are returning them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value for money","review":"A good eco-friendly option that is not too expensive. I prefer the 18 oz size, they fit perfectly in our Honda Odyssey and our Honda Civic and easier to handle when filled with water. I got one of the 27 oz bottles and they keep falling out of the cup holders near the driver seat in the van. They probably would work better in the third row seat. Overall, a good buy and I would suggest the 18 oz as the best size. I got the green moss, orange and the blue. Loved all the three colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a big disappointment!","review":"I bought 2 of these bottles thinking I found the best idea for a water bottle...no more plastic. What a disappointment, the water tastes and smells like coins. When I received them I washed both of these bottles in hot soapy water and rinsed them well. The water still tasted and smelled like metal. I bought a bottle brush, washed them thoroughly again in hot soapy water and rinsed them well, they were the same. I tried washing and rinsing with white vinegar, no help. I tried washing with baking soda and rinsing well, no help. I contacted Klean Kanteen with my complaint and they are giving me a return authorization to return them for a refund. I'll post more when I find out how their customer service is."},{"rating":"1","title":"colored klean kanteen","review":"Save your money on the Klean Kanteens with color. Buy the stainless steel ones. The product itself is quite fine, but the colored ones arrive scratched and marred, so I think it will just be a matter of time before they do that anyway. Amazon did replace the marred ones, but I wish I had purchased the stainless steel ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klean Kanteens Rock!","review":"I have used Klean Kanteens now for over 4 years and have been very happy with them. I compared them to SIGG, New Wave, uh hum, plastic Nalgenes and other polycarbonate water bottles and prefer them.I got a few of these recently -Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Water Bottles: All Sizes, All Styles, Choose From Steel Caps or Poly Caps. Mix & Match!They are very durable but can dent. I drove out of my driveway one day and my 40oz Klean Kanteen dropped onto the concrete - got a little dent but that is all.My kids love the 12oz Sport bottles - they are 2 and 5yrs old. When they were smaller, they loved the 12oz Sippy. I prefer the 40oz when I go backpacking and the 27oz when Im drivin around town or at work.I love 'em!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it a better review","review":"Pros: It feels good in the hand. Very easy to clean. No liner, so no worries about what the liner is made of, or whether the liner will wear out.Cons: It leaks even when the cap is screwed on tight. This is a deal breaker. Also, its mouth is poorly shaped for drinking. If you're moving, as in a car or on a cardio trainer, it is all too easy to spill water all over your chest while trying to get it in your mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just great!","review":"So your looking for a stainless steel water bottle? Well, so was I until I stumbled onto Klean Kanteen. I chose this bottle for several reasons. The first reason was the large opening, so many of the other bottles have these little openings that make them hard to clean and or get ice into. The second reason was the high grade of Stainless Steel used. Thirdly was the build quality, this thing seems like it will last a very long time. If your worried about it leaking I can tell you that I have not had one leak since I purchased this bottle a month ago. The only down side to this type of bottle is carrying it for long periods of time. Hot and cold pass right through the metal. I wish they put a big loop like they have on the nalgene bottles then these bottle would be perfect! Also, I have not experienced any metal taste like others have posted. This is a great product that I would recommend to friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Klean Kanteen!","review":"Great product for a lot cheaper than I would have paid at my local retail store. We love them! They hold a lot of water and keep it cold for a lot longer than I would have expected. Wish it didn't \\"sweat\\" so much, but other than that it's great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent All Round Bottle","review":"I particularly like the fact that I can brew hot tea (to make ice tea) directly in the bottle and then refrigerate it. My 10-year old son's bottle is wearing well too ... much better than his Sigg Bottle, which looked battered after 2 weeks! Goes in the dishwasher too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling throughout the day","review":"I ordered the 18ox black kanteen and have been very pleased with it so far. It fits perfectly in my car's cup holder and is lightweight enough to throw in my purse. I really like the size because I can keep it at my desk at work and refill, then bring it with me as I travel and run errands throughout the day. The only negative is that it doesn't really keep cold beverages cold for very long. That's about it, I like it so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You need the sports top","review":"The top of the Klean Kanteen is very wide so when you drink from it you will probably spill. I recommend ordering the sports top with it. I think it should come with the sports top and not be an extra charge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint is peeling","review":"I purchased two Klean Kanteens, one Pink and one Black. My husband used the Black Kanteen three times, loved it, but found out the paint on the bottom (outside) of the canteen is starting to peel!

The Sigg also has too narrow of a mouth and so it doesn't get clean in the dishwasher.The Kleen Kanteen seems to be more durable and it washes easily in the dishwasher. I don't think you are actually supposed to wash it in the dishwasher, but mine's been washed in there many times and it's fine.The Poly Loop Cap is easy to grab and undo quickly. So far I haven't had any problems with leaking.I am loving my Kleen Kanteen and hopefully I will love it for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Green!","review":"I've been making a HUGE \\"Go Green\\" effort in my life this past year... recycling EVERYTHING I can, drinking my coffee from a \\"reusable thermal\\" cup, using a water filter on my sink faucet and refrigerator pitcher.

(didn't want hassle of having to NOT use it and send it back) and suggestion for Klean Kanteen company, make \\"different colored\\" caps to differentiate yours from your spouse's, kids, friends... GREAT product, HIGHLY recommend it.Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Water Bottles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent alternative to plastic bottles","review":"I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing this product, since some customer reviews raised concerns about product quality and water with a metallic taste. I have been very pleasantly surprised. I have not had a problem with leakage due to a poor seal between the canteen and the top, and I can detect no mettalic taste. I feel much better about not having to drink from a plastic bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottle","review":"Great bottle with no strange taste when you drink from it. It doesn't leak as long as you put the lid on correctly. It also keeps the liquid quite cool too.Worth noting that we also bought a blue one of these. Unfortunately after one use the blue kanteen had rust form in the inside screw where the lid goes. Thankfully, Amazon agreed to let us return it and we can get our money back - must have been a dud. We know of others who have these kanteen's and are very happy with them. And we intend to keep our plain stainless steel one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, effective","review":"I carry this bottle almost every day. I like having one, to save from using bottled water, and wasting both the money buying it and the trash throwing it out. Additionally, of course, this one could be used in a SHTF scenario for boiling water and the like, since it's steel. I did notice a bit of a taste in the water when first used, but I don't anymore. Cap screws on securely, and I've found that the loop is helpful not only to secure the bottle somewhere, but as a grip to open it if the cap is on too tight. Good purchase if you need something to carry your water in. Don't buy it for hot drinks, as mentioned above, this bottle gets HOT fast when filled with something hot - even when washing in hot water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice color, easy to use, the sport cap does leak a little.","review":"Overall, a good klean kanteen product. My wife loves the color and the size is just right for her. The sport cap is the only complaint because it leaks if the bottle is held upside for a while (i.e. in a diaper bag or purse). When the canteen arrives, there is a slip of paper that comes with it indicating the sport cap is not leak proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must keep upright, Cap 2.0 leaks our pours out when closed, as packaging says after arrival.","review":"This cap 2.0 pours water out when upside down. It does not hold water at all due to the air bypass design to allow quick drinking/air replacement. The packaging on arrival notes this. I did not see that disclaimer on Amazon. Cap 2.0 is a rip off and is good for only uses cases when the bottle is always upright.Bottle quality is good, get different cap or competing provider. I think it is a scam/business decision to get people to by the better lids which are an extra ~$10 sold separately, after the get this poor designed cap. Get stainless cap or the Cap 3.0 might be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interchangeable tops, and recyclable, too!!","review":"These are a great value since you can easily purchase a top separately when you need or want it (that wasn't the case with my Sigg bottle). All the tops are interchangeable on every bottle size. And, if and when the bottle has been dropped/dented/damaged one too many times it can easily be recycled at most recycling centers that take steel. Keep the caps and buy another, they'll serve you well for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An environmentally safe way to keep drinks cold!","review":"I bought the Klean Kanteen in every color, one for myself, and the rest to give away as gifts to co-workers. I really love that it is safe for the environment, doesn't give off toxins, and keeps your drinks cold all at the same time. I do recommend purchasing a sports bottle top for it as well, since it is very hard to use when going to the gym, etc. Also, the top can be very difficult to unscrew at times, a few time my husband couldn't even get it open!! Overall, I am very happy about the purchase. The colors are great too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safer than plastic","review":"Stainless steel is clean and chemical free and almost indestructable.If ever needed can be recycled! How much more GREEN can you get?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colors are good, but stainless doesn't scratch off","review":"I absolutely love these water bottles. I can keep water in them all week long and I only taste water. No plastic or metal aftertaste. The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because if I were to do it over again I would stick with the plain stainless steel bottle. The colors are nice, but they scratch off. Other than that I would definitely suggest this bottle to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squeaky but great!","review":"Yes, the sport bottle top squeaks but it really FLOWS! Love the color and love the size. The 27 oz. bottle is perfect to carry around rather than those clunky Nalgene bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klean Kanteen","review":"Very durable, clean look, and keeps water tasting fine. Amazon could have shipped the item a little better, but the product itself is fine. One thing, you have to suck on the bottle tip a little harder than other bottles. With plastic bottles, you can squeeze a little, but not with the stainless steal canteens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Very happy with both the product and the supplier. This is the best size for me - not too big -- and the product arrived in a timely manner and in good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Tall and thin, and I love the stainless steel. I got the stainless cap as well. It clinks when you close it (due to the metal top hitting metal bottle), but I don't mind that. And the bottom of the cap is closed (if that makes sense) so it is great when I want to shake the bottle to mix powder or something in the water -- it doesn't get into the lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"I received the bottles in good condition but when I used one of them, it \\"chirped\\" when I drank from it. It was very distracting to everyone around me. I haven't used the bottles again. The stainless steel bottle is fine. It is just the lid makes the chirping noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough","review":"I bought this to replace one I had that was run over by a full size SUV. It is still usable, it is just ugly. These are tough canteens. Only two gripes which are the nature of a steel canteen. You have to suck the water out because you can't squeeze it out. It doesn't fit in a bike canteen holder because it is to slick, but then again, its steel. These weren't anything I didn't expect, just something to be aware of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allergic Reaction!","review":"I recently bought four of these for my family for Christmas, so we could stop using the plastic bottles. After drinking from the 40oz. steel loop cap bottle I had an allergic reaction where the bottle comes into contact with my mouth. I researched their website to realize there is Nickel in the steel, of which I am allergic. I just wanted to make others aware of the potential allergy. I only have had an issue with jewelry before and didn't think twice about drinking from a metal bottle. The rest of my family has had no reaction and they love their bottles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good with one downfall","review":"This water bottle is overall a good choice, however, after the water sits for awhile you do start to get a metal taste, but I have been using the drink mixes crystal light and others put out in it and you don't notice the metal taste anymore.

It is very big which is convenient for me in my busy schedule. Also, it seems to keep the water cooler longer that my old water bottles. The sports cap is also very handy. There are a few drawback to consider though. When there is ice in the water bottle it makes the most obnoxious noise! Also, periodically the sports cap will also make annoying noises when you drink from the bottle.

The bottle is fine but the sports cap I chose for my bottle leaks when not standing upright. The vent hole that allows for easy drinking makes it less than water tight. So, while it may not be the best choice for all activities, it's fine for sitting in a cup-holder in your car or for home and office use. Water somehow tastes better coming from this stainless steel container. I like that I can use it with or without the sports cap, depending on where and what I'm doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for lunchbags","review":"I bought this item for my children's insulated lunchbags and they fit perfectly.

The Klean Kanteen keeps water cold, for a long time while traveling and although the Klean Kanteen does not claim to be leak proof, I have not had a leak problem, yet while traveling in backpacks or bags. I am pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, Great Cause","review":"I've been acutely aware of the negative properties of plastic bottles for some time, particularly that tons of the bottles end up in certain zones of the oceans and have a very profound negative impact. For a long while I've been getting by on recycling plastic bottles, but this doesn't help with some other big problems (e.g. it encourages bottle producers to supply more plastics, pay super-inflated price for water). Now I've stepped up to using only municipal water sources, as I feel everyone should consider doing, and this stainless-steel bottle is great for bringing water along with me during my bust workday. The fact that Klean Kanteens are customizable, affordable, and support a great cause only makes the deal even sweeter. If you can afford to buy plastic bottled water, you certainly can afford a klean kanteen for every member of your family. Actually, you will save a ton of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Reusable bottle, but the cap is iffy","review":"I love Klean Kanteens, our family now has several. However, the sipper lids leak. My 6 yo daughter constantly has soaked lunch bags. Although, the standard loop lids are great. Unfortunately, they seal so well she cannot open them herself.

I put filtered water into the larger bottle and was very surprised that after an over night stay in the frig, the water had a very harsh, metallic taste. After repeating the process, the water still had a metallic flavor. I'm disappointed that this product - which has other features we like such as its construction and close fit of the top - fails to give a Klean taste. We paid a premium price for this product; we won't be purchasing them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Water Bottle","review":"I bought two of these in the 27 oz. variety -- one in black and the other unpainted. I use them either for water or green tea. Here are my thoughts:* The taste is good, without any aftertaste that I can detect.* The paint on the black one has a little gash because I repeatedly scrapped it against the metal bottle holder on my bike, but I was impressed at how sturdy the container was.* The shape fits into pretty much any cup holder in terms of the opening, but it is very tall, so it may not always fit for height.* Store-bought ice cubes fit easily into the mouth of the bottle.* The metal transmits the temperature of the contents, so I bought a Camelbak brand neoprene sleeve from REI that fits it perfectly and serves as insulation.I would definitely recommend these, especially to people who don't like the taste of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color is TERRIBLE!

Also, younger children may not fully close the sport cap top, so liquids will leak. I bought two 18-ounce bottles for my 4-year old twins.

I called KK and the lady informed me that HER bottle has been used for years and doesn't chip at all. I told her I hand-washed them and had them in a stroller cup holder--that's it! No sympathy. Anyway, now I put them in the dishwasher hoping the rest of the paint comes off.The bottle is good for traveling, but the twist top is a bugger to get on and off. Plus I have to use a washcloth over the bottom in our car's cup holders because I'm afraid the chipping paint will stain something.

We have both the stainless steel and the painted finishes. The stainless steel finish stays nicer; however, it is much spendier than the colors (usually those are on sale).

There are very few reusable water bottles available in this size, so I really appreciated the options. I also liked the look of this; I used it on job interviews, and it always looked great. However, it cannot lie on its side. One time, I had to put my purse in the airplane overhead compartment. It fell onto its side, and the water bottle leaked in my bag (even though the lid was tight). As long as I was careful, though, I never had that problem. So, overall, it's a nice bottle, but it's not great if you want to just throw it in a bag and not worry about the orientation of the bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sweats too much","review":"It is a nice bottle,and very colorful but the bottle sweats too much if you put cold drinks or ice in it.

However, the steel isn't all that thick and my kids drop it a lot and it dents all the time. We've even had to take a hammer to the bottom a few times just so it can stand up straight. It also sweats all over the table when you put anything cold on it and makes a big mess. I have since ordered the Thermos Nissan insulated steel bottle for myself but my hubby and sons are still using these since we bought themThermos Nissan 18-Ounce Stainless-Steel Hydration Bottle. I thoroughly enjoy my Nissan bottle but hate the mess theirs is always leaving because we have to make sure to keep wiping up the counter or papers and other things get wet and messed up.

They are the perfect size and color. The stainless steel is safe for drinking and does not cause drinks to taste different. The only problems we have found are: 1) the caps are difficult to remove for little hands if they ate tightened as tight as they need to be in order to remain leak-free. 2) the color chips when dropped very little (not a huge deal except for very picky children who are also a bit clumsy!) 3) the outside of the container does get a bit of condensation but that is expected from stainless steel as it conducts temperature.

It fits the KK 27-ounce bottle and keeps ice water cold for hours. If you use the pop-up sport cap, you have to suck on it because, of course, you can't compress steel like plastic, but that's no big deal. You can also twist off the whole cap; the pop-up part fits in a doohickey that hangs from the neck of the bottle, so the cap stays clean and you won't lose it.

And his gets tossed around with barely a scratch or dent! They're perfect to bring on walks or to bring water or any beverage to work. They wash easy. The cap is sturdy and doesn't leak. They come in so many colors it's easy to personalize someone's gift! It's simple and sleek design is perfect for anyone! The 27 oz I found was the perfect size: not too big and not too small.

In fact, I have two of these, and they both leak unless the bottles are upright and motionless. I'm also unimpressed with the taste, they occasionally impart an off taste to my water. It doesn't seem metallic, but I don't know what else it would be. It doesn't occur all the time, and I frankly haven't experimented to find out why. I have reverse osmosis water that runs about 20 ppm total dissolved solids--it doesn't have any taste to it, so it has to be coming from the bottle.I give it two stars only because I suppose it could be worse.

Within a week I was getting reports of wet backpacks because they were leaking all over the inside of them. I was not happy about this and still haven't decided what to do about it. For now they are still using them, but are making sure that they are upright at all times and only if there is no other resort.

I guess it would have been fine if I'd planned to keep it in an upright cup holder in a car.Right now I'm kind of wishing I'd saved my money and not purchased this product, since it looks like I'll have to continue paying for one-time-use Poland Spring bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"After researching many stainless steel water bottles I selected Klean Kanteen for my three grandchildren.

I do not know what materials are in this top that my grandson must put in his mouth to get a drink of water from his bottle. This is not what I ordered.

Within the past 3 weeks of having my 27 oz Indicator Red Klean Kanteen, water has become 90% of what I drink now.This sucker is incredibly durable and completely leak proof. The rubber grommet on the lid keeps the seal super tight and leak free. I've filled it up completely, turned it upside down and shaken the heck out of it and not had a single drop leak out. As an example of its durability: I've had my Klean Kanteen filled about 3/4 full and accidentally dropped it in my office and someone thought I fell down because it crashed so loud; I picked it up and it didn't have a single scratch on it. I used it to hammer a thumb tack into a door earlier this weekend and didn't leave the slightest dent on it.

Polycarbonate can release its primary building block, bisphenol A, another suspected hormone disruptor, into liquids and foods. In 1998, the Japanese government ordered manufacturers there to recall and destroy polycarbonate tableware meant for use by children because it contained excessive amounts of bisphenol A.

I like this minimalistic trend.- If you keep water in this bottle for over 12h it starts tasting really weird (metallic).- The muzzle has a diameter which makes it near impossible for me to drink properly from it. The upper side of the muzzle blocks my nose. I would have preferred it to be either larger or smaller, but this diameter doesn't work for me.- The muzzle is completely exposed (even if you close the bottle). If you use it outdoors, dirt, germs, and other unsanitary material can easily attach itself from the rim you drink from.

I purchased a couple of these bottles, but then returned them after seeing how they were constructed.The opening that you drink from is not covered by the lid, as it is with other water bottles. This makes it a bad item to take to the gym, which is nothing more than a giant petri dish for germs. If you grab the bottle by the top (not by the ring), or if it falls over or comes into contact with anything, you end up putting it directly into your mouth. Worrying about BPA is great, but the probability of catching something from the gym is a lot higher. I would recommend a bottle with a covered lid - I ended up purchasing some from CamelBak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stainless Steel Saved my Life","review":"I was using a large Arizona Iced Tea bottle as my water bottle.

I was being tested for MS, that's how bad it was. Then I got an email about the dangers of using plastic water bottles. They suggested using glass or stainless steel. I figured it was worth a try.

Also the cap that goes over the pop-top fits tightly (good for cleanliness) so it is difficult for kids to pull off.Love the fact that it is stainless, but the bottom needs reinforcement.

For a steel product, it's more lightweight than I expected, but not flimsy. I did notice upon opening the packaging that the bottle did not seem ideally pristine, having a few scuff marks and minor blemishes. I can't say whether that's attributable to Amazon's handling or the manufacturer. In contrast, the interior of the bottle did seem very \\"klean,\\" if you will. If you get the sport cap you will note it makes a little \\"whistle\\" when you draw in water; it is vented to allow air pressure to work in your favor. Again, not really something I'd complain about, though ideally it would be silent. Overall I am satisfied and will be keeping this bottle, despite some imperfections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kanteen","review":"Great kanteen. Great for young children. Easy to use.

She was using plastic rubbermaid type bottles you can get at local superstores. I would occasionally slip a sip and would taste the plastic taste. I'm not paranoid about the chemicals in plastic and that they're going to kill me, but I don't care to taste them. It can't be good for you if you can taste it. So, I researched cans for holding drinking water. I saw reviews about the paint coming off of the outside, but I didn't care too much about that. Fortunately, there have been no problems with the paint. Bottom line: MY WIFE LOVED IT MOST OF ALL SHE RECEIVED FOR CHRISTMAS!!!

It's really nice in concept, but there are some problems with it. First of all, the sport cap chirps loudly like a bird when you drink from it, which is rather embarassing. Secondly, I, too, find that it imparts a strong metallic taste to the water. I haven't given up on it -- maybe I will try switching to another type of cap and see if there's some way I can clean it to improve the taste. I really support the effort to make a safe water bottle, and I hope Klean Kanteen will work on fixing the problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stainless, Good = Plastic, Bad","review":"For anyone who drinks water, Klean Kanteen is definitely the way to go, no build up of foul odors or tastes with stainless.

Also, her sippy spout doesn't leak all over the place as all her previous bottles have done. I'd reccommend these to anyone.

I was (and still am) concerned about the contents of the plastic in plastic water bottles diffusing into my drinking water, but I just cannot take another sip of metallic water! It was getting to the point that drinking the water from my Kleen Kanteen made me nauseous! I tried many things, including using vinegar and baking soda to remove the metallic taste (as advised in the official website) with success for maybe a few hours during the day.

The cavity of the cap is not uniformly circular: it has 2 concave holes. Even though I tried to wash the cap dutifully, I couldn't get the few remaining spores of mildew that always burrows into porous plastic. As a result, water kept in the bottle for over 24 hours gets this unpleasant old smell, similar to week-old water in a plastic water bottle. I have to BOIL the cap regularly to prevent this.(2) The paint on the bottom of the bottle started peeling off, and now leaves pieces of paint everywhere. I have only set the bottle down on wood and plastic tables, so there wasn't any heavy wear or tear.Perhaps if I had chosen brushed steel colour and then purchased an additional cap, then this wouldn't have happened.

You can get the stainless bottle with the sport lid but not with the colored bottles??

If you put hot stuff in it (like me), expect it to get cold fast. Expect to burn your fingers every time you pick it up. Expect to burn your inner lip on hot metal ever time you take a sip. The steel is VERY thin. I expect that if i dropped it, it would certainly dent.This product is honestly worth about 6-8 dollars.

Finally I decided (1) plastic bottles of water are too heavy to keep hauling from the supermarket, (2) they're bad for the environment because the plastic hangs around for ever, (3) the water in them often tastes of the plastic, and (4)the water is often no healthier than tap water. So I bought a portable filter and a couple of Kleen Kanteen stainless steel bottles. Problems solved. Water tastes good. No plastic taste. Good for the environment.

One thing that lends the film so much of its charm is this brilliant soundtrack. The songs are catchy and make you WANT to sing along. At times some of the words seem creepy \\" children throwing snowballs instead of throwing heads...\\"but that creepiness has a charm to it that is almost like that of Dr. Seuss. The only thing that makes the soundtrack BETTER than the film, is the narrations read by the great Patrick Stewart.

Well, this is the soundtrack with the vocals and the origanal score by Danny elfman (pee-wee's big adveenture; Edward scissor hands; Sleepy Hollow; Planet of the Apes). Featuring the composer as Jack, who has a stunning voice and a vocal range of a piano (88 notes? 86?). Danny Elfman cleaverly puts music to life ih these wonderful songs that make you laugh, cry, and wonder what the heck the main charactor Jack Skellington is thinking!

He loves it too. He is very content in it, and enjoys \\"participating\\" in my chores instead of being stuck in his exersaucer or highchair. It is a little pricey for a simple piece of material (why I didn't give it 5 stars), but it works, and I am happy with my purchase. Making sure you get the right size is crucial!

I felt nothing, in fact I found it to be laborious to complete. Some part of a book usually reaches out and grabs me, whether it be fear, humor, disgust, heart beating romance ,or some action-adventure, but this book and Holly Krauss bored me.

He's one of the few basses I've ever heard sing a convincing recording of Chesnokov's \\"Do not cast me off in the time of old age\\". Such a recording as this would be interesting merely because the sound of a Russian basso profondo is very unique. However, Miller does not merely possess an extremely low voice, he is also a very talented singer. He shows a surprising amount of agility in track \\"I will lift up mine eyes to the heavens\\" with some beautiful higher passages.

Nonetheless it is still an essential reading for the Hospitaller's last century on Malta. Cavaliero, naturally writing in hindsight, presents the Knights' ousting from Malta in 1798 as long overdue; this makes for good reading but bad perspective. One gets the sense this is as much an elegy for the Hospitallers on Malta as it is a historical work. To Cavaliero's benefit, though, this is a subject that has received scant attention despite the general swell in popular interest in the military orders; he is to be credited with tackling this period of history with a kind of style other historians would be envious to achieve. In summation:Get this book? Yes. It is well worth it, despite its faults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lapses in Historical Accuracy","review":"As with the book, Wood had created serious lapses in historical accuracy in the film.

Alexander was known as Macedonian and had never been called \\"Greek\\" in any ancient text, and Wood should have represented him for what he was.

That's not to say that he simply supplants the historical record with fancy literary devices. On the contrary, as a researcher Tosches' tentacles reach from the basements of dusty libraries to the boardrooms of entertainment executives to the social clubs that function as Mafia fronts.

BUT if you do not put the lid on correctly or push the straw in far enough this cup will leak horribly. It will also leak if the little clear air valve on the inside of the lid is not pushed on all the way. People are complaining about cleaning this cup but I just take it all apart and stick it in the dishwasher basket and take it out and put it back together. If you dont want to worry about all the parts I would go with the playtex coolster tumbler or the playtex sipster. I only use these three cups. But the Tumbler is by far my favorite for 2years and up. This Nuby cup is my favorite for a one year old. The sipster for any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to assemble","review":"If the sliding lid were slightly shorter, then you could easily thread the straw in place behind the crossguard. But as is, the sliding lid prevents the straw from pushing up into place, so you have to use your finger (or a tool like pliers if your hands are too big) to pull the mouthpiece between the sliding lid and the crossguard. This becomes tedious the very first time you wash the cups, and it really never gets easier. And what parent wants another frustration in their day, especially when the little one is begging for their drink?Also, everyone else who complained about the \\"spray effect\\" when the lid is opened is spot on.

I noticed that my son always chewed the straw (the silicone part, not the BPA part which is inside).

They work great if your child doesn't understand that they need to tip the cup up to drink from it. (My son is now almost 12 months and still isn't great at this) So I thought, perfect, he can drink from any angle. Well, I only use these with water because he is constantly flicking the straw which holds a small amount of liquid in the top (it doesn't flow back down the valve). So after having formula flying everywhere...the stroller, car, kitchen wall, my face, etc... I got fed up with it. He only gets water because it won't cause a stain when he plays with the straw or sets it down too hard. Any other type of liquid, and he gets a normal sippie cup and we are working on teaching him to tip it up so he doesn't just suck air.

We recently had to part with them because they do contain BPA. Although none of the components that \\"touch the liquid\\" come in contact with the BPA parts (straw flip-cover), my son would sometimes chew/suck on the knob of the flip cover if he wasn't looking when he put it to his mouth. According to Nuby's website, all of these particular staw cups manufactured after 4/18/08 are 100% BPA free.

I went to buy another recently, and all I could find was this Nuby one. I really don't care for it--the straw has to be bitten to get anything out of it (try explaining that to a 1-year-old who's used to the regular sucking kind, ugh), and every time I open it to refill it water comes dripping out from some unknown place, almost like it's getting trapped somewhere and overflowing. Adding insult to injury, the straw is too short, so I imagine if we ever put milk in there, we'd be wasting a lot. I didn't realize it was a Nuby cup or I wouldn't have bought it--I highly dislike their regular soft-tipped sippies, too.

Unfortunately I lost that insert the first time I washed it and now the cup is almost useless. It would have been better if they just made it one longer piece.I also found the straw very difficult to pull through the top as the slide closure didn't seem to go as far back as it should.Since my 20-mth old really liked the smaller one, I really am disappointed that she can't use the bigger one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy straw sipper cup with no leakage (unless provoked)","review":"I have been using these cups for several weeks and have been very happy with their performance.

It was cute and I'd seen a lot of toddlers with these cups at playgroups.The straw is hard to thread back through after cleaning, and the last thing you want when your toddler has decided she's thirsty is to faff around with a fiddly straw.The biggest drawback is the spray factor. Liquid pools in the top portion of the straw, you close it and then when you open it - SPRAY! Milk flies through the air. It's a very messy cup.

I really liked the cup when I first tried it and bought a second one. My son was able to drink from it easily and it didn't leak (at first). After having it a couple of months, I hate it. I've lost one of the straw parts and a new straw costs nearly as much as a new cup. The top piece of the straw is very difficult to assemble correctly. It's very difficult to get water out unless you bite the straw, but then it's not durable enough to withstand repeated biting. Now there is a hole in the straw and it leaks. I can't get the straw to fit in quite right, and it leaks. These all seem to be design flaw issues. At least with the munchkin straw sipper, if you need a new straw they are cheap and readily available.

I put it together wrong the first time and my son spilled milk all over himself. After closer inspection, I realized I hadn't pushed the valve all the way in which can take some work to do. Once I fixed that, no more leaks. I assume this is the problem all the other reviewers are having when they say it leaks.And as long as your little one doesn't use it as a teething toy, it will last a long time.

It would perhaps scare off a kid intending mischief but some druggie attacker would simply shrug it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A condescending treatment of Christianity","review":"The main problem with this documentary is that it begins with the premise that Christ was not the Son of God. As a result, the series dismisses the New Testament as a source and then comes up with lots of alternative explanations for why Christianity developed. If you are a skeptic about Christianity, then this documentary may be for you, but if you are a Christian, this documentary will tell you very little about early Christianity and will take lots of cheap shots at your faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Liberal View","review":"I have always enjoyed Frontline video series. I thought their piece on the Gulf War was one of the best I've ever seen. However, this series was so slanted towards the left that it left me utterly disgusted. They only interview scholars from notoriously liberal divinity schools who give a completely tainted few of the truth! I suppose this makes for good television and avoids the more controversial black and white issues of the Christian faith (i.e. The one true way to God), but I call it blasphemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD \\"From Jesus to Christ\\"","review":"This gently used DVD titled \\"From Jesus to Christ: the First Christians\\" came within 3 days, was a wonderfully low price, and is well worth the time and money to watch, over and over again. It contains comprehensive historical accuracy, documented by well respected and top university professors in the history, religion, and theology fields. The photography and presentation are outstanding, and most importantly, this documentary puts the whole mysterious notion of how early Christianity came about into an exciting and easy to understand educational package. I recommend this DVD to ALL people, not just Christians, for a well rounded, all-inclusive discovery of the historical truths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Academic view on Jesus","review":"Elaine Pagels is, in my opinion, one of the leading authorities on the subject matter. I first saw this air on TV and have had many discussions on the various gospels as well as those found in Nag Hamadi. I am a seeker and thus am always on the hunt for answers of how and why. This documentary attempts, very well, to answer some of those questions most of us have. This does not attempt to rattle questions of faith and if your faith can be easily rattled I don't suspect you would be watching this documentary anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbalanced and therefore misleading review of scholarship","review":"This video series is a good introduction to the scholarship of the third quest for the historical Jesus and specifically of the so-called Jesus seminar. Unfortunately, that scholarship is at one end of the spectrum and is fairly controversial. What this series fails to do is to seriously consider the evidence and arguments of scholars who hold less radical viewpoints and who have raised serious objections to the kinds of claims made in the series. For a brief example of such scholarly objections, see http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Five_Gospels.pdfFor more complete treatments see:Fabricating Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the GospelsWhat Have They Done with Jesus?: Beyond Strange Theories and Bad History--Why We Can Trust the BibleorDethroning Jesus: Exposing Popular Culture's Quest to Unseat the Biblical Christto name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"jesus to christ","review":"this is a very good overview of Christanity.

Instead, I was surprised to see the Jesus Seminar scholars so prominently featured bringing \\"new evidence\\". Atheists will love this portrayal of Jesus because it is based on a group whose \\"research\\" begins with the premise that the Bible is largely myth. All of the commentary is colored in this direction which makes for a completely lopsided presentation. I'm shocked that absolutely no effort was made to bring on any New Testament/Early Christian scholars that would provide a kind of foil or balanced point of view. The info in this video represents a miniscule (<5%) viewpoint in the Christian study and has been widely discredited -- even by Atheist scholars.

I suppose if you are absolutely new to this way of eating then it is a helpful start, but if you are already eating vegetarian style, you already know this info. It had conflicting suggestions for food choices, one of which was the use of canned soup and frozen vegetables.

I liked the book even less, and would be even more critical. I saw this book at one of the local book 'superstores' and spent at least an hour looking it over thoroughly. The TZ Companion by Zircee is a vastly better work. The authors take a scholarly tone, that often comes across as overly pompous. Their episode reviews and synopsis' are very poor, and although exhaustively indexed, are lacking sorely. There are some interesting appedices (such as everything Serling did, general themes covered in various episodes), most of which have been addressed long ago online. Also disappointing was a complete lack of pictures. This book does not have a SINGLE photo. Just a text based rehash of the TZ Companion......very disappointing in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been There, Done That","review":"A poor rehash of the Companion.

This is a great unit for small spaces but has many drawbacks:First, older CDs do not have the best sound on this system. I played The Stooges Fun House and David Bowie and the Spiders From Mars albums and the sound is reduced to transistor radio mode. Also, the wood cone speakers make a lot of music sound odd and \\"tinny or metallic\\". Very weird. On the other hand, classical music and DVDs sound terrific (though the dialog is often too quiet).Second, the unit itself is very noisy during disc play. A whirring noise, like a motor humming, can be heard when a disc is playing. This gets very annoying while you're trying to watch a movie or listen to music on lower volumes.

I wish the button on the clock was bigger so she would not be so reticent to use it since their are other buttons on the clock and she seems scared to press any by mistake and mess up the clock.One issue I have with the clock is that the clock makes hourly reports at night as well.

A must read for anyone who loves to hate villains!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Fast-paced and action-packed. These words describe just about any of Mr. Salvatore's works and are certainly applicable to this, the latest in the Demon Wars saga. Pony and Elbryan continue their work against the machinations of evil and encounter numerous battles along the way. Definitely, read The Demon Awakens, which is the first book in this trilogy, before starting this one. After you finish that you'll be ready for more. Salvatore creates lovable characters with the emotions and tensions of real life personalities and is a master of battle scenes. If you've read the \\"Drizzt\\" books, you'll certainly enjoy these stories; Elbryan embraces many of the same qualities as the dark-elf. If you've never read anything by Mr. Salvatore, give this trilogy a try. It's worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant","review":"The demon spirit is as good as the Demon Awakens, when I read The Demon Awakens I became so caught up in it that I went right ahead and wrote my own book hoping to equal Salvatores genius.

Salvatore, as always, kept my attention and focus and I truly enjoyed turning the pages. My only complaint is that after the victory over Dactyl (maybe/maybe not?) the story begins to focus more and more on the Abellican monks. At times I found this boring and lacking of slow. Once the goblins and powries left the stage the story began to grind to a slower pace. Although I did eventually get into the new direction of the story, it did take some getting used to.Overall I'd recommend you pursue the continuation of the First Demon War Saga and pick up this novel.

I think a large problem I find with books like this is that the main character come off more annoying than heroic. You know your not enjoying a fantasy novel when you would like nothing better than to see the main protaganist meet a grisly fate (like squished under the foot of a \\"fomorian\\" giant).

Not only is my comprehension of God's Word vastly increased, but I receive new insights each week.I can't even begin to tell you all of the amazing, life-changing aspects that are taking place in my life right now as a result of this product.This Listener's Bible is a must have for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eternal Investment","review":"My purchase of \\"The Listener's Bible\\" was one of the best investments I have ever made. Max McLean does a tremendous job reading the text. He makes you feel as if you are listening to the author of each book. While reading he gives you each chapter reference so that you know where you are, but he does not give each verse (which would be quite annoying).After listening to \\"The Listener's Bible\\" for several weeks, I realized that I was getting a different perspective on the Bible. Normally I hear Scripture taught in church or I personally study smaller portions at a time. But by listening to longer sections of Scripture at a time, I've gained a deeper understanding of the Bible. For example, I am much more aware of how much of the Gospels were spent addressing the needs of the sick and the poor. I had always heard that this was so, but there was something about hearing it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"two chapters missing","review":"I downloaded this book, but the first two chapters are missing.

This is a movie about the Belgium resistance against the Nazis, complete with the execution of half a village, and here comes Paxton like he is in a Mary Poppins movie. It boggles the mind. Perhaps it is just me. I can't wait to hear what other viewers thought of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This movie is so bad that it is annoying.

I think this movie suffered from poor directing, which doomed it to mediocrity right out of the gate. But it was Bill Paxton's performance that made this movie nearly unbearable for me. His performance lacked weight and depth in every way. He was utterly unconvincing as a military officer, a man in love, and someone in touch with the gravity of war and all its ugliness. I was actually embarrassed for him. Julia Ormond, conversely, did a respectable job, but she along with a good concept couldn't mitigate the damage done by Paxton and the poor overall execution of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Resistance\\": Not a Feel Good Movie","review":"-----This movie, \\"Resistance\\", with Julia Ormond and Bill Paxton, is well-made and well-acted, but it does not make you feel good. The good guys lose too much; the bad guys win too much. The Nazis do not get hurt enough. Perhaps the movie is too realistic to be entertaining; being in Nazi-occupied France in WW II was not much fun. I was not born then; perhaps the movie does show you what it was like on the individual level. You may not enjoy it, but you will remember it. ---Jim"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this book on your shelf already","review":"If you have given up on superhero books or simply fallen off track and want to read you something that is a great superhero book, please pick up Invincible.

The art is incredible, some of the best colorist at work inside. And the penciling of Ryan Otterly starts great and continues to become a visual media that you will want to see more and more of.

Get it and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly \\"The Best Superhero Comic Book In The Universe\\"","review":"The individual issues of Invincible tout the book as \\"probably the best superhero comic book in the universe\\". While this is meant as a joke, Invincible truly is the best there is when it comes to modern superhero fiction. Mixing the powers of Superman with the early Lee/Ditko Spider-Man, Invincible starts off a little slow, but the massive twist in the middle of this book starts off one of the most intriguing superhero stories out there. The art only gets better as the book goes on, and the almost 100 pages of art is a fantastic bonus, especially the Invincipals. All comic book fans should pick this book up, and Volume 2 when it comes out next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just something about Kirkman's Writing.","review":"You just have to read his comics to truly understand how unique his writing is.

It was incredibly hard to put down once I started and is utterly entertaining until the very end.

Not only is the writing great thanks to Robert Kirkman but it has easy on the eye art. It isn't too flashy but isn't too simple either, it just fits and works. Getting this book definitely got me hooked on the series and made me appriciate Kirkman even more for being able to tell an intriguingly entertaining story. Although there isn't much cursing in this series, I would recommened to parents to read this first before letting their kids under 13 read this title for the violence in the second half of the book.

Generous helpings of groping, licking and moaning only add tedium to the already outrageously padded-out premise. Lacking in humour, wit and EROTICISM, the project is a dull, ludicrous affair, which even a man in a gorilla suit can't save.Undiscriminating viewers may get a kick out of this, probably for ogling and masturbatory value more than anything else (but even, the sex scenes aren't so hot - if you want to do something like this, why not go all the way?) . those of you who are a little unsure about purchasing this title should perhaps rent it first.The extras: the 50 minute so-called 'doco' is just a behind-the-scenes featurette, which sometimes seems more interesting than the actual movie.

Saints that were once familiar to the populace (Lawrence for one) are \\"rediscovered\\" by Sister Wendy in the manuscripts. And she doesn't shy away from controversy, either. Sister Wendy readily admits that some saints were actually fabrications (Christopher) or were made out to be more than they were (George and the Dragon).In all, I enjoyed the program.

Next time I will definately pay the extra for a good battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulking and Unprotective","review":"This flimsy hodgepodge of velcro and nylon is both cheesey and bulky.

Comes with convienently hideous velcro strips that peel off and stick to the back of your handheld. Great if your throwing your pocket PC at a velcro dartboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality tool made in the USA","review":"This tool is quality made and I'm definitely pleased with it. As a maintenance mechanic, I need my tools to perform daily tasks. This one hasn't let me down. I've worked with cheaper Chinese versions of this hex key set and I definitely see the difference in quality. The chromed casing doesn't bend up when I apply a lot of torque to a fastener. The ball ends definitely make it easier to turn fasteners in tight spots. I will caution however, that the ball ends will tend to round out if you use them to loosen really tight, rusted-in fasteners. For that reason, I use my Eklind hex set without the ball end because they make more contact on the inside of the fastener socket. Otherwise, excellent tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silicone Case Is Great","review":"I use this Sansa Player in the gym and the silicone case is great for protecting the unit.

The SACD is clear and wide-ranging. All the instruments and voices are easily distinguished. The problem is that the weight of this work is never heard, almost as if the orchestra is afraid of showing any force. The percussion try, but the brass are especially 'nice' and always sound reserved. One never hears the anger, attitude, or magnitude required to convey the power of this music. I would recommend the recording of Davis with the London Symphony that is recently available from Pentatone on SACD. It is an older recording that is incredibly updated to sound as good as this one, but with more power, emotional exploration, and maturity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry Earthbound Recording.","review":"I have been collecting SACD records for some time now and found many of Spano's recordings to be excellent. In particular, his Vaughan-Williams Sea Symphony in Atlanta had the majesty, warmth and affection of a recordings by English masters such as Barbirolli and Boult. This particular performance sounds earthbound, unspired. The recording even in SACD surround is tight and dry. Most unpleasant to listen to in the big moments. The many classic recordings by Colin Davis, Charles Munch and Charles Dutoit are significantly better, and the Davis is available in surround sound from pentatone in SACD format. It still sounds great even though recorded in the late 60s."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just ok!","review":"I found this documentary kind of difficult to follow and the camera work and audio were a bit choppy.

The instructors do offer two interesting, advanced combinations; but they are poorly taught. Overall, the quality of the instruction is poor, and dull. Also, the quality of the videotape is bad--the picture is grainy, and the tape is flimsy and not strong enough to withstand the number of x you might have to rewind the tape to figure out the true count of the only two interesting moves. I think you actually learn more from their demonstrations than from the instruction.

I thought of keeping the software but it the sound is just too annoying and you need it to play the games.I believe the problem is that I'm running Windows XP, and since this Disney software is a few years old it does not run properly on XP.

Compact, sleek and amazingly durable, the i730 is Nextel's most feature-loaded phone yet. I've been a Nextel customer for 2 years and would never consider another carrier (used to be with AT&T, Verizon and CellularOne (now Cingular)). Their coverage is far-superb and I've never had a dropped call! If you loved the i90c or i95cl, the i730 is going blow your mind.

The phone is fantastic. Beautiful color screen and a very nice platinum outer finish. Its bigger than my previous phones, but it fits nicely to my ear and the phone feels more durable. I was please to find out this phone has a one touch direct connect, which is a real cool feature. The speaker is real loud-much louder than my boyfriends i95cl, and I can honestly say the earpiece has better reception (RF). Also the telenav feature is a very nice touch,I recently moved to Seattle and its helped me out tremendously.

The I730 is the biggest piece of crap I have ever owned. I have had it for 3 months and the darn thing is falling apart. My so called Smart button has fallen off one day and I don't even know where it is. The phone's reception is horrible.

So I finally got an i850, and believe me that phone is a whole lot better. The call quality is better, the service is better, and the battery life is a lot better.

Want a walkie talkie buy a walkie talkie. All other carriers have free mobile to mobile calls. I think this is much better then a walkie talkie. Call someone, talk normal (No push to talk and both people can talk normal) or leave message. The Nextel coverage and quality is horrible here in south Louisiana.

It is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still room for improvement","review":"I've had this phone for a little over a week, and while it performs good enough, there is room for improvement. First is the poor battery life that other reviewers have mentioned. Even when I haven't made any calls, it still drains about fifty percent daily. Secondly, it doesn't seem to be as well made and as sturdy as my old Samsung 850 phone. For the price, Motorola should have a product that is not so flimsy.But that being said, I still like the phone. The display is bright and clear; and it performs better than my previous phone. So if you're considering buying one, make sure you buy a spare battery and extra battery charger. You'll need it. And if you need a phone that can take abuse, I would look at the i530 with the rubberized exterior. It's not as slick as the i730, but it looks like it is designed more rugged use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to the 45 RPM","review":"The sound quality of this CD is terrible!

The only other reason I can think to buy this album is for the picture on the cover which is absolutely hilarious. It depicts a woman dancing in front of a man who appears to be Richard Nixon. Put in context with the 70's it's obvious that the title \\"Shame Shame Shame\\" is being used as a reference to the Watergate scandal that was unfolding at the time of the song's release.

We now have no more \\"stink from the can.\\" It holds tons of food scraps, and we only have to empty it every 2nd or 3rd day. We did get some mold growing on the inside of the lid, so just watch for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norpro 94 stainless-steel composter","review":"The composter looks good on the counter top and it holds a lot kitchen scraps. I haven't noticed any odor, so the filter system seems to be working."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Stink!","review":"After we were able to recycle food waste through our waste mgmt company, we started out using just a plastic bowl with a lid to collect the waste. Uck! This is so much easier. I don't think anyone would ever confuse this for a regular canister out on the counter but it doesn't look bad, just functional. Given that our garbage and recycling sit under the sink I'm not sure how anyone would have room for food waste under there too. The lid comes off very easy. And there is no smell. I'd certainly buy it again and recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty lid","review":"Initially this product was great. The lid fit snug, but was still easy to remove. The filters worked and there were not any flies as reported in some posts. The stainless steel cleans up nicely. Unfortunately within the first year the metal band on the lid split vertically. Now we find we don't use it as much because the lid is difficult to get on and off. Another split has appeared recently. I have to give this product 1 star because it was not durable. For this price it should have lasted for a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Kitchen Composter","review":"This composter is an excellent kitchen countertop composter. The filter seems to control all odors. I line mine with small kitchen plastic garbage bags. I noticed that the filter is the same carbon material that is readily available at local home/hardware stores that is used with air purifiers. I buy the carbon filter material in a roll and cut it to fit this pail. I am a beginning composter and found the size perfect for my small kitchen, but big enough to hold several days worth of kitchen waste before making the trip to the compost pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Nature","review":"We've been using this keeper for several months and are delighted with it. It's a little pricey but we like it. It works perfectly for our 2 person household. Mark it down $20 and get a 5 star rating for value."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Favorite","review":"We compost a lot for a couple who lives in a suburban area. I was getting tired of bowls filling up and not getting taken out to the compost bin, so I bought this compost keeper. I really like it. The carbon disc in the lid keeps the smell out of the rest of the kitchen, even if you leave things inside for a week.If you don't want to scrub the inside every time you dump it, pick up the biodegradable compost bags that are made to fit it. I did and I'm glad I did.The aesthetics are pleasing for pretty much any kitchen decor - mines a modern hollywood regency mashup and it looks right at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great.","review":"Have been using this product for several months now and while initially it seemed like a great product it is starting to show significant wear. It says the product is stainless steel however it appear that there is rust beginning to form in locations were abrasion is typical (ie the lid). Had I know this would occur I probably would have gone with the ceramic version. Just a heads up for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money and smell free!!","review":"This thing is great. It tried a couple other stainless versions before reading the reviews here and this is the one I was looking for in the beginning. It's large enough so that I don't have to run to the compost bin every 2 days, easy off top, yet keeps in smells completely. Easily washable and a great handle to boot. Plus, I'm super picky about looks and this one fits the bill, sitting on my countertop. You hardly notice it. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter insert doesn't stay in lid","review":"I've had a similar style bucket in the past, but lost the lid due to operator error (lid accidently dumped in yard waste container). Finally ordered what I thought was the same thing we had purchased from Bed, Bath, and Beyond, but this container has a problem with filter insert staying in the lid. Put the insert into the top cover and it slides right out into the waste in the can. We eventually taped the insert in, but the tape breaks quickly and out comes the insert. I complained to the seller expecting a return label or maybe a new lid insert, but instead Uncle Jim's Worm Farm sent a whole new container. The new one works a little better, but the insert still likes to slide out, albeit more slowly than the first one. I would not recommend this container, but a big shout out to Uncle Jim's Worm Farm for attempting to fix the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective and attractive","review":"This item has vastly increased our composting, looks great in the kitchen and filters work very well. Elegant, safe and odor free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Composter But Be Careful What You Put In...","review":"I bought this earlier this year and it was working out great. Then I opened it one day and found maggots inside. I stopped using it for quite awhile because it was pretty gross. I talked to a friend and she said she had the same problem. And she found that it was caused by putting eggshells in there. So just be careful if you put eggshells in and make sure the empty it right away. But other than that, it works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust Bucket","review":"This product was a real disappointment.

We loved this all winter and spring....and then fruit fly season came. We had a plastic compost bucket on our counter for years and had much less of a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Love this little can in my kitchen. We had a plastic container that filled too quickly. This can is much bigger so we don't have to empty it as often. No smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many good qualities, but one terrible flaw","review":"Initially, I loved this composter- the lid fits tightly and is easy to open with one hand. It looks OK on the counter. It is light and well designed for carrying. BUT the holes in the lid are large and it quickly became a fruit fly magnet. It was such a disappointment. I am going to go back to using a cylindrical truly airtight container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fruit Fly Nest","review":"A word of warning- the holes in the top of the bin allow fruit flies to enter and lay eggs in the carbon material. If you are not prone to fruit flies, are not squeamish about boiling the carbon to kill them or dealing with maggots than go for it. But, I would recommend a product without the top holes or a carbon insert.I had mine for about 2-3 months before I realized what was going on. Also, some people online did not notice until they had a ton (infestation) coming out of the bin when they opened it.Ew!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!","review":"I used mine for 2 months and it cracked - split! - down the side! I spent way too much for a product that lasted so short of a period of time. I am so disappointed and I can't return it for full price because it's after 30 days...RIDICULOUS! How could this happen from organic debris? Defective or simply junky. Way too much money for such a short life span. Really...wouldn't any airtight container work just as well? And you won't have to buy charcoal inserts all the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality Product","review":"We ordered this stainless steel compost pail as a durable and attractive way to store our compost scraps, replacing the plastic pail we used. On the original unit we received the lid seam split open after only a couple of weeks and had to be returned. Our second unit has now been returned because the can/pail portion of the unit split down the seam. The unit appears attractive, but the lid is not easy to use (Friction is higher than expected). I would not recommend this composter to anyone given the poor quality we have experienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I purchased this stainless (?) can two months ago and I went to empty into my composer and noticed black stains on the shelf. I took the plastic bag out and filled the pail up with water and placed it on a sheet of paper andnoticed the paper getting wet, I took a rag and washed the outside and noticed black corrosion marks. I filled the pail and the water was running out. I used plastic bags in every filling but some of the waste leaked outbut noway in just sixty days should the stainless (?) rust out. Made in China so this is just a chunk of tin sold as steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works well","review":"I used a ceramic composter for quite a while, and found this stainless steel one works much better. Material does'nt stick to it, and the top comes off/on much easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little compost pail","review":"It looks nice and holds quite a bit of veggie scraps. The only thing I don't like about it, and it's minor, is that the top has two filters in it to keep the odor down. When you take the filters out to wash the top, the water gets all caught up in the lip of the top and it is difficult to drain. I have to keep shaking it back and forth to get the water to come out. Other than that, I like it very much. It looks way better than the clear plastic tupperware container I had sitting on the counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"No smells!","review":"My only concern with this product was that there would be a smell from the composting veg before I emptied the canister. The filter in the lid keeps it all inside. I've had stuff in there for as long as a week. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great composter for the money","review":"No more disgusting smells from a composte bowl. All in a concealed stylish trash can. Every home should have one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average MW oven with poor operation manual","review":"I had this MW oven for about one year as a gift from a family member. We rarely use this unit except for reheating of food. It is lightly used in all the time that I possessed this unit. About a month ago, the light inside the compartment went off and I tried to replace the light bulb. Guess what, there is no place inside the compartment that one can access or even locate where is the light situated. I reviewed the printed manual and the Panasonic posted internet mannual words by words. Amazingly it does not even mention the light in the book throughout. I contacted Panasonic by email and get no response so far. I am truly disappointed and want give this unit a one star rating even I understand Panasonic has already discontinued marketing this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product and dishonest customer service","review":"I called JVC customer service to complain about the problems I'm having with my new system. The man acted surprised when I told him not a single CD would play and the display kept reading \\"no disc\\". He had \\"no idea what could be wrong with it\\", indicated this problem was \\"isolated\\" and had the nerve to ask me if I had dropped it. He then advised to unplug the system and wait before trying it again.Then I looked on Amazon and saw how many similar complaints have been made by others. Obviously, this is an ongoing problem which requires replacement of defective parts. The least customer service could have done was to be honest and acknowledge this defect.

Stay away from JVC and their lying team of officers: Kunihiko Sato, Masatoshi Hirabayashi, Shingo Kawata, and Keiichiro Doi.

Nearly half the book describes cooked foods. For those who have adopted a raw diet, half this book is irrelevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to live foods; delicious, imaginative meals.","review":"Excellent both as a cookbook and an introduction to live foods, macrobiotic dining, etc. Both the raw and cooked recipes are imaginative and delicious. Her tone is straightforward and empowering; she eschews the zeal often found in writings about these dietary disciplines. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for people transitioning to raw food..here's why","review":"Most of the raw recipes have about 5 ingredients, 1 of which is almost always Braggs Liquid Aminos. I've tried to like Braggs for seven years now and I just can't. It's nasty. The seasoned 100 percent raw fooder may find these palatable but to a newbie, most of the recipes will be bland AT BEST, gag worthy at worst. Like others say, there are a significant amount of cooked recipes in the book(the ones with tempeh are actually pretty good, if you're into that) so I'd say overall this is more of a macro-biotic cookbook than a raw one. I haven't used it in five years but now that I've been a raw foodist for two months, some of the recipes I wouldn't even have considered before may appeal to me. For a transitioning raw foodie, I really reccommend Jennifer Cornbleet's Raw Food Made Easy for 1 or 2 people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cook Book for Healthy Eating","review":"I know that this cook book is absolutely the best I have ever used for raw and vegatarian cuisine. I have taken quite a few of Ms. Romano's cooking classes in Key West, FL and this cook book has all of those recipes and much more. The delicious and easy to follow step by step recipes make this book a MUST HAVE for anyone looking to lead a healthier lifestyle. I recommend this as a gift for anyone to give to someone they know who enjoys great tasting food - even if they are not a vegetarian. It has everything from salads and appetizers to the most luscious desserts. When you buy this book buy 2 - one for yourself and one for someone else. They will thank you for it again and again - I am positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Raw Vegan","review":"Be careful with this book... if you're looking for a book with just raw recipes this isn't a good choice.

The title is just too misleading. Half the recipes are cooked, thereby destroying all the valuable enzymes. A Raw foods book should contain all raw recipes.

But I think this paint will help. My portrait teacher showed me this: on a slightly greenish neutral toned ground, painting very thinly with the least oil, build up darks with the OH Raw Umber. Then, using a triad of OH Cremnitz white, RU and the barok red develop the spectrum of skin. Again very thinly so the optical mixing of the toned ground can give depth in the shadows. For the lips, and interdental lines, and on the eye reds, too, try Mars violet.

Every place referenced in the text is shown on the comprehensive map which is undistorted by page joinery, lying flat when the book is opened. Discussions of materials and techniques are understandable. Every artistic expression of the Tibetan culture available to collections is covered. Tibetan history is integrated easily into the text as is Buddhist thought. Buddhism is placed historically and culturally in relation to indigenous influences and neighboring cultures, past and present. Traditions and schools are presented clearly and thoughtfully. For an introduction to Tibetan art, this is THE book. It is a supporting text, a springboard to better understanding the exhibition books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very abbreviated survey text.","review":"My main disappointment with this book is that \\"Art of Tibet\\" really turns out to mean \\"Buddhist Art of Tibet\\". Perhaps one page is spent addressing the art and culture of Tibet prior to the introduction of Buddhism.

The title suggests that this book is going to let the dog of the leash and go wild with the C language but no. The content focuses on the latest C9X standards alot and displays some examples of nice algorithms that have been thought up before by someone else. Great is your a 'strictly by the rules' programmer, but its not for me. There are many good things that can be done in C programming which are non compliant with the C9X standards, particularly inter-system processes, and these are the kind of things I would like to see published in a book of this sort.? It's a pretty basic book which whines on about standards too much and nothing like the title makes out. It focuses on what you can or can't do within the rules of the C9X standards and its quite amusing that the title contradicts the contents of the book. Another one for the charity shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend it.","review":"I found this book to be very poorly written and unsatisfactory.

He could take any standard jazz tune and make you feel as though you were hearing it for the first time.

Tracy below) and they hadn't heard of any problems with this unit -- when clearly, that's a bunch of hooey. I have given them a piece of my mind -- like the fact that my first microwave (which was a Panasonic too) lasted a gazillion years and we had to get rid of it because it was probably leaking microwaves by then. (It also weighed about 100 pounds!) The bottom line is that I'm writing a letter to the president of Panasonic and telling the big honcho what a piece of garbage this unit is, that not advising the customer service people who have to deal with people like me that there's a problem with the unit is disingenuous and that I'll never buy another Panasonic product ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great defroster, but mine died too","review":"I purchased this microwave 14 months ago from Amazon; it's seen light duty since, and it worked quite well.

It's such schmaltz that made me cringe listening to this awfully bad song. Bette even tries to approxmate sound effects during this song \\" produced \\" by Barry Manilow.

It is massively researched and well written. For me, it provides a gold mine of information in trying to trace the beginning of the enlightenment, which led to the french revolution, and has undermined Western culture ever since.However, I am concerned about Popkin's bias, which he freely admits to in the Introduction, on page xxiii. He says: \\"Like the sceptics who will considered here, i believe that doubts can be cast on any such dogmatic claims and that such claims ultimately rest on some element of faith rather than evidence.\\" This, too, is a dogmatic statement; therefore, doubt can be cast on it, and it ultimately rests on an act of faith.Popkin goes on: \\"My sympathies are on the side of the sceptics i have been studying.\\" Professor Popkin is to be congratulated for his candor, but these \\"sympathies\\" color the whole book, whether consciously or subconsciously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Wild Mushrooms","review":"Growing Wild Mushrooms is a good book for a biggining Mycologist.

However, since we are talking about horror, toss out the believeability factor. This story wasn't even engaging enough to keep my attention for long, although I did finish it. Any time you spend money on a book, you have a duty to finish it.This was like going to the dentist, though. It was literally like pulling teeth to finish this zombie tale about the living dead in downtown Dallas.Even more surprising was that the folks at Dell Abyss would publish this. The Abyss line put out some good little horror novels, like the Stephen King blurb said. However, this wasn't one of them.If you want to read a DECENT novel from Dee, try SUCCUMB.

I found the prose insulting to my intelligence, to say the least, and he loads it with profanity like a teenager saying \\"look what I can write!\\" I find it amazing that this title ever got published, let alone by Dell Abyss.

On the other hand, if you like playful orchestral music, with some electronic instruments and rock riffs in the mix, you will enjoy it.

Mathematical computation is used sparingly and then only when needed. This book is a goodblend of theory and practicality. It gives the programmer what he needs now!

They will help to clarify some specific topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please include solutions.","review":"Yes, I agree with the \\"reader from RTP, NC\\". A technical book with no solutions is worth nothing. People always LEARN from mistakes. If there are no solutions, how would people know their mistakes? Learning is up to the reader.

I have been a programmer for over 12 years, I'm used to dealing with language reference manuals, but this one takes the cake. It is full of superfluous waffle. I seems to me that a concept that could be summed up in one or two neat, concise sentences is dragged out for pages, and also, and this is the most annoying thing, said to be referred to in later chapters.After 6 weeks with this as the prescribed text for the current course that I'm doing, I've decided to go to another text."},{"rating":"1","title":"why someone give the book 5 star?","review":"this is the first algorithms book i read, this is last robert sedgewick book i read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Answers to exercises (at least half of them), please!","review":"I have decided that authors that are not willing to provide detailed solutions to at least the odd-numbered exercises are not worth reading. Why? Because first, where is the evidence that they know the answers to the exercises they present? But more importantly, how is the reader supposed to actually learn from the exercises if he can't see at least one possible solution and the rationale for that solution? This is the same reason why the Deitel & Deitel books are unacceptable. This isn't college anymore.

What has always amazed me is that once you've worked your way through an algorithm, and Sedgewick's explanation, you remember it. For me, it was, and still is, a foundation of computer science and as ready a reference today.Really liked the writing style, Sedgewick does a good job of keeping the explanation human-friendly. Face it, it's a book on algorithms, not quite a summer reading beach book. :-)All told, I put this book up with the Knuth series...btw, Sedgewick was a student of Knuth's.Enjoy, and hope it helps out as it did me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon sent me an outdated edition","review":"I know the author personally.

It contains many major errors (such as claiming that XP Home doesn't support NTFS compression or have an Administrator account) and dozens of smaller but significant errors. These errors would never have made it into the book if Microsoft had had a subject matter expert proof the book. In addition, the writing is often careless, such as when terms that should be given precise definitions are instead used haphazardly and inconsistently. It is a relatively easy read, but this is not a well-written technical book.

There were none of these type questions on the test. The book is very thorough, I've been doing this hands-on for 5+ yrs and was nice to see \\"why and how\\" things happen when I do things.

It is only when they share their secret with an elderly neighbor that Jane and Rebecca realize that they may not be the only secret princesses, with or without queen mothers, in the area. There may even be a prince or two hiding nearby.Delighted readers will realize as soon as Jane and Rebecca do, that whether or not someone remembers his or her true status, it never hurts to give them the royal treatment.Leanne Franson's charming illustrations enhance this gentle story.

The reasons it is not a great text are:1) It uses phrases such as \\"it's easily seen\\", \\"it's clear\\", and \\"obviously\\". These phrases have no business in any textbook. Period.2) There are no answers provided for any of the problems. In my class for which I have this book, we are not provided solutions, only marked up homeworks. Confidence in understanding comes from working through the material and learning from your mistakes. That's not possible if we can't figure out where we're making mistakes.

It's a shame these guys never really made it, because I think this is an excellent collection of songs that really deserved to be heard by a wider audience. In many senses, they're just a typical rock band -- not particularly ground-breaking or adventurous, but they have a sincerity that differentiates them from other rock bands.It's a clean sounding album, with catchy guitar riffs, interesting vocal melodies and thoughtful, inoffensive lyrics.

While I realize that the scale is designated for kids 3 and up, I don't imagine it is suitable for a child under 6. First, the buckets that hold the material being measured fall off of the base very easily. Second, the buckets do not move very far when there is a significant difference in the weight of the two buckets. The kids cannot discern the point of the scale for that reason. I had hoped that they would be able to put say, 3 blocks on one side and 2 blocks on the other and then be able to see that the two blocks side went up. That is not possible with this scale. The buckets have mL marks, which I suppose would be very helpful if the kids were in elementary school learning the metric system."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dream is a wish your heart makes","review":"Only CD that has the original song by Linda Ronstadt.

A field guide will tell you that a certain bird migrates through the state in the spring, but some birds migrate in March, and some in June. This book will also tell you how populous the bird is (ie. how rare it is). You can also see the general movements of resident birds in the state over seasons.I live in Wisconsin, so I use this book all the time.

Interestingly they have two selections from Woody Allen but not a single one from Bellow. I also would have liked to have seen a selection from 'The Catcher in the Rye' ( though I understand that Salinger though Halachically Jewish does not self- identify as Jewish). There are so much else that could have been in the anthology including samples of the work of the long list of great American Jewish comedians.Nonetheless there are many very enjoyable pieces in this very fine anthology."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a true Green Day fan, fanatic or anything, dont waste your money!!","review":"As like everyone else, i was super excited about this DVD. i got the express shipping and everything.

Schreck depends on compilations of other people's works, adding nothing new. Were I Charlie M., I'd be a little pissed that he had launched his career on my back and giving nothing in return. He, Aquino, and Flowers owe their identities to Anton LaVey, yet feign blindness to his brilliance, lest they pale by comparison to the truly creative spirit of LaVey. Schreck's writing is about as insightful as his music--NOT! He adds nothing to the body of work already in place on Satanism in the cinema.Open wide the gates of Hell, and toss the bum out!Hugo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Nuker","review":"Right size, works well but this is a replacement of the exact same model that actually kept running when I opened the door.

I spoke to the last repairman, who said that he looked diligently for the short that caused the fuse to fail but could not find it.What disturbs me is the attitude of Panasonic.

If you like Power Rangers (or hate them) this is a must-see.

Parodying anime's hero team genre, Shinesman is a five-member team charged with protecting the Earth (i.e., Tokyo) from all evils. Hiroya, the main character, draws upon his affection for his young (and far too understanding) brother to give him the strength needed to conduct battle.This is a great, fun title to watch. However, there are several semi-serious flaws. First, virtually ALL Japanese text has been covered up with English translations. Second, while it is nice to not have closing credits after the first episode and opening credits preceding the second episode, the Shinesman commercial bridging the two episodes goes beyond zany to the absolute idiotic. These are the reasons why I can only rate this a \\"4\\" overall.Unfortunately, the series ends far too nicely - it would be nice to have a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"one song only!","review":"this is one sorry excuse for a cd! one song...\\"Tighter,Tighter\\" worth listening to. but a good song from the past. shows they have talent, but choose not to even bother. this should be a 2.99 bargain basement deal. no other song on the thing is event decent! and i paid 13.99 for this? save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy Pop Tune","review":"A great little song for its time.

Then, when the movie began to TRULY fall apart, they decided to bill it as an ode to \\"a movie that's falling apart\\". Suddenly, everything that happens is \\"tongue in cheek\\", and the formerly serious acting \\"actors\\" begin to speak almost directly to the audience by looking directly into the camera.

I believe many woman may not like this book because it gives away many of their dating and manipulating secrets and puts the male back in the dating driver's seat!

That guy can get women without even opening his mouth because he's that good looking. I don't care how \\"bad\\" he thinks he is with girls. He can tell them he likes lunchmeat and they'll be all over him. Basically what I learned is that you get girls by being born with the skill. No amount of teachings will ever help.

And also, I noticed in the begginning of the book, Thalia and her sisters said things like \\"cool\\" and \\"blame game\\",which I'm SURE isn't accurate. And no, they didn't learn them from other High-schoolers. They said them before they even met any people from earth.

Squirells bring her food like little tranced-out slaves and she some how is some sort of gardening guru (but I thought she didn't cultivate food- what?).Spiritual enlightenment is not achievable through this horrendous excuse for a book.

I also find his views about gender-based generalization of attitudes and women as objects of male desire (the \\"men act and women appear\\" passage) somewhat offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAYS of SEEdING confusion","review":"Critics such as Berger are harmful to the cause of art. His writing is totally incomprehensible. I teach art, and therefore would expect to know what he's talking about -- but I haven't a clue. Art critics need to stop writing for EACH OTHER and start to speak the language of the common person. No wonder people feel stupid when it comes to discussing art (modern art in particular) -- the critics speak in a language that is alien to most everyone except themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent study of the power of visual discourse.","review":"I must agree that this is an excellent book. It is not only a wonderful series of essays on art, but a landmark study of the ideological function of visual discourse. Berger \\"shows\\" how the framing of visual images shapes the viewer's perception of those images and of what they attempt to represent. Chapters two and three, on \\"ways of seeing women\\", are especially powerful illustrations of how particular attitudes are reflected in visual representations and of how those attitudes are reaffirmed for the viewer. Berger's argument is that discourse -- visual in this case -- is never purely objective, but is always reflective of a particular way of seeing the world. This is not to say that we should attempt to overcome our particular ways of seeing -- which cannot be done. It is instead a call to be aware of the ways of seeing to which we have become accustomed, and which we reproduce in our own lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Joking?","review":"What a farce!

I was amazed that after the first couple of incoherent chapters, the samples are almost entirely comprised of seductive naked women. I think the author would revel in the artistic freedom now available now on www.youporn.com. This book teaches nothing concerning seeing, art or aesthetics. My copy goes in the trash.

This is truly one of the better film representations of Papa's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two \\"must haves\\" for any video collection","review":"Labyrinth seems to be suited more for a younger audience than The Dark Crystal. There is singing, dancing, amusing sidekicks, a simple plot, and even some lessons learned. Still, this movie is popular among all age groups, even if to poke fun at some of the dramatics.The Dark Crystal is a classic good against evil tale. Though it uses puppets, the theme is darker and more violent than Labyrinth. I've watched younger kids close their eyes, or get scared during some of the \\"scary\\" scenes. I think what's great about this movie is that it keeps on moving, you're never stuck in the same place for too long, as the characters are always on the go.This collection presents two movies that are similar only in the fact that puppets are used in both. Based on your age, the mood of each movie will vary greatly. Still, these are great films, and classics that will be around forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kimhi's Hebrew Grammar","review":"This book is a classic.

I know because I have one and Fontana's command of the instrument is quite awesome. I wish I could play like that but it takes many years of practice plus an innate talent. This album testifies to both these requirements as well as being a delight for listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donald Duck Going' Quackers","review":"Going Quackers is an amazingly 3-D game. This game is similiar to Croc: Legend of the Gobbos. The difficulty level is challenging but not too hard. A nice affect to the game is that sometimes you look at Donald from the side view and sometimes in back of him. It's fun to have Donald jump and bounce his way through twenty levels. Not only does Goin' Quackers improve hand-eye coordination it has strategy involved. You have to look for items that might help you through parts of different levels. Donald Duck is very well animated and realistic. However, the game sometimes crashes therefore barely reaching a five-star review. If you're thinking about buying this game, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"betty boop 12\\" glamour doll","review":"this doll is so cute, you won't make a mistake by buying it,this was very well packaged, the dolls dress and shoes are made of a shiny silk,the doll is very glamours, just like she is ready to go to a fancy outing, the bottom of the dress and the cuffs and shawl are made of fluffy soft fur,"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a book about low cost travel(Especially hitchhiking)","review":"This is a really cool book.

It would even rapidly switch between open and closed, forcing me to disable the \\"answer calls on cell phone open\\" feature so it didn't answer phone calls and then immediately hang up on them. It didn't help that this 'protection' did not prevent the 8200's hinge from breaking, either.

When a request from my daughter for an eagle to complete a wildlife display was received, I wasn't sure I could find one the right size, etc. so was very pleased when I found such a good selection on Amazon.

She's a triple-threat: can't sing, can't play the guitar, and has not a scrap of understanding of most of the songs. Her reputation is based on glowing second-hand reports from other 60's folkies.

I like this kind of book format; however, some stories will leave you wondering about the sanity of the very authors themselves. For example, there was a reference that the famous \\"John Wayne\\" was an active participant at the Alamo. I read the paragraph in which this occurred several times and decided that the author was just making an intellectual joke . . . but I speculate that the reader 100 or so years from now may think that the author was a complete idiot that only learned history from made-for-tv movies. Another author belittled the human cost of the plague in 1300s Europe by stating that it ONLY affected 3 out of 4 people. You may have purchased the book to discover some history, but you are also discovering something about how people interpret history as well. Although this book is easy reading in a short-story format, maybe the bedside table isn't the right place for it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best kind of childrens book","review":"I would like to see this book back in print because it is the sweet and simple story of friendship (and love).

I think the production on \\"Kuruption!\\" was a little unbalanced. The Daz Dillinger-produced tracks are the best ones. And guest production by Dr. Dre, that's good. REAL good.Kurupt is one of the best MC's of all time. I've been down with him ever since I heard him on \\"The Chronic\\" and \\"Doggystyle\\".The West coast-disc was the best of the two CD's on \\"Kuruption!\\". Kurupt sounds like he should do on it. The East coast-disc is not that good, a couple of songs, but not all of them.If you're into Kurupt, you gotta have this album. He deserves 5 stars for his lyrical skills alone. However, the somewhat uneven production on this album reduces the rating to 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS NIGGA IS TOP DOG IN MY BOOK!!","review":"THIS CD IS DEFINITLY WORTH BUYING.

The West Coast disc was more entertaining, but the East Coast CD had good cuts also. Kupurt has good flow, but who in the hell are these other guys on here? My favorite tracks were: West Coast- \\"This One's For U\\", \\"Make Some Noize\\", \\"We Can Freak It\\", \\"Fresh\\", \\"C-Walk\\", \\"Can't Let That Slide\\", and \\"Ask Yourself a Question\\"(which was produced by Dr.Dre). East Coast- \\"It's A Set Up\\", \\"Light S*** Up\\", \\"Gimmewhutchagot\\", \\"No Feelings\\", and \\"We Can Freak it Out (remix)\\" featuring Noreaga.

His first album went two times platinum, and was very well received. Then, he drops an even better second release. Do you know how hard that is to do? Most sophomore albums are wack as hell. Kurupt just keeps getting better. His flow is a lot more versatile than it was(although it was still great back then), and on tracks like \\"We Can Freak It\\", \\"The Life\\", \\"It's A Set Up\\", \\"C-Walk\\", and \\"Fresh\\", he proves that. This album was good from start to finish. I highly recommend that all hip-hop heads get \\"Kurupted\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of all time.","review":"Kurupt is one of the best to ever pick up a microphone, and he shows that on this album. \\"It's A Set Up\\", \\"Light Sh** Up\\", \\"The Life\\", \\"C-Walk\\", and \\"That's Gangsta\\" are the best songs. Kurupt's sophmore album shows immense maturity from when he was on his first album.

The music is absolutly horrible! If you are expecting the old doggpound rap and beats you won't find it. The best song is \\"we can freak it\\". everything else seems thrown together. You would think a rapper who rapped with the best of them (dr.dre,snoop,the legendary tupac,outlaws)would definetly rip a mic in peices. Instead it seems since tupac died kurupt and other rappers feel the need to pretend they want to unite east and west coast.

This book is more than a recounting of the Senator's life. It also provides thoughtful and moving political analysis of Wellstone's work and achievements. Abraham Joshua Heschel, the noted Jewish philosopher, historian and social reformer, said shortly before his own death that we must \\"Know that every deed counts, that every word is power...Above all, remember that you must build your life as if it were a work of art.\\" Paul Wellstone's life was such a work of art and Bill Lofy shows us why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney's James And The Giant Peach","review":"This is a great soundtrack, it's fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nutty Squirrel","review":"This was bought as a Christmas gift for an adult who is \\"nuts\\" about anything having to do with squirrels.

I don't think there has ever been a more talented man. When you look at his work over the past 20 years, it's breathtaking. And while I love everything he's done, from The Little Mermaid to Beauty and the Best, Aladdin, Pocahontas, and more, The Hunchback of Notre Dame is a masterpiece. I have played classical piano my whole life, collect soundtracks, classical cds, etc. and this is one of, if not the best I've heard. \\"God Help the Outcasts\\" is maybe the best song Alan ever wrote... just beautiful. It should be way easier to find this soundtrack! Especially with so much crap on the market! I can't recommend this cd enough. In fact, start collecting Alan's music... you seriously can't go wrong!

Both sung by Clopin... Half of these songs made a shiver go up my spine and I think I giggled a couple of times... My favorite Disney Movie. EVER.

I love hearing my favorite songs from the park over and over. It's the one CD that my kids even enjoy listening to. (Even my 13 year old!) My 10 year old's favorite is the Ballad of Davey Crockett and Haunted Mansion Theme Song. He has them both memorized. We even listened to it this winter when it was snowing outside, to remind us of our summer vacation to WDW, and to give us something to look forward to next summer. It is a must for any Disney Fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great interpretatons in a listenable contemporary style!","review":"Let's keep it short & sweet. This is a fantastic sounding collection of the park tunes. I believe those who discount the recording are not in touch with the intent of the artists. The purpose of the record is to provide an artist's interpretation of a song, not to reproduce it exactly as you remember it. This is a fantastic way for us theme park buffs to keep the magic alive during the times we can't be there to enjoy it first hand, and on that level, it succeeds. Standout cut for me is David Benoit's \\"Spectromagic Medley\\"-it shimmers just like the parade! My advice is-enjoy the spirit of the album without being concerned that the artist didn't hit every note exactly like the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth getting!","review":"This CD is defintely not worth buying. The only track worth anything is the Grim Grinning Ghosts. The pirate song was done by the Pointer Sisters & the other songs were equally mangled.

It reminds me of both times my family and I went to Walt Disney World. I lost the cassette tape years ago, and I was surprised to find this album on CD, so I had to order it. The renditions of classic Disney songs are fantastic. Olivia Newton-John's rendition of \\"Part of Your World\\" is just beautiful. The Disney Big Band medley of \\"The Mickey Mouse Club\\" and \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\" reminds me of my recent trip to WDW. And, \\"Remember the Magic\\" as sung by Brian McKnight always brings joyful tears to my eye. Highly recommended by me to any Disney fan out there. It's well worth the money. Now I have something relaxing to listen to while doing homework in my small college dorm room."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Very disappointing CD, obviously catering to some specific audience only. Nothing worthwhile until track 8. Then, I have to admit, the CD is excellent. If you're willing to spend the money for 1/2 a CD then go for it. The music after track 7 has some of my fondest memories of the park wrapped up in it. Unfortunately, tracks 1-7 turned me off so badly that I didn't even GET to tracks 8 and up until a year after I bought the CD originally!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!","review":"We bought this in Florida to remind us of our holiday.

I was born and raised in Anaheim CA so I always loved Disney. From the title I really thought it was the original songs, but alas it was not.

Avoid this if you want to hear the original songs from Disney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable if you want the traditional Disney tunes.","review":"I thought this would be a nice alternative to the original scores but most of the artists have mangled the music and most of the songs are not recognizable unless you are following along with the words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically just for Collectors","review":"I bought this CD because I'm a big POINTER SISTERS fan and wanted their one song on here to complete my collection. I enjoy their song, and I view this CD as basically one for die hard fans to complete their discographies of the recording artists who are on this CD. Fans of OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN, LINDA RONSTADT, BARENAKED LADIES, POINTER SISTERS, PATTI AUSTIN , and the rest will probably just want their one song each just for their collection. I'm not a big fan of Disney songs. This CD is okay, not great. Probably the biggest goof is TIM CURRY doing THE BALLAD OF DAVY CROCKETT. He intentionally mocks the song with ad-libs & lines not in the original version. Surprising how they actually put it on this CD. I guess Disney purists will not like the new arrangements of most of these songs. Just for die-hards & completists, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged a lot","review":"For some reason, this book seemed to take forever to read. It just doesn't get that exciting.

The only difference between his work and those of other gossip mongers in our nation's periodicals is that the latter know how to write a coherent sentence, properly punctuated and generally void of misspellings. Of course, they must submit to the discipline of editors and they usually write for reputable publishers who demand that quotations be checked, that facts be accurate and that documentation be provided.

Turns out the local DIY stores don't sell an \\"extension\\" Had to mate 2 hoses and several connectors together but installation is complete. The old feeds on the old faucet were easily twice a long. This is a surprising problem. Unless the distance from you faucet to your hot/cold taps are 10 inches or less I wouldn't buy this. That said it looks nice and it works now. Still only 2 stars for leaving the feeds so short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, good quality","review":"We returned a different make and model to a local bog box store - too much plastic, too flimsy and lightweight.

After several weeks of use, very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hot or cold water","review":"I've had this fauce for three months and I cannot get hot or cold water out of it. I get warm and cool water only. I believe this is because there is only about a 40 degree radius on the handle. In other words, the handle doesn't go far enough left to get hot water or far enough right to get cold water. This is not a problem with any of the other nine faucets in my home. I called Kohler and they sent me a replacement part that has the exact same radius as the vave I already have, so obviously the problem lives on. I am hopeful that Kohler will find a way to resolve this otherwise this is a lot of money down the drain - no pun intended. I agree with the other comments about the less-than-adequate stream water flow. Spray flow is fine, but can't be used for everything.

It should be required in all high schools as well. Well written, well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"masterful account; mistitled","review":"This is not so much a study of FDR as of his senior people, with the character sketches of Eisenhower, Nimitz, King, and Arnold-- and especially Marshall-- being the most rewarding. His judgment is consistently fair and he offers an excellent, if incomplete, history of the grand strategy of the two major theaters, in addition to elucidating some the practical dilemmas facing FDR and his team in building and supplying a vast war machine, almost from scratch. Learn too how FDR used the New Deal to build two aircraft carriers and almost by dictat order the re-creation of an air force on the verge of war. FDR's judgments in personnel decisions (aside perhaps from his machiavellian relationship with MacArthur) raise him to a level of shrewdness approaching genius, in elevating Marshall, and then in elevating Eisenhower to Supreme Allied Commander.

Those episodes probably seem so subpar because they are packaged with two absolute classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and rich","review":"Cowboy Bebop combines the classic Wild West with what was best about the 70s. What was best about the 70s, you ask? Ok, not much, but listen to the soundtrack to Cowboy Bebop and you'll know what I mean. The intro animation itself is reminiscent of something close to Charlie's Angels.Muscle car and Soul Train references aside, Cowboy Bebop is one of the most richly animated series I've ever seen. It balances serious plots with humorous ones and sometimes combines the two for an enhanced effect.My only complaint is that I would have liked to witness more episodes detailing Spike's past with Julia. There just isn't enough of that story, the one that interests me the most.But there must be something about this series that never leaves my mind.

I hated it. I've very much enjoyed other books by this author, but this offering leaves me cold.The interesting setting held my attention for awhile, but then it faded away.

It all comes to head (pun intended) with a pitiful resolution.WeT wastes Nick Mancuso in a tale about a deadly mermaid.

Mox Nix was a bit rawer hardcore wise and had one Harry Bowles on vocals who sadly R.I.P. is no longer with us. Plain Wrap! on the other hand is the more seasoned brew on this disc. Don Burnet does both vocal and guitar duties on these tracks and Dave Mellow before joining Uniform Choice plays bass guitar. The CD is worth all your greasy pennies alone for the anthem opener \\"This is Punk Rock!\\" and it sure was Don. The Plain Wrap! tracks are my heroes on this disc.

Would recommend this to anybody for price though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bouncer","review":"This bouncer definitely cradles the baby and better than the Papasan. My daughter is 5 weeks old and I have used it for weeks with her. The only problems is the headreast only holds her head too far forward, it doesn't support her head. I actually use it to place under her bottom because the seat sinks in a lot for a baby her size, so placing the headrest under her helps her not sink so far down and kink her neck too far forward. Other than that I love the bouncer and my daughter naps in it and is very comfortable. And it is really cute. I did have the same problem as a previous reviewer with the covers to the rubber foot support spinning."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a happy little baby","review":"I bought this bouncer for my granddaughter before she was born. She was little (5lbs. 12 ozs.) at birth and this seat was not contoured for her size...something that was not made clear in the box info. But as she has grown and now six weeks later and weighing almost 8 lbs. it still is not comfortable. It has a very deep center and she sinks in and cannot stretch her legs or her body. I think it may be more appropriate for a bigger baby and hopefully she will be more comfortable in it in the future. But I was really disappointed at the quality and technology of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy Customer","review":"I bought this bouncer for my daughter. At first I was excited because it is pretty in pink (it's difficult to find anything in pink). Within the first days, I began to struggle with the adjusters, they get stuck. It's really frustrating trying to switch the positions. The bars that hold the seat up are very flimsy, it actually broke with my daughter in it, and she was only 10 pounds. Oh, and it doesn't really vibrate. Needless to say, I had to buy my daughter another bouncer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned this product TWICE","review":"Very cute bouncer, but my husband and I had to return this product back to the store twice . . . and our baby isn't even born yet.

Needless to say, we're going with a different bouncer."},{"rating":"1","title":"so cute so useless","review":"I purchased this unit because my daughter was small and I thought it would cradle her.

The 2 stars are for the looks but overall not a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this product because I thought the pink was beautiful and the features seemed great. Also with the name \\"Carters\\" I did not think I could go wrong. Right after we put the bouncer together our older child bumped against the toy bar and broke the plastic piece that holds it on. We have since found out that Carters does not even make this product, another company does and Carters puts their name on it. The manufacturer sells/provides NO replacement parts for ANYTHING on this bouncer. The toy bar is not repairable nor is it replaceable. So now I have a bouncer that is a nice sleeping spot for now but will provide no play/entertainment later on. As easily as this piece broke by an older child a younger child could break it even easier. Don't waste the money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks pretty...but that's about it!","review":"I received this bouncer for my baby shower. I registered for it because it was \\"Carters\\" and because it was one of the only pink items I could find for my awaited baby girl. The blanket that comes attached to the bouncer tore, and the vibration did not work. It would make noise, but there was barely a slight vibration. No matter how many times I changed the batteries, the bouncer did not work properly. The music is loud, the nature sounds are anything but \\"natural\\", and the toys are basic in comparison to other quality bouncers I have seen since registering for this one. I returned the product. Although this is (as of right now) the only pink bouncer on the market, I would HIGHLY suggest purchasing a better quality item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Bouncer!","review":"My daughter was never comfortable in the bouncer that we originally had for her.

I wrote to the company and called several times and they have not responded! To make matters worse my seat ripped the first time I washed it on GENTLE CYCLE in cold water.

I'm no Tony Martin hater; Cross Purposes is probably my 3rd favorite of all their albums, and frankly the band has never had a bad singer (I even liked Seventh Star and Born Again), but this album is just horrible. There is no energy or chemistry at all on this record. Even Technical Ecstasy had some listenable moments, but after one listen through this abominable album it sat on my shelf untouched for years until I needed some space and sold it back to the music shop for about a buck... yeah, I ripped off the store for a buck, because this album isn't even worth spending a penny on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Won't Cry For You","review":"the only song that i still play is I Won't Cry For You , this is why i still have the tape, this is a song that before the mp3 time i had to buy the tape for, Ice-T sukz on this album, he was on top of his game untill the mid 90s, many fans hate this cd just cause its called black sabbath if it was with another name it would had came out and gone without any one knowig of its existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORBIDDEN TO LISTEN","review":"This CD is forbidden to listen, because it is forbidden the sad decline SABBATH went into after the OZzy / Dio days.

It's a shocking example of how the mighty Black Sabbath fell. The only good thing about this album is that it did so poorly, it finally paved the way for the original Sabbath reunion. This album is so bad it makes me angry to even see it on the shelf in my CD collection. Maybe the worst major metal band release ever, far worse than Kiss \\"Unmasked\\", or Metallica's \\"St. Anger\\". Black Sabbath should offer a cash buyback program and destroy all known copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"an embarassment","review":"How can you call this Black sabbath?! I find everything about this album dissapointing. The only original member left is Tony. There's no Ozzy, no Geezer, and no Bill Ward. As for the actual musical aspect of this garbage, It's worse! How can Iomii let Ernie C from Body count produce? How can he let Ice T rap? if you're gonna do something experimental like that, don't do it on the first track. It kind of ruined the whole album for me. Also, there is no memorable Iomii riffs on here. Plus way too much techno, electronic stuff. And by the way, tony martin has nowhere near the talent of Ozzy. Please, please, please don't let this be the last Sabbath studio album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total disgrace to the sabbath legend!","review":"Do not be fooled this cd is not a masterpeice, it is not even average, this cd is a load of cheesy cornball music.

I bought this in a pawn shop and still felt ripped off. Ice-T on a Sabbath album? I don't know, on his album 'Rhyme Pays' he samples just about every song from 'Paranoid' so maybe Tony decided he owed Sabbath a favor. Whatever the reason behind Ice-T's appearance, it failed miserably. He only appeared on one song, but it set the tempo for the rest of the album that never really went anywhere. First of all we have Tony Martin again, the faceless, generic singer that Sabbath hires when their stuck and can't get Dio, Cozy does a decent job drumming, but it's played against watered down bass tracks. The only thing accurate about this ablum was the cover. It was a cartoonish attempt and should be 'Forbidden'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain terrible minus a couple spots","review":"I couldn't believe how bad this album was when I first bought it. It has grown on me a little bit, as I grew to really like the last two songs, but nearly everything before it is terrible. Tony Martin's vox are atrocious on this release. However, I heard that the management told him to sing this way to sound more \\"grunge.\\" If you are a die hard fan, buy it for the last two songs. The final track has a tinge of TYR in the change, but just for a second. Sabbath said that this was an album that was written and recorded to get out of a contract obligation, and it sounds it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a shell of it's former self","review":"I remember when Black Sabbath was cutting edge and daring. When a new album came out, it was a mini-event. But after a series of forgettable albums, the band has lost all of it's edge. When I first heard Forbidden, I thought I was listening to some lame band who was obviously influenced by Sabbath, but didn't have the knack to write the songs. When I found out it really was Black Sabbath, I picked up a copy of the disk to give it another try. Sadly, this is just awful. The Ice-T appearance does not help or hurt this disk, simply because his rap is buried in \\"Illusion of Power\\", an unlistenable song that does not sound like Black Sabbath. The riffs are repetitive, the drum work is generic and lyrics are awful. The only bright spot on the disk is the tune \\"Rusty Angel\\" which hints at this bands former greatness, but can't hold a candle to their 70's & 80's material. Only buy this thing if you are a die-hard fan who needs every album."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly cover!","review":"i bought this album brand new for only 7 or 8 bucks and i liketo think i got my moneys worth! i really have no use for barelyany SABBATH album after BORN AGAIN, with the possible exceptionof THE ETERNAL IDOL, which definitely has some good songs on it!FORBIDDEN has two very good things going for it; the cover isprobably their funniest ever, right next to SABOTAGE! I like thedrawing on it and how silly the band members look! I also quitelike the opening track on it, ILLUSION OF POWER. Featuring aguest appearance by ICE T, this song has more character and per-sonality than any song they'd done in a while. It also has TONYMARTIN'S best vocal on it, along with another very powerfulguitar riff from IOMMI. The rest of this I could really do with-out; it's not that it's really that bad, it's just not that in-teresting, even tho' the production is very good and loud. Mostof this is just standard TONY IOMMI heavy metal. nothing specialat all, tho' the first track is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"This is the most weak and unfinished work by the greatest band in the world.

After the triumph of TYR and DEHUMANIZER it's hard to believe that Black Sabbath would come out with something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forbidden Means Literal!","review":"I bought this one when it first came out, but, man, this is horrible! The only songs even able to measure up are \\"Illusion of Power\\" and \\"Won't Cry for You\\", and even they aren't the best. The others range from borderline mediocre to Three-Stooges-on-crack quality. \\"Can't get close enough to you 'cause you're just too far away?\\" DUH! (bang your head against the table... bang your head against the table... bang your head against the table...) Tony Martin sounds like he has strep throat, Tony Iommi's guitar sounds uncharacteristically palsied, and Neil Murray's bass was better when he played with Whitesnake. The only bright spot to this album is Cozy Powell's drums, which keep up a relentless assault on your eardrums until they bleed. Now, I must ask the question \\"What were they thinking?\\" Better yet \\"What weren't they thinking?\\" It makes for a shorter list."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Okay\\"...but nowhere near Cross Purposes or Headless Cross..","review":"Forbidden in my opinion just wasn't all that great, and even a majority of the die-hard Tony Martin-Sabbath fans skip over this one or just burn the one of two good tracks from the cd onto cassette or cdrs. First off, the production was horrible. The production alone kills off whatever power we might have heard coming out of Cozy Powell's drum unit, who many say was Sabbath's most talented skinsman. There ARE a few standout tracks like Rusty Angels, I Would Die For You, Kiss Of Death and Loser Gets It All. Other than that, moreso than not this is worth skipping over. Tony Martin has had far better vocal days as in the previous albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad really","review":"thoughts on listening to _Forbidden_:great riff...pity about the singer...is that a drum machine?...is there any bass on this record at all?....Ice-T even sounds weak here.i never bothered w/ post-_Born Again_ Sabbath, until a morbid curiousity drove me to purchase this one.Black Sabbath is God.this isn't Black Sabbath.1 star for some riffs that deserved better. 1 star out of pity for the fallen god."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. horrible, terrible.","review":"I liked the Eternal Idol, loved Headless Cross and didnt mind Tyr.

I couldnt rate it a zero because the lowest you can go is 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, but not Terrible!!","review":"This is one of the weaker entries for Sab, but certainly not the worst i.e. Born Again being the worst. This album has some redeeming qualities, but not many Illison of Power was a decent track feat. Ice-T. That track had somewhat of a throwback to earilier Sabbath, being that it was dark and gloomy sounding. Kiss of Death was a pretty good track featuring some hard driving guitar by Iommi. Guilty as Hell as was another track I liked off the album. All in all this album suffers from bad production sound and poor writting in most of the tracks, but still much better than some of the music out there today. Recommended only for true Black Sabbath fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"As a long time fan of the band I was very disappointed in this album, as I have always loved Sabbath material with Tony Martin. Cross Purposes was a good album but the follow up here is not even close. The loss of Geezer and the addition of Dave Murray and even Cozy Powell doesn't help. Aside from the tracks \\"Rusty Angels\\" and \\"Forbidden\\" I find that this album has less to offer than previous Sabbath lp's. For the most part the muscianship is good and Tony's solo's are decent but most of the music sounds tired and thrown together. There doesn't appear to be the chemistry in the songwriting that was present in this previous incarnation of the band (HC/Tyr era). It is a decent rock record but definately the worst that Sabbath has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Bad As the Few Say","review":"Do I think it's a 5? No. But I just want to balance out the \\"Awful\\" reviews. Quite frankly, if you like the Tony Martin era, of the five albums, this might rank third. It's got a bit too much lighter stuff for me. The darker stuff, including \\"Shaking Off the Chains\\" (GREAT) and \\"Illusion of Power\\" (yes, the Ice T collaboration was cool, despite what anyone might say... it's not like he's rapping on this song... don't forget Body Count, folks) have an old doom Sabbath feel. The Tony Martin-Sabbath era, in my opinion, is underrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"tai chi fan","review":"I bought this product because it had good ratings,HOWEVER, it was awful.

Apparently he was reasonably sober (alcohol-wise) on these dates as his playing is very sure and clean. He almost sounds a little mechanical at times as he races through a stock selection of his favorite tunes, but the sheer virtuosity is breathtaking. He seems almost oblivious of the accompaniment, which is fortunate in that they're not of the highest caliber. The rendition of Embraceable You is particularly stunning. A few snippets of conversation with the MC add to the ambience. The recording quality is good. Anyone who likes Bird and modern jazz will enjoy this offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this waiter's corkscrew hoping it would be easier to use than the cheap one I bought during my last visit to a winery.Unfortunately, this corkscrew fails in every way.

Me and my friends dont talk about periods and bras because pretty much every 6th grader wears a bra and half of us dont even know about menstruation!! And Nancy, Gretchen and Janie and Margaret are all stupid, mean people who want to be like everybody else and I dont think you want your child to think like that because then theyll start doing drugs since everyone else is.

It's bad enough discussing it in Health class.Besides, who wants to grow up that fast? I am 12 and probably wil never want to be grown up, and when I am an adult, I'll probably act like a kid. I mean, woulddn't you rather play some sports or go to the movies with your friends, or play outside or with toys than dream about sex with 11 year old boys?

This book was totally unrealistic. It was supposed to be a realistic view of a sixth grader. WRONG!!! I don't know any girl my age who would make such a big deal over getting a stupid bra. I did, however, like the parts about the boys and Margaret struggling with religion. If Judy Blume were to write a book strictly about this, I'd be first in line to buy it!!! Too bad it was ruined by everything else. Also, at my school, a period is just something you get and life moves on.Please, if you want a realistic view of a sixth grader, read something like It's Not the End of the World, or Blubber.

That is where I will go to purchase it for my daughter again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very fictional book","review":"First of all, this book is quite unrealistic. I remember when I had my first period. I did not freak out like the girl in this book. It scares some children who read it to think that it will actually be like that. Alsoher friends were very inapropriate. Most normal sixth graders, even now, do not talk about the sort of things of which the group of girls in the story did.

It's Me, Margaret is honestly one of the worst books that I have ever read. This book tries to teach young adolescents about growing up...Helpful, right? Wrong!!! The characters displayed in the story that young girls are supposed to relate to are mean, stupid people who all want to be exactly like everyobody else. Is this how you want your child to act? My advise is to give the book to her to read if you must, but to tell her \\"it's okay...I don't think you're as dumb as these people\\". I read the book as a twelve-year-old because my doctor recommended it to me, and my first thought was that I hoped she didn't think I was like the girls in the story. Adolescents need to know that there is more to life than whether or not you have a bra; this book teaches just the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was TERRIBLE, unrealistic, and stereotypical.","review":"Okay, who really acts like Margaret? I mean seriously, I know of no one. Yeah, sure I really hated growing up and all, but whats up with the club? There really wasn't a story to it, besides questioning religion. Which I think would offend many parents that their kids would start questioning their religion. Margaret was only in 6th grade.....she was unhealthily obsessed. When I was that age, I was a kid...... and I still am at 13. It seems that the people today just want kids to grow up faster and faster. In 6th grade, I played basketball,soccer,softball,etc. I had fun with friends, but this is really giving girls a false image. And to all the boys who read this, \\"girls are not that stupid\\". Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not realistic","review":"\\"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret\\", in my opinion, is an unrealistic study of a pubescent girl. It seems obsolete and dull and the issues described are not personal and truthful. I am 13, and know what these things are like. I can't relate to the characters and their instabilities. I myself do not attend church and have never experienced problems similar to those Margaret endured. The young girls in the story are foolish and very tense about maturing. I can imagine real people to be somewhat like them, but no people my age I know. I find soothing books to be fantasy, not books about a foolish girl's problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why in the world does she presume that girls are like this?","review":"I think that this book is neither believable or touching.

Margaret is a stupid ignorant girl who is way too excited about being sick every month. (a.k.a., getting her period.) You would think she would dread this moment, but she's so eager to \\"grow up\\", and she and her stupid friends form a club just for talking about puberty and crushes.

It was full of silly, schoolgirlish scenarios and immature views that I just could not get my head around.

From now on, I will stick to the Hardy Boys. They never dissapoint me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-Warming Delight","review":"I recommend this book to any girl. This book is good for the female sex because it's about the changes girls go through. This book was a touching and heart-warming delight. This book could help a lot of girls because it could help with problems that girls have. Margaret tells God that she wants a bra and tells him about how the girls are getting bras for the club. \\"I told my mom I want a bra.\\" Most girls go through the same changes and they don't know it. They think that they are the only ones going through the change. Like Margaret she thinks she's not normal and she wants to be like everyone else, but really she is she's just going through her changes. \\"I want to be like everyone else.\\" In conclusion if you are a young girl going though the changes of life then you would enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely one of the best books.","review":"This book was probably the best book I will ever read.

I have recommended it to many friends. Blume has a humorous and disarming way of presenting real-life issues in the lives of pre-adolescent girls. My daughter and I have enjoyed reading this book together and have had many meaningful and delightful conversations as a result of this book. I am particularly pleased with the way the issue of G-d and religious choice has been addressed. Our girls face many choices in their lives, some religion based and some not. Reading this book together has given my daughter and I yet another opportunity to discuss our committment to Judiasm as well as our moral and ethical beliefs and foundation.

This book the whole time tells about a girl that is going through puberty.

When I read it Judy Blume became my favorite author. Now I have read most of Judy Blume's books and i think Are You There God It's me Margaret is one of the best. I am like many of Judy Blume's characters in her books for example I am like Margaret because i am in the sixthe grade, I am 12 and I am an only child.

Matagret is a sixth grade girl who is flat, and is wrorried she'll never grow. This is sixth grade! And it's not like all her friends are bra-wears; they have the same \\"problems\\". Her \\"crush\\" is the cutest and meanest boy in class: she doesn't want to like the nice guy who has a crush on her because her friends hate him. She and her mom are best friends, and the most un-realustic deal: she's imature, flat, never kissed, and doesn't have her period at the beging of the book, and by the end all has passed. Please. Also, it seems as though Judy Blume has tried to cram every single thing that happens in puberty in this book and it drags. Don't read this book if you're looking for real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This book was extremely old.

I thought that it was a good book to read because it confronts the issues that many young teens and pre-teens feel. 'When should I start wearing deordorant?' A comical question but one I'm sure we've all asked. Boys, school, friends, everything you need. I can relate to Margaret because she goes to her friends for information instead of her mom.

Margaret and her friends founded a club,gushed about boys,and worried about growing up like many of their real contemporaries. And Margaret's relationship with God was interesting. Although I didn't understand at the time why she was so impatient to wear a bra and get her period,the book helped me when I went through these rites of passage. I reccomend it to preteens to teach them about puberty,and teenagers and adults so we can reminisce about our childhoods through Margaret's adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I think that Judy Blumes books are so good.

It is a great book! I love this book because it is all about a girl's preteen stage. No offense, but boys probably would not relate to this book. The main character, Margaret, had troubles with her life. She was the new kid in town and she met some girls but didn't really feel comfortable with them. She counted on God to make her troubles fade by the power of prayer. I like how she was not afraid to speak up to someone about what she feels in her heart. Margaret needed help and she needed someone to talk to but his someone didn't talk back, he acted on behalf of her problem. She wasn't afraid to talk to God about what she worried about. Overall, the book told girls that they should not worry about what life gives. Margaret certainly was aware about what was going to happen to her next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a girl wants","review":"I was not to happy when i learned i had to read this book for a college Lit. class because i heard it was all about period's.

It talked about many issues the a preteen and teen might have. This book was hard for me to put down. It talks about Margret growing up and the challenges that she has with being a preteen. It can tell the feelings of a girl of that age and what she is going through. It could help girls in situations of that sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"This book was okay, and it was easy to keep reading. I think it was really unrealistic, becuase I have never heard of a 6th grader who was that obsessed with her outer appearance. When I was in 6th grade, I wasn't worrying about what I looked like, as long as I was presentable and cute. I didn't care what guys thought of me in the \\"love\\" sense, just who was best at kickball. If you're looking for a little un-reality, read the book, but if you are looking for a real life situation, pass it by. I'm in 8th grade now, and wish that I hadn't read the book.

I think that you would be better off reading the Fudge books by Judy Blume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting.","review":"This book was very interesting, and Judy Blume is an excellent author. However, I don't think the book is really appropriate for pre-teenage children. As a matter of fact, it especially is not appropriate for adults...The realism is lost, in all honesty, when all the girls are going crazy about starting puberty. Nobody is that excited about their period or bras. I think there are plenty of other books for children to read about puberty that are more informative and less in the realm of cheesy romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure torture","review":"I first read this book when I was 11 and I didn't like it at all. Margaret is such a jerk for picking the handsome boy over the nice boy and for being mean to another girl just because her breasts are big. Also, who in her right mind would *want* big breasts when girls who have them get called sluts just because they wear a bra? And who in her right mind would *want* to get her period when all it means is a lot of mess and fuss?

Instead, it was a book of theoreticals and broad ranging ideas. When I think of a guide, I think of a \\"how to\\" manual. This book is anything but that.

Most of the book seemed very superficial just giving you the most basic information about the technologies and not delving into the nuts and bolts, exploring research or providing examples of unique ways people have used these technologies (a few examples are given but they are not particularly informative or interesting).Again, this is basically just an introduction and most of the information you can find on the net."},{"rating":"1","title":"someone else should have wrote this","review":"A great title like this should be written by someone with experience in the field.

The wood under the chair was splintered, there was a horrible grating sound when I tried to rock in it, and it didn't fit together right.

In this book there are five short stories, psychological thrillers (each approximately 40 pages long),told in an unusual way, brilliantly. The first story \\"The Royal Game' (original title: The Chessnovella) is one of his greatest works. I could not put it down. The last story, \\"Letter from an Unknown Woman\\",is so unusual that I cannot find words to adequately comment on it in this space. The other three stories are of no less quality. - This book is not for somebody who is speed reading through books while waiting for a bus, yet it is easy reading. Don't read more than one in one sitting. Let the story and the style sit in and remain with you for a while. It will be worth your while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough can be said","review":"I think the best advice I can give is to READ THIS BOOK.It is a wonderful collection of human feelings and emotions, and it makes you feel, understand and love the characters portrayed in each story.In particular, Letter from an Unknowned Woman is the best love story I have read. It is simple, short, dramatic, unexpected and so profound, I am still in awe at what I read.Zweig is a brilliant author, and even when translated his books maintain this magical aura that simply makes them shine.Don't pass up the opportunity, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it says it is","review":"This is a good workbook for introducing sentence-combining into a high school English class. The first half of the book uses sentence combining to introduce/review the writing process, offering students \\"invitations\\" to write based on the exercises. The exercises themselves are often topical, and the writing invitations generally ask students to write about themselves and their experiences. The second half of the book uses sentence combining to review grammar, including the parts of speech, usage, clauses and phrases, and punctuation.My only criticism of the Toolbox is that it is perhaps too ambitious. By trying to be all things, I felt it does not provide enough depth, especially about the writing process (compared to, say, Writers Inc). Of course, if you wish to use it as a supplement to your classroom instruction, it is more than sufficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"NEW\\" item not so new","review":"When I pulled the duvet cover and shams out of the package they were covered in some type of animal hair.

I still bought this one after I read this comment and now I regretted it. Actually it is even worse than this review. I got the product, took it out and was glad to see that there was no animal hair. I washed it and then the problems come out. First, the fiber came out as red fiber-balls and scattered all around, on my cloth, on the carpet, on any surface. Then I try to fit it onto my duvet, and this movement made more fiber-balls coming and even the fiber-dust everywhere--on the desk nearby, on the computer screen, on any surface--even on the screen of my alarm clock on the side table.

Unfortunately, their followup LP lacked the same energy and stick-to-the-ribs punch. \\"Back to Zero\\" doesn't have any standout cuts, and the production lacks a certain energy this time around.

I know that is not a long time, but I already can tell my skin is firmer. My dark circles under my eyes have vanished too. I am 105lbs and work out with weights and run but my cellulite just seemed to be creeping its way farther and farther down my thighs! This book makes complete sense that it is not a weight problem or due to being out of shape. I ran a marathon 4 years ago and I noticed a picture of myself running and of course my cellulite was visible. Even that level of training did not budge my cellulite.

I already eat healthy and do not really have a major problem with cellulite, I just thought I read about it for preventative reasons since I am getting older.

I am a 5'4, size zero female and I have cellulite in my thighs. After following the program outlined in this book I now have varicose/spider veins which I did NOT have before following the suggestions of this book! As part of the vitamin/supplement regime, this book instructs its user to take antioxidant, biotin and niacin pills. I read an article in Reader's Digest that said these supplements could actually be harmful! It appears the antioxidants may have contributed to giving me varicose veins.

Try a little suspension of disbelief guys!The rest of the movie is pretty mediocre, with the good parts being Mike Awesome's match, and the old clips of when they had actual good wreslters like Benoit.

It is not formatted for North America and so our DVD player would not play it, but I set it up on my laptop, added some good speakers and we settled in for a great visual and narrative journey from London to South Africa.Much of the dialog and visuals are recorded conversations and comments from helmet mounted cameras and microphones and so are at times muffled, but the gist of what they are saying and the accompanying images are more than explanatory. Their well recorded encounters with Rawandan holocaust survivors and other nationals as they travel are moving and powerful in many cases.I recommend this series if you love travel, especially motocycle travel, as well as their Long Way Around Series(even better!).

All 3 shows disregarded the fact that the female co-founder of this group of 'controlled drinkers' KILLED a person in a drunken driving accident, where SHE was the intoxicated one. So, if you don't mind biased, anti-AA sentiment probably based on the writers own fears of their own addictions (which is where we usually see such denial) get this and revel on closemindedness and fear.

It was revamped prior to hitting the shelves and it tells a great story about wrestling from the early days to today.

This is, in fact, a book for idiots. Reading the sneak preview, I could not help but think that Messieurs Albano and Sugar are the only \\"idiots\\" in the wrestling field. Trying to be funny, their jokes are characterized by a grotesque sense of humor that would make anyone cry. Being an ex-pro, I feel embarrased at the way they tackle the nature of the otherwise beautiful sport.

I would have expected more from Bert and Lou, but not from their writing buddy Woodson.

Next time they should get someone who knows something about the sport to pen a book about wrestling!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with errors, and a poor overview to boot","review":"There aren't that many books about pro wrestling to start with, so when you come across something in the mainstream press, you have to hope for the best. Unfortunatly, The Complete Idiot's Guide is filled with factual errors concerning the history of the sport, not the least of which is poor coverage of the 'fake versus real' issue.If you are seriouis about the history of wrestling, pick of Have a Nice Day or the new Dynamite Kid book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title says it all","review":"This book is definitely only for complete idiots. There is absolutely nothing of any interest in this book. THey are stories with huge, necessary chunks cut out.

There is nothing particularly enlightening in here...basically anyone who has ever watched wrestling once or twice will know the majority of information that is given in the book. I mean, I know it is called the \\"Idiots\\" guide, but I guess I didn't realize that the authors took it so literally. I thought that the biographies of wrestlers past and present would be interesting, but they too were just superficial sketches. I also found a number of factual errors in the book, which took away from its credibility. I like the idea of this book in theory, and it is nice to see a book such as this being sold in the mainstream, but I didn't like the way it actually turned out. Hopefully someone will try a similar concept but do it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic, basic, basic","review":"If you're a complete wrestling addict, this book will fail to enthrall you. There are a few nuggets of entertaining information, but for the most part, this book is for people who really don't know much about the world of sports entertainment.

I also bought my potting soil at Menards this season. I usually buy Miracle Grow at Menards but they must have done some deal with Schultz to only carry the Shultz brand. It's AWFUL! When I potted my plants (some 40+ pots), I had to break down clumps of dirt and manure (yuck), and pull out stones. It weighs a ton and retains too much water. Most of my begonias have died and there are tall grasses growing in the sunny pots. I would have been better off to dig up soil from my yard than to use this potting soil. Worst I've ever used! I was also unable to buy Miracle Grow plant food at Menards as they only carry the Schultz brand.

I needed 2 more bags today and made 3 trips to Menard's and all 6 bags were unusable. Be careful buying this junk, pinch the side of the bag to see if you can feel the mulch in there, it won't feel smooth if it's mulch. The good gardening soil will feel smooth.

This is a recording that will be remembered as one of her finest, I think because the songs mean so much to her.Nancy Wilson is an amazing vocalist, truly one of a kind. And if you have never seen her do what she does live, do yourself a favor-she is mesmerizing in concert.

Ute Lemper's wonderfully dramatic voice is highlighted on tracks such as 'My Ship'(a Kurt Weill classic) and 'All That Jazz' (from Lemper's stunning prtrayal of Velma Kelly in the hit musical Chicago). One C.D. surely cannot capture the enormous range of styles that this artist has to offer, but her fresh sound and intensely powerful voice is surely an excellent starting point, a door into the world of Weimar Cabaret (Kabarett), and Kurt Weill."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing artist...","review":"I purchased this CD quite by accident and am I glad I did! Ute Lemper has a great voice and her interpretation of Kurt Weill is unique and first rate. I actually like it better than the classic treatment by Lotte Lenya. Her singing of Surabaya-Johnny is mesmerizing. This CD is a good introduction to the artistry of Ute Lemper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless ramblings.","review":"Don't waste your time or money on this book. I purchased the angel oracle cards by Ms. Virtue. They are a beautiful oracle deck and I recommend the cards. HOWEVER, this book is like reading a diary of her personal life which is not what I cared to know. I was put off by her constant mention of the other books that she's written throughout this book. This book feels to be written in a rambling, \\"crank out another book\\" style. I did finish reading it because I wanted to find the reward, but was left flat and upset that I wasted so much time.I completely believe in fairies and angels...because I've witnessed. But this book wasn't helpful at all, unless you want to know about the author's personal life. Hope this review will save your time. I agree with the reviewer from NC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book felt more like a long-winded promotion of veganism and animal rights than an exploration of the fairy world.

It was mostly about the author's life, and although well-written, some parts were just unbelieveable. I mostly enjoyed the book up until she starts weeping because a leprachaun yelled at her because her husband mowed down mushrooms in their lawn.I am a believer of the faery realm and I got this book hoping to gain some insight. However, this book left me feeling a little confused and wondering if the author is a bit schizophrenic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant book","review":"I agree with another reviewer that Doreen Virtue uses this book as a pulpit for her experiences with fairy folk and she also espouses her personal philosophy (veganism etc.), that said, she has delivered an enjoyable read with leaves the reader a little lighter of heart and looking around every corner for a glimpse of the little people.I bought this book based on it's title and was not really expecting it to be a 'recollection' type of book -- hence the 4 stars. I did enjoy it though, and in retrospect, would give it 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be forewarned","review":"Unlike many of Doreen Virtue's books, this is not a book that's spiritually instructive. Rather, it's Virtue's personal account of discovering fairies and her struggles with and explorations of true love. How did this book acquire such an editorial description? There are no step-by-step instructions on how to contact fairies, or ways to work with them personally. And I cannot think of a single case study mentioned. Too, too much time is spent in Doreen's personal life, which I never found enlightening or inspiring. I was entirely disappointed; her publisher did her a disservice, setting up all the wrong expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christianizing New Age","review":"Title says it all. This book is pure fluffiness and a diary of her life in her opinion. I wanted to read about the Fey and gain more experiance with them, however the mention of Jesus, God, Angels, and the Holy Spirit were on every page. That has no place in new age or with the Fey and it annoys me as a practicing Pagan of eight years to see that in New Age sections. If you really want to read up on Faeries look at Edain Mccoy or Froud. This is meddling, innacurate bull. Don't waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Drivel","review":"What rubbish! I personally did not enjoy this book, in my opinion it totally lacked spirituality. I myself felt very uncomfortable when the author was proud of getting a guaranteed swim with the dolphins at some 5 star resort when everyone else staying at the resort had to go into a draw.

These are sung by Sting, and are much better then Frank Sinatra and Joe Hendersons efforts.Another classic, \\"Come rain or come shine\\" is performed by Don Henly.Between the dialogues and songs, sad and sometimes dramatic jazz improvisasions occur.If you feel sorry for yourself, listen to this album, it's so sad and tragic, but still beautiful and warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst grinder ever","review":"Don't buy this grinder, it's absolutely useless and has an incredibly weak motor.

I find that I refer to this book over and over again, even over my Iyengar books.Kraftsow's advice on modifying asanas for health reasons or physical limitations is right-on. Too many yoga classes nowadays are seen purely as another type of aerobics class with no value placed on \\"honoring the body\\". In my opinion, too many yoga teachers nowadays are approaching asanas from the \\"one size fits all\\" perspective, without taking into account an individual's capabilities or limitations.I believe that Kraftsow's advice and the photos on how to modify asanas to prevent or help injuries is invaluable.

I was quite excited to attend the workshop, as I was interested in learning more about his yoga practice, but found the book too poorly written to translate into practice.Problem was, Mr. Kraftsow treated his workshop as just another book promotion opportunity and talked about himself and his book for more than 2.5 hours, leaving less than a half hour for actual yoga practice. Even worse, he insulted people from different geographic areas and suggested that many yoga practitioners were miserable because they didn't eat enough sugar!When I got home from his workshop, I threw his book away.

When people give up caffeine or cigarettes or marijuana, they feel pain. They feel real physical pain. It's not psychosomatic; it's withdrawal!2. The author presents himself as a doctor and scientist with all the answers, who can make the world a better place, even though he has no medical or scientific proof to back up any of his theories.

Yes, abstinence before marriage is a good thing... but if your spouse wasn't as virtuous as you were before marriage, them may still pass on an STD if they aren't using condoms!It's also terribly heavy handed with its moral and actually has the demons sitting activelly plotting to teach people sex ed so as to get them to sin.Add to this a shoddy grasp of biblical texts.

The main actor that played Jake was 40+. It simply didn't work. It's odd that they didn't use younger actors because they followed much of the storyline, and even the dialog, closely.If you are a fan of the book you may want to watch this movie, but don't go out of your way.

Parker is such a talented actress, she is so down-to-earth but slightly neurotic as Kate, a mother of two who has a very demanding job.

Banking on the star power of Sarah Jessica Parker, coming off the second Sex and the City movie, I Don't Know How She Does It purports itself to be a comedy about a working mother named Kate Reddy who has it all, but must learn how to balance her career, her marriage, and her children. Unfortunately, I didn't really seem to care much about how Kate did it, as the film teetered hesitantly between comedy and drama and relied on hopelessly outdated viewpoints on gender to deliver its message. Despite a supporting cast that included the likes of Greg Kinnear, Pierce Brosnan, and Christina Hendricks, I Don't Know How She Does It is probably best suited as entertainment for those who are looking for just a small taste, just one more fix, of Sarah Jessica Parker in full-on, Sex and the City Carrie mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a good 'bad' movie!","review":"I was rather disappointed with this film.

As a working mother with high stress job and whining/fighting children dying for my attention, it was the most disappointing message ever.This movie ending is much more palatable. But movie version really lost all the funny British humor and quotable lines from the book which actually read like a tragic/comedy to me, so 4 stars only.

My main issues have always been that most mills do not produce enough pepper in reasonable time, they are not really adjustable (get clogged with pepper), wont hold enough pepper or are a pain to fill. Not so with the magnum. Filling up is uber easy with the large side port, i can pour in the goodness straight from my pepper jar. It holds (nearly) cubic feet of pepper.it produces a astonishing amount of pepper in short amount of time (i use the back and forth twist), easily providing the required amount of freshly ground pepper. The adjustment actually works (better than anything else i have found).You should buy one now :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of longevity is an issue","review":"I also purchased this mill based on a review in Cook's Illustrated. It worked well for a couple of years, although I also experienced the design flaw with the filler opening that can easily open when you don't want it to.

I was pleased to see that it was a live performance and that all of the guitar solos (with the exception of \\"Down by the Lazy River\\") were played by Alan and Wayne Osmond. This was obviously a less than ideal concert situation, as the stage was too small for their dance moves and the microphones were mixed terribly. You can hardly hear any of their trademark harmonies, except when Donny is singing his solo songs. Those who wonder whether the Osmonds actually played their instruments will have ample evidence: a (brief) drum solo, some decent guitar playing and several keyboard highlights from Donny. I might have rated this DVD higher if the sound quality had been better. Since I know of no other live video of the Osmonds from this time period, I recommend it highly for Osmond fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"way to short!","review":"I liked this DVD, but it just was way to short!

This posthumous collection presents the best from his early days with Taste in 1970, through to his last major release, 1990's Fresh Evidence. While his untimely death was tragic, the real tragedy was that he never caught on with American audiences in a big way. On the brink of greatness -- a la Eric Clapton -- in the mid-1970's, Gallagher's U.S. followers failed to obtain critical mass, and he slid into relative obscurity. Not so in Europe, where fans recognized a passion in his electric blues riffing and composition that even Clapton could not match. This CD will provide the listener with glimpses of his greatness, sampled from albums that sold some 30 million copies worldwide during his lifetime.

In short, Chris Jackson is a writer whose stories are coming true in grisly tableaux.

Chris - who has a big, dark secret - is a great character, which is important to me, but the small town is full of well-written, interesting characters.Just don't let the cover lead you to think this is a romance or has anything to do with a damsel lounging around in lingerie.

It was fine until the stainless steel soap dispenser started to rust and then it didn't look quite the same.The biggest problems occur when you fill the dispenser. If you fill it more than about half-way, there is a significant probability that the weight of the dispenser will cause it to fall off the (poorly-designed) assembly. If it doesn't fall off and you continue to fill it, the soap/lotion can overflow from the bottle underneath the sink onto the insides of the cabinet. Then you have a real mess to clean up.

Six of the ten selections feature Gourley in a trio with bassist Marc Johnson and drummer Victor Lewis, including Johnny Griffin's excellent original \\"When We Were One,\\" Sonny Rollins' \\"Airegin,\\" and Jimmy Rowles' \\"The Peacocks.\\" The other four selections add trumpeter Don Sickler and tenor saxophonist Ralph Moore and are actually more exciting, partly due to Sickler's transcriptions and also due to the vintage material (including two Gigi Gryce songs).

This one loses a star for the terrible version of Nick Cave's The Ship Songs. Cave fans will note that the lyrics are even wrong in a couple of spots. All in all, this is a fine collection of CB rarities. Given that 13 of the 16 tracks are very good to great, you can't go wrong with Still In Hollywood.

The live stuff, the covers, and b-sides, all top notch. The \\"God is a Bullet\\" b-side \\"Free\\" is awesome. The cover of \\"Mandocello\\" blows \\"Cheap Tricks\\" out of the water.

The way he handles his disability and the way the other children treat him with love and respect is truly a model we should be holding up.

But they should be small if the screening has really identified the various shades of X'sThe major problem with the book is that it is riddled with typos.

The copy sent me looks as though it was taken from a garbage can. I was VERY disappointed but it was utilitarian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, That Makes Much More Sense","review":"The premise of Made To Crave is simple: we crave, because we are supposed to crave. The Lord can satisfy our cravings, but unless we reach for him, again and again, we'll attempt to fill the void with other less desirable choices.As a woman who has grappled with my weight for all of my adult life, this exposed a fatally wrong conviction I had: that because I crave, something inside me is broken and needs to be fixed.The author, Lysa Terkeurst, writes in a chatty, girl-to-girl style, and supports her premise both from the Bible and through her personal anecdote. I just finished reading the book, so I can't speak to the effectiveness, particularly since my life has been too complicated to truly focus and give it a fair shot, but I do believe it can only be helpful for a believer who is trying to find his or her way out of the weight trap. I'll report back and edit this critique when I've really put the book to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"New twist on a constant struggle","review":"I'm so sick and tired of the same old stuff on dieting.

Worth a read for a different perspective and a boost to your self esteem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this book!!","review":"This is not heavy and overwhelming, but it is substantial and thought-provoking.The questions at the end of each chapter are insightful and revealing.The author is real and easy to relate to, and let's us see behind the curtain of her own struggle.God has recently delivered me from being overweight and this book acknowledges that it is always about something else -- has always been a spiritual battle at least for me -- and this will help me develop a plan for transitioning to \\"real life\\" and making permanent changes.Great insight for \\"real\\" people's lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so what we need!","review":"I am so excited about this book!!!!! Finally, a no diet, diet. This book helps us go to the root of the problem. Why do we over eat? This book tells you. Where should our priorities be? This book tells you.

For instance, much of what she said about food I found to apply to my relationship with stories.This book is written in a relateable, approachable way, and is full of Biblical truth to replace the lies that hold us in bondage. Lysa calls us to a much greater goal than feeling better about ourselves--closer walk with God. Not just eating right to reach a goal weight, but living in victory.I appreciated the emphases that it is the decision I make now that matters, not the one I made last time, nor the one I'm going to make next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Lysa give you such a great perspective on what should be important in your life.

I have read other books and heard her speak and I really enjoy her honesty and conversational style.Lysa discusses her struggles with weight, and how she used the Bible along with prayer and scripture memorization to help her in her weight loss battles.In Made to Crave Lysa also discusses the importance of friends that hold you accountable, hard work, and nutrition that is necessary to keep weight off once you have lost it.I have been recommending this book to friends, and I will be participating in the upcoming webcasts she is presenting in January.As an athlete I need this too.

I never worked on the head stuff and proceeded to gain it all back.Then, I read this book. The concepts Lysa shares in \\"Made to Crave\\" have helped me to do a 180 degree turn in my thinking. God is walking with me on this journey 100%...and after two and 1/2 months I've lost 21 pounds! I'm telling you (as someone who knows ALL too well), this book is EXACTLY what us girls need to hear. And Lysa is the perfect girlfriend to hear it from. I'm SO excited to finally be experiencing freedom in this area. You will be SO blessed by this book.

I still struggle and have had to re-read sections in this book to keep scriptures and helpful tips fresh in my mind. Many Americans will find this book helpful as our food culture has changed so much and has become so processed and unhealthy. I have gotten many easy sayings and my favorite is above, but my second is \\"Eat to live, don't live to eat!\\"I would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, easy-to-read chapters, good biblical tidbits","review":"A good book overall. Very easy to read, and there are some great, useful tidbits. The book pretty much stays on a single theme and doesn't explore other facets of craving/idolatry beyond food. A good read, but a pretty limited. You will struggle to relate if you don't suffer with a pretty serious addiction to food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"If you are struggling with weight loss, healthy eating, and even struggling with sex, drugs, alcohol, low self esteem, worry, stress you will see that the message that Lysa is trying to get across will apply to these other areas as well. God's word is solid and Lysa does a good job at applying scripture to our cravings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes good sense","review":"Not a diet book, but a chance to explore the root of the problem when it comes to losing weight.

Lysa has given the world a gift in the form of an amazing book inspired by God! Wish this one would have been around 11 years ago! Must read for all women and even some men!

Ouch. That's why I dropped it down to a 4-star rating. But I love inkjet-printable discs, I needed dual layer for this project, and a good $3 disc is better than a $2.50 coaster.FYI - My burners at NEC ND-3520A and ND-3550A.

This is a wonderful adventure story that I would highly recommend to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classy, riveting, edge-of-your-seat action thriller","review":"I literally could not put the book down..read the entire book in one sitting.

I was hesitant to order gloves online because I insist on gloves with fingers that fit; I hate having space at a gloves finger tips. I crossed my fingers and ordered a small size; the fingers fit well but the palm is a little small. Although the glove felt a little small at first, the palm material stretches very well and the pair soon felt just fine.

I've sealed my 6 car driveway, did a ton of yard work, and even used them for paintball with no problems. I'll be purchasing another couple of these since I got the driveway sealant all over them and so I can have a supply of well fitting, durable gloves in-house.

I would say they had about 150 hours of hard labor on them. By the end, there were tares in the seams along the glove line but the rest of the glove was still holding up strong. All in all, awesome gloves. If using for basic mechanics, gardening, yard work, etc. These babies will last a long time. On a horse/cattle ranch? Maybe two weeks.

They are easy to put on and are comfortable on my hands. Quite handy for the occasional need to wipe away sweat from my face, too. That said, I find it a small inconvenience that despite the overall tight fit, they cannot cover my finger tips tightly. It is really difficult to open a can of drinks while wearing them and I would sometimes have problems pressing certain buttons on my DSLR camera.

In fact, except for the padded areas, the palms, knuckles and the proximal interphalangeal joint they are but a scant single layer. I Bought them for ridding and just for a hoot I did a stint with just one glove. It really didn't seem like the gloved hand was perceptibly warmer. They will help protect your knuckles in mechanical operation and because they are so thin they offer good retention of dexterity. The padding will also help while holding cold tools and parts, so, while you'll still feel the wind on the back of your hand while working they are worth having. For lightweights they seem reasonably well made and you can can pick up and manipulate small objects like screws and washers or operate and adjustable wrench or a ratchet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, comfortable gloves.","review":"Bought these for my step-father.

Unfortunately I will be returning them because \\"small\\" is still way too big for my small hands.

If you have bigger hands this may work, but just realize the \\"small\\" isn't very small. (For reference, my pointer finger is 2 1/4 inches long and I can span 7 inches thumb to pinky.

The Electronic/Dance genre is made up of many, many styles which vary greatly in sound. This, although not piano driven, is Soul music influenced Garage/House music. This sound is more likely to hook someone into Dance-Pop or Urban contemporary than Trance. I was not disappointed by the mixes at all. Obiviously, many enjoyed this version of \\"Looking For a New Love\\" is liked since it peaked at #1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play. Jody's vocals are silky smooth and warm, as is most of the mixes. All the mixes are nice enough for me since they move my body and make me feel good, the mixes have done their job.

If I want that sound (but with better songwriting), I'll put on Singles Going Steady! The Buzzcocks made the right move in having bassist Tony Barber helm the followup to All Set, 1999's Modern.All Set's highlights include Kiss and Tell, What You Mean To Me, and the touching Steve Diggle contribution Back With You. Like all the Buzzcocks' 1990s output (and despite some of Pete Shelley's corniest lyric-writing ever), this is better music than at least 80 per cent of what's out there.

I thought the premise sounded great, but it was put into an empty story. I wanted to care about the characters, but they had little depth. I almost stopped reading it all together when at least some action started up, but that only led to a very dissapointing ending. There was no real workup to a climax. It got to a certian point of the story when it just threw all the characters in the same room and ended it. Maybe Jonnie Jacobs was getting bored with it too and wanted to get it over with. Do yourself a favor....skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Intent to Look for Other Books by Jacobs","review":"Whilst this book started off at a pretty fast pace and was pretty interesting in the first couple of chapters the quality died off fast once Betty was killed and O'Brien injured. The rest of the book has the rather boring character O'Brien obsessed with trying to figure out what her dead client wanted. Meanwhile the injured hit man who sent the premature killing hit man that bungled the job wants to know just how much O'Brien knows. Sounds interesting from the description you say, you'd think that wouldn't you and I was one of you but in reality you'll struggle to stick with the boring storyline to the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"another winner","review":"This is the best yet in a great series. I've always like Kali, and Jacobs does a great job with secondary characters too. There are several storylines, each with its own driving mystery, and it's only as we get further into the story that we see how they are connected. There's mystery, intrique, suspense and humor. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"This book starts off with a bang when attorney Kali O'Brien is shot and her client is killed. Kali knows almost nothing about the client, nor does she know if the client was the target, or if Kali herself might have been.

And by \\"slight\\" I mean approximately six years. To be fair to those record company executives who held back it's release, the album does have a few problems. The main one being that it's not funny. Let me repeat that: IT'S! NOT! FUNNY! At all! The whole album is pretty much a disaster. The first album was merely mediocre, but this one is downright bad. The \\"highlight\\" here is probably \\"She's Coming Out Swinging\\", where Lisa works with George Clinton's P-Funk All-Stars. That track is not too unbearable.

So when Songs in the Key of Springfield was available we grabbed for it. It is a real treat -- 5 stars. We can put it on and listen all day. The Yellow Album, however, is a real disappointment -- ESPECIALLY in comparison to Springfield. The cover is clever and, unfortunately, the best part. This album stops its parody of Sgt Pepper when you open the CD. The songs are forced and amateurish. It's like Andy Rooney time: let's get a tape recorder and make an album and we'll save the school. Thank God the show isn't written like this. Oh, there are one or two good moments (especially in Apu's solo). But it's mostly pretty flat. Rarely worthy of a chuckle. Not worth the $12.

The only real bright spot on this album is the rock song \\"Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves.\\" \\"Funny How Time Slips Away\\" is halfway decent, and it was nice to see Apu take over on \\"24 Hours A Day.\\" They don't redeem the album, however. \\"Love,\\" \\"10 Commandments Of Bart,\\" and \\"I Can't Help Myself\\" are moldy rap tunes. George Clinton's song \\"She's Comin' Out Swingin\\" goes on WAY too long. The concept of \\"Anyone Else\\" is lame. \\"Every Summer With You\\" is cheesy, and \\"Kamp Krusty\\" didn't need to be made into a long suite.

Bought this book to get updated on ASP 3.0 and hoping to compare and learn from other's shopping cart design. I am disappointed to find most of the examples do not work. This may not be a fair review as I did not buy this work to learn ASP and so did not read the book from cover to cover. But I do expect the examples to work out of the box!I bought the book yesterday and spent the whole morning today installing most of the shopping cart examples and was very frustrated by it. Just glancing at the shopping cart it seems like a fair design and the book does offer some valuable information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent SAMS - Easy to understand and implement","review":"I had read the SAMS ASP in 24 hours book which was an excellent start to ASP. This book would have been just as good to start with and it is a lot more in-depth. Of course, the focus is e-commerce and you are taken through building an online store. The examples are easy to follow and the text is well presented and easy to understand (especially for people who hate technical books).If you are looking for an introduction to ASP and have not yet purchased the SAMS 24 hour book, consider this one instead. They do cover a lot of the things that the other book has in it. Towards the back end, they have examples of email forwarding from forms and other bits and pieces that are not directly related to e-commerce, but were the reasons I got the other book.If you are trying to build a full-blown store online, start here. It won't get any easier than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reqiures User Regristration to Shop","review":"This book has one major flaw. The author discusses the advantages/disadvantages of using session variables when creating the cart and the advantages/disadvantages of requiring the user to create an account before anything can be added to their shopping cart. That is great, but then the author proceeds to use the database (require the user to create an account) method throughout the rest of the book. Tell me how many carts require you to create an account to put something in their basket? I think this deters most shoppers. After I realized that the rest of the book uses this method, I put it on the shelf. And thus the reason for the poor rating. I have now purchased VB Developers Guide to E-Commerce published by Sybex.

It is a great tool in listening from a great performer. I actually bought the book ten or twelve years ago and finally a few months ago found the CD for it. The CD has helped greatly in mastering the style. Without listening to the CD it is almost like stabbing in the dark. I recommend it highly to anyone who just has no opporunity in being around Western style fiddlers. The internet does have some of Mark playing western fiddling but this CD had a lot more tunes. Also for those classical players it is a break from practicing scales and appregios. It was one of the main reasons why I got into this style and other fiddle styles. However, like anything any one style can become a rut. Thus I off and on play Western style fiddling so as to keep a freshness to it. The CD has renewed my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wenzel screen room","review":"I use this for camping. You need at least 3 people to set up, I was hoping it would only take 2.

It was amazing we were still together after 4 hours of erecting the monster. It took duct tape to keep the joints together. After a day of standing, it started to lean, and multiple metal rods bent. We ditched that tent and bought this one on Amazon.This tent was a DREAM to set up. It literally took us 20 minutes to set up. The construction was intelligently designed. It stayed up for almost 2 weeks with no problems. It came down in just as much time to put up. I could not be more pleased with this tent.

I was anxious to get them in and when they arrived I was kind of disappointed that these are only Baby Bears, not a mix of three different sizes with Mama Bear and Papa Bear. The pattern cards require bears of three different sizes so I guess I'll have to order a different set. Be aware that if you are wanting the assorted size bears, this product only contains the smallest size bears. I would have purchased a different set if the description for this item had noted that.The bears themselves are very cute and durable looking. Even though they are not what I wanted, I know my kids are going to go nuts over them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but captivating","review":"I'm not sure what it is about these bears, but every child I know just loves them. They come in 3 sizes, (big, medium, little) and 6 different colors. My daughter's had them about 5 years now and still plays with them. They're great for sorting by color, sorting by sizes, counters to practice numbers etc... I've seen them in classrooms at her school also; I suggested we pass them down to her younger cousin and was met with an emphatic 'NO'. So I guess my niece will be getting her own set and we'll be keeping ours for a few more years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knock Off","review":"These are 100 hits from the 80's, but NOT from the original artists.

Yes, the artist name was \\"Countdown Singers\\" but who would have known that didn't mean \\"various artists\\". Lesson learned. Guess the $6 price tag should have been some kind of indication. So, get this if you want to hear 80's hits performed by American Idol wanna-be's."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"Unfortunately, I misunderstood when I purchased this and didn't realize that it wasn't the original artists. That was my fault, though it certainly isn't obvious. Some of the songs are okay, but MANY of them are AWFUL!I gave it two stars instead of one only because 100 songs for $5.99 is a pretty good deal.

Much to what will be the shock of many New York based companies most NFL fans are not New York fans, in fact most Americans now pull for anybody other then New York. Enough is enough!

I mean, I could think that he ends up in a new community, but you could think differently. The point was to imagine the many ways to make the book end, and the end helps open you horizons. The singing helps you think that he has heard-beyond, and not only seen-beyond. For all the people out there who havenn't read this book, you should, it's a very thought out book.

Years ago when I purchased these recordings, I was torn as to which to select--the original or the digital re-recordings. I bought both. The digitals sound so much better to the casual classical listener (which I am). However, as a Philadelphia-area native, I'm proud of the legacy of Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra. This is the same \\"Leopold\\" made even more famous by Bugs Bunny's impersonation in Warner Brothers' 1949 \\"Long Haired Hare.\\"The originals don't sound very good compared to the digital re-makes. If faced with the choice again, I'd go for the 1982 version of the recordings. They're the ones with the burgundy covers pictured on the front page of this product's Amazon listing. Unfortunately, Disney no longer offers these for sale. I'll just have to dig into my archives to find these recordings and give them another listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastered?","review":"I went to see Fantasia in 1940 and the music was wonderful; the product that I received was a poor reproduction of the original.

Seriously, it REALLY sucks. At least after reading these reviews I know why it sucks so much. Buy this only if you're a hardcore classical fan who can pick out and appreciate the supposed wonderful nuances of this particular recording. Otherwise see if you can find the \\"uninspired\\" remake from the 80s. That one sounds awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, muddy sound quality","review":"I felt strongly enough about my waste of money in buying this soundtrack that I felt compelled to add my voice to the chorus telling people not to buy this compact disc. The idea of Fantasia is appealing because the soundtrack brings together great music from different composers all in one place. However, the sound quality is so muddy that I simply could not listen to this music any longer than necessary to decide to prune this from my collection. In particular, sections of \\"A Night on Bald Mountain\\" get louder and softer a few notes apart when the music should play at the same volume. In an era when you can purchase individual pieces of music, this soundtrack can easily be stitched together from more modern recordings. The one star refers to the quality of the recording. With good sound quality, Fantasia would be a five star compact disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor audio quality mars production","review":"My family loves \\"Fantasia,\\" but the poor audio quality of this recording makes it nearly impossible to listen to. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complaint","review":"I thought that I was ordering a DVD of the original movie, which I remember seeing when it first was screened. To receive only the sound track, without any animation, was annoying to say the least. Your description of the offered product could have been more explicit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable.","review":"Don't get me wrong, Fantasia is one of my favorite movies and Stokowski my favorite conductor--a true genius. The problem is that these CDs were \\"restored\\" (\\"destroyed\\" would be a better word) by someone who has no idea what music sounds like. In a desperate attempt to preserve our ears from any (gasp!) noise, a brutal gating filter was used to destroy any semblance of the sound of real instruments. And, since optical recording of the time had very poor treble response, what treble there is has been boosted mercilessly, resuting in shrill, screechy strings. I really cannot bear to listen to these CDs.I see that someone has muddied the waters by uploading pictures of the 1980s digital re-recording of the soundtrack (the CDs with the brown background). Blasphemous as it sounds, that may be the better way to hear this music, at least until the Disney company sees fit to allow a proper restoration of the original soundtrack to be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original release much better sound","review":"I own the original 2 disc set. I thought the re-master would be an improvement. The sound quality on the original is noticeably better than the re-master. One of the worst soundtracks of any CD I've owned since the 80s.

It helps you to relax and even makes you remember those moments from the movie.

My evaluation of this set of CDs is that it is simply wonderful as it reminds me of the many happy hours my children would spend watching and rewatching Fantasia, and of course the sound of it was there too. This is that sound and I love it for itself and the memories it invokes are wonderful. Even an ugly person can become handsome if he or she is full of love.

Odd John is much the same only more so; in fact it is the equal of any science fiction tale ever created. It uses fiction as a device to conceal the author's real intent, which is to get some points across to those \\"supermen\\" that walk the real earth, people so far advanced in terms of mental and conscious functioning as to be like men living in a world of monkeys. If you are among them you must see what Stapledon has to say to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The next step","review":"The story of Odd John serves a didactic function for the rest of us. Man as we know him has evolved, and continues to do so. Stapeldon gives us in Odd John the next evolutionary step in man: Homo-Superior!

Each time you look at it you will see something you haven't noticed before. Ben Watts has captured the urban youth being exactly that - Young, colorful and full of life. What a privelige it is that a truly superb photographer has shared his personal diary/scrap book with the rest of us. I totally recommend this book.. PERFECT for a xmas present."},{"rating":"2","title":"La vida loca","review":"I saw this book and grabbed it at the bookstore. Even though I am no youngster, I found the images in this book to be so tantalizing and alive, that I wanted to go out dancing. Ben Watts' ability to document culture with a non biased view really took me aback. An avid reader of fashion magazines, I have always been a fan of his work. I had no idea that someone of his stature ( I see his work in Elle) would be able to touch the soul of inner city youth. Most people would be afraid to photograph the subjects he has so beautifully presented in this diary of life. Growing up as a Puerto Rican in New York , I am proud to see that there is finally an art book which celebrates the diversity present in our culture. The fact that Ben Watts reaches out and shows us this classically demonished part of society in a jubilent and non judgemental way makes me want to shout.

This author focuses on practices done by corrupt muslims who do not even read their own book. The Quran numerously talks about Homosexuality, Condeming it over and over. First it warns the men not to leave their wives and go for other men. Another verse states How God dealt a destructive Force (severe storms) on the People of \\"Lot\\" that instantly killed all their inhabitants as punishment for such a sinful act. Then there are the VAST testimonies of Homosexual muslim who choose not to engage in Homosexual acts and lead a Heterosexual life in order not to Sin in the name of God. I could go on, this is so pathetic that it's not even worth my time reviewing this. MY ADVICE, BEFORE YOU BELIEVE IN SOMETHING SOMEONE SAYS OR WRITES ABOUT, do your own independant research to see if the author is honest or just a fanatic. In this cas go read what the Quran really says about homosexuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Piece of Junk ever written!!","review":"Islamic Sexualities by Stephen O.

The unit would still power on but no audio.I applied for a refund from Amazon, they accepted and had the unit picked up shortly thereafter at my house and at no cost to me. About a little over a week later I had my refund.Lessons learned, going to buy a more reputable unit this time around. But definitely no hesitation in dealing with Amazon again.While the unit was functioning it wasn't all that impressive, the audio was solid for its price range but the feature set was not overly useful when connecting to a HTPC with coax or fiber optics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cheap?","review":"JVC has a reputation for making reasonable quality products for a reasonable price. The receiver I got started having problems after about 2 weeks. It started putting out a feedback loop when a digtal source was inactive. But what made me return it was, it would shut off when playing loud DVD scenes. It would do this only on some output setting.It's reasonable that a 7.1 receiver at this price would not have some features like video conversion. I had come to expect that JVC products do what they do fairly well. At least the receiver I got didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"I bought this because I wanted a powerful receiver that was also easy to use. Once this thing is set-up, it is exactly that...easy.My wife can barely change satellite TV settings, but she handles the JVC with ease.Pait this with a decent set of 5.1 or 7.1 surround speakers and subwoofer and you will not be disappointed. It has many features also found in much more expensive units.Also great if you have another JVC component (TV, DVD) due to the AV Compulink availabilityLots of video inputs and outputs, including S-video and component-make this very useful for someone with limited inputs on their TV.The reason for only 4 instead of 5 stars it its lack of digital audio inputs. It has ONE optical in and ONE digital coaxial in, and ONE USB in (for streaming music from a PC). For my components, I need at least 3 fiber optic inputs.

But, this book would be good if you just want a light overview of Lewis' arguments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Educational","review":"Doctor G is such a cool lady! This documentary series is so interesting and educational if you are into science, scientific findings and solving or exposing mysteries. My only small complaint about how they filmed this was they did their best to not show you much autopsy at all. When the cameras are in the lab, and if there is anything gross exposed, they filter the footage around the gross parts. They even went so far as filtering Doctor G's hands if she had blood etc on her gloves. I wanted to be able to see more of what she was describing and seeing first hand, rather then just verbal detail.In any event though, what Doctor G shares is very interesting and I had several \\"AHA,\\" moments as mysteries started to unravel and then finally completely exposed the mystery of how a person died in each case. I could watch these dvd's over and over again. Glad I own them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"manufacturing problem","review":"Love the show and the episodes I got but I only got 6 of the 12 episodes. The packaging has only 1 DVD and it is a double sided one but one side has 3 episodes and the other side has only 3 as well. Amazon responded quickly to the complaint and sent me another but it is the same. The packaging or manufacturing did something wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but preachy","review":"We haven't really watched any other autopsy shows. This one is interesting, as some cases are tragic and others bizarre. I think Dr. G is fairly preachy, often commenting on how you should check your blood pressure, etc. so you don't end up dead for the same reason these people did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seven men at daybreak","review":"Operation Daybreak is a truly emotional and gripping tale of the assasination of the leading Nazi Reinhard Heydrich, in Prague. The assasians were all Czech paratroopers trained by British intelligence at the start of WWII. The film is authentically set in Prague and includes stirring music to accompany fine performances from all! Sit back and enjoy this film, but remember the Kleenex for the last fifteen minutes. A classic...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must see!","review":"A very well made film, quite accurate to true events. The final scenes above and in the crypt are quite harrowing and a tribute to the brave men involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst war movies ever made!!!!!","review":"This movie was historically wrong. It didn't fallow history at all. The actors were alright, the screenplay was horrible. The producers also put in some romance (which never happened) and took away from the movie and made it that much worse. The way the historical events were twisted made the movie hard to watch for the full two hours. Any one that understands a little about the event would undoubtedly agree this is a horrible movie. This movie does much discredit to the actual people that conducted the assignation and especially to the Czech resistance of WWII. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I gave it one star for certain \\"entertaining\\" scenes. If you want to watch how this event really went down there was a movie made in the 60's called ATENTAT, that followed the event almost to perfect detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A title begging for a dvd release","review":"If ever a movie needed to see a dvd release, this is the one! After much searching around, I managed to source this one and I'm glad its finally in my collection. I saw it in 1980, and since then, it has been right up at the top on my wish list of collectible movies of all time.The transfer seems to have been from a VHS and hence the quality isn't too great, but I guess beggars can't be choosers when there isn't an official dvd print of this title anywhere in the world.For those of you who haven't seen it......just blindly pick this title up!!You will never regret it.And lastly.....I hope the authorities who own the rights to this movie listen to all our prayers and release a remastered version of this classic on dvd so that it will not be lost for posterity ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film on an often overlooked event in the war.","review":"Nicely done film, and great location shots (although you can see the burlap sacks covering the modern street signs in some shots). I am a bit confused about the reference to the ice cave in the video description though--its a film about the assasination of Heydrich in Prague, 1942."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impact","review":"Most of the major deciding battles of the Second World War were fought on a grand scale with thousands of men opposing each other - Stalingrad, El Alamein, Midway, Operation Overlord, Iwo Jima and many others. These battles did decide who would ultimately prevail in the conflict.But sometimes on a smaller scale and away from the headlines and on a less epic sale were other equally crucial fights that did determine the course of events. Men and women who literally went on death defying missions to achieve one or more objectives, little knowing the cascading effect their success or victory would have on the other theatres of war.Operation Daybreak is one such true story."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Retreads!","review":"One of the most underrated artists to come out of the disco era has been unfairly dealt another career set-back with yet another \\"Best of\\" collection.

Unlike some, I like this album. I really like the mix of songs included on this album, which is very much a window into life and soul. It's all here - love and loss, wanting to be your own person, and wanting recognition as a human being. Personally, I think that this is a great album. Yeah, if you already have an anthology of her complete works, then this will be redundant - period - full stop. But, nonetheless it's a great album, and if you don't have that anthology I think you'll really like it, like I do.(Review of Donna Summer - Greatest Hits)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother??","review":"The ONLY reason to buy this one is if you are a new fan of Donna Summer's work...and I don't know how any fresh fans can be recruited, given the lack of new material since a Christmas album released years & years ago.

Walking in the park has greenslade's heavy jazz. Valentyne suite is an extended jam with classical as well as jazz improv. This group came out with the grass is greener on dunhil later in the year. They were essentially England's BST with equal or better talent to the Moody's .

The story \\"Night of Love\\" never got a chance to develop because she already had them declaring their love for each other soon after the book started. I know it was a short story but come on...give me something to look forward to.The second story, written by Joan Elliot Pickart, was so poorly written it might as well have been something my 10 year old sister put together. The entire story was boring and sloppy. However, it was even worse when I realized that the hero sounded a lot like a woman, he was completely unbelievable and ultra feminine. There was so much a$$ kissing in the story that I simply could not finish it. Out of all the books that I have ever read (and I have read many) this was by far the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO RESUME!!!","review":"The title says it all. If you bought this player for listening to audiobooks, which is what I did, you'll be extremely disappointed that you'll have to fast forward through the book every time you start it up since there is no resume feature. Considering audiobooks are anywhere from 3 to 8 hours long in most cases, or at least the pieces you get from audible are, it's totally inconvenient to start playing from the beginning each time you turn it on. Get used to the fast forward button and remembering exactly what time you were at because you're going to be doing a lot of it.

After using the thing for lest then a month the flimsy plastic belt clip just fell apart. I spent hours (literaly) tying to reach someone at RCA to help me. After way to many calls I finally reached someone at the Customer Satisfaction office (or something to that effect) who appoligized profusely for my frustrating experinece and promised to do everthing humanly possible to solve my problem. After I explained the problem, she quickly told me I was out of luck, they do not make any replacements for that part. So much for jumping throught hoops!

First, the subject matter. Second, it is physically large, almost 12 inches square and containing nearly 400 pages. It's beautifully designed and printed with many photos - the cover photo is particularly emotive.Doug Ramsey has researched Paul Desmond's life in great depth, literally from cradle to grave. What emerges is a portrait of a publically acclaimed musical genius and an intensely private man.I saw Paul Desmond in London in 1958 when he was with the Dave Brubeck Quartet. Fifty three years later I'm still a fan!If you have an interest in Paul Desmond, buy this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Testamonial for a Great Talent","review":"This is a book for the serious lover of jazz, and for the many dedicated fans, then and now, of one of the world's greatest talents.

I only use the HDMI inputs and outputs, but they work fine.I have another issue with the unit: it runs hot. I have a dedicated fan behind the unit that blows air underneath it. As long as the fan is on, the unit is quite warm. If the fan is off, the unit gets hot - hot enough that it's uncomfortable to touch.I'm concerned enough about the safety of this unit (wood, power cables, and heat don't mix well), that I'm going to replace it - despite it being one year old, and working fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"I bought this receiver over 2 years ago and have sent it back to JVC 4 times. Except for the time that it wouldn't turn on at all, JVC denied that there is any problem. The unit shuts down sporadically with any minor blip in volume whether from a dvd, xbox or tv. I finally told them not to return it and bought an Onkyo receiver which was cheaper, has 4 HDMI inputs, and sounds wonderful.I obviously got a lemon, but what infuriated me was JVC's denial that there was a problem with the unit and refusal to replace it. I wasted a lot of money and time and am glad to be rid of this receiver.

Jerry Beach does a very good job of making the many unforgettable moments of Matsui's first year in pinstripes come to life.Dubbed Godzilla by his adoring fans back home, Matsui's signing with the N.Y. Yankees was international news. Beach's book takes us step-by-step through what it took to make such a deal happen, how fans and industry insiders on both continents took the news, and the subsequent season that had more ups and downs than your average roller coaster.Whether you're an avid Yankee fan, a fan of the Japanese phenom, or just a baseball fan that enjoys a good baseball book, this one is the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!!!!!","review":"This book is a MUST READ...

After 3 minutes of our puppy chewing on this \\"edible\\" bone, we got concerned that he had bitten off a chunk of it. To our relief, the bone is technically \\"edible\\", but the fine print says for puppies 6 months and older. To me, that's a little misleading. I'd consider a puppy under 6 months old.Our dog passed the 1-inch chunk he'd eaten, but it was his first soft stool in the 6 weeks we've had him. The rest of the bone found its way into the garbage. Nylabone should reconsider selling a multi-pack of these bones mixed with the non-edible style. We were ultra-concerned when handing him a bone that he managed to eat assuming it was the same as the others.My advice, steer clear of these \\"healthy\\" edible Nylabones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"diarrhea\\"?","review":"It didn't take very long either.

What to do? I went out and found another bike, in a store that stayed open after hours just for me -- a 'near disaster' averted.

The tires don't leak air, the training wheel brackets are the best I've come across (althought the wheels are a little chincy and have already been replaced with a $10.00 heavy plastic set), and the center bar is low enough that he can balance the bike flat footed on the ground. I mainly bought this bike for the dual handbrakes, as I've had older kids in serious crashes due to trying to pedal brake when transitioning to a 'big kid bike'. It arrived completely undamaged and practically assembled itself for me, although the 'universal' product manual schwinn included was not much help.

I canceled the order because they did not think it would be in before Christmas.

I should have paid closer attention to the shipping weight: 45.8 pounds !!!! I did not weigh the bike, but its probably around 30 pounds, or about half of our son's weight!

Recently, I found \\"Best of Strange Cargo\\" available when I was visiting a local record store and grabbed it.Electronic was the word I was originally seeking. The genre didn't have a name back then and was only in its infancy thanks to people like William Orbit.Yes, the CD is as good as I remember and well worth the wait. It's an impressive sound combination of vocals and synthezation that is extremely listenable. I don't have a favorite, though I have not skipped a single song through playing the disk several times.Rebecca Kyle, September 2009"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fitting collection for an amazing series of albums","review":"William Orbit is one of those rare instrumental artists - unrestrained by any style or genre. His Strange Cargo albums (of which there are four, with a 5th rumoured to be on the cards in 2013) cover a miriad of styles & genres. From Latin inspired melodies to deep ambient sounscapes to soaring rock to pumping dance beats to..to..to.. on & on the styles go!Strange Cargo, Best Of is a terrific place to start for those new to Orbit's music & also serves as a fine book-end for those who have the other albums as it contains remixes, reworkings & rarities (5 in total)."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Best of Strange Cargo\\" weaves very relaxing and rich threads of early ambient music that makes for great driving","review":"\\"A great example of how fluid, melodic, and atmospheric ambient electronic music can go to the highest depths.

Perfect for daytime congested drives and doesn't skip sides or become monotonous but having a consistent and often varied air about it which makes it stand out more than even a Biosphere album.\\"BEST TRACKS: Water from a Vine Leaf.

Even though it was factual, it was never boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, Basic History","review":"This is a readable basic history of the War in the Pacific from 1941-1945. Readers get a view of the many battles, from Pearl Harbor and the Fall of the Phillipines, to the U.S. and Allied advantage that began as early as the Battle of Midway in June, 1942 and the landings at Guadalcanal two months later. Then we see the General Douglas MacArthur's long island-hopping campaign that culminated in the U.S. military holding Okinawa and poised to invade before Hiroshima. The author does a nice job of capturing the strategies, and to some extent the lives of the ordinary soldiers that fought the war. This book is aimed at a younger reading audience, but remains a nicely written, informative look for novices as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great home gym, esp. for Pilates","review":"I bought this in January and have been very pleased with it. I'm glad I got the Pilates version because it has everything the regular gym has and more. I have used it almost exclusively for the Pilates exercises. It is well-built. The first few times I used it I was discouraged because I didn't immediately get the hang of the exercises. But I'm glad I stuck with it. A friend of mine has a Total Gym he bought at Sears for around $200. There's no comparison to mine in quality. Then again, mine cost more.You do have to be careful with it and follow the setup and safety directions very carefully. I've had a couple mishaps which were my own fault but you need to be careful with it, esp. around kids. Overall, I think it's a really good investment and I'm not a fitness junkie.I leave it set up because it doesn't fold as easily as they make it sound. It's pretty heavy and cumbersome.

The idea of having women musicians on 3 CD's is a great one, but the music suffers from mediocrity. A lot of the tracks I wouldn't even consider music, its just women talking away with a keyboard mixer in the back. I am not hearing the quality of musicianship here. With that said I'm not regretful that I bought it, because there are some good tracks here. Such as Chicks on Speed, Le Tigre, Pam Hogg and Ana Da Silva. Yeah the rest of it though thumbs down.

His argument was the music was simplistic and the talent level lacking. Wrong, wrong wrong. The songwriting is some of the best since the Pixies/Nirvana era. Every song is catchy, but not lightweight and the lyrical content will pass you by until you actually sit and listen.

I found Imperial Teen later than most. I hate the radio. They should be playing this album or Lovesick or Go ... not the other homogenized ... you hear everyday. Sure, there is some good rap, and occasional goot alt rockers. But, most of it sounds the same and is .... These guys should be blasting from the radio. Why not? I would have heard this album sooner. This is great rock, great songs, Poppy yet noisy too. Intelligent but sexual too. Too smart to cave to the demands of corporate radio. A great live act. This CD is a bit catchier and more tuneful than Seasick. Where Seasick was a little noisier and punker this has catchier hooks. The lyrics are great especially that line about doing a congressman. Ok, now I know why programmers can't play this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not essential, but a great album","review":"This CD doesn't really break any new ground, although it definately has its own sound. Most of the songs are fairly similar sounding, and not really experimental, but its still the kind of CD you can listen to straight through. There's a neat feel of lightness and bouyancy throughout the music that'll probably be the main reason you'll want to stick it in your player.By the way, the song Yoo Hoo is awesome, probably the best reason to buy this disk. For some strange reason I find it incredibly hilarious and it cracks me up every time I hear it, I usually start laughing even before the singer comes in. Roddy Bottum acts like he's talking on the phone near the end. \\"Hello, are you there? I know you're there!

I'm watching this lady move her finger up and down the fretboard, and i'm wondering how these clowns got a record deal, or were even allowed to perform for free. This music is god awful to put it mildly, a mix of incoherent lyrics and two chord songs. The guitar technique is so lousy, it seems like a 6 year old could do a better job. I'm not just simply panning this group, i'm being honest.

It's one of Blur's most fearless wonders into the library of 'never done'. The unusual use of whammy bar on \\"Oily Water\\" and half cocked restfullness of \\"Blue Jeans\\" are examples of the brilliant carry through of the album. The intermission, commercial break, and secret tracks only make the album more fun to pop into your player. If you like Blur, get this album. Also, if your not a rubber necked pot of ear grease, at least give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blur's best","review":"This is, in my opinion, the best album Blur has ever recorded. Its sound is most similar to that of The Great Escape ... this is a polished, well-thought album with (unlike Leisure) good production and (unlike Parklife) soul. The songs are, for the most part, slow-paced and relaxing, with sharp social commentary. I'd list standout tracks if there weren't so many ... this is an album you can listen to the way through -- and then press play again! (Plus, in the days of 12 or 14 track albums, who can resist the bargain of the N. American version -- boasting 19?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Life Is Beautiful","review":"When I first bought this CD, I immediately disliked it. As a follow-up to Leisure I thought it was weak. But slowly the weird, singular style of this group and it's pop songs with their seemingly disjointed chords began to grow on me. Much credit needs to go to bassist Alex James for making sense of the experimental, unorthodox key changes.Standout tracks include 'Pressure On Julian', 'Starshaped', 'Chemical World', 'Miss America', 'Villa Rosie', and 'Turn It Up'. Also included are three songs which were on CD singles: 'Pop Scene', 'Peach', & 'When The Cows Come Home' all of which are interesting.I love this band because it has a great sense of humor (as heard on 'Coping' and on the funny break ditties) which is sorely lacking in most of today's modern life.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blur's triumph","review":"And they said Blur would never make it. After Leisure (which wasn't very good but still rocks my ass), they wandered,they got drunk,they played clubs and bars while getting drunk AND got criticised for it, but Blur are back with a vengeance. Crammed with intelligence, wit and cynicism, MLIR is Blur's best album IMHO. It opens with the classic \\"For Tomorrow\\" and burrows deep into modern England like an unrelenting mole. Other worthy songs include Blue Jeans, Chemical World and Popscene (on the US version)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Blur album...","review":"I think this is Blur's best. It has more rocking songs on it, later Blur albums get a bit too arty and weird. \\"Colin Zeal\\" is my favourite, its kind of a Bowie influenced song, and it rocks hard.

After they hit the self-destruct button in 1992 they had to re-assess their musical ideals. These new ideals spawned MLIR. The albums opening track 'For Tommorrow' is one of the decades greatest tracks. What a start. Following that you have the punk-like 'Advert', the pop genius of 'Starshaped', the stirring 'Oily Water', the heavy aggression of 'Coping', I could go on... This album I would say also set the trend for the much respected BritPop scene. A benchmark album and one of the most important of the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Blur CD","review":"If you cant choose what Blur CD to get, GET THIS ONE!

The good picture quality, the incredible voice acting, and most imporantly, the great plot - the darkest and deepest of the five series of Sailormoon - more than justifies this purchase. The season starts out with an ominous vision - the people of the world have been petrified (turned to stone), including the Sailor Soldiers.

If they want to release a dub on DVD it should be a different one, but at least it is bilingual so you can view the original uncut Japanese version too. Anyone who thinks they love the dub so much and doesn't need to watch the original Japanese series, please give it a try because 99% of the time you'd probably change your mind after watching it. It is so much better and the story flows, unlike the dub where they edit out parts for time and \\"inappropriate\\" content for children (which there really isn't anything).

The dub is aimed at a much younger crowd then the original series was intented for. If you're older, I would highly suggest getting the original version. It is excellent. I would rate SMS as the second best Sailor Moon season (I personally thought that Stars was the best)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Both Worlds","review":"Long before dubbed episodes of S and Super S came out, I had gotten my hands on subtitled versions of those series's. I have to admit, the dubbed Sailormoon does stray somewhat from the original version; however, the dubbed version of the S and Super S series's are much better than the original DIC dubs of the first two series's. As with the features, I expect Pioneer to include the original and the dubbed tracks on the DVD. Whether you like the dub or the original, this DVD should satisfy both needs.

Since I'm not the origional owner they won't do anything for me.Update: After a lot of talking and writing the departments listed on the Motorola website they have agreeed to take the unit back and refund what I paid for it. This was a surprise to me and actually I wanted them to repair or replace it but this is fine with me. Since I bought it used I am very surprised they would go this route instead of repair/replacement. This unit has been discontinued."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Lemon...Motorola should be prosecuted for selling it !!","review":"Like Rich Lo, I bought my first Motorola HDT101 from Circuit City, took it home, plugged it in....and nothing, completely dead. I should have simply gotten a $300 refund and bought a different HD receiver, but instead I foolishly accepted another new unit in exchange. The second HD101 functioned beautifully, for a while, but occasionally would \\"lock up\\" showing only 0000 on the screen until it was unplugged, allowed to cool, and restarted. This went on for several months until it finally died completely.So now I am stuck with an admittedly defective product that Motorola will not repair or replace, and since Circuit City has gone out of business, I can't even demand a refund from them. LESSON 1: Read the Amazon reviews before buying, it can save you a lot of money and frustration. LESSON 2: Avoid Motorola products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thing is junk","review":"I had this thing for little less than a year, got it from a local Circuit city and the first one after about a week had problems so I exchanged it.The 2nd lasted a bit longer but now will not turn on without displaying four zero's.

Often, errors were simple spelling or grammatical oversights, though occasionally would result in new meanings for entire paragraphs. Honestly, I believe the content of this text could be fully covered (if you are reading for a class) in a matter of weeks and a few chapters. The book was expensive and I quit reading before I made it halfway through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't worth the price I paid","review":"First of all, it is very difficult to find instructional DVDs on the subjects of gift wrapping and gift baskets. I was excited when I first found this because I thought it would provide inspiration and some additional instruction. Unfortunately, it only gave me limited inspiration. I thought that it might give me some more how-to instruction but was seriously disappointed that it only taught me how to measure a box to wrap a gift and nothing more. If that wasn't bad enough the bad jokes, crass wisecracks and just unnecessary humor was extremely distracting to the purpose of the DVD (I don't even think she smiled during the whole DVD). If the \\"host\\" spent more time on the instructional and left out her horrible wisecracks this might have actually been a decent instructional video. I believe the author has good information to share but it seems that I need to buy the book in order to get it.

A stellar B movie cast of stars who are relatives of big name actors (McQueen, Norris, Swayze) and a really enjoyable none too serious plot.

Dom Swayze is a guy who survived a previous death ring hunt and is now living in a cave wearing the same clothes for 6 months. Norris is the expert they call in to be hunted this time around, and Chad McQueen is his mate Skylord Harris who wants to come to his rescue.

Jennifer Warnes, a country singer, singing the songs of Leonard Cohen, whose poetry is studied in universities, including the words to a number of his songs, i.e., \\"Suzanne,\\" \\"The sisters of mercy,\\" So Long Marianne,\\" etc.On this album, you'll hear tunes like \\"Bird on a wire,\\" \\"Joan of Arc (with a special guest vocal by Leonard Cohen), \\"Song of Beradette\\" & of course the title tune, \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" which I onsider to be a masterpiece.

There's just nothing here. Buy something else, anything else, involving Leonard Cohen for a peek at a wonderful songwriter.

It does have 2 speeds and the high setting does produce strong airflow but directional options are limited and - again - it's simply too loud for an office setting where others are around.

The book is filled with extreme self-pity and a tremendous lack of appreciation for the medical community.

Many of the nurses and doctors who cared for this author will affirm strongly that she received excellent care. It is a very trying disease.

There are many others out there that face far worse then what Sue did, and their attitude was far better. Sue should be thankful that she is still alive.

It was hard for me to read, at times, because of this.However, there is some extremely valuable information here, especially in the book's constant reminders that many who cannot communicate in the usual ways are fully aware and have feelings, often strong ones. Some sensitivity is in order in any such situation, and I expect to retain that lesson for years to come.There is also some good information about Guillain-Barre, which I did not know anything at all about prior to reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book!","review":"As a nursing student, I found this book very fun to read.

This is a remake of all of his music. I bought it about 2 years ago and only listened to it once.

Sound is pretty good, considering the fact that it's a field recording from the mid 60's. The 'experts' who released this aren't sure if it's from 1965, or 1966? It's NEITHER, it's from 1967, and this wasn't the set they played at La Maison, anyway. Many of these songs *are* cover versions, of course, not original numbers, and frankly, they're *not* exactly A-list material, but they *are* the Elevators, and played and performed in the 'Vator's inimitable style..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after 5 uses","review":"I had been very happy with this player until is just quit working in the middle of my run. I turned it on, the sound was off - like it was coming from somewhere other than the ear buds. Two minutes into the song, the sound is just a dull hum and that's the end of the story. I tried to re-set it by taking the batteries out, no luck. I tried to work with it through the computer, but the driver for it wouldn't even recognize it. The manual is lacking, it says replace the battery and if that doesn't work pay to mail it back for repairs. Thankfully I was able to return it for a full refund and now I'm searching for a more reliable player. I had only used it about 5 times when this happened.

The slice I tasted was supposedly watermelon, but all I could taste was a bitter, sour fruit.

You talk to them and complain and they say even though the box says \\"you get 5\\" they reserve the right to mail out \\"3-5\\" instead. How is that even legal??? Liars/con-men/whatever. I am just thankful my daughter enjoyed the lower amount she was sent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I purchased this kit in June as a birthday gift. We were really looking forward to a great summer of discovery. However, the Insect Lore ad DOES NOT state that the larve cannot be shipped in the Summer to hotter parts of the US. There seems to be no provision to protect the larve with packaging for summer delivery to the Southwest. Looks like most positive reviews are from buyers who live in a cooler climate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Miracle of Nature","review":"I bought the Butterfly Pavilion for my grandchildren so we could watch butterfly metamorphosis together. It was very easy. We mailed the free certificate and about a week later we got our caterpillars with their special food. We watched our critters every day grow and eat. After they formed their chrysalids (or cocoons) we put them into the Butterfly Pavilion and waited for them to hatch. About 8 days later, they started coming out one-by-one. My youngest grandson (5 yrs.) was the first to witness the birth. \\"Nana, Nana, come see our 'butterfrys'\\". It was the most amazing experience. We let them go later and all had a good cry. I'd recommend this fine product to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for children to learn","review":"This caterpillar/butterfly set was a lot of fun. It allowed my 6 year old to understand the life cycle of a caterpillar changing to a butterfly. The only problem, (which isn't a big deal) is that the caterpillar would transform to a butterfly overnight when we were sleeping, so we were unable to see that process. But we are already ordering more caterpillars because our family had lots of fun with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butterfly pavilion","review":"HUGE, and perfect if you need to put in a plant that the caterpillars are enjoying eating so you can watch them grow and turn into a butterfly.

A great experience for a growing, wondrous mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for my little butterfly lover","review":"We purchased this for our daughter's 4th birthday, and I'm glad I ordered the pavilion and sent in the certificate so the cultures were in the house for her to see, because she loved opening it!The only issue she had was that she wanted the caterpillars to turn into butterflies RIGHT NOW, not in a few days which is typical for a 4-year old I'm being told.The customer service at Insectlore is very accomodating - our cultures were sent when the heat was soaring all over the country, so they sent me a certificate to redeem for more caterpillars once the temperatures drop to a reasonable level.I think we'll be ordering more items from this company in the future - I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"butterfly home","review":"My grandson loved this toy,learning about catapillers,butterflies.What they eat and how they form and grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Butterfly Pavilion","review":"We love this toy!!!

There is a great instruction and fact booklet with the kit. We ordered our caterpillars through the mail so that they would arrive in plenty of time to become butterflies and be released before our vacation. The caterpillars arrived in 3 weeks instead of 1 and only lived for a couple of days. We followed the instructions to the letter. I purchased this kit because of it's size and the opportunity to see at least 10 butterflies. In all fairness to the manufacturer, we haven't tried to obtain replacement caterpillars and will probably try again this spring. All in all this was very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun but yucky to clean","review":"we just loved watching our caterpillars turn into butterflies. lots of room for them to fly. but after you let them go you have to clean out the net. kinda gross. more durable than a box if you are going to do it more than once, though. 9 out of 10 became butterflies for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor customer service","review":"My son received this as a gift, and I have had too much trouble trying to order the larvae. The code for the larvae on the form in the box is not in the options on their website. I called their number during their business hours (per their website) and got a message saying to call back DURING THE TIME I WAS CALLING. I then tried to send an email via their webform, and it did not work either! I am going to try and find the larvae elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Project but research butterflies first!","review":"This was a neat project. We got all five catapillars and they did very well and got really big. The tricky part is transferring them to the butterfly house after they have formed cocoons. If any of them fall YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY hang them back up. Use a string or piece of tape. If you don't, they won't come out right. They cannot lay on the floor of the cage. The instructions said this was okay if one of them fell. This is not true. I read online to hang the one that fell back up, but it was too late. He came out deformed and only had one wing which was crumpled. They also need enough room to dry out their wings before they harden. They have to do this fast after they emerge. The poor deformed one could not get to the food source very well and he died sadly while the other 4 are still alive. It kind of made the experience not so great for me watching that one who seemed to be suffering and probably starved to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Larvae are not shipped during summer!","review":"My granddaughter saw an ad for the Butterfly pavilion on TV and requested it for her birthday. The shipper was timely, but there was a fatal flaw: They do not ship the larvae from June to September.I understand their reasoning if temperatures are too high, but there were times when they weren't. At the least, the company should make a point of informing consumers before they buy at the times during the year the larvae will be shipped.This was a huge disappointment to my granddaughter, and my rating has to be based on the fact that she could not use the pavilion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children's Easter Present","review":"This was a GREAT buy! I recommend this Butterfly Pavilion to anyone with young children. It was very easy to take care of and my children loved it! All of our caterpillars died in the first batch, but they were very quick to send us a whole new batch and they all lived! It was an awesome experience for my kids and I. I will definitely be ordering more butterflies come spring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Note: First set of caterpillars cost $5; all additional sets cost $15","review":"This is a great present/educational toy. My son received it for his third birthday, and even though he did not appreciate it perhaps as much as an older child might, he still found the metamorphosis process fascinating. We released the butterflies last week, and he still looks for \\"his\\" butterflies whenever we're outside.The reason this does not get five stars from me, however, is that all subsequent containers of caterpillars cost $14.99. (The pavilion comes with a $5 coupon for the first set of caterpillars.) This means that, over the span of a year, assuming you order four kits (not unreasonable when our first metamorphosis cycle ran approximately ten days, and children learn through repetition and anticipation), the entire experience will set you back $70. Pretty expensive for a mesh toy, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butterfly Review","review":"Great product perfect size for the 10 caterpillars that were shipped separately.

If she could only get one present then this was the one she wanted. So I spent $30 on a mesh hamper that has been sitting in her closet for almost a month - untouched. The coupon for the butterflies was redeemed online over three weeks ago and not a word from Insect Lore on the larvae. The \\"customer service\\" is TERRIBLE so say the least. There is no customer service. You have to submit a message online and hope they will actually read it and write back. There is no phone service you can call. None of my messages have been answered.

For that, it has not been used as a kite properly.In general, the material is fine, the printing is fine, but it lacks details and it is rather small.I think it is an OK product to fly it up in the sky (which it's its purpose) but does not have the realistic details I have seen in others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Careful What You Wish For","review":"ISBN 0590494473 - Samantha's a terrible basketball player but she's on the school team anyway - only because she's tall. Her height gets her attention she'd rather not have, especially from Judith. Judith makes fun of her all the time, and Samantha's tired of it. So when she meets a woman who offers her three wishes, Samantha can't resist aiming those wishes at Judith. She doesn't really believe the woman can make wishes come true... until one DOES come true... and things don't turn out quite the way that Samantha thought they would.Not exactly a novel idea, this story's been told many times before, but Stine does a nice job of making it appealing to young readers. The ending is cute, not scary, but it doesn't take anything away from the book. Worthwhile, but don't knock yourself out to find a copy unless you're a serious Stine fan.- AnnaLovesBooks"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crazy Gypsy Woman","review":"This book is a page turner, because it is very intresting.

It was the first series of books I ever read. At the time they were the only books I woul read. Some of them were good. This was one of the worst that I did read. My advise is, if you like R.L. Stine, read his books. Don't tie yourself down to him. There are many better or equally good authers. Read the classics. Read \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\", and \\"The Dark is Rising\\" chronicle and other classics. If you don't like these books, read \\"Animorphs\\". They are good too. Just remember, ignore the reading level ratings on the back of some books, and read all genres. Reading makes you more intelligent.

But I was disappointed on many levels.One thing that bugged me throughout was the author's use of the Greek names EXCEPT with the God of the Vine. He should have been Dionysus, NOT Bacchus! Nor was I remotely fond of the way one of the most popular of the Greek gods was used in this book. Actually, I flat out hated that aspect.And the end was a horrible disappointment. I consider it a relatively unhappy ending and the way that Artemis handled the final crisis in Vegas was incomprehensible. And again, not seeing the happy ending for her subplot either.All in all, it left me disappointed and unwilling to take a chance on any further books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I skipped to the end","review":"I really tried to finish this book. I liked (sort of) her other goddess books but this one was a chore to read. Apollo was just to bland and whishy washy -Artemis stole the book from him.

This book never gets too directional or limiting (i.e. you should never marry someone with green hair, etc.), but guides you through what makes a solid relationship, and what might make for a bumpy road. I had wandered through the dating world always wondering what I was supposed to be looking for, and I believe this book will help me become more focused.I'm not Christian, and I had worried that this book might be too \\"preachy,\\" but was pleasantly suprised when religion was mentioned more in a spiritual sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive design!","review":"Someone thought this armband design through, and it's well made of sturdy materials as well.

For this it's perfect.And finally, in response for those raters who mentioned it's too light and moves when it's turned on, the on-off button takes much less force if you press the outside edge - not the center.I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but great for small spaces","review":"So, the good: iIt's got a very small footprint, which made it perfect for my cube. Even when oscillating, it only takes up a few square inches of precious, precious desk space, and it blows a decent amount of air.And the bad: the high speed makes a little bit of a whining noise.

Unfortunately, I am definitely the exception here. It worked fine at first, but after around 6 months, it started becoming increasingly noisy. Given that I had this in the bedroom, it didn't make for a comfortable night's sleep. In about the 8th month, I had picked it up while cleaning and later found that when I turned it on, the noise level had escalated and it didn't seem to work properly. Once again being the exception to other reviewers, I actually had a much better experience with the Brookstone MiniMax fan. It's still going strong and unlike the Lasko fan, you can set 1,2 and 3 hour intervals before auto shut-off. Even without that feature, I would have been happy with Lasko if it hadn't burned out on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"If you use it on high it is too loud to sleep next too on a night stand, low will do the trick and move some air, however after 3 months of use it started to develop a loud chatter, I tried to shake, slap, and blow it out with an air compressor.

I bought this for my bedroom to help cool down my room so I can sleep, it was too loud, I could not sleep to it. Also, the buttons are too bright. They are a bright blue when the fan is on, and it lit up my entire room. Another reason I couldn't sleep.

But this one was so loud, I ended up returning it. It had a high pitch to it, especially on the High setting. Also, it started stuttering on the 2nd day when I had it in the oscillating mode. I returned it, and got the Ozeri Breeza. Much quieter, puts out a lot more air, if you want it, and had 3 settings instead of 2.I will say one thing for the Lasko. It is small. So if space is limited, and you don't mind keeping it on the low setting, it might be a good option for you.

The unit has two speeds and the high setting is practically speaking, too loud if you are on the phone. Low speed even is quite a bit louder than any computer cooling fan. This fan is not a personal or small office fan unless you are okay with a constant whir in your ear. The sound from it even pitches up and down when oscillating.

It is not super stable, so an errant bump with my notebook toppled it, and it was squeaky and noisy through the rest of the day, but that has gone away.It's still the quietest fan in my office, whether its on high or low. Both settings satisfy me for airflow in this size of fan, it chills me out readily after my daily walks outside in the 99+ degree Texas heat, though the buttons are a pain and require lots of squeezing with my hand around the whole unit.

Lee's daughter said he ever feared, and R.E. Lee when asked who was the greatest Union General, he said McClellan by a longshot,) and he could have ended the Civil War in its first year (with some well deserved help from Lincoln) or else Lincoln the subject of so many myths was right.But then, how many remember that he did the same to the General who won at Gettysburgh, fired him.

Two bonus tracks add to the pluses, though the alternate take of \\"Rotation\\" is pretty flabby. And, the album had been resequenced by Herb himself, although I can't figure out why.

Herb's passionate trumpet playing is quite pleasant to the ears as the little extra effects that he produces goes along way towards making each song special. Beyond The Rain is my personal favorite track as Herbie's trumpet and the backing arrangement and special effects really make this song into a symphony. Each song has its own special qualities although Love Is can drone a bit with the over repetitive vocals. Rotation does have a little too much synthesizer in spots.

I first read a page of it during a boring sermon at church, at a time when my marriage was going downhill. It sucked me in so fast I couldn't put it down. It was a shocking experience to read my entire life story written by complete strangers <grin>. It has a very straightforward style, but I think it's also easy enough reading that a teenager could understand it. The mix of psychology and scripture was exactly what I needed, and I don't know if I could have accomplished effective healing without it. The book is effective alone or in a group setting. My church even used it in place of a Sabbath School class: While everyone else was in groups studying Daniel and Revelation, I was in a group studying codependancy from a biblical perspective.

I have been in many, many romantic relationships that ended in heart break, it is not what I wanted for my life. I knew it wasn't all my fault, or all their fault, but why?

Also, a few of the tunes have some more annoying than not vocals in the mix. It's all too repetitive with no sense of mood or ambience, no build up of tension and release... just basically some sounds and rhythms mixed together with no sense of purpose.

Seeing that it had been made into a movie, I bought it. I wasn't disappointed. Although a lot of time is spent documenting the runner's social/economic conditions, it ultimately makes sense in the context of the ending. I particularly liked the way the story shows the raw underbelly of poverty/social stigma (in England) and how people deal with it. From gleefully spending a loved ones insurance money, to stealing a car for fun, the story pulls no punches. It becomes easy to identify with the protagonist. The movie never veers from the novel in any significant way. It is all too clear why the runner does what he does at the end, despite knowing exactly what will result for him. I found the acting and filming superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"the loneliness of the long distance runner","review":"This film belongs to the angry young men generation of the fifties and sixties.

I had to pull the drawer out entirely and flip it over to see that even though the drawer was not over full just a row of neatly lined up bicycle tools the staples had come loose and the bottom was sagging and therefore not opening as it was catching on the drawer below it.

Yes, the water does accumulate but the unit never shuts off. It overflows until a human shuts it off.The first night I ran this in my bedroom, I awoke to about a 6-foot circle of very wet carpeting. I drained the tank manually (very difficult to do without spilling even more water) and then was stupid enough to try it a second night.
