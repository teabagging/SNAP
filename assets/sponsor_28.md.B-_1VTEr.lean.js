There are lots of cases/sleeves for purchase that will do this, but I didn't want a case or a sleeve. The first thing that came to mind was a cook book stand. However, who wants to look like a weirdo carrying around a cook book stand? After a handy search on Amazon, I came across this little guy. After a day or so of contemplating and shopping, I decided to get it.As always, shipping is pretty fast so I received it in only a few days. It folds very nicely into a small plastic package. It's adjustable so that you can use your tablet in portrait or landscape mode. It doesn't slide around on the table. It's light for ease of carrying. All three legs adjust so you could use it for other things...like maybe an actual cook book!If you're looking for a stand alone stand for your tablet (or cook books), for the money, this little bad boy is a nice addition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this for my Nook Color","review":"Overall, I'm very happy with this little stand. It's cheap in price, compact, portable, and just simply does what I need. Of course if I could change some things, I would like to have the upper support be divided in 1/3's rather then 1/2 in order to position the upper portion so that it's more in contact with my Nook as I like to keep it pretty upright, and this stand doesn't seem be made for that. Also, I think that if the base legs were given a hinge in the middle, then it would also fit smaller tablets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tablet Stand (mine: BlackBerry PlayBook).","review":"- Stunning industrial design with a tight and utilitarian form factor.- Solid construction.- The padding behind where the Tablet sits on the stand is cushioned enough and provides scratch resistance.- May work for any kind of Tablet.- An accessory well worth its money and into the future (for all the upcoming hand held devices that may release)."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent buy","review":"simple, elegant, and portable. it works perfectly with my playbook and should work well with any tablet. given the price, it is hard to go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compact stand","review":"I use this stand with both my original iPad and my iPad3.

I use it with my iPad in an Apple Case. The best use for me is reading a book in bed. I use it with the Logitech Notebook Lapdesk; between the two I am much more comfortable now. I see using it on the plane as well.The only con I have is that it still doesn't meet my need of raising the iPad up high enough to reduce neck strain. In all my research, I had yet to find anything that comes close...until CES in Vegas hit and Joby announced their new Gorilla products for the iPad.

Anytime a loud noise goes through it (i.e. a gunshot during a dvd movie) the volume cuts out for several seconds. Also if you adjust the volume knob the volume cuts out and you get white noise until you jiggle the knob and turn it back and forth several times and even then you don't generally end up with the volume level you were aiming for. However, if you insist on buying it anyway it has almost everything you could ask for in a stereo receiver assuming you get one that functions properly. It even has phono jacks for those of us who still play records. However, it does not come with a remote control.

Even though I could barely hear it, both of my cats immediately got very scared, ran out of the room, hid, and wouldn't come back until the buzzing offender was removed from the area. The sound this brush emits is extremely irritating to cats (don't know about dogs, but my guess is, dogs as well), so I wouldn't bother with this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest!","review":"Andreas Schiff does an excellent job with these pieces, but my intent is really more to make sure that no one misses hearing the music itself. These are mostly masterpieces among masterpieces, among the greatest piano music ever written. I would say that the Rondo in A Minor, K. 511 and the Gigue in G Major, K. 574 especially stand out. The latter, by the way, has been even further enhanced via a superb orchestration that forms the opening movement of Tchaikovsky's Mozartiana Suite, with the later composer's sense of Christmas-Eve like anticipation perfectly in tune (I believe) with Mozart's own intentions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Springy\\" enough","review":"These tongs are not \\"Springy\\" enough.

This is the original one, which is closest to the vibe of King Harvest's original (which I also like having now heard it).

He compares the fallacies in the bombing campaigns throughout the fifties to the philiosophies on Von Clausewitz' \\"On War.\\" Never were there any political motives in the campaigns led by Sean Russel.

I also liked the Jack in the box stories. He always gave off an upbeat Batman mixed with Joker style. It's a small dead for me, but it's kind of cool to see a black guy from the city as a superhero and not be the brooding type.

Throw in all of the voices, sounds, songs, and ability to interface with a computer, and you have an unbelievable deal.The only down side is that the software it comes with doesn't load on my Mac :-(, but since most things don't, I wouldn't downgrade it just for that. It interfaces with Garageband, which is the software I already use, so that's enough for me.Oh, and talk about fun. I'm got this to practice my piano lessons at home, and the first day it came I had so much fun I went to bed with sore wrists. I kept trying out practicing my scales with different voices.

Linked does not go off in either extreme: spirituality or quantum physics. The grounding is thoughtful and welcome.My only contrary thought and I thank the author for raising it in me, is how do we unlink? Is it possible? Is it welcome?

The first track, \\"Metal Crusade\\", is straight forward metal with a little melody mixed in. This song also has the best guitar solo that I've heard from Lincoln. The next song, \\"Martyrs\\", is pretty much in the same style. There's a couple of other good ones, but none of them really have the power and heaviness as there earlier albums. The biggest reason for this is Steve Rowes singing voice has lost that extremely low growl as on \\"Scrolls...\\". All in all I'd say that this album is definately worth it.

The grandeur of metal should not be profaned by the taint of corrupt Christianity. Musically, these infidel cretins fail to deliver. The songs are simplistic, the vocals uninspired.

Indeed, cameras, computers and microchips today provide valuable input in the making of military strategy. However, one must remember that technology is useless when you don't have the men with the political willingness to undertake the risks associated with war. Doctrine, planning and human will are far more important factors in the business of waging war and defeating the enemy. Besides, for every technological breakthrough, there will always be flaws and weaknesses associated with such technology. A skillful adversary will always try to exploit those weaknesses for his own advantage. From this point of view, the Tofflers are too deterministic by putting their trust in technology as a determinant for victory or defeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not good enough","review":"Reading this book was rather like going into a 400 page Newsweek article.

I contacted Conair (the actual makers of this dryer) and was told that I will receive a replacement for the dryer, as long as I am willing to pay to ship it back, pay for the return shipping of a new dryer, and wait two to three weeks (AFTER they receive my dryer) for the replacement. As I told the customer service rep, that's a long time to be without a hair dryer. I'm giving this item two stars because it's great when it works, but the durability is questionable and the warranty is far less than stellar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quick dryer...","review":"My wife has used this new dryer a few times and reports it's not quite as efficient as her old Conair dryer. After all the positive reviews, I was expecting a better result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulls back my hair","review":"Nice package, free miny oil buttle sample, nevertheless I feel is not what it offers, it pulls back my hair and it doesn't shine.

It has alot of power and that is what I like out of of a blow dryer. It does not take long at all to blow dry my hair. I don't have long hair, but it's thick. The only con about the blow dryer is that it is \\"heavy\\", however you really do get used to it. The price was very reasonable. I'm thinking about buying one for my daughter. Oh, and my husband uses a blow dryer to dry his body off after his showers, and I heard him say \\"that's a nice blow dryer\\" ...so even from a mans perspective it's nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dissapointed","review":"This is a nice dryer but two big things that are not right for me. The hot setting is not that hot and the high setting is too high. I have to dry my hair on the low setting but since the hot doesn't get that hot it still takes a while to dry my hair. I have super straight hair and when I use the high setting my hair gets so knotted its annoying (and painful). I'll keep using this because I threw out the box before giving it a week to try out but I will be replacing this at some point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dryer","review":"I hate drying my hair so when I borrowed this from a friend and my hair was dried in record time I came home and ordered it. Much quieter and more effective than my last dryer. I still hate drying my hair, but now it takes less time and looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I agonized over which hair dryer to buy, and I'm pretty happy I went with this one. I picked it because it's a good brand for a good price with decent reviews. It's very sturdy and it has the look of a more expensive, professional dryer. The cord is very long, which is a huge plus. The airflow is strong and doesn't get too hot. It's not the quietest or fastest hairdryer ever, but it does the trick. The only thing that drives me nuts is that I keep hitting the cool button all the time. It's in an awkward place and depresses easily. Overall, it's a strong play if you're looking for a simple, effective dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this hairdryer!","review":"I first used this dryer at my yoga studio and fell in love with it. So, I found it here and bought it and still love it nearly a year later. It dries my thick hair relatively quickly and reduces frizz, which is a big plus. It doesn't feel too hot and it has three heat settings so you can reduce the level of heat. The dryer is pretty heavy and that's fine by me, but do be prepared for that. It's not what I'd call quiet, but the sound of the fan isn't that high pitched squeal that some have so it's less annoying than some.Update 1/31/13: I have had this hair dryer for two years now and use it daily. It's still going strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salon style blow dryer","review":"I LOVE this blow dryer. It takes half the time to blow by my hair and I get salon results with this thing. I am terrible at doing hair and with this dryer I have been able to give my hair more volume and eliminate my flat iron. It helps control strays and gets hot enough to truly style your hair with the round brush. It is a little heavier but you get used to it really quickly. I would also recommend this one with the on\\\\off button because my friend has the other style and you shut it off all the time with your hand when using it. The sliding buttons are key."},{"rating":"2","title":"This dryer rocks!","review":"Love the hair dryer. It's my second one. The first one was a hand-me-down from a family member. I don't know how long she used it, but I used it for 3 years before I bought another. It dries faster than any other dryer around - and leaves my fine hair with more volume than other products. I love this thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT!","review":"I like this hairdryer, it's my first new one in about 10 years so from what I'm used to it feels light and easy to grip. I agree with other reviewers that the hot setting is too hot (as in burns your hands if you want to run them through your hair while you dry, would burn your scalp if you kept it in the same place too long) and the warm setting isn't hot enough to dry hair quickly, but i think after so many years of 2000w hairdryers and ceramic straighteners I can take the heat in exchange for drying my very thick hair super fast. I'd still recommend this product and am happy with my purchase :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT blew me away","review":"My wifes hair takes forever to dry, She burns up normal hair dryers in as little as two weeks.

I will have this for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dryer for the Price","review":"This blow dryer gives the feel and results of a salon dryer at a much more reasonable price. It dries my hair more quickly and leaves my hair much softer than any other dryer I have owned. Some of the other reviews mentioned that it was heavy. It felt that way to me at first, too, but within days I didn't even notice. I highly recommend this dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER","review":"I got this hairdryer for my birthday last summer. I have very very thick hair that takes over 45 minutes to dry and straighten. Using this hair dryer, it cuts it down to 20 minutes. No joke. I love it!! My sister who has really really thin hair, used it when she stayed over one night and she was floored at how much volume she was able to get out of her hair. So I bought her one for her birthday. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hair dryer I've ever had!","review":"This hair dryer is the best one I've ever bought and used, especially for the price! It's a very high quality hair dryer that leaves my thick course hair smooth and frizz free. I still use a flat iron after my hair is dry to get my hair silky smooth, but people with thin hair would be just fine without a flat iron. My hair is down past the middle of my back so the 2000 watts puts out a lot of air and drys it within 5-7 mins. The only thing I don't like about the hair dryer is that it's a little heavier than most dryers, other than that, it's great and totally worth the $30 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but heavy!","review":"This is a great hair dryer, but it is heavy. I was looking for something to make staightening my long hair a little faster, but the size and weight of the dryer makes it difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Died Within a year","review":"This hairdryer was very heavy and I did not like it from the start.

I would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt work!","review":"I bought this hair dryer thinking it was the best for this price. I used it twice and really liked it. The third time it stopped working.

It was surprisingly affordable, and it works really well. It has a warm setting, which I really like, and it is powerful but quiet. My hair comes out silky and less static-y than usual. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I found this 40 years ago","review":"I love it! I have very thick hair and although it is a little heavy who cares? It dries in half the time and the frizz is gone. I was even asked what I did different to my hair. I don't dread washing my hair anymore. Am thinking of ordering one for my daughter. Fabulous dryer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great dryer but the paint peels","review":"I like the way it dries my hair. It gets very hots and dries fast. However, the black covering is peeling off the dryer and every time I dry my hair I have black pieces all over. What mess!! It is heavy too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful hair dryer","review":"I find this hairdryer to be very powerful and dries hair very fast. It is more than what I wanted to spend but I think it is worth it.The only con is that it is heavier than my previous one. Otherwise, since I received it a week ago it has been very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet","review":"I loved this hairdryer when I got it. It is the quietest dryer I've ever heard. It dries hair really fast. The only problem is that it only lasted about 6 months before it started shutting off by itself or just not turning on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great dryer...when it works!","review":"I was very pleased with this hair dryer for the 6 months that it worked. It has a lot of power and is exactly what I was looking for. However, 6 months after I purchased it I turned it on and...nothing! I contacted customer service who informed me that the dryer was still under warranty and they would be happy to send me a new one. The part that really makes me an unhappy customer is that I have to pay for the shipping of their defective product back to them and send a check for $3 to get a new one shipped to me. The customer service rep informed me that it is a limited warranty which means I have to pay for shipping?! It seems to me that when you sell a defective product that is covered under warranty you should incur all costs associated with the replacement of your product. I have read too many reviews for this dryer that say it only lasts for 6 months. For the price you are better off purchasing another brand that will still work in a year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after LESS than 2 months!","review":"Like so many other reviewers on on this product, this dryer suddenly stopped working for me also. I was satisfied with this hair dryer for the 6 weeks or so that I actually got to use it. It has a lot more power than your average hairdryer and does seems to cut down on drying time. It is a little heavier than my previous hairdryer but that didn't bother me. I really liked the extra long cord. BUT, this hairdryer completely stopped working on May 19... I purchased it on March 28. I tried it on every plug in my bedroom and it still wouldn't work... other appliances worked as normal in the outlets. There is a 30-day return policy, so this was basically a waste of $50.00 for me. If you still feel compelled to try this dryer, buy it from a seller with a better return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I wanted a hair dyer that is high powered. And this one is, but it is also heavy (for a hair dryer)...so not good for traveling. I would buy this one again, I like the cold shot button."},{"rating":"1","title":"BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer","review":"When my Vidal Sassoon dryer of 4 years needed to be replaced, I reviewed many -and ordered the Babyliss-- hate it! It is very heavy, awkward to use, not well balanced, overly expensive and does not get nearly as hot on hot as the Sassoon- and the placement of the cool button is terrible.Will be putting this in the Goodwill box. If you are a body builder- this may be ok- However, I think it is a piece of overrated junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dryer I've ever owned.","review":"This is by far the best dryer I have ever owned and the cost is well worth it (and it's not even the most expensive). It is quiet and dries my hair so fast. The hot setting isn't too hot and the warm setting is perfect for my 5 year old. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a fast-drying hair dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE","review":"I bought this because my old hair dryer caught on fire in my hand - no joke. I wish I had upgraded sooner. This literally dries my hair in half the time, leaving me about ten extra precious morning minutes to get ready. It gets super hot and works well with a round brush to get my hair smooth. Only complaints - it is a bit on the heavy side (I personally don't mind because I am not drying forever, but if you have thick hair you might) and the \\"cool\\" button is RIGHT where my hand goes. Going to take some getting used to so I stop accidentally hitting it. Otherwise, perfect, makes me love my hair so that's priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Dryer","review":"I have been very happy with this dryer. It gets very hot and the Cold burst button works fine. I do not blow dry my hair every day but when I do I notice less fly aways then my previous dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working after a few months","review":"This dryer was nothing special when it worked but now is totally worthless - worked fine one day, won't turn on the next. I tried using the reset button but still nothing. So now it's in the trash and I'll buy a new one. Save your receipt if you buy this dryer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for straight/dry hair","review":"I was so excited when I recieved this hair dryer in the mail-I spent hours looking up reviews to find the perfect hair dryer, so I really wanted to like this one. Unfortunately, I tried this hair dryer 4 times, but just couldn't get myself to like it. I have naturally straight, medium thickness, color treated (dry) hair so I'm looking for shine/moisture and body in a hair dryer. This hair dryer gave me neither. In fact, I compared it to my old conair travel hair dryer (blew dry half my hair with the conair, half with the babyliss) and I found the babyliss side of my head to be much dryer with many more flyaways than the other side of my hair. The babyliss did nothing for my hair body either, and instead kind of gave it a weird square shape. All in all I would say that maybe this hairdryer works for people with curly or very thick hair, but if you do not have this hair type BE VERY WARY OF LISTENING TO THE OTHER REVIEWS ON HERE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This will blow the hair off your head! It's a little on the heavy side, but you only have to hold if for a few minutes. I have long, moderately thick hair and it's dry within 2-3 minutes. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Buy!.....or so I thought","review":"I just recevied my BaByliss Pro yesterday and I love it! The speed and the heat is perfect and it cut my drying time in half. I would have paid much more for this dryer. Less than $40?? This is a an amazing deal! Throw away your wimpy Revlons and Conairs and Vidal Sassoons and get this dryer!Only 4 months later and my beloved BaByliss has stopped working. Sometimes it will turn on. Sometimes it won't. When it does decide to turn on, there is no telling how long it will stay on. And once it shuts off it won't start up again for several minutes (if at all). Very disappointed because I really loved this dryer...for the few months that it worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmm","review":"the jury is still out on this one. I love that it dries my hair faster but it is way too heavy, the warm setting is not that warm, and it is very powerful. Im giving it a few more tries to see if I can control it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product !","review":"It works great for styling with a round brush, and is hot, but not too hot. It is also very quiet, despite its power. I love the attachment. I would definitely recommend this dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"fab","review":"love it! best hair dryer i ever bought by far. fantastic. made my hair so big! seriously worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional grade hair dryer","review":"This hair dryer dries my hair in half the time my old Conair did. Not only does it save time, my hair is soft and shiny after use. The only downside is that it is heavier than I expected so just as well I don't have to hold it for more than about six or seven minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hair dryer for the price","review":"I have never owned a professional dryer before, my most recent conair ion dryer died on me, and after much review I ordered this one. I've only owned the product a few days, but I'm happy with my purchase. It is definitely heavier than my last dryer, but it has amazing power, feels just like the one my stylist uses. It is quieter than my last. It dries my hair in less than 5 minutes on the warm setting. I can't use the hot setting for more than about 20-30 seconds before it becomes unbearable. So I've just stayed with the warm temperature setting. I do however have fine shoulder length hair, and it has always dried very quickly, but I can definitely tell a difference with this drier. My hair feels smoother and softer after drying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't heat up! BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer","review":"With all of the rave reviews, I figured this was THE hair dryer to buy. How could 300+ people be wrong? Well, from my experience, it isn't. Not only was the heating element dead right out of the box so all it blows is room temperature air but it's WAY heavy and unbalanced. They should call it the BaByliss POS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I will never buy a BaByliss hairdryer again. I paid $80 on sale at a beauty products store. Within four months the heat sensor kept coming on and turning the dryer off. It comes on after about one to two minutes use! I can't even finish my hair. What a disappointment for my first \\"quality\\" and expensive dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad design","review":"this is so hard to turn on and off and change desired drying settings. there is definitely a flaw in the design. smells like its burning all the time and also it's very heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 8 months","review":"This hairdryer worked great when first purchased - very powerful for its price.Unfortunately, 8 months later, the high speed setting no longer works. With long hair, this makes the dryer all but redundant unless you want to commit your entire morning to your hair. The rubber around the handle has also started to fray and peel. The dryer was never put under any more stress than you would expect - used to dry hair once every other day, stored in the bedroom away from steam and humidity.I can't recall if it came with a warranty (I assume it did; although the box, instructions, etc were lost during a move). If you do buy this dryer, I recommend keeping hold of all that information just in case. I emailed the seller to see if they could help on the warranty situation but never got a response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair Fryer","review":"I had been using an ionic hair dryer for years.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had such high hopes","review":"I'm being generous with my two stars. I have pretty thick, wavy, highlighted, long hair. This dryer just doesn't have the airflow needed to dry my hair without frying it. It does get hot (HEY! that's worth two stars, right?), but when not paired with powerful air flow, you're just baking your strands. I'm returning it. My drug store hair dryer works much better. I am SO disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dryer at an excellent price","review":"With curly, thick hair in Florida summers, a burned out blow dryer is nothing short of a crisis. I had to shuffle through reviews in moments and place an order as soon as possible to recover. Out emerged the BaByliss. This product was exactly what I expected and better. Much lighter than my older dryer, warms up in an instant, nice matte finish that repels unsightly fingerprints, and power that can be wind tunnel strong or breezy light. The slide controls versus switch was also a huge savior, preventing the many times I would often shut off the dryer or change settings on other models. For the price, you simply can't beat it. It's definitely a keeper :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Value for a Great Hair Dryer","review":"I purchased this after reading a bunch of reviews for this product on Amazon. Gotta say this is a top end Pro dryer for a fraction of the price. The feel is great, the finish on the product is fantastic. It has nice weight to it too. Definitely feels and looks like a high end pro level hair dryer. Its quiet yet very powerful and has setting from med, to high with settings from hot, warm and cold. You could easily pay three times as much for a hair dryer of this quality. My hat is off to BaBayliss for creating such a fine product. I know that this will last for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I recently purchased this dryer and I'm very happy with it. I like to blow dry my hair immediately after showering while its soaking wet, and I've gone though several cheaper dryers that just take too long to dry my hair. This dryer isn't much more expensive than the cheaper hairdryers, yet it greatly cut down my drying time and gets my hair completely dry in just three minutes. It also makes my hair softer and more shiny. Yes as other reviewers have mentioned it is heavier than other dryers, but you get used to it. I would definitely recommend this dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hair Dryer","review":"BaByliss makes the best blow dryers hands down and their prices seem to be getting better and better. At 2000 watts, the speed of this dryer makes straightening my curly/wavy hair a breeze with minimal heat time/resulting damage to my hair. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing lie or dangerous device?","review":"If you buy this thinking this is a 2000W dryer, please keep this in mind. Mathematically that is not possible. A 2000W hair dryer running on a 110 circuit would draw 17 Amps of power. The cord and plug used are designed for a maximum load of 15A. So either their marketing folks have lied, which I hope is the case for SAFETY reasons, or this hair dryer is designed to draw more current than it's socket was designed for. To truly draw 17A would require a 20A circuit and a 20A rated outlet with the weird plug that has a keyed sideways prong.This is probably a good hair dryer but truth in marketing is gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too heavy!","review":"This hairdryer is beyond heavy.

Before I ordered this I looked at BBB and they were selling the same hairdryer in red for $79.99 and when I found it on amazon for $32.99 a bought it right away. It is really hard to find a hair dryer for this price around 2000 watt and I highly recommend the Babyliss BAB2000 if you are looking for a fast hair dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy but great!","review":"I have thin, color-treated, medium-texture chin- to shoulder-length hair (it varies on the season) and this dryer is THE best! It is a little heavy but so worth the $30. I'll never try a $200 hair dryer and the $20 Revlon/Conair/etc dryers don't do nearly as good a job!

Anyone who pays $300.00, $200.00 $100.00 or even $50.00 dollars for a hair dryer is throwing their money out the window. Anything with less than 2000 Watts should be purchase at the drugstore for less than $20.00 dollars. This particular model is Amazing. I agree with the other comment that it is a little heavy but not only your drying time is cut in half with this dryer, but also your hair looks amazingly shiny, not dull and dry as with other low quality dryers from the supermarket. This product truly works well and the price is out of this world(extremely low) for the quality and excellent performance of this item. Extremely happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"hot is too hot, warm is not warm","review":"Like many other reviewers, I have long, thick hair that can take a while to dry. I do think this one dries my hair faster than other dryers, but there are two things I don't like about it. One is that the airflow is so forceful that it tangles my hair while I'm drying it. I have to brush it constantly to get the tangles out while its drying. The other is that the \\"hot\\" setting is too hot--I can't leave it on that setting very long without feeling like its burning my hair and skin. The warm setting doesn't seem warm at all. Its what I'd call \\"cool\\". I want something in between, but this dryer doesn't have it. Overall, a disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair Dryer stopped working after less than 6 months!","review":"Hair dryer worked well for the first five months, then started shutting off on its own every time I turned it on.

I used it twice, it worked great, cut my drying time in half. It is heavier than any other hair dryer I have had, but due to the decreased drying time...I decided to overlook the weight. Then, for the third time out of the drawer I was drying my 4 y/o daughters hair. Thank God I was drying the back of her head, because after about 30 seconds it made a very loud pop & shot out sparks that hit her in the back of the neck. It burned her, did not leave a large mark but again thank God we weren't drying the front of her hair -it might have hit her in the eyes instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last a year!","review":"I ordered this product based on reviews, and I must say I was somewhat disappointed that is wasn't as good as my last BaByliss.It is powerful, but it isn't as hot as my last dryer. As a result, it takes longer to dry my hair. I have very fine, thin hair, so this isn't a huge issue. However, if you have thick hair, it would definitely take longer.In addition, this dryer makes my hair much more flat than my last BaByliss.I do like the fact that they have changed the shape and place of the buttons. I don't inadvertently change the settings or turn the dryer off while drying my hair.It's a good dryer for the price, but I wish I had spent more money and bought one much like my last.11/5/10 Update:The dryer didn't even last a year!

Have not had any issues with power usage, but I wait to turn on my hair straightener after this is off. It is a little bit heavy, but nothing that cannot be managed with the shorter drying times. Feels very sturdy. The surface of the blood dryer is not slippery plastic like other dryers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"Seriously love this. I have really thick hair and I used to never dry my hair with a hair dryer because it takes for-ever. This one is just perfect. I don't know what kind of motor is in there, but it's pretty powerful, I'm betting I can use that motor to power a kid's go cart or something. Anyway, unlike most dryers out there, this dries my hair without frying it. I will not be trading this anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it cooked my hair","review":"When I first received this hair dryer, I thought it was great. It is not as heavy as I was worried it would be, and it dried my thick hair very fast on the high setting - manageable and with a shine. However, as I continued to use it on an almost daily basis, I noticed my hair getting drier and more brittle, less manageable - it just seemed damaged and unhealthy. I bought new shampoos thinking that might help, but it didn't. Finally, I resorted to using a different hair dryer, the Conair Infiniti. It takes slightly longer to dry, but my hair has quickly returned to its healthy state. Perhaps the high-heat, high-blower setting on the BaByliss was too much for my hair, but the lower settings took forever to do the job. At $50, this was an expensive mistake to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this hair dryer about six months ago. I loved how well it worked and how fast it dried my hair. And then, one day, it just stopped working. It's not worth the money for a hair dryer that only lasts six months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing results, incredibly fast","review":"I have coarse, dry, curly, color treated hair. To get it straight usually requires 30 minutes with a blow dryer, 30 minutes with a flat iron at 430 degrees, and waiting a day. I have had it chemically straightened to save time, but I worry about the chemicals. In just 30 minutes with this blow dryer my hair is straight and soft. I decided to buy it because of the overwhelming number of positive reviews and I'm so glad I did. It is heavier that what I'm used to, but I'm sure I'll get used to that. It's not \\"quiet\\", but it does make less noise than my previous dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Purchase.... as a gift for a friend","review":"I bought this hair dryer about a year ago and still love it!

Has cut both of our getting ready times in half!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut my drying time in half- hair looks healthier","review":"I love this hair dryer. Like some other reviews say, it's much heavier than I'm used to-- but i have only ever bought cheap dryers. When my last one broke in the move, I decided to try a step up- and it's worth it!My hair is long, thick and wavy and i HATE having to dry it. It used to take me 30 mins plus just to dry my hair, and I'd have to straighten it on top. This dryer had my hair dry in 15 mins! I still went over it with a flat iron, but 25 mins and my hair was done, as compared to almost an hour before hand.I love it--- if you have stubborn hair, you should try it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"This book was pretty good, well written. I was a little nervous reading it, I thought it might be stupid, but it was able to pull me in within the first few lines. All in all it's a good book! I couldn't put it down.

It'll make you think twice about exercising though. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I've had this unit for approximately a year now. I purchased it along with a Sony 42\\" Grand WEGA RP-LCD.This system is good for a small room, but it is not nearly loud enough for a normally-sized living room. The satellites don't become effective until you have the volume cranked to the 60s (out of 70) and the subwoofer doesn't pump out nearly enough bass.It's obviously tailored towards a casual user, which is perfect for the price. Wish I had just gotten something louder.Also, this system has 2 remotes: 1 for the receiver, and 1 for the DVD/VCR. You have to use both unless you get a universal.The Good:+ Cheap+ Includes all cables+ Easy to setupThe Bad:- WEAK POWER- 2 remotes: 1 for receiver, 1 for DVD/VCR- Subwoofer is sub-par. Not enough bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, not \\"Exactly\\" perfect, but still hella fun","review":"Some reviewers here are complaining about title screens, slightly off sound effects and not exact arcade translations.

Ava, the eldest of this clan, locates Jared Broderick, the Marquis of Middleton and heir to a dukedom and he marries her. She should feel lucky!! Especially in light of who she could have ended up married too. The endless mind games she played with Jared were not a sign of a smart go to gal who knows what she wants, which is I think was Ms. London was going for. Instead, she comes across as manipulative, which makes any romance with her and the actually very nice Jared unrealistic. A very poor romance. In fact, I would say a very frustrating one. Half way through any romance book, you have to be rooting for H/H to get together, declare their love and live happily ever after. In this one, you hope Jared can get a divorce!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I took 4 stars away when it collapsed on me.........","review":"I was on this thing with nail gun in hand and one of the casters broke and it sent me to the ground.......do you see a theme here?

I contacted Buffalo for a replacement but Buffalo said since could I not find the receipt that's not going to happen. They offered me \\"replacement\\" casters for $55, no other comment like \\"Sorry to hear that happened\\" or \\"I hope you weren't hurt\\", they just want more of my money for an inferior product.

It installed quickly and easily on my Win2000 Toshiba laptop. Windows recognized it and did all the work of installing the drivers. However, there are two issues i have with this product. First, there is no on/off switch, the only way to turn the hard drive off is to unplug it, otherwise it won't turn off, even if you shut down the computer. Secondly, the ac adaptor is so wide that it takes up 3 slots on my power strip, and while this doesn't affect the function of the drive it is still a pain. Overall though, i'm very happy with this drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"True 80s thrash metal","review":"I got the album a couple of years ago.I happen to like it very much, although some material can be a bit predictive. I'd say this band is a combination of Motörhead meets Carnivore and Venom. Basic 80s thrash with no thrills, but nice music to listen to when driving a car! The song Metal Forever is a Heavy Metal Anthem here in Germany and many people like it. Live, this band is really worth looking at, their show is filled with striptease, fire breathing and explosions. Like Venom meets GWAR.I give this CD 4 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"goddess of desire delivers","review":"Before I bought the cd \\"Symbol of Triumph\\" I read the one and only review which basically said that the cd [stunk], but I went ahead with my purchase intentions and was pleasantly surprised. I actually searched for other releases by the band. If you like Celtic Frost, The Meatmen (newer), Mentors, Green Jelly (the heavier stuff)- than you should like Goddess of Desire. They are very heavy with a moderate, yet varied tempo, crunchy guitar with plenty of backbone. They are in somewhat of a 80's black metal time-warp, but who could ask for anything more? That era remains thee best by far. Goddess is thy heavy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brad Paisley's Who Needs Pictures","review":"There are a few top dancing songs around now, including Brad Paisley's super good We Danced in this album and of course I Hope You Dance, elsewhere (which I've reviewed). Brad's CD also has He Didn't Have to Be which has a spiritual connection with both songs and talks to the heart and the Heartland. Now that the Big Election is coming up, I'm reminded of another dancing song, Harry and Beth Truman's Tennessee Waltz, Missouri style. Our family goes back to Missouri (among other places), and I've thought ever since Harry's days that his upset victory over Dewey had something to do with Country dance and the loneliness and exhaustion that it talks to. Dewey was the odds on favorite, and Country Harry won. It makes you think about the front runner today and the fact that the final decisions aren't made by speakers on Earth but by a Higher Authority upstairs who I think likes Country Dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"twangy, yet still Brad","review":"This is a good CD, but not like the Brad of today's radio.

Ever since hearing \\"He Didn't Have to Be\\" on the radio, I have loved all of Paisley's songs. He sings uptempo songs with witty lyrics as well as sentimental or religious tunes. He is also an accomplished musician, writing many of his own songs. He also plays a wicked guitar on the album's instrumental track, \\"The Nervous Breakdown.\\" This CD is a wonderful addition to any country collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Didn't Have to be","review":"I bought this cd after seeing \\"He Didn't Have to be\\" on CMT. \\"He Didn't Have to be\\" touched my heart and made me cry that night so when I bought this cd I was very excited. However, to be honest, other than that one song I really didn't like this cd much at all. I should have just bought the single and called it a day. Oh well, ya win some and ya lose some."},{"rating":"1","title":"rodeo clone","review":"Here he is, fresh-faced fodder from the Nashville clone factory, ripe and ready for the new country meat grinder. Not that this West Virginia native didn't work hard to get where he is. He's an accomplished songwriter covered by folks like Tracy Byrd and cowrote or wrote every song this debut, a rarity in this genre. But despite some notable moments of appropriately silly two-steppin' wordplay (Me Neither, Don't Breathe) and solid balladeering (Who Needs Pictures, In the Garden), Who Needs Pictures breaks no boundaries, tests no standards and bares no teeth. It's an above average debut but it still suffers from the same nagging predictability and benign qualities that have come to define Nashville at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME","review":"The song WE DANCED has inspired me to become a songwriter, because that song is so elementary, my 5 year old daughter could have wrote it.

There is no stopping this man!After hearing \\"He Didn't Have to Be\\" on the radio I bought this CD and was fairly surprised. I was expecting more of the same type of songs, but there are some real toe-tappers on here! \\"Me Neither\\", \\"Sleepin' on the Foldout\\", \\"Long Sermon\\", \\"It Never Woulda Worked Out Anyway\\", and \\"Don't Breathe\\" are upbeat, catchy tunes. The title track and \\"We Danced\\" are more like \\"He Didn't Have to Be\\" and they are all great!All in all, this is a great effort by Mr. Paisley, he takes great strides to maintain the traditional type of country music and it shines through on this disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rising Star","review":"Brad Paisley is without a doubt the best new male vocalist in country music. Brad is not only blessed with a great voice, he wrote or co-wrote every song on this album. It is so refreshing to find an artist who actually writes his own songs. The songs on this album are humorous, romantic, and touching: a fabulous variety of Brad's song-writing capability. Brad also has an amazing talent in his ability to play the guitar. This guy has the whole package: great looking, outstanding talent, and strong vocals. Brad Paisley is now my favorite country star. Thanks for sharing your talent with us, Brad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Needed this product when I am working out, very comfortable to wear, and provides the amount of support I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Briefs Great, Service Awful","review":"When I received the briefs they were what I'd hoped for, however they arrived more than a month after I ordered them.

But find a vendor other than 'International Joke'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book on the subject & well researched","review":"It's obvious by the book, that the author has done his research on a subject that is highly neglected in western circles. The reason why the author uses Kibi as a center of focus for his theoris on the origins of the Japanese imperial clan is because of its important location and interaction with ancient Korea at the time. The book is a good primer on further studies of ancient Korea/Japan interaction. I wish there were more books written in English on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy if you need S-Video out","review":"We bought this specifically for S-Video out. The box and specs on the outside mention S-Video out but fails to mention that the VHS will not output through S-Video.

It doesn't have a tuner which may be a bit of a drawback for those who want to record programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashed already","review":"The player would be acceptable were it not for an annoying defect of the DVD player, which re-plays every 5 secs or so. It is, of course, under guarantee, but the logistics involved in taking advantage of this from here make it impracticable."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Player Quit","review":"A refurbished unit of this model was purchased for me as a gift. It is easy to set up. It is a DVD player and a VHS recorder/player. I am not so much bothered by the lack of a TV tuner as I was not having a display to tell me the tape location of the VHS, which is handy when you are recording on tape from the TV. I had a Panasonic that split up the recordable area of the tape into five sections, beginning to end.As my title suggests, even more distressing was the fact that the DVD player quit recognizing DVDs a year after I received it. I tried using several wet and dry cleaners to no avail. I can still play them on my computer, so I know the DVDs are not the problem. The VHS player still works.As I indicated, it is a refurbished unit, so this opinion should not carry as much weight as those for units bought as new items.

After \\"haggling\\" with the \\"customer service\\" department, they did offer to forego this reshelving fee. This purchase was not worth the hassle & aggravation.

After many calls and emails to try to get the \\"on site\\" repair, turns out we had to lug the tv to a local authorized repair center who kept it for about 6 weeks only to lug it back home and it was still broken. So we lug it back in and it's been at the repair center for 8 weeks and counting despite repeated calls to them and Philips. Philips is not standing behind their relationship w/the repair center nor have they sent the correct parts to fix it. They also won't give us a new tv or extend our warranty. DO NOT BUY THIS TV.

The front black section that goes around the whole tv has seperated from the television I constantly have to press it back on especially if the tv is on for a while . My assumption is that the glue they used to make attach this part is heat sensitive and it melts everytime the tv heats up. Considering that heat generation is one of the problems with Plasma tv in general it seems as if Philips would have had a handle on this problem. This is unfortunate since this is not a cheap television therefore one would assume better quality products would be used. Unless you enjoy having the front of your television falling off like an old pair of pantyhose when your friends are over oohing and ahhing this probably isnt the tv for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture is second to none","review":"Had mine for about 6 months with no problems so far.

When we called Philips directly they said it would have to be sent in for repair or that we could just take it back to the store.The store took it back no questions asked, which was nice, because on top of this problem, there were several others.

The vast majority of wrestling fans live in the present; hence why the WWE product has become \\"faddy\\" as of late. It's trying to turn a profit on the disgusting practices of modern society. John Cena's character is the prime example. White America is now speaking ebonics, and wearing the garb of an inner city gang member. It's now chic to be a rapper. John Cena appeals to that audience. Now, if Vince McMahon didn't seek out the help of the new Hollywood writers, we would never have this problem.In this sense, the WWE product is predictable and its not worth watching anymore.

Another huge disappointment was the return of the Undertaker. Now don't get me wrong, I have been a fan of the Undertaker since that first time he debuted, and he's always been my favorite wrestler. What they are doing to him though is a travesty, just bring him out to destroy a few low key jebrones and then stare down Orton, it was so damn predictable.

There's dirty dealings, spooks and things that go bump in the night, along with a surprise return from the dead.This was a lot of fun and definitely one of my favorite story lines, although the courtroom drama dragged on just a bit too long, with plenty of overacting at that. Fans of Lara Parker will get to see plenty of her in this set of episodes, and in a more sympathetic portrayal at that. Could it be she's going to become one of the good guys?

The rest of the cast, chorus and orchestra , under the long experienced 'Goddie' are superlative and make for one of the finest line-ups in D'Oyly Carte history.

Apparently the fact that he has a band-aid on his head makes him \\"dirty?\\" Shouldn't his name be \\"Injured Ho?\\" or \\"Wounded Ho?\\" I dunno.The fighting is pretty mediocre especially considering you can't tell who is who (except for Ho). If there is a plot I couldn't figure it out...Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic, but....","review":"This movie is a classic old-school kung-fu movie. Gordon Liu always entertains and choreography is top notch for its time. However, the release from Red Sun entertainment is a disappointment. On the DVD cover it states that it is remastered, I highly doubt that. The picture looks grainy and you can see the tracking adjustments on a few scenes that usually happens on VHS tapes.

I rode the sandbox next to my motorman father on the rock 'n' roll Creve Couer line. I knew the inside of the car barn at Delmar and DeBaliviere, the coffee shop across the street where Dad and other Public Service folks hung out,and the bustle of the Wellston loop. The book taught me things I didn't know, reminded me of things I'd forgotten, and showed me lots of pictures of the city and the cars I loved as a kid. The reproductions are very good; the captions as interesting as the text. I loved the map of the rail system in 1962.

Visually, the unit has a look that gives the impression that it costs more than it actually does, although the digital lcd display my appear cheap when compared to higher end models. Aside from this the Daewoo plays dvds flawlessly and I would say that this would be along the lines of the Apex 600B DVD player, which is legendary for it's ability to perform beyond it's price range and with minor adjustment, play other regional dvds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrek in black and white?","review":"The player displayed no color (black and white only) when it arrived. Apparently that is a common problem with this particular model. I checked several support options, including the vendor's web site, other web sites, and the newsgroups; the only given solution was to switch from PAL to NTSC, perhaps toggling a few times. This did not cure the problem, and therefore the player was promptly returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This DVD player is such a bargain for the money. Very sleek and sophisticated design. I especially loved the zoom and frame by frame feature, which I used while watching our new Rocky movies on DVD!

After plugging it in and inserting a DVD, none of the buttons on the right side of the player responded (play, stop, eject, etc.). I had played this same DVD earlier at work so I knew it wasn't the disc. After messing around with it for an hour and half, I finally got the DVD out. I returned this one and bought an APEX that was the same price. It felt way more sturdy than the Daewoo and works like a champ. I think it's luck of the dice whether you get a working one or a lemon. I read the positive reviews some people wrote and decided to take the gamble. I wish I hadn't. It's going to take at least 2 weeks to get my account credited, not to mention the hassle of shipping it back.

No problem with the set up, excellent picture via a 27\\" Philips TV. It does everything it says on the box.

Turning it off and back on again did not revive it--only waiting an hour or so would it start to work again . . . for another 20 minutes.Though I called customer service two days after I bought it (which involved over an hour of wait time before an automated menu gave me the number of a local representative--and forget about online help--the site seems designed to keep you from contacting them) I was not offered an exchange, and all the work to replace the damaged product had to be made by me. I was asked to bring it to a \\"repair place\\" that was so far out of my way, getting there and back would cost more than the unit. Daewoo's philosphy is not, apparently, \\"The customer is always right,\\" but rather \\"Buyer beware.\\"Do not buy this product, or--I would recommend--anything from Daewoo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little flaky on mp3","review":"I mainly got this unit for playing mp3's.

It plays dvd's with clarity. I really didn't purchase it for the cd player or mp3 features, but I really enjoy it for its main purpose. The only problem I have is with the remote control. In order to turn it ON/OFF you have to do it manually. WARNING!!! This is not the ideal machine for those couch potatoes out there! There is no ON/OFF button on the remote, so if you are thinking about shedding some extra pounds, this DVD player is definitely for you.

Once you get into the movie or the music, though, it's not really noticeable. My wife doesn't like the color, but I guess it's also supposed to be available in black.

So far, I managed to play the following formats: MP3, CD, VCD 1.1, NTSC DVD region 1, and PAL DVD region 2. The latter was played on a regular NTSC TV. The built-in conversion from PAL to NTSC works well. I can wholehartedly recommend this DVD player, especially to those who own region 2 DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Bad Points","review":"Great, cheap DVD player, multiregion capability with the remote hack. Only problem is that if your not careful, it goes crazy, and scratches up the discs. Something to do with multiregion I think, because it only does it with my region 2 discs.

Excellent song writing, great lyrics (even though I'm not always sure of my translation abilities), and she really puts a lot of feeling into her singing. Some of the songs are surprising (such as \\"Orfeo\\" and \\"Parole di Burro\\") in that they start out VERY mellow but then Carmen really let's loose and the passion in her singing just brings the song away from any kind of mellowness and into an unexpected intensity (don't miss the rougher, less produced version of \\"Orfeo\\" 20 some minutes into track 12). The other thing I like about this album is the range of song writing. \\"Bambina impertnente\\" has a very punky beginning with PJ Harvey-like distorted vocals. Compare this with \\"l'ultimo bacio\\" which is a sad and pretty song with a string orchestra that my parents could appreciate. A great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"is Carmen Consoli the best Italian musical artist of the new generation????","review":"it feels good to say that laura pausini and giorgia and irene grandi are doing good things in terms of the new generation of italian pop by WOMEN...but let's face it: a cursory listening of one or two carmen consoli CDs quickly leads one to the conclusion that she is the ONLY contemporary female italian vocalist who is truly INVESTED in her ART....there is no comparison....she is the leading female italian pop singer (describing her as the Italian PJ Harvey sells Carmen short)...IF NOT ...she is The Best...I want to give Nek and Mango and Tiziano a chance...but....I don't know..Carmen's music is a lot more varied ...it's more interesting than those guys'....she may very well be the best period!

Nyman 's orchestration often creates a tension in otherwise consonant passages.The scene in the movie where this occurs is just brilliant.

I will wait and see what the shop says tomorrow. Could cost us more to fix it than it's worth. Timing is terrible, as my wife started a class two days ago.

Since they control the flow of information anything that portrays their government in a negative light is not allowed. It seems that this documentary although insightful in some aspects does not give any credit to the Cuban exile community for the positive aspects of Cuban society prior to the Castro Regime. Maybe sometime the producers of this documentary can try to capture both sides of this debate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This history of Cuba is totally misleading. The chapter titled The Conquistadores was not only misleading but also inaccurate. The writer tried to put together a complex history in a very short time. Among the misleading scenes were several showing Maya Indians in Cuba. There are no Indians in Cuba now, and the Mayas were never inhabitants of Cuba. The author overemphasized the oppression of the Spaniards,and incorrectly portrayed the Cuba before Castro as a two-class country with low morality. In reality the Cuba before Castro was prosperous with a strong middle class. The author neglected to compare these with the oppression, poverty and lack of morality that exists in the Cuba of today. He neglected to mention that prostitution, gambling, and criminal activity are rampant in Castro's Cuba. His portrayal of Fidel Castro and his men as heroes is far from believable. This is propaganda piece from the Castro Regime.

It does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but not for everyone","review":"&This; is not a cookie cutter Les Claypool effort. It is also not as accessable as his other work. It's very quirky and odd (sounds good already) First off, his bass playing is top notch here. Some of his best playing in my opinion in sometime. Very articulate clean. It is not hard edged like Primus, but gives a new direction that is colorful and well done.a bit like a Beefheart/Stan Rigway effort, not for everyone, but is for those who are open minded, its gold.He's not making songs as much as paintings & character studies that he has always done so well. Les is an Artist and must keep moving and I enjoy what he has brought to the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to his older material","review":"Of Whales and Woe is Les Claypool's most recent album. I have only been a fan of Primus for a few years now, but Claypool's solo material just doesn't compare to his past works. Most of the songs have nice little tunes to them, but not all are good (Vernon, Back Off Turkey), and the lyrics are just terrible. One Better practically gives a lesson about the Sputnik satellite. Stick with his material from 1989-1998 (Suck on This through Rhinoplasty, Sausage, and Holy Mackeral), and ignore the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"brea-lynn pandora of athens","review":"This book is about a young girl named Pandora who is adjusting to becoming a women.

This book takes place in Athens, Greece in 399 B.C. Pandora really wants to become more of the community by helping other people. Women back then had to pull the water out of the well and do the cleaning. Hauling water up from the well was hard but Pandora enjoyed it. One day she went down to the well to pull up the water and there was a man named Socrates who changed her life. He gave Pandora hope. Pandora's bother was always getting to do cool things but know she wanted a turn. Socrates said that women should work and not just sit at home knitting. The rich theme of pursuing your dreams is great, but the book was slow and boring to read. Pandora of Athens could be a better read if the author made the plot go faster, and made the characters more colorful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"The idea is *so* cool, and the Archos guys are *this* close to getting it right. The sound is great, the ease of use is amazing (plug in USB, see drive, drop song in place, play).But that's as close as they get - the finish of the unit, the crappy controls, the hopeless manual, and last but not least the fact that the thing fails repeatedly after only a couple of months use renders it pretty much a waste of money IMHO...Shop around for something better, or wait until Archos get purchased by some big name tech outfit that can deliver the QA and support required for a device of this kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful but sometimes fickle lover","review":"This thing is permantly attached to my hip. I've used most of the 6GB, mostly from recording my vinyl collection. The sound is good. Rechargeable batteries and no discs make this preferable to most portable cd players.Some issues: 1) hard drive sometimes freezes, forcing me to restart the player; 2) hard drive has crashed once (I now keep most files backed-up on computer); 3) A/C cord was poorly built and subsequently frayed, making it inoperative. I could not find an equivalent at Radioshack and thus had to give Archos another $$$for a replacement. 4) Archos customer service--if you manage to get through to them at all--[stinks].Still, the Jukebox recorder is a great product for me. Even if I had extra cash I'm not sure I'd go w/the iPod as it doesn't record. If I hadn't blown $$$ on a replacement AC adaptor, I probably would have bought the microphone kit from archos."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wouldn't be without it...","review":"I agree with Dan...many of the complaints listed here reflect user issues, which indicates to me that Archos needs to improve their instructions and tech support. I first bought the Jukebox 6000 and was so pleased we now have the 6000, the 6 gig player/recorder, and the Studio 20 in our house.I personally don't care much for MusicMatch, so I just drag and drop my folders into the jukebox. As for battery life, we haven't encountered any problems, and usually get a good 10 hours of play time.The Studio 20 gave me some error messages at first, but I would just disconnect, reboot the computer, and didn't have any more problems.I use mine as a back-up hard drive regularly, and with 20 gigs, there's still plenty of room for music. When I had to reformat my hard drive, all I did was transfer my files to the Jukebox, then reinstall. It was a breeze.I can't speak to the problems others have had, but we all love ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't this be nice...","review":"I bought this product despite the bad reviews and warnings.

The chance is VERY high that you will take it on a trip and it will break down, and you will be unhappy.Also, Archos tech support is THE WORST I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED.

It is definitely much smaller than the Nomad and I chose it for the form factor. The complaint I have is that it just stopped working abruptly after a couple of days. Started displaying a message saying that there was a hardware error. So I just had it returned. And this was without even having done any jogging/any thing out of the normal that would cause shock to the player.

It refused to read a lot of files, but it *did* hold a lot of data. I just can't get to any of it. Twenty-four hours after I opened the box, it started freezing while reading files, and I had to restart it. Finally, it refused to work at all and froze upon booting up. It exhibited all of the problems that a previous reviewer had commented upon.The toll-free customer service phone number has been disconnected.I am beginning to believe that all of the good reviews for this product were written by Archos employees or advertisers.

I may buy one when the model is upgraded or some major firmware updates are offered.Loved shopping through Amazon.com!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome, but not perfect","review":"Let me start by saying that if you spend the money, you will be satisified. The player works great, sounds great, and is fairly easy to operate. Anyone with more than a little computer experience will catch on quickly. When you get the unit upgrade the musicmatch software (for free) at there site. The headphones that ship with the unit are junk..Don't judge the sound quality until you hook up a better set of headphones. The instruction manual is almost useless, but the unit is pretty simple to figure out through trial and error. I have not been able to make the unit skip, the buffer works great.

I've gone through two of these. The first one began malfunctioning a few months after I got it. When I went to email Archos, they never answered. Then I tried their customer support phone number and finally got through after about 5 tries. I succesfully returned it, (which was hell in and of itself), and the Archos poeple gave me a new one in the mail a few weeks later. It came with about 7,000 fragmented files. When I managed to recover them, I was unable to delete them. I was also unable to remove any mp3s that I put on the player. I dont even try to turn it on anymore, because it takes over a minute to turn on, and if it gets hit in the slightest, it restarts or freezes. I wasted 300 dollars on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but trouble","review":"I ordered the Archos Jukebox Player/Recorder and right out of the box it didn't work. I called tech-support (which I was able to get through to fairly quickly) and they informed me that the device had a bad hard drive. I shipped it back to Amazon on a Friday afternoon and they had a new one off to me on Monday morning (I'm always very impressed with Amazon). The new one worked for about two hours and then would no longer boot up. I again called Archos' tech support and was told that the hard drive was defective. That's two units in one week with defective hard drives. I don't think that I am going to take a chance on a third one.

Who is the problem? Is it Sweet Pea Cahrisson, Sonny Boy Marsallus, Johnny Carp, Moleen Bertrand, Rufus Arceneauxn, Emile Pogue or John Giacano and this is not all the players.

Fans of Cletus \\"Noble Mon\\" Purcel - with his truly poetic capacity for invective - will be glad to know that he's back, as is the still dirtier-mouthed Helen Soileau, who unexpectedly reveals a vulnerable side here.Precious few living novelists can make me buy their work purely on the strength of their name.

Our protagonists are a girl who horn dogs just about every guy for blocks around and does just about every drug that uses \\"drug\\" as a descriptive adjective. The other one is a handsome guy who gets really violent when he is either in one of two situations: he's hit on by gays, or women who accuse him of not being normal.

Her voice is droopy. Her phrasing is poor. Her drama is nearly non-existent. Her interpolated high notes unfairly hijack this opera from the other singers. Where is Sills' studio \\"Norma\\" with Shirley Verrett when you need it? I hope EMI releases it on CD very soon.Also, everyone keeps ranting about how Sutherland and Horne sing everything in the original keys. Keep in mind that the tones have gone up one full tone since Bellini's time. So today's key of F has the same tessitura as the key of G in Bellini's time. That means that both Callas and Caballé, singing \\"Casta diva\\" in today's key of F, are actually singing the aria in its ORIGINAL TESSITURA. This means that Sutherland and Horne are actually singing ABOVE the original keys (tessituras). It is wrong of them to show off like that. Upward transpositions done to show off one's singing technique are just signs of lacking taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring studio recording, not necessarily singers' fault","review":"Despite the reputation of Sutherland and Horne, one really must listen to this recording for what it is, a bland, undramatic studio recording. The singers are miked rather distantly, reverb has been added, and the engineers have managed to drain whatever remaining life out of what might have been recorded on the original tapes. In the case of both Sutherland and Horne one can barely make out one word, much less any sense of character or emotion. I have heard Sutherland live, and the effect was much different. The beautiful, effortless voice at that stage in her career had an energy and a kind of natural reverb which was in itself dramatic and exciting, and you didn't feel that anything was missing. Horne I have never found to be an interesting singer or interpreter. But similarly, in live performance it was the energy of her singing that made up for the lack of personality and the rather hard tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr Dave","review":"A CLASSIC Irwin Allen disaster movie with some drama and sap opera soap thrown in!

These Chicagoians write songs about life in the city, and being human. '1% Faster' consists of 14 songs with various influences ranging from the Rolling Stones to the Clash. Most of the songs are shorter than three minutes, but the album does not sound choppy. Just about anyone can relate to their lyrics, and anyone can get into their sound. Take my family for example. I like it, my dad likes it. Im 20, my dad is 55. I like punk, dad likes oldies.

I was intrigued by the descriptions of pre-war Jewish life in Vienna and charmed by the Viennese locales. I hoped to strongly identify with the characters, especially the following generations. I was ultimately, however, only repelled.From what I read, I found Clara's depressions and the capitulation of those around her to the disease (although the daughter seems to be finding her way as I closed the book) abhorrent.Maybe the subject is too personal and I was looking for strength and heroines, however I would warn potential readers to tread carefully unless you are a fan of the dark side of the psyche."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLAM!","review":"After seeing Emril's commercial, I thought I would give the cinnamon flavor a try.

It's easier than Diablo II, since you just have to click once on the enemy and the hero will chase it until it's killed. Graphics-wise it's average, keep in mind this is a 2001 game. There's about 5 characters to choose from. Personally I like games that have cheats, how many of us have time to play a RPG game for months, slowly building up stats. Maybe if I was in elementary or middle school, sure. An annoying thing, or a bug maybe, is that in order to move an object you have to click on it first so the hero will walk towards it, and then say \\"I can't use it\\" so now you are right next to the object you can move it. Great for $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Click to kill gets old","review":"Much like Diablo and even Neverwinter Nights, this game falls short when it comes to engaging playing.

Anyone with an ordinary array of kitchen tools will be able to make most of the recipes in this book, from adults to children. Indeed, I would rate this book very highly for \\"quality family time\\" because the children can (with adult supervision for the actual cooking, of course) make just about everything in the book, and the delightful pictures of Marsha Redfox should make them want to. Marsha's ethnic costumes could also help spark family discussions about the cultures all the recipes come from while cooking them (or better, while eating them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great..","review":"I agree with other purchasers of this case..best use is as a dust cover, not a carrying case. It's hard to close..trying to fit the lid into the flimsy grooves on the bottom is a pain and it's very thin. I was worried the sewing machine would fall out while walking as it slides around inside. I purchased it for my daughter so it served it's purpose as her first sewing machine and case but I wish cases were still made like the fitted one on my old Burnina. Now that sturdy, fitting case was what I'd call quality! You could just remove the top and sew, it fit the sewing machine perfectly and even had storage in the bottom. This cheap thing should have been given free with purchase of a sewing machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cost: $30, Value: $5","review":"Unlike the old cases where the machine snugly fits inside and the lid over it, This is an inexpensive piece of plastic with latches on the sides. The machine just sits on a plastic grid bottom with nothing to cradle or hold it in, so it can bounce around inside when walking or if tipped over. As for walking with it, the handle in strangely and cheaply made. There are ridges for grips, but they don't work well since they are raised ridges which dent your fingers when you hold it, due to the weight of the machine. If you're moving it in a short distance (across a room) then you're not holding it long enough to hurt your fingers. Hmm, can't find much good about it, except it is a good dust cover. Why would Singer make such nice machines and skimp on the carrying case?

I am so pleaed with this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dust cover, not a carrying case","review":"I bought this case as a cover for my machine a few years ago, and it was great for storing my machine when I wasn't using it very much. In the past 6 months I've started taking classes, and taking my machine with me, in this case. The handle is the MOST uncomfortable design. It's astonishing... I created my own \\"padding\\" handle so I can carry it further than a couple feet without pain in my fingers. My machine is not very heavy, it's just an awful design.It gets two stars instead of one simply because if you plan on putting your machine away, and never carrying it further than a couple feet, then it's probably an alright case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sewing machine carrying case","review":"I am a new, yet old seamstress.

But, it's not intended to be the same type of hard-edged, modal jammin' that the Brothers are famous for. There are no vocals.

The authors chose log homes that are just not what log homes should be; simple, rustic, and cozy. These homes are large, expensive, and over-decorated. If you like baroque decors fine, but I think most people would agree with me that these rooms are too ornate.

Additionally, her wonderfully gritty voice doles out practical writing advice with sturdy handles, the kind you literally cannot get from any oridinary seminar. Much of this tape is subsumed within her bestselling book, Bird By Bird, yet there is plenty that is unique to Word By Word to make it well worth the price; not the least of which is hearing the poem which Anne's dog Sadie wrote to her, wherein Sadie ponders the question: 'Should she (the author) really be driving?' Hilarious and poignant as ever, Lamott mixes up wry asides with text from her writing manual, and makes everything difficult seem worth undertaking. All in all, a generous illumination and expansion of several classic Lamott topics; hearing her say it in her own words brings it crackling to life. Writing is hard work, but with Anne at your side, it's a shared journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy this","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but I think buyers should be aware that this recording has little to do with Lamott's very good book, 'Bird by Bird'.

I tried to fix this so the really tiny button inside would always be pushed down to make it think it's closed, but, I got annoyed with it and gave up.It requires 4 batteries and is huge..needless to say, it eats the batteries up really fast.

That's about all the good things I have to say! The bad: it cuts off songs randomly; it squeaks, squeals, hisses and pops at random and LOUDLY. Also, I had to hold the cassette part of the adapter into my car's player for a few seconds because it kept kicking out. I had the unit a total of 2 days before I returned it, and only because the store was closed on Christmas day.

One of my daughters ran D1, and the insights Murphy provides are spot on, as regards the pressures and choices facing athletes at that level. I have purchased a second copy of the book, and both are on loan to women who are involved in women's athletics, one a coach, one the mom of a promising young athlete.

There is a very small mirror tunnel behind the color wheel (looks like a long prism) that often fails as it is very fragile. This tunnel concentrates and channels the light to the DLP chip and if it collapses it can cause a dark (not black) band to appear at the left/right 1/10 portion of the screen. This band gets wider with time.The reason is that the glue connecting the four rectangular mirrors of the mirror tunnel peel from the heat; in my projector, one of the mirrors had slipped and fallen in.Otherwise a fine projector!

Please take my advice on this:If you dislike hard headed , chauvanistic barbarians with Scottish burrs that call their heroines lassie, then this is NOT the book for you.If you're a tad bit logical in your romance reading , this is NOT the boook for you.

Who cares who is robbing the banks, who cares what happened to this secondary character who disappeared? Ms. Clark did not need these filler subplots to bring this book together, and yet that is what she used them for.

Not Roberts' best.","review":"I have just discovered Nora Roberts and am in the process of reading the books available at my local library. I returned this one after reading about 1/4 of it. It's a typical, early 80s romance where the heroine seems like a stupid, silly girl until the big strong man comes in and protects her. The dialogue and the entire plot just did not make sense to me. I am seriously considering staying away from Nora Roberts' mass market romances and staying with the larger, more well-written ones. If I hadn't already read some of her later works I never would have read another of her books. This was not the Nora Roberts' writing I've come to love and appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Early Nora Roberts","review":"I have been reading Nora Roberts for a few years now and just finished this 1983 reprint.

Her romantic suspense novels usually have a great plot, characters that are human, but likeable, and are an easy read. But this book STUNK! The sappy female lead totally drove me to the psych ward.

Now, we have to keep in mind that this was only her second novel published, but it was so typical Harlequin in the early 80s-- annoyingly overbearing hero, weak barbie-doll heroine who pretends to be strong but crumbles under the hero's pressure. Nora's first book -- Irish Thoroughbred was SO much better. If this is your first Nora read, please keep reading, because this one was not like her at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly, insipid tale that should never have been reprinted","review":"No character development. No male POV. Just a childish heroine who, although she's heart-stoppingly gorgeous and must have had men hit on her since she was 14, someone has had no experience dealing with the opposite sex being attracted to her. The photo shoots are ridiculous - this is NOT the way photo shoots work. And an employer, a major publisher, having tons of free time to just hang around on a shoot? Totally believable. The \\"other woman\\" was ludicrous and didn't belong in the story. Another tale about how 2 people, although attracted to one another, can't be honest with one another. We've heard this before - and told much better. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out dated","review":"This novel was written almost 20 years ago and as such, is pretty outdated.

Next paragraph: \\"Despite government actions favorable to their interests, the officer corps remained unrepentant.\\" Next paragraph - a group of soldiers protest.

I wasn't aware there was any suspense....I was pretty sure Danny was evil/psycho from, like, the first few frames. I was sort of hoping for plot twist where the smarmy lawyer turns out to be psycho--now THAT would have been exciting!Don't waste your time unless you really have a lot of love for old movies, regardless of quality.

It is about the dislike of his presence by Dylan's people, his difficulty as being a reporter as a wannabe and is self serving. The only redeemable aspect of this book is his coffee shop conversations with Joni Mitchell at the end of the book.If you enjoy page after page after page of incessant whining and childish, pouting by an author then by all means buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Dylan, but Not That Much","review":"The whole thing seemed to be too much Dylan exultation for me. The concert was perfect, exactly the way it was supposed to be. Dylan was always so sage-like and untouchable. Get real! This is the story of Ratso following around a concert and he has a little more access than a fan who could follow the revue around.

You can get \\"compatible\\" cartridges a lot cheaper elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have modeled it after the Vice City guide...","review":"In addition to the things others have pointed out -- the inaccuracies in the maps and screenshots -- I find the guide hard to use. For example, the map for all the hidden horseshoes in Las Venturas is about 100 pages away from the screenshots of all the locations. The Vice City guide was a great guide, very high on usability. You'll spend a lot of time flipping back and forth with this one. The typeface is really tiny, and the mission descriptions tend to be very simplistic (at least the VC guide gave you some actual strategy tips; much less so, I think, with this guide).It's big and slick and pretty to leaf through... but that can't justify its cost. You will find less than 50% of what the game has to offer without it, so you're stuck with buying it. Brady should publish a second edition with corrections, or at least publish online corrected versions of the maps and an errata page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong where it matters most","review":"The whole reason I bought this guide was for the horseshoes,tags,oysters, and photo ops. Well first off I found mistakes in all of the above. The photo ops are completely off 100 %. The horshesoes are all wrong on the map and a couple of the descriptions look like they just photoshopped a picture of a horseshoe onto another picture and made up a spot. If your gonna make a buisness of doing books like these hire someone to double check your info at least. Not to mention the lack of real in depth info on how to really pass any of the side missions. Like someone before me mentioned it almost felt like they just played through the story missions and wrote down what the game already tells you. I just wanna say thank you Brady for wasting my 20 Bucks. Spend it well, I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its sad really...","review":"I, like so many other's, was stupid enough to buy this guide not realising the mystery's within.

It was very inaccurate in some of the locations of items. For a specifice example, the locations of the Photo ops in San Fierro. The locations were not accurate, and not even matched up correctly by number. Even some of the horseshoe locations were completely inaccurate that they were not even the correct location, which annoyed me because I spent a large amount of time searching for something that was not there. I own a PS2, but I use the XBOX & PC version because of its accuracy. There is no real difference, as the guide does not tell you which button needs to be pressed, so the XBOX version still fits.Also, for those who I know are curious, the XBOX version gives more insight on the dating and \\"coffee\\" aspects, unlike the PS2, which skips over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely helpful","review":"This product was very helpful in my gaming experience.

I found better information on the internet than this stupid piece of crap guide. Whoever the author was on this guide, they should be fired!

This is their \\"greatest hits\\" collection and quite great indeed. The Miserere which begins the set is alone worth the price of the set. The only fault with it is that it is so startling, so obviously genuine, that you will still be hearing it as you play through the rest of the set. The Scholars' ongoing recovery project only proves how integral music is to the human psyche, how essential the sacred is to basic human sanity. And how the severence of the two in the public space and the popular imagination -- the sacred from music -- has severely damaged us all en masse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behold, The Wonder Of Man","review":"Can any one believe the beauty of this music, the clarity of these voices, and the intonation resounding in every breath that they take.

But i, for one, say that the Tallis Scholars are truly angels on earth, and their voices are proof of that.

Charmed fans, however, will not find much to please them here. None of the characters is given anything interesting to do. Piper spends the book whining about staying home and caring for the children that follow her. Darryl exists only to return the kids to their homes. Paige does nothing but go to the symphony and talk about the flutist as if he were a junior high school crush. Phoebe's only function is to be present at the scene of two murders. The plot is entirely predictable, and the one detail that could be called a twist is not a surprise if you notice that the author has reused a name.If just reading about the Charmed ones is enough to make you happy, buy this book- but don't expect it to do justice to the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Back in the days when the classical all-night program was one man who said and played anything he wanted to (I remember a rant on the poor quality of a pair of name brand corduroy pants, for instance), one night he just about roared, \\"you've got to listen to this!\\" and the the \\"Cruda Sorte\\" from this album filled my room.He was right.Next day I went out and tried to buy it. Didn't seem to be in the stores yet. But by the time I got it and listened to it a few times, I was convinced that this was one of the best albums in my large and extremely varied collection.Things like that were why I listened to him.

And just when I was pickin' up my d**k outta the dirt the mango kid enlists ex-Kyuss howler John Garcia on back-up vocals for the song \\"Invisible\\", brilliant. Danko is in full bad-boy swagger too, you can just see him lickin' his lips and eyein' the pretty girls in the front row as he tears through a tasteful solo. Compared to AC/DC, Motley Crue, and Kiss (and I'm sure he's not losing any sleep over those comparisons, after all it is the enemy) this album does not stop for ballads or pedestrians and Danko's soulful voice growls like the hounds of hell on amyl nitrate.

We Sweat Blood was Danko struggling to make a proper follow-up and failed. Sleep is the Enemy finds Danko back in form. He even manages to progress a little. On Sleep he infuses choruses without losing any of his raw power. His music is still pure macho R&R. Political correct he ain't. This is Rock Hard. Danko is often compared with AC/DC. This album proves he can play in the big league. Not only that, it proves he can out-rock the big league. AC/DC seem like pussies next to this bad boy. This album was released in Europe months ago. It's time for America to wake up.

His utter rejection of Adrienne Rich and her volume of 1996--one of the best in the series--only shows to his detriment, not hers, and to the detriment of this volume.

Just follow the manual from manufacturer. Remember that this machine handles mostly lite to medium fabric only. Unless you can adjust the pressure for the presser foot correctly, don't sew heavy fabric on this baby or you will bend your presser foot holder and cause your presser foot to not catch the threads to form the serge properly/not at all. When I did it, I simply moved it back into position. It works like it suppose to. I did end up buying most of the presser feet for this serger though. It did cost me much more (another $75 total), but needed it in order to experiment with the different styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"My first serger I purchased back in the mid 80's was a Singer. I had it for over 20+ years and never had any trouble with it. I took it in for some routine maintenance and I got it back with the tensions all messed up. I ended up just buying a new Singer model 14SH654 at Walmart. From the get-go, the motor smells hot when I use it. The needles they tell you to use I can only find through the internet on Singer's website. It's very time-consuming to thread. The manual is definitely not user-friendly. Whoever wrote it must have been an engineer or rocket scientist! I am extremely disappointed with the performance of this machine. I will never buy another Singer product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"maquina","review":"muy bien! la maquina es excelente producto! todo el proceso se realizo sin ningún inconveniente! buen precio! recomendado 100% gracias!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"Bought this at Walmart thinking that being a Singer it should be a decent machine. After a few days, thread got all tangled up inside which I can understand can happen. Problem is that the threading directions and pictures in the manual are so lame, and the color coding is a joke, so it was impossible to get it re-threaded. Funny thing is it says right on the box that it is color coded for foolproof threading! There is no color coding on the more detailed pathways the thread must take. I have been a dentist for 27 years and am used to detailed work (machine is for my daughter), but there is no way anyone can thread this machine using only the directions provided. The manual does not even show enough detail to see where the thread is going. I could not find any other directions online. Very disappointed in Singer's lack of regard for the consumer. Returned to Walmart and told manager to pull it from the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money","review":"I purchased this machine thinking it would live up to the Singer Name, (even purchased a gathering foot, which by the way no attachements come with this machine,) boy was I wrong, the first time I used a different setting on the tension for gathering it never worked right again, no matter how it was set. I contacted support and they told me that it could be due to using different brands of thread, or setting the tension differently, anyway I got the run around. I have been a professional seamstress for over 30 years and know how to set tension and know about quality thread. They also told me to get it corrected I would have to send it to a repair shop, keep in mind that this machine was less than three weeks old! It worked a total of about one week. So I boxed it up and returned it to Wal-Mart and ordered a EZ Lock and it is working beautifully! and guess what, you can use different brands of thread."},{"rating":"1","title":"you might want to consider another machine","review":"i ordered this exact serger through ebay, the bulb was busted and it didnt sew very well no matter how much i tried to work with the tensions. the seller was great and sent me a new one right away, the exact model. the serging is ok right out of the box, but if you change the threads and have to adjust the tension, forget it. the serging is terrible. i think the tensions in these machines are not very good quality, honestly, i dont know what its problem is. it's become very frustrating working on it for hours, reading and rereading the instruction manuel, and threading and rethreading. well, i'm on my way to the sewing repair shop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 20 Minutes!","review":"I have been sewing on a 20 year old Brother serger that broke in the middle a project. I ran to Walmart and bought this Singer off the shelf out of desperation. At first I was impressed because it was really easy to thread - way quicker than my old Brother. The stitch looked nice but I was immediately concerned about the squeaky noises all the moving parts were making. It sounded very cheap. Then after about 20 minutes of sewing I heard a loud CLUNK and see that my right needle thread has broken. I try re-threading and it breaks again...I look inside to investigate and see the needles are scraping against the lower looper arm - which means that it had somehow gotten bent in the few minutes I had been using it. I looked at the loopers and the metal looked so thin I think I could have bent it with my finger. I will be taking this back to Walmart tomorrow for a refund.

It threaded pretty easily with clear color-coded instructions but nothing else has worked. Three needles have broken, one bent (I'm only sewing flannel here!). Now I am out of needles and as others have mentioned, they aren't easy to find. I will have to order new neddles online which is fine with me at the moment as I could use the week long break from this frustating machine!

Certain areas of the book are too harsh to be discussed openly with smaller children, but the message of family values is so strong that they need to be included. Reading the book from front to back is not as easy as other books, as it seems to have two separate messages, but the overall strength of the book is supported on both sides of the book. The stories relating to love, honor, family, healing, and faith in God are very uplifting and will endear the author to your heart.

It was actually a comedy of errors! The run-on sentences alone rquired re-reading just to derive some meaning.

Instead, the main focus of the book is a bitter child custody battle between the author and her ex-husband.This is a story about the author, not about the dog.

It should not be in the PETS as I found it, but in the INSPIRATIONAL or SELFHELP section of the store. I bought the book to read on my flight from NYC to Nevada and read it all the way through during the trip. I arrived with more joy and more hope than I have felt in a long time. Books are powerful and I won't let this one slip by without reporting its power to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous book!","review":"What a heartwarming story--fabulous. One has to wonder about that nasty reviewer, here--he is from Oklahoma and has only done this one, horrible review of a single book on Amazon. Someone with a vendetta? At any rate, this is a lovely story of courage--so believe the *great* reviews!! And more power to this amazing woman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"With a little Faith....anything is possible!","review":"This is an inspiring story written (mostly) about a dog who was found as a puppy with no front legs. The story tells about how his \\"family\\" trained him to walk upright on his hind legs all the time and become the only known bi-pedal dog in the world! It is a truly insipiring story of courage, faith, and miracles! I would recommend it to any age...especially if you are an animal lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about a Dog","review":"Isaw the dog on a talk show on TV, so I thought maybe I would purchase the paperback the dogs owner wrote. The book really isn't about the dog at all. I realize the author needed to give background on how the dog came into her life and how she came to show the dog. But 90% of the book is dedicated to her hatred of her ex-husband, her hard luck life and what a hard ball woman she can be. I am all for womans rights and the need to fight back, but I bought the book to read about the dog, not about the womans personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dog is inspiring, the writing and this book are not.","review":"I completely agree with the reviews below. The story about the dog was what I was interested in. The book is marketed as a book about the dog, but it ends up being about how awful her ex-husband is and all of the bad cards she was dealt. I didn't buy a book so that I could read about a bitter custody battle similar to the woman's down the street. It's written so poorly I couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Would Have Read the Reviews!","review":"The other reviewers hit it right on the mark ~ this book uses the ploy of an amazing story about a dog to sell a book that is poorly written about someone's messed up (and yet still not interesting) life. The author goes off on everything that is wrong in her life and how it is all her ex-husband's fault but no one sees it . . . hello, I picked up the book to read about the dog! I don't know how this book ever got published in the first place. Save yourself the time and look up the dog's inspiring story on the internet and skip reading this author's poorly written ramblings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith is remarkable","review":"but not the book.

A Very worthy buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I agree with many people on here who say it's not solely a writing guide- I loved this book (ditto on Bones, which, if you have to read one, that would be the one), for her specific ideas on writing, but, more so, reading her journey gave me insights and compassion for my own struggles to do something as simple as sit down, write, read. Easy stuff, but, not so much when you put pressure on yourself to be Hemmingway or say something big and meaningful. It holds for me, as someone else also said, a place of honor of my reference shelf (as does Stephen King's On Writing and Anne Lamont's Bird By Bird, if the context helps)."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same...","review":"This is the follow up volume to the excellent Writing Down the Bones. If you have read the first book, and still feel blocked, then this book could prove very useful. What I feel is that she covered most of the important aspects of being an aspiring writer in 'Bones, so I feel their is some rehash, and some material that is just not as good as 'Bones.Still, she builds more on both zen and jewish wisdom, and it does not do anyone any harm to read it.Of course, this book helped me to appreciate haiku, and that counts for something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Writer's Block Begone!","review":"The best kinds of books are ones that you put on a certain part your desk and know that, eventually, you'll be reading it again. Natalie Goldberg's _Wild Mind_ (as well as her _Writing Down the Bones_) is the type of book that is going to follow you through your life because they help writers with a terrible disease... writer's block.No matter what stage of writer's block you're in... Initial denial... mediocre frustration... or serious hair pulling... Goldberg has a variety of simply exercises which can not only \\"unstuck\\" you, but also help develop the writing muscle so that you don't end up always thinking, \\"Well, I get to my writing real soon now\\".For non-writers, a Goldberg read is likely to churn up creative energy. Simply reading a few chapters will open the creativity door wide open and who knows what is going to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite","review":"of Natalie's writing books. I think it is especially good for those who edit themselves as they write. Natalie gives you permission to write badly. You can always clean it up later. She encourages us to let loose and and get it down on the page. And if you're blocked, she offers lots of \\"try this\\" exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woolly, impractical new age rubbish!","review":"Believe it or not, this offence to trees was touted to me as a textbook for my creative writing course! Woolly new-age thinking coupled with profound-sounding but essentially meaningless pronouncements predominate, along with what must be the worse piece of advice a new writer ever had - Lose Control. Honestly, dear, if we all lost control when we wrote we'd write this superannuated hippy crap as well. Writing is a craft and should be an exercise IN control. Useless as spirituality (not nearly severe enough), useless as gay memoir (but I'm happy she found love. Kudos). Doubly, in fact triply useless as a guide to beginning writing. Avoid at all costs. Advice to other beginning writers - get a better, more useful book on our craft, which limits you in scope to anything not by this whiny new-ager. Wish I could rate this in minus numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST BOOK EVER*","review":"I had to read this book for a creative writing class, my junior year in high school. After reading this book, I have lost all respect for my teacher for just asigning us to read it. I cant believe anyone who is interested in writing could believe this woman, who clearly knows nothing about creating writing! all she did was force herself to talk about not forcing your writing. i even ripped out pages of this book because it made me so frustrated and mad to know that books like these can even get published! NEVER READ THIS BOOK IT IS A DISGRACE TO ALL BOOKS IN THE WORLD AND WRITING IN GENERAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment after Bones","review":"While some will love this book, I found it terribly disappointing after reading Writing Down the Bones -- which I loved. Perhaps this is because Bones was so wonderful this could not compete. I found the writing in Wild Mind cloying and self-indulgent -- to the point of irritation. There are many more inspiring writing books than this. Don't bother with Wild Mind unless you want if for its great cover art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writer's Reference","review":"Every writer should have this on his/her shelf. Although it is not a step-by-step guide to how to write, it offers useful tips for improving our writing. Many of the exercises can actually lead one to a publishable piece of work. Every writer has to find his/her own method, system, way of getting from the beginning to the end, and Ms. Goldberg makes the reader privy to hers. This book encourages writers to step out of their own notions of \\"how\\" to experiment and find out what's on the outside of the box they've put themselves in.Lucy Adams, author of If Mama Don't Laugh, It Ain't Funny"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring insights on writing and creativity","review":"Natalie Goldberg presents us with more inspiring insights into the life of a writer. She delves deeper into the Zen priciples she touched on in Writing Down the Bones, and their impact on the life of a writer.

If you loved Writing Down the Bones, get this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any writer!","review":"I don't think Natalie Goldberg could possibly top Writing Down the Bones, but this book is almost as good. Definitely a must for anyone who loved Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better than her","review":"This book gave me great confidence as a writer, because I know I can at least write better than Goldberg! All you can learn about writing from this book is in chapter 1: Don't edit while writing. Use the first word that comes to mind. Show, don't tell. Don't think; let it flow. Don't worry about grammar. Write badly if you need to. Write what's hard and hurts.The other 61 chapters are from the diary of an over-sensitive Zen student in therapy, flying all over the country with numerous friends. I found it annoying and would rather recommend On Writing by Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's lucrative to write about writing.","review":"That's the only explanation I can come up with for this book. Goldberg has made a good living off of \\"Writing Down The Bones,\\" and now goes to the well again to offer advice to aspiring writers. Save yourself some time and read Lamott's \\"Bird by Bird,\\" a much better book on the process of writing that is filled with humor and insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again the same old same old...","review":"All you have to do is turn off your mind, relax and float downstream and you too can be a wealthy writer and go jetsetting with all your glamorous friends. Any actual writers reading this advice are probably expiring of laughter.Being able to construct a simple sentence with proper spelling and grammar does not, in itself, make you a writer. It would seem to be a prerequisite of becoming one, but the lady who wrote this book apparently feels that it is preferable to lose control and write gibberish -- perhaps she's trying to encourage students to write the kind of garble that passes for \\"intelligent literature\\" nowadays.Unfortunately, being told that you have the ability to write does not mean that you have the ability to write well in terms of plot, story structure, word choice and all the other elements necessary to high-quality, memorable writing (marketable or otherwise). Skip the autobiographical content; get what you can out of the guidelines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but ....","review":"The first part of this book was really marvelous, then she started on \\"True Confessions.\\" If I had known I wouldn't have bought this book. Sex life and preferences should be kept personal and not published, at least not in a book about writing advice. It was totally out of context and had no value at all! I would have given even less stars, but the beginning really is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Goldberg's publisher did her no favor by letting this garbage slip into print. I'm sure her credibility took a swan dive when \\"Wild Mind\\" came out. In one of the last chapters of the book, she wrote of speaking to her editor and proclaiming her Zen philosophy of writing: \\"It's okay if this book is a failure.\\" By that measure, this book is supremely \\"okay.\\" By the way, Nat, being straight, white, and male doesn't necessarily make one a \\"redneck.\\" Your intolerance is showing. So much for your philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU CAN SKIP THIS ONE AND SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"Wild Mind is a rambling assortment of stories told by the author ... many of which have nothing to do with the craft of \\"writing.\\" Ms. Goldberg spends too much time discussing \\"how she came out of the closet\\" and her new gay lifestyle, and how it has somehow impacted her writing. In the end, the book includes very few useful writing tips or examples. I am completely amazed that it has received anything more than below average reviews.

I have watched both seasons today and haven't cracked a smile. It's like they took a low budget drama storyline and tried, unsuccessfully, to put some comedy in to the story. The storylines were just to serious to be comedic.

As an Episcopalian, I have a greater understanding of the Church, and the challenges and opportunities which are available to serve others. The author's experiences are many, and his journey is told with honesty, compassion and strength. Reading \\"Presences\\" is a great way to begin the new year and is a book I strongly recommend. Tom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really tried to like this book. It's not poorly written or uninteresting but the name dropping and faux modesty become tedious. And that's too bad as he obviously has some stories to tell. He so badly wants to appear accessible and yet every anecdote shows the naivete of the super-rich. Does he really think it was his charm and skill that provided him with these opportunities and successes?We tend to dislike in others what we dislike in ourselves. I think he sums himself up perfectly when telling us, on the eve of his consecration, how he feels about St. Paul: \\"Although he is my patron saint, and I find his theology profound, I have never really liked Paul's personality. He seems to have been something of a misogynist, and although he spoke as if humble, he boasted a bit much about his sufferings for Christ, or so it seems to me.\\"Couldn't have summed up Paul (Moore) any better myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry!

Sometimes the instructors topple, too, which is good for the beginner ego. The second reason I love these tapes is (I must admit) one of the instructors is stunningly gorgeous.

My landlord stipulated that I can't make modifications to the apartment, so bars were out of the question. A friend of mine told me about these wedges and I got them.Today I left the bathroom window open (with the wedges in place set at 4 inches) while I went shopping.

This thing is a foot cube, so there's no way you could fit any baby outside of a newborn inside of it.That being said, when the cube first showed up, it seemed ok outside of the size, and my 2 1/2yr old son and 9-month old daughter seemed to enjoy it. That is, until my son realized that the wires on top were bent in such a way that there was no way for the Elmo block to move at all. Shoddy at best. We've had this cube for a total of 3 days now, and already at least 4 stickers are off of it, due to not being placed center on the piece they were on, or just low-quality stickers. My children still play with the cube, as currently it provides no real safety hazard, but the price I paid for this cube was entirely too much considering the low quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old's eyes lit up when he saw this...","review":"My older children all wanted to play with it too. Although this cube was smaller than I expected (the customer-posted picture is for a larger item), I was happy with the product. We especially like the Sesame street beaded maze that tops the cube and the side with the abacus, colors, and Sesame Street characters. You can't see it on the picture, but there is also a side with a zither, xylophone, bell and mallet for musical play. It looks like a great tool to teach counting and colors.As far as the quality is concerned, there are a couple of stickers on one side that could come off if picked too much, but nothing a little white glue won't fix. I would not consider this item a hazard by any means. No problems with chipping paint or splinters mentioned by another customer - sounds as if there may just be something defective about that item. Good value for the price I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed! This is a hazard!","review":"I was so excited to get this today. That excitement turned to disappointment when I saw the box it came in. First, it was significantly smaller than expected. Clearly, the customer picture added here was for one of a much larger size (or that child is the size of a small doll!). The one I received could barely fit something the size of a paperback book! The construction is shoddy, the \\"lid\\" doesn't even fit on the top, the stickers are coming off and I noticed paint chipping on the wood pieces on the side. My son hasn't even touched it and it's falling apart. I would never let him play with this...there are too many things that could hurt him (including splinters in the cheap wood).It's the first time I'm unhappy with an order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I have been extremely dissapointed with this toy over the past 6 months. I bought it for my 2 year old son (who loves Sesame Street) last Christmas. First, the box it came in was much too large for the product and little to no packing material was included. It was rolling around in the box during shipment. Since our play area is small, the size didn't bother me, but the stickers began falling off almost immediately. Once my son noticed a few starting to lift off, he began peeling them off and sticking them on furniture. I've had to use a glue stick to salvage some of them. More distressing was that a peice of wood from the xylophone broke off during play that he could have easily swallowed. Also he hasn't played with it much because it is so small and the moveable peices move such a short distance. This product is poorly made for the price, and I am shocked Sesame Street still has their name on it and it is still on the market. If I could send it back at this point, I would do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Christmas CD's!","review":"John Rutter has assembled a beautiful collection of old English carols with excellent performances by Clare College singers and musicians.

This album has so many unique qualities. There is some instrumental accompaniment, but it is clean and spare and devoid of the usual holiday bombast. The blend of the voices is perfect. Many of the selections are different from what usually clogs the radio waves in December. I can't really do justice to the beauty of the singing here, but it has a lovely peaceful quality that I treasure at this time every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the most beautiful music you'll ever hear!","review":"I agree with all the previous reviews. This is one of the prettiest CD's I've ever heard. \\"Donkey Carol\\" caught my attention a few years ago when the classical music station played it during the Christmas season. It is so heavenly, you really think angels are singing to you! I also loved \\"Cradle Song\\", \\"Ding dong! Merrily on high\\", but all of the songs are beautiful. It really does have an almost \\"other-worldly\\" quality to it, and I'm not usually a large fan of choral music! Thanks to the other reviewers, I purchased the CD and was so happy I did. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"traditional, and comfortingly so...","review":"In a world where new is better and change occurs at an ever-increasing rate, it seems logical that seasonal music would be included in the rush toward mass marketing and commercial airplay. It is amazing, but not surprising, that \\"carols\\" which extol the virtues of an electrically-illuminated ungulant, or which humourously recall the tragic events surrounding the collision of an elderly woman and another ruminating creature of the forest should be featured so prominently in the playlists of the popular culture.Tired as I am of such artistic efforts, Rutter's efforts in leading the Clare College Choir and Orchestra on this collection come at the right time and to the right place. This is true and beautiful music of the season: it is performed well and interpreted with Rutter's master's touch. For those of us whose tastes run to the traditional, this is welcome stuff indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot guitar with great driving riffs, classic rock for Jesus","review":"Lincoln Brewster is a real talent no matter the genre. I first heard Lincol on 'for the love of strange medicine' by Steve Perry ('Oh Sherry' and Journey fame). In this album Lincoln has brought the secular rock balad in to the praise and worship area. There are great songs that can introduce worship to non-churched people while challenging long standing Christians with challenging and uplifting lyrics. Lincoln has also provided lyric sheets and power-point to assist in using this album in church and home settings.

I'm not an expert in 14th-century language, but I'm willing to bet that the words \\"spiffy\\" and \\"sappy\\" weren't in common use at that time. And how Lucrezia could refer to someone's utterance as a \\"malapropism\\" when the literary character on whose name the term is based didn't exist until the 1800s is beyond me.What ultimately made this book unreadable for me, though, was the tortured prose. An example: \\"...these notions became an obsessive sequence of water buckets that I was throwing on my passion's wildfire.\\" This isn't even necessarily the worst example-just the one that occurs on the page where I finally had to give up trying to wade through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Read This Book","review":"This book is an utter distortion of political and social realities of the late 15th century Italian States. It is poorly written and disappointingly researched. Case in point, Mr. Faunce has in improbable \`honeymoon' sex scene between Lucrezia Borgia and her second husband Alfonso of Aragon, situated in the Villa Adriana at Tivoli. Unfortunately for Mr. Faunce, the Villa was sacked by the Barbarians of Totila in late antiquity and the excavation was not begun until 1501, several years after the wedding. The other instances of sheer mendacity are too numerous to list. The book is rife with other asinine inaccuracies that cannot be excused by literary license.

Even being a person who doesn't regularly attend church, the blasphemy of the main character imagining Jesus Christ in sexual acts, very explicitly, is something that entirely disgusts! The fact that this is the first book by a writer who is otherwise a screenwriter should have tipped me off, but I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and was proven wrong.

The manual, while a good source for technical specs, is short on actual repair information. The disjointed manner in which it is written is confusing and tiring. For example, disassembly instructions in one section of the book, and reassembly instructions three or four pages away. In many cases critical information is missing or misrepresented, the drawings are often out of context or just incorrect, i.e. a photo of the correct application of a part for one set of model years but no information for following model years with the same part but different location. If you must buy consider also having a Moss Motors Catalog for correct drawings with the name and location of the part."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I absolutely LOVE JCS. I got so excited when they released a new album, because all the songs on their other ones are so powerful that you just can't stop listening to them. In listening to the first track, I decided it was okay, but the rest of the album sucks. What happened? The songs are so b-l-a-h.

As a major JCS fan, I have been nothing but disappointed with this album. I lacks the raw energy and passion that the earlier albums possessed. JCS has been on a scary road toward becoming a pop band. Haha needs to return to his roots, and ROCK.

It has a few minor quirks which some seem to think make it worthless: The lights don't last long, but they're cheap and easily replaced, and to those who experience shutdown, mine did that for the first time recently. I popped out the small prefilter on the canister top and couldn't see through it, so I ran it under the faucet to rinse out the dust, tapped the water out, and after it cooled down, the vacuum worked like new. Not a big deal. It really is a good vacuum."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works great!","review":"The Fantom vacuum does everything it said it would. The handle is very easy to detach and use for dusting, the vacuum does a great job on both carpets and hard wood floors.

I have used the vacuum almost daily for four years, and have yet to encounter a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well for a while","review":"This vacuum had wonderful suction at first, but only lasted one year.

As a matter of fact, I'm now searching for a new and more sturdy vacuum. Yesterday, the electrical cord came out of the vacuum itself. If you are looking for a really good vacuum, this really isn't the way you want to go. It's very highly over rated. It does pick up a lot off of the floor, but it's really not worth the money if you want something that will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"wake up call","review":"Works much better than any previous \\"electric\\" toothbrush used.

I've never really had problems with water getting in the battery compartment, but once the cover stops sticking then you can't really use the brush.

Also, batteries last only a few weeks at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product should be Recalled - It will break in no time!","review":"AS many other reviews stated, the unit is not built to last.The snap on plastic bottom in the battery compartment will break even with the utmost care. Water and humidity will get in and zap out the circuitry - as well as shorting out the batteries. The battery cantacts are consructed of such soft metal that the pressure of the battery itself will stretch the contacts so they no longer make a connection to the batteries.My unit lasted a bit longer than some I've read here - 3 months.I liked the concept of not being stuck with a rechargeable unit which has batteries that cannot be replaced - unfortunatley this unit will need to be replaced many times over the rechargeable units (which have more power in the brush strokes than this unit).From all these reviews it is obvious that this is a defectivly designed unit, and should be recalled, discontinued, or perfected."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!!!!","review":"Dont buy this.Other Sonicare products are good but this battery operated is not worth your money.Reasons:This will stop operating when the water enters to the battery compartment.

More important than the weight of the charger was my concern about the availability of converters or proper voltage plug-ins to recharge my regular Sonicare, as I was traveling with 2 other people, and we all had cell phone and digital camera batteries to recharge nightly, so I didn't want to take up valuable plugs. I have used a rechargeable Sonicare toothbrush for years, with great results. This one works just the same, and the original batteries lasted for the entire 3 weeks (and it's still going)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"My old Sonicare died after and few years and I had tried using several different brush types, manual and powered, attempting to find a cheap replacement. After a less than stellar annual check-up, I decided to just buy another Sonicare.I saw this model and could not believe how little it cost. My old one was over a hundred dollars. It worked great too. I saw no difference other than the lack of the quadpacer timer thing. Unfortunately, it died in less than two weeks. And no, it was not the batteries, the thing is just dead.I suggest you buy a rechargable 4100 for forty or fifty dollars. I have been using one for a few months now with no issues. It has the great cleaning action of a Sonicare at a reasonable price. Same as with the cheap battery powered model, the brush turns off after two minutes but does not have the quadpacer or any other fancy features."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks water into battery compartment","review":"The first toothbrush i bought was eating batteries like crazy, new set every five days. Then i noticed water leaks inside the battery compartment and shorts them. Paid special attention to how to close - no good. Returned to amazon, thought it's a bad one, got another one - still sucks. I don't really understand how water goes inside but it kills the batteries. The only way to keep it working is to open and dry it every few uses and also keep it stored horizontal (not standing).Update: my solution to the problem was to dip both battery ends in petroleum jelly (Vaseline) to protect them from corroding from water, then then liberally top up the cap with more jelly before closing. being hydrophobic, that petrolatum seal seems to keep water away from the battery compartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sonicare yet","review":"I've had a few sonicare tooth brushes over the past several years, all of the previous ones dying due to dead batteries after a year or two. I've pulled them open and replaced batteries in the past, but when I saw this model, with replaceable batteries? Perfect! It functions the same as other models in the same family, and costs 1/3 of the others that include a rechargeable battery. I like that when I travel, I am not stuck with bringing along another charger. It shares the same 2 AA batteries as my camera!Regarding issues of water & corrosion: either wipe or rinse the thing off after each use, or store it horizontally. simple. I've had 2 of these for a couple months now, and there are no problems whatsoever. NiMH batteries last 2-4 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I received this as a gift for Christmas.

Don't waste your money on this cheap Sonicare, just buy the more expensive ones that are better made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Totally worthless purchase. For one, it's noisy compared with other power brushes i've had. It began cutting out on me, at first I thought it was the cheap batteries that came with it. Then I replaced them and it continued to cut out. Bad connection inside or shorting out? I kept taking it apart to look at, changed batteries again and still nothing. It wouldn't run anymore except for one other time, then i turned it off to rinse and it wouldn't start again. It sat unused for a few weeks before I decided to pitch the damn thing in the garbage. I never did bother finding the paper work to return it. Isolated case of a lemon? Who knows.

I had an extra AA wall charger and lots of rechargeable AA batteries so I threw that in his \\"care package\\" and he says it works fine.I also use a Braun toothbrush that takes AA's and I use rechargeable AA's in it and it is great.

I was hopeful that mine would last. However after about 4 weeks of total use, mine would cut off after about 10 seconds of use. Eventually it completely stopped working. It was not batteries or any other obvious problem. Both were defective. It most likely stems from water in the internal compartment. It was very frustrating.

I upgraded to this from the Sonicare Advance after it failed to hold a charge any longer. With the other Sonicares, you have to throw the whole unit out if the batteries inside die. With these you just change out the batteries. I liked them so much I bought 2. Now after 3 months, both of them have already died. The end cap where you replace the batteries is not water tight. The O-ring that seals the battery compartment is not made very well. There are also 2 holes at the bottom of the toothbrush next to the metal clip on the endcap, which I believe is a design flaw. Although Sonicare sent me replacement units, I believe these replacements will also only last a few months. This is a great toothbrush for brushing, except they need to send it back to the design stage for the water resistant problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"This brush WILL quickly self-destruct...DO NOT BUY!!","review":"Do not base your purchase decision on any reviewer who has had the product for only a day, two days, or even a week. My Sonicare Xtreme e3000 brush died about 3 weeks after first use. All owners of this brush will, sooner and probably not much later, find that water will invade the battery compartment and corrode the metal contacts and your batteries. That's what happened to mine and, after reading other reviews here and elsewhere, apparently is also happening to all other users of this brush. The O-Ring rubber seal suffers a design flaw and cannot maintain a water-tight seal. It's very obvious from the moment you first install the batteries...the bottom cap just will not seal tight enough! This product needs to be recalled by the manufacturer and Amazon needs to stop selling this garbage.

Called Sonicare and they offered to replace the toothbrush. Great!Received the replacement, but alas, the SAME THING HAPPENED! It's dead, less than 2 weeks after receiving it. I'm applying for a full refund from Sonicare. They say they will give it to me if I fill out a form and ship it back at my expense. They also offered the option of a replacement, but I think this is just a very poor design. Too bad, because when it works, it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"So excited to purchase this toothbrush. I loved my Sonicare electric cordless, so thought this would be even more amazing. Within three weeks, the battery-operated one died. Thought perhaps I had a lemon. Tossed it and ordered a new replacement with the additional little silicone cover heads to keep water and moisture out. Three weeks later, the second one died. Contacted customer service, they said the batteries may have died after three weeks and that I should clean the contact points with alcohol and a cotton swab. Right. If you're looking for a high maintenance toothbrush that will die on you within weeks of purchase, by all means, buy this one. I had an electric, cordless Sonicare that I had for years and years and regretfully tossed it out, thinking the battery operated would be wonderful. I would give the battery-operated one 0 stars if possible, and will go back to my manual brush. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product I Ever Used!","review":"Bought two toothbrushes for my wife and I, and two packages of replacement heads. Mine crippled soon due to the water leakage to the battery compartment, and water leakage also caused odor formed from the base compartment of the brush.

The brush goes too fast, the brush is too small and the hard plastic handle hits against your teeth, and rattles on them, if you don't have the angle just right. Also, when you brush your teeth normally, you turn the brush around and up and down; thus, water running out of your mouth, goes all over the housing which allows water to get inside the housing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"First, I did NOT buy this from Amazon.com, so I am only writing to warn others.

Bought another and it lasted about 3 years.Couldn't afford the higher cost models and bought this as a temporary solution...well it lasted a matter of weeks before it stopped working.I WILL however buy one of the lesser expensive rechargeable models though because you cannot get a comparable look and feeling of clean with any other toothbrush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"aweful packaging","review":"The packaging that comes with the brush, not the amazon packaging, but the Phillips packaging is the worst.

I unfortunately told my wife about it and had her buy it too and now we have 2 unhappy users.Mainly its the battery compartment.. which is in the bottom (blue cap). If you dont dry up the brush before storing.. then overtime the water can enter the batt compartment and corrode the batteries. The corrosion prevents the batt caps from even closing... which prevents the mechanism to operate. Both the brushes are not working as of this morning.

To say I'm disappointed is an understatement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toothbrush, Especially for College","review":"I've used this toothbrush, the essence 5600, and the flexcare r910. The flexcare is more powerful and has better brush heads (it also avoids the problem of having water trapped inside the brush and growing mold), but it's also far more expensive. The essence 5600 is a waste of money in my opinion as it has the same performance as this toothbrush, but suffers from a shoddy li-on battery that dies after about a year or so of use. This avoids the battery problem by using replaceable AA batteries and lasts quite a while on each replacement.The only major con is with the brush head design. There is a a gap between the brush body and head, and this gap tends to fill with water after use. This unfortunately leads to black mold growing in the cavity. It's easy to avoid this by simply unscrewing the head after brushing and rinsing out the cavity, but it's an annoyance nonetheless.All in all, this is a great cheap way to get the benefits of sonicare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted","review":"I really enjoyed this toothbrush for the eight months it worked.

This works just like the Sonicare units with the charging stations, except that you change the batteries. It uses the e-series heads. It does not have the reduced speed on initial use which may be a problem for first time users of sonicares. The bottom pulls off to put the batteries in. The edges that you need to hold onto to remove the battery cover are a small making it a bit difficult to remove the cover.The only downside is how fast it goes through batteries. The information on the product does tell you that it will go through the regular batteries quickly. I was getting only 3 days or so which I thought was little too fast. Lithium batteries last several weeks when the sonicare is used by one person.I give it 4 stars because of the battery compartment cover and the battery use.

I don't think it's those holes that others mentioned (they really lead nowhere inside the battery compartment) and I wasn't getting any water passed the 0-ring. I think the circuit is just junk.

I didn't want to pay the exorbitant price for the plug in so I purchased this unit. We use rechargeable batteries in my house so replacing the batteries would be no big deal. After a week of use, it stopped working. Thinking maybe I had defective batteries I replaced them. The toothbrush worked on and off for another 2 weeks then completely stopped working. Phillips did agree to send me a new one but unfortunately, that stopped working in just a few days.

Otherwise, skip it completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it works","review":"This toothbrush is wonderful, when it is working. Unfortunately, serious design flaws allow moisture to enter the battery compartment and corrode the battery contacts. This is mildly annoying, at first, because you can usually get it going by tapping the toothbrush on the counter top. Eventually, after a month or two, the battery contact will be so corroded that no amount of tapping will help and you have to go in with something abrasive (like sandpaper) to clean up the battery contact.

Once again veteren Cinematographey Ernest Dickerson shines his brillian photography.The score by Terence Blanchard is also excellent. Like I said this is my favorite Spike Lee movie. This may not be spikes best work (do the right thing) but this is the first film where spike seeems most comfortable behind the camera. MO better has a real 'im a porfessional'look to it.

Further complicating his life are his lifelong freind and mooch - Giant, and his bandmate, Shadow. Giant is in and out of trouble, and Shadow longs to move out of Bleeks shadow to form his own band.This is a visually stimulating film. Spike Lee's uses of colors and lighting creates a mood that is essentially Jazz. The ambiente atmosphere of the film is highlighted by outstanding music composed by Branford Marsalis.Mo-Better blues is an urban tale that will strike at the heart of all.

Wesley Snipes, who to me is always better when he plays an evil character, is wonderful in this. Denzel is a little on the flat side in this one, this isn't a Malcolm X or Training Day performance for him. Wesley is wonderful. No action hero [stuff], just a great acting job. Spike is in it as expected and does his usual in his role. Joi Lee is credable and the soundtrack is good if not spectacular. If you are a Spike or a Wesley fan, add it to your collection.

(1/4 inch for the wheel support and 1/8 inch for the brace. If you need to use the spacing washing, add another 1/8 inch.) Because of this, it would not fit on my child's bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my granddaughter","review":"Needed some training wheels for a 16 in girl's bike and wanted something what would be easy to assemble and safe.

We had to return them and have yet to find a new pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big League UPS.","review":"This compact beauty will give you UPS for 4 outlets, enabling you to run an avg system for about a half hour! It also features 4 surge-protected only outlets, a USB circuit (or an RS232 in another model) and a phone or ethernet in jack plus 2 phone or ethernet jacks out (acts as a splitter). It also has voltage regulation to smooth out spikes & dropoffs and finally adds hot-swapability for its 525VA battery. It is a nice package of features in a nice compact, user-friendly box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty out of the box, but doesn't last","review":"This is lovely stuff, but in normal use it chips and breaks easily. Unless you plan to hand-wash and not use it much, look elsewhere. In the space of just a few months, several pieces became damaged. There's just no excuse for such fragile products..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable - chips easily","review":"I bought this set and the brown set and both chipped in less than two weeks. I guess that's what you get for $50. I had originally wanted to get matching serving pieces when they became available, but have decided to keep looking for everyday dinnerware that is more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but very light and breaks easily!","review":"This is the worst set of dishes I've ever owned... The dishes are very very light, they are like chalk with a glaze on them. These are not very durable, I would not put a hot cup of coffee in the cups!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I sent this set to my daughter as a gift thinking that the image looked fantastic and they were quite a bargain. She called last night to say the gift arrived and she hoped it was a joke because this is one of the cheapest (in quality) sets of dishes she's ever seen. She only unwrapped a mug and one dish and put them back in the box, hoping that she would be able to return them. I sure hope I don't have to pay to re-ship a 23 pound box! If only she lived nearby, we could break the dishes into little pieces, turn them into a lovely mosaic, and chalk this up to a learning experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"great colors and design but it ends there","review":"I had the same dishes for 18 years, Pfaltzgraff Heritage. I was quite tired of them and replaced them with these. Big mistake. They look great out of the box but they chip VERY EASILY. And, because of the great, deep colors, chips are quite noticeable. I'll be lucky if these last 1 year. My most disappointing and only disappointing Amazon purchase to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but not durable","review":"This set is very pretty, but the glaze is not consistent so some pieces always look dirty or streaked. Even with gentle use, knife marks show immediately. A gentle bump against the side of sink caused a huge white chip, making the plate unusable.This is not durable enough for everyday use. I am very disappointed with the product and regret also having purchased the serving pieces. I predict remaining odds and ends will end up in next summer's rummage sale. I wish I would have invested in Fiestaware instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful to look at , but not durable!","review":"I spent many months looking for the perfect set of dishes to replace my 10+ yr old dishes. Was soooo excited to find these dishes - exactly what I was looking for! So when they began to chip after using for just 2 weeks, I was extremely disappointed! I have a service of eight and just about every piece has a chip. They already need to be replaced!(after using for a month) My other dishes were just a cheap set and they have lasted over 10 years without ONE chip! DO NOT RECOMMEND! Don't be fooled by how nice they look! I just wish I could get my money back......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely color but...","review":"Though this set is a wonderful color...it is quite heavy and not suitable for children or the frail. Also, it chips easily and often. We still use it but sparingly. If one has troubles holding a heavy cup...then this is not for you.They are great for microwave heating because they do not transfer heat like glass or Corelle. The price is right but spending a bit more for a set that does not chip so easily would advisable. If you will be using regularly with children or the elderly....their weight would be an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Breakable","review":"I purchased two sets in 2003. Most pieces now are chipped and this is definitely not a product I would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply beautiful","review":"This dinnerware is simply beautiful. The pictures cannot do it justice. The dark specs in the glaze are really interesting. Presentation of food is impressive on the dark plates (the midnight blue). If you like the look and size, I recommend this set highly. One caution: the plates are too large for a really secure way to load more than a few in my dishwasher, and they will chip if they are banged around. I have been happily using them (all pieces, including mugs) for more than 8 months, washing the dinner plates by hand, and so far can find only the tiniest chip on one plate, which may have been there originally. The other pieces go in the dishwasher and survive. The mugs in particular are really nice, great for coffee lovers. This is the only set of dishes I have owned with mugs I like to use every day. To feed a large family, or let kids clean up, this set might not be the best choice, but otherwise highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"These dishes are not for everyday use. I give them one star for fabulous style and colors (I bought three different colors), but that's the most I can give them. These dishes chip very, very easily, and the underlying ceramic is bright white, so you really can't miss the chips. Plus, I'm not sure that I buy the \\"dishwasher safe\\" label, because these get unbelievably hot after short periods in the microwave, and change color also. I DO NOT recommend that you purchase these if you plan to actually use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"I ordered this set about 8 months ago in the blue. Since then it has chipped, faded, and generally disappointed me. When I first got it, I was very pleased. I guess if you hand wash it, it would last longer...but who wants to? I gave my beautiful Dansk away because I thought I was sick of it to replace it with this. Sighhhhhh...I guess I learned my lesson! You get what you pay for, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but chip easily","review":"I was very excited about the product and bought several different colors. But they chip easily and get very hot in the microwave. I like the idea of breaking them up into mosaics pieces! I want to contact the company for refund. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased the bordeaux, olive and gold sets of dishes for everyday use. The colors are beautiful on the service and were a perfect match for my decor. However, I was so disappointed that these dishes chipped at the slighted hit against another dish or against each other. Just about all of my dishes have more than one chip on them. Also, they are not all that microwave safe, especially the green ones. The are very hot when removed from the microwave. I thought I would love these dishes, but I feel cheated! They don't last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"I decided after 13 years with the same dishes, I'd treat myself to a new set. Although the Sabatier dishes are very pretty, they don't seem to be very durable. The glaze is very thin, resulting in lines on the plates from using a knife or other sharp utensil to cut food, and I have already chipped one plate. Fortunately, I only bought one set of 4 place settings - I won't be buying any more and will look at some other brand to replace my old dishes instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but not tough enough","review":"The style and color of these dishes are beautiful, but they chip and crack at the slightest thing! I have only had my burgandy set for 2 weeks, and already 3 of the dishes have chipped. The color white is underneath, which makes the dish look very unappealing!!! Very disappointed in the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"See You On The Journey!","review":"What a terrific read! Unlike so many \\"business\\" books, The Problem Solving Journey offers detailed and inspiring examples that make the author's approach really come alive. Hoenig's breakdown of the problem-solving personalities and their corresponding problem-solving essentials are easy to grasp. I couldn't help but think about the various colleagues I've teamed with while reading the descriptions. Hoenig nails them. And the book offers clear insights into why some teams aren't so productive or successful, despite the good people involved -- too many Discoverers, not any Performers or Playmakers, etc. Read this book. But, also, go to the author's company Web site and take the online problem-solving personality assessment. Great stuff. I look forward to running into Chris Hoening on my personal problem-solving journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem Solving Generalities","review":"The book's main thesis is that problem-solving should involve a multifaceted team. Yet surprisingly, every case study (filling about 3/4 of the pages) describes an individual who was successful by excelling in ONE of these facets. Not a single case study describes problem-solving by a team of individuals with different problem-solving skills, which is what the author recommends. The book might be useful for people who could benefit by thinking more about the problem-solving process; there are constant generalities describing this process. Also, I frankly disagree that problem-solving is more important in the \\"information age\\". Why? This thesis is also not well defended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psycho-Business Babble","review":"This book will not help you solve business problems.

Although I had considered myself comfortable with Elizabethan dialect, I've learned a lot from the No Fearbooks.

Side-by-side with modern English, Shakespeare's poetry is even more luminous."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Better Way to Read or Teach Shakespeare","review":"Can't imagine a better way to read or teach Shakespeare than the No Fear Shakespeare concept....orginal text on the left hand page, contemporary \\"translation\\"--our language--on the right hand page.The tragic beauty of Romeo and Juliet gets better time. Young love is still young love, but the older one gets, the more young love is apprectiated, the youth of the lovers, their hopes, their dreams, their obsessions, their foolishness, their folly and, yes, their endearments and their commitment to honor and to each other.There is a reason Shakespeare never disappoints and this is one of them...and having the original text and the easily understood text right next to it makes this play especially moving and enjoyable.The reader may well be surprised at how many quotes we take forgranted in modern laguage and idiom come from this play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a Classic Contemporary","review":"My daughter says that this translates the play \\"into English...not any of those thee and thou things.\\" I should be helpful for her high school English class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for the profanity and induendos!","review":"My daughter was given this book to read in her 8th grade class.

I am connected to a cable modem. The network was originally a challenge to get set up and running. It actually took two weeks of trial an error along with much consultations of internet resorce areas. Additionally, the 1.0 software for the Airport needed to be refined. The 3.0 version is a definite improvement! For the past 10 months the network has been a joy to use. I can have all three computers up and running without any noticeable slowdown in operation.

And yet... after several spins, I realized this group's music is not a simple soundtrack, the CD stands well on its own as a great, straight-up alt/indie rock album. The group seems pretty quirky, rocking when they feel like it (and yes, they can), other times being comic, cynical, heartfelt, nostalgic, bluesy, grungy...their self-given title of \\"experimental\\" fits very well. Standout tracks include the loungy, reflective \\"No One,\\" the rock/county ballad \\"A Girl Named Tex,\\" the laid-back, homespun, almost karaoke-sounding \\"Superhero\\" and \\"Steady Ride,\\" a great song for the open road. One of the VERY rare CDs that I happily listen to every track. Money well spent, and I wish they'd hurry up with their long-delayed second album. ^.^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't looking for much.","review":"I bought this cd to get 2 tracks: Blood Gulch Blues & another song entitled No One.

Thumping it with one of the buttons would get it moving, but it would not stay running. Having experience with a couple other models, I would recommend either a $25 Oster for basic needs or go for a $400 Vitamix with the brute strength to do anything and do it for years. A mid-level model with these types of issues are a ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!","review":"We selected this blender because we thought it was a higher quality blender for light duty smoothies and sauces. The control buttons stopped working in the middle of blending a smoothie, causing me to have to unplug it to get it to stop. When it was plugged back in, it was completely dead.

However, I found out that the CD had been released for quite some time before I even knew about it. After receiving the CD, I eagerly listened to both CD's, I can say I thoroughly enjoyed them. Jordan has a wonderful voice and I think he did justice to many of the songs, I will not say all of them, but many of them. The one thing any NKOTB fan MUST remember is this is a REMIX CD, meaning yes it is not the same as the original, it did bring back some good memories but you will tend to miss parts of Jon, Danny, Joe and Donnie. I would recommend this CD to any fan, but keep in mind, its not the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought back memories","review":"Wow these albums are great. The first album is the 'Pop' mixes, and listening to it brought back so many memories of my teen years. I forgot how much NKOTB's music moved me. The second album is the 'Eroupean mixes.' This album is in my opinion the better of the two. The beats are funky, and fun. I found myself dancing around the room with my kids, who totaly enjoyed their first listens to NKOTB.I was also surprised at how many of the lyrics I remembered since it had been years since I had listenend to any of their albums more than once through. Even my husband would enjoy it if he could bring himself to get past the name of the group, and the torture he gave to his sister for liking them. Serves him right that he's married to me now LOL!Thanks for all the great memories. Well worth the money!Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item received!","review":"What I ordered was the Health Outdoor Products Peanutty Raisin Suet cakes...what I received are Health Outdoor Products Song Bird Suet cakes.

Because I can get 11.5 ounce cakes at my local hardware store for .99, the Peanutty cakes are comparable and I thought the birds might like a change of taste.

He tells you that much himself.Par example:He calls Rhody McCoy an \\"angry black man,\\" I think, and basically argues that Albert Shanker was justified in making 500,000-some odd copies of anti-Semitic material from a couple hundred pamphlets supposedly distributed by supporters of decentralization in Ocean Hill-Brownsville in Brooklyn - some of these later found to be fraudulent - because \\"Jewish fears about anti-Semitism were real.\\" Etc.Read this one critically, because Friedman is making an obviously subjective argument."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial and glossy","review":"Rx for Survival presents a media-friendly perspective of what makes a difference in international development and health.

I took it to Indonesia with me for two months. Indonesian is the easiest language I have ever studied, by far. Your learning curve is very high and Indonesians are very friendly and easy to talk to. Learning the language is very rewarding and this book does a pretty good job of helping you speak the language. No book is complete and you should always organize your own grammar notes and vocabulary words but this is the best book I have come upon. It also has the added bonus of being made on cheap paper so it is light to carry if you are traveling with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read on an interesting man","review":"It is hard to believe that other people have not written about Richard Taylor, but they need not bother now that Parrish has written this book. This book on Taylor is engaging and interesting, but also very scholarly. Although Parrish's writing style can be dry at times, his topic does not allow the book to get mired in details or become boring. Instead, Taylor's life jumps off the pages and Taylor led such a life that we, the reader, get a great overview of pre-Civil War politics, the war in the Trans-Mississippi, and the Reconstruction Era. Normally, I find the pages on the time before and after the war somewhat boring, but this was not the case with this book. The whole book really kept my attention and was very interesting. Thinking back, I really cannot think of any criticisms of this work. Just a good, solid history book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blues and Guitar","review":"I bought it for \\"the Itch\\" which is a blues number with some samba piano and fun guitar and nice rhythym.

It is a brand we very much prefer, as we find it to be very good. It contains 70% coconut milk versus the usual 55% most of the other brands contain (and many brands do not even list this fact), so you are getting more coconut flavor in each can. The one big thing we DO NOT like is that it contains preservatives. This brand does not seem to be available without it; we checked their website. So, even though we like it, we are trying other brands without preservatives. This contains coconut milk--70%, water and potassium metabisulphite (E224). As yet, we have not been able to find another brand of coconut cream similar to this. We DO like that there are clear, easy to decipher, production and expiration dates on each can. Many brands do not do this. Hope this info is helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice product, but not *that* nice","review":"One day I bought a can of coconut cream at the supermarket, just to see what it was. One day, I got around to opening the can. It was thick n creamy, very yummy, excellent in my morning cup of cocoa chai, perfect for baked goods when moistness was needed. It went fast. Too fast. Now I can't find it on a store shelf anywhere in my town. Not even sure it was Savoy brand. But I was glad to find it here at Amazon. For $1.62 it's worth it to try and see if it's the same product that I liked so well. But $6.75 for shipping?! Not if I never eat coconut cream again.

Begun with, mostly, Claude Shannon, this topic of study has been growing into a real science for decades now, but for some reason it is one of the most misunderstood subjects out there, even for seasoned professional scientists. Seife cuts to the heart of the matter with very clear thinking and examples from a very well rounded range of scientific points of view. Seife clearly and very engagingly demystifies many confusing topics and brings a real and almost visceral familiarity to a complex subject. After reading this, you will understand many esoteric scientific concepts better than even some professionals... and enjoy it immensely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeks only to amaze, and shoehorn reality into his theory","review":"The book is constantly sticking the word 'information' into spots where it makes no sense, as if to justify the idea of 'Information Theory.'

It might be good for someone without a scientific or technical background, but if you have already read a lot about information and complexity, you find his coverage a little \\"light\\".

Instead of telling us what is this view, we are forced first to go first through the usual typical topics in popular science: a oversimplified explanation of quantum physics, relativity, what is entropy, etc.When the time comes to cover the specific topics of the book, quantum computing is explained very fast, and without clarity. Regarding the implications to the \\"cosmos\\", the author first adheres to the \\"decoherence\\" interpretation of quantum mechanics, and a few chapters later he bases the reasoning in the \\"multiple worlds\\" interpretation, which he takes seriously and claims that is \\"rapidly becoming the favorite of physicists\\" [sic].

However, the cover of the book has a picture Netscape Navigator on it.This book offers a huge vault of neat little tricks, but I wouldn't want to learn Javascript from it. The examples are right on par, though, for teaching you examples. If you have no other programming experience, you'll probably want to avoid this book, as I felt it was good only if you knew Javascript already and wanted to perform a neat trick or two with the stuff. Most of it involves graphical quirks rather than form processing and such.There are better books around, but this one has its place.

American orchestras rarely play short, easygoing symphonies like these two works. Even the early Schubert symphonies are rarely played. These two works of Gounod are not great masterpieces but they are delightful and these performances are magnificent. As a bonus there is the wonderful ballet music from \\"Faust\\", a real masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was great","review":"I really enjoyed this, especially considering that it's fairly hard to find recordings of Gounod's symphonies, which are severely under appreciated. With this you get a recent recording that sounds great, not to mention that it comes from The Academy of St. Martin in the Field conducted by Sir Neville Mariner. So with some of the best sounding classical music from one of the greatest orchestras then and now you get more bang for your buck. Definitely worth your money, especially considering that the compositions are not all that accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a sad but brilliant time capsel.","review":"I'm fortunate enough to have taped this old classic from 1920 which reflects all the awfullness that was our country in 1919. Which isn't to say we as a society have changed so much, but lynching is not a resolution anymore to a proublem with an African American.This movie showed a world from the past and I loved the fact that this film still exists, so often all charecters in our silent films are played by whie people in black face. We must never forget and this very artistic representation of how our country once oppressed the African American is a wonderous reminder. Theres painfully true scenes of rape and lynch mobs that grab the black charecters to lynch much like I imagined a Jew was grabbed in Nazi Germany in 1940, difference is we in this country were the bad guys! Its tough to view, but I'll always cherish this evidance of a more primative time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion!","review":"I love this recording. It's beautifully played, interpreted, and recorded. It is also a reminder that Solti's programming in Chicago was very conservative overall, and that Solti had a great deal more in him than just the bombastic orchestral showpieces. Here we have an excellent choice of vocal soloists as well some excellent solo work within the orchestra. The Chicago Symphony Chorus is wonderfully polished and clear. In all respects, this one of a handful of truly excellent recordings of this work.

White shows the greatness of Nehemiah and the productivity of his leadership. He shows how Nehemiah's results were based on sincere devotion to prayer, Scripture and the holiness of God. Nehemiah also demonstrates considerable courage and wisdom in the face of severe opposition and danger. This is a book that is relevant for any leaders, especially leaders in churches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lead by Example and Faith","review":"White attempts to put some meat on true Christian leadership by doing exegetical study in the life of Nehemiah. His Excellence in Leadership outlines some sound biblical principles of leadership. It doesn't give the message, but surveys the means. Nehemiah is a leader because he inspires his people with a vision, and isn't vague about that vision, but is very specific to the task. He is a man who knows specifically what he believes, and trusts God with all his might for God Himself to carry out His purposes. The Law of God and the knowledge that God is always victorious is at the center of Nehemiah's successful leadership. As always, John White has given us a tender yet instructive interpretation of the Scriptures, sharing his own life in its application. This book is a beginning for those who desire to be God's tool in the leadership of His people to healing and victory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.

Regretfully, the Visual Quickstart Guide merely rehashes the same information that is available in the User Guide.

I came to this site because it was a link from NRP's website.I read the reviews. Tell me again, why I would want to read a book about a woman who thinks she's livin' the dream, but in reality it's a nightmare. Having it all, wow, what a novel concept. Unless you've been living in a cave, the people who seem to have had it all are imploding with a nauseating regularity. They end up in rehab or dead.The comments about the author making sure she or her husband were home by 7p.m. to be with their very ill daughter were pretty revolting. Wow, what a sacrifice.

The book seemed really intriguing from the cover. Two pages in, I was becoming increasingly irritated that this book seemed like nothing more than an outlet for her ego. She mentions SEVERAL times by page 3 that she's brought a few magazines to the top, has a bunch of kids, etc.Personally, I would have preferred it if she had considered her target audience. Mentioning how successful she is in a way that makes it sound condescending does not really help her readers; it seems more like she's rubbing it in their faces.On another note, did she consider personality types? I personally don't want to be away from home for 16+ hours a day. She didn't seem to consider mentioning how to become successful while still having a life outside of work.For a woman who claims to have it all, I doubt she has time for a bubble bath.I'd prefer to read Sports Illustrated.

After a year or so with that one, the water flow out if the filter dropped quite a bit. That showed just how much it had worked for me.These filters deliver \\"Spring water\\" quality, no matter how bad the city water is. All you have to do is get one of these and a cheapo Automobile Oil Filter changer tool ($6.00) to swap it out. Just be sure to clean out the filters insides as well when you open in.

That's due entirely to Milland's riveting, Oscar-winning portrayal of Don, a man so hysterically self-destructive that he sacrifices his dignity and others' goodwill to keep himself in a state of perpetual stupor. Cheery it's not, but \\"Lost Weekend\\" is a landmark work, showcasing Wilder at his gut-wrenching best. Wyman also excels in an early role as the concerned Helen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling descent into madness by the drink...","review":"This was one of the first films to show the ugly side of alcohol abuse, coming along only a decade after the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous, and before the AA brand of self-help was adopted by rehab centers or was widely publicized. Seeing this today, one realizes that much of it is dated now, but Ray Milland's struggles with cravings still vividly connect with the audience. Overall, and in reverse chronological order, the movie is well-performed, well-directed, well-written and worth seeing at least once, if you are interested in the problem or in American classic film-making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think you may be an alcoholic?","review":"This 4 star movie could help answer that question.

There are some remarkable sequences here, in particular the opera scene nodding to Chaplin's 'The Gold Rush', or the Kafkaesque purse-snatching incident. Throughout, Wilder emphasises the circle, the vicious circle, the noose, encircling even the narrative, ironising any 'cop out' move towards resolution, which, based on pure talk, has no solidity. This is one that will go on and on, ending only in death or madness.Still, this is Wilder's most overrated film, as dated in dialogue, assumptions and wearisome drunk hero as a Eugene O'Neill play; while the visual 'daring' now looks frequently risible. For a genuinely moving portrayal of a drunk, catch Melville's 'Deux Hommes Dans Manhatten'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much Message","review":"The Lost Weekend is about an alcoholic would be novelist who loves drinking more than friends and family. Desperate to stop drinking but even more desperate to keep drinking he throws his life into a soul destroying lost weekend of booze, crime and madness.The acting is fantastic and you really feel the characters trying to cope with such self destruction. But I feel this film has dated somewhat. The Lost Weekend is a \\"message\\" film about the dangers of the bottle and it hits you on the head with it. Also the ending is not quite what you'd expect in a modern film on this subject. This film is not one of Wilder's best, and in my opinion is not a standout Academy Award Winner but is nevertheless a very good film and possibly a little ahead of its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"My DVD disc was damaged.

This would have to be one of my favourite hard rock songs of all time and one that can instantly lift my mood no matter what.Being more a fan of metal the tracks 'Instruments of Destruction' by NRG and 'Nothin's Gonna Stand in Our Way' by Spectre General are also stand out and it is hard not to be a fan of Kal Swan's soaring vocals on the Transformers Theme which is surely one of the best vocal tracks this guy has ever laid down.Woven throughout these pumping rock tracks is the work of Vinnie DiCola, which is also able to transport you to various parts of the movie instantly with his talented compositions.

They worked in concert to create what is truly a bonafide masterpiece.Dennis is a prolific and thorough aviation history book designer and writer with many well received works; Tony is a dedicated artist, photographer and writer.They both love the Great White Bird! And it really shows in this profusely illustrated work.So with this latest, greatest history on the Valkyrie produced by them, there isn't any need for another book to be published on North American's Mach 3 Superbomber.Highly recommended!Steve PaceTacoma, WA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless - lots of false alarms","review":"Bought this radar detector after my Bel radar detector bit the dust after 10 years. I've had this detector for about a month now and found it to be useless. Lots of false alarms on all bands, especially on K and Ka. I have yet to see a police car with radar after the alarms go off. I had to turn off the radar detector \\"detector\\" features (VG-2 and Spectre) as they would go off for no reason. An example: sitting in a driveway of a rural subdivision and the VG-2 alarm going off non-stop, and I live in a state (Wisconsin) that doesn't even use these types of detectors. Voice alert got annoying after awhile so I turned that off too. My old Bel detector was always on the mark with detecting police radar and rarely had false alarms. I would not recommend this product to anyone - waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this radar detector","review":"This radar detector is the probably the best detector i ever owned, the range is great i live in raleigh north carolina and i do lots of highway driving and this thing saved me at least 50 times from a speeding tickets and the compass is amazing and everything on it, the only dislike is out of know where it will display pop mode when theres no cops insight, like i will be in my driveway and the detector will go off like crazy. But other then that great detector i recommend it to all my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"phenominal","review":"Product works great... the only gripe i have is that the power cord is very elastic and pulled the detector off my dash a few times.

I wanted the added protection to avoid speeding tickets. The features of this product are good and I do like having it but I would not reccomend it to anybody. What I found out after buying it was that state troopers don't turn on there radar guns when sitting on the side of the highway. They wait till you fly by them and then clock you. This detecter does alert you but for the most part I've already seen the cop and slowed down and the police don't even bother clocking you at that point. I did take a long trip for Thabnkgiving and this was true thru many states. I havn't gotten a ticket and do slow slow down when it does go off but in my opinion there is no reason to buy any type of radar detector. Cops have become smart to them and there will never be a detector that can detect a turned of police radar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch Fido!!","review":"WOW!!! We just LOVED this movie.

Plus, these guys don't sound as full of themselves as Duran Duran. Maybe that's what happens when everyone laughs at the name of your band.

This is NOT the Dissection of yore, nor should it be expected to be. To say that a man should serve 7 years in prison and emerge unchanged would be folly, and the music is as much of a reflection of that as anything. The biggest departure of this album from the previous albums has got to be the sound quality. Absolutely top notch, and it gives the recording a whole new sheen. I'd imagine that if this were recorded in a similar style as Storm, then you would see entirely different opinions in the reviews. Favorite tracks of the album are the title track \\"Reinkaos\\", the epilogue \\"Maha Kali,\\" and \\"Beyond the Horizon,\\" but they are all quality tracks without a one to be skipped over. If you like old Dissection, you may or may not like this album. But if you like METAL, then you will most likely enjoy this recording for its own merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but excellent","review":"after two amazing black metal albums, dissection singer/guitarplayer/mastermind goes to jail for murder because he is, quite frankly, an idiot of the highest order. Though I believe someone is up above, i'm not religious so I could care less about his satanic views, they mean nothing to me. What I do like is the top notch music and vocals. Obviously, prison changed this dude's musical views. So he takes dissection from a black metal band to a melodic death metal band thingy. The result is spectatcular to say the least. I can see why fans would be dissapointed as it's just a total depature from their original sound but I think it's just as good as their other stuff. The melodies on this album, the music itself, it's epic beyond belief. The guitar solos are amazing and the vocals, while not as harsh as their older stuff, are clear and precise. The production adds to the sound, this album sounds IMMENSE. The drumming is outstanding as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissection?","review":"The first time I listened to this cd, I was kind of shocked. It is definitely not the Dissection of old.

Yes, there's an unfortunate In Flames/Gothenburg sound coming from this, which I wasn't prepared to admit after the first two listens. Aside from a few cool solos and occasional mighty riffing, the rest of the material cannot be compared to older Dissection. This band is much more capable than this. This band was one of the few that used to be able to capture an atmosphere without the inclusion of keyboards. This is a major disappointment, and many Dissection fans are already infuriated at this change. This is still a Metal album by all standards; it's just that the hype was too enormous for this album and it does not live to any expectations. 2.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper meaning.","review":"Lets cut right to the point -A human body is useless unless there is an essence inhabiting it - powering it - bringing it to life. This applies to alot of things. It also does to Reinkaos. The music is nothing like the older material and a lot of people have been scorning it. However, the music is secondary to the meaning - the message. If you dont understand the lyrical content then you can't understand this album - for its true meaning and purpose.Remember what Jon said, the music is just a sonic propaganda unit for the message. Once you come to understand what it all means, you realize that the music is indeed powerful and (set-anic) magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"different but not bad","review":"I prefer the old Dissection but this new direction is interesting and I give the band much kudos for experimenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp","review":"I'm not going to be as harsh as the guy below me, but this album is a dissapointment. Lack of blastbeats? I don't know if that's that apt a criticism of Dissection, who even back in the day sounded like black metal light, think black metal with plenty of 70s rock. Kind of what you'd expect from a black metal band from goteburg to sound like. He still has loads of melodies and the music is decent, but the it does sound forced, heavy handed and frankly a little limp. The lyrics are wretched, even for black metal. It reads like a religious shout out list. It might impress 14 year olds but not me. A shame as I've been looking forward to this album since he was convicted. Oh well, at least Ishahn released a solo album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment . . .","review":"I can sum up this album pretty quickly. Slow, boring, weak, repetitous, and anything but aggresive. I cant believe that after seven or so years in prison this is the best Jon could come up with. Their first two albums are my favorite melodic black metal albums ever, hands down. But this, what a sad day in metal history. If this wasnt Dissection, I might give it two stars. This is like Metallica releasing load after the black album (except the old Dissection would devour the old Metallica.)Where are the blast beats Jon, where is the melody, the passion, and excitement of The Somberlain and SOTLB?

The band's official website says that as he was a true Satanist (*red flag there!*) that he felt his time was over.Sorry, but I've got no sympathy for that sort of action, satanist or not.

The Jukebox is delicate. I purchased mine and have had to exchange it 3 times (as of now) due to it's sensative design. There are specific instructions, though simple, to follow while loading and playing files. If the user accidentally presses the wrong buttons, the mistakes wear on the hard drive and it won't be long before the device locks up and fails to work. I regret buying the ARCHOS. It's a terrific idea, 500 cds on one portable drive. But it's a bigger pain than it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Alright, this product works really good for about a month or two. Then it breaks.

Problem is that batteries discharge spontaneously even though the switch is off.Therefore every time I turn on the switch, batterie level is empty state. The product seems to have an internal short-cicuit.I had been complainting this problem to the Archos service center by e-mail several times, but they had been ignoring me. I had no reply from Archos at all. So I recomend the one, who is going to buy a product of Archos by online, not to choose a Archos.

If I email them they tell me to call them, if I call them I get a menu loop. It's unfair. I'm just [out of luck] over, but lucky for you this happened to me first, so it DOESN'T have to happen to you.

You can hear the hard drive spinning in the background of soft sounding music, which defeats its whole purpose.The interface is not very useful and making playlists is very labor intensive. I returned it for Apple's ipod which I am VERY happy with.

This is the worst of all worlds. A product that even when working is not worth the price. It consumes batteres much faster than the 8hr advertised and the output (volume) is real low - at the highest setting it is difficult to hear while jogging or other activities. My unit quit working after about 1 month. I returned it to Archos under warrantee and went through customer service hell, they replaced it with a Jubebox 6000 (smaller 6GB version) without my permission. All attempts to get corrected have been blocked by poor customer service. There is no 1-800 number to customer service so I'm forced to call long distance numbers only to be put on hold for 20+ minutes and then promised call backs that never happened. I'll never buy from Archos again and would not recommend that anyone else even ocnsider their products. There are plenty of reliable products and manufacturers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply HORRIBLE!","review":"I purchased this hunk of junk 2 days ago.

You will never get any tech support....and you will be VERY disappointed if you waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great AntiPod","review":"That's just what I call my Archos, as people ask me if it's a tape player. It's a very reliable product, and reasonable priced. It doesn't force you to use a program like iTunes or Napster to transfer music or any other file to it--It's simply click and drag. I love how it can store my entire music collection.Downsides:-Size: it's heavy and won't fit into most pockets...not good for running with-No Auto-sort of files. Everything has to be done by yourself which takes a while to get going.After about 2 years my battery has worn down A LOT--but, i've gotten very good usage out of it. I would recommend install in the ROCKBOX program as it allows for more options like playing basic games and just more options in general. Also, if price is not an issue, look into the next player up that plays videos as well for about 50$ more."},{"rating":"2","title":"All's Well, Still!","review":"Me again! Quick update on the Archos Jukebox 20.* Batteries charge fine now and display BATERIES CHARGED when topped off.

However, I bought it anyway because I like the fact that I can use it as a regular hard drive.After loading some MP3 files into the jukebox, I played some songs using my own headphones and they all sounded very good.I love the fact that I could save many files from work and brought them home to work on. In the past, I had to put files on CD-R or CD-RW discs and it took a long time to do that. Although saving files to the jukebox is not as fast as saving it to a local hard drive on a PC, it is much faster than creating a CD for sure.I would like to warn people who want to purchase this product that the manual that comes with it contains many errors. I was really having a hard time figuring out how to use a playlist and understand the menu options.

A 128 meg of storage works out just fine for that.I have some concern about ARCHOS as a company mainly because I know nothing about them or if they will last.

It sure doesn't fit into pocket of mine, except maybe my jacket pocket)3) a USB interface, that is extremely SLOW and downloading all this information4) a clutter of wires and adapters to keep it running for any length of time (AA batteries last no time at all)5) no software to help synch your filesLike the rest of the PC world, you get what you pay for: a chepa product that SOUNDS like it's a good deal, but I should have held off and bought Apple's new iPod"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!","review":"Seems like a great little gadget and it would be, if it worked. It worked for the first few months I owned it. Started having all these problems with it and ARCHOS replaced it under warranty. The replacement then worked for a few months and is now doing the exact same thing as the original one.It does not work as a portable mp3 player. You turn it on, it turns itself off 2 seconds later.

Do yourself a favor, buy an iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not user friendly","review":"First off, the software's version that comes with player is out dated. It caused me to loose the 7.5 version of MUSICMATCH JUKEBOX; in return for a 6.0 version. Second, once you do install the software, it takes an eternity to figure that you need more downloading to convert WAV music to MP3 music. The craftmanship and layout of the player indicates that it will probably not withstand the test of time. You must jog through a menu to just adjust the volume. Don't even think about playing the player before the recommended 8 hours recharging time. I let my player recharge for 24 hours, while I attempted to download music. It still didn't play after that. Lastly, the instruction manual is useless at best. It doesn't help you what so ever in downloading music to the portable devise. Afer 36 hours of playing around with it, to no avail., I finally sent it back. It's really not worth the time and effort put into it. Maybe, it's a better hard drive back up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this machine!","review":"This is the worse electronic equipment I've ever purchased.

It would cause my computer to crash frequently, transfering data was very slow, it would not let me transfer very large files, and this can't be used for jogging, since it has a hard drive that tends to crash.

Don't get me wrong, I've always been a major Yardbirds fan - always will be. However, I truly believe their 'Ultimate' 2-CD pick on the Rhino label cannot be beat. Still, it's great to hear tunes on this budget-priced CD like \\"I Ain't Got You\\", \\"Steeled Blues\\", \\"Shapes Of Things\\" (loved hearing this song on the radio when I was like ten), \\"Train Kept A Rollin'\\" and a couple that I didn't immediately recognize like \\"Sweet Music\\" and \\"Stoll On\\".

Several of the songs on this cd have been twords the top of the charts. EVIL HEARTED YOU and FOR YOUR LOVE are probobly the most recognized songs of the YARDBIRDS. The YARDBIRDS sound is pretty much the same as the BEATLES. Which means then, that it is different than the EAGLES. The YARDBIRS were never as popular as the BEATLES, with the baby boomer generation. This can probobly be atributed to there lack of origanil sound and lack of quality lyrics over the long term. this is one of those British clone bands however they really can not be faulted for this as it was the the thing to do at the time. in the song I ANIT GOT YOU they sing about women and there Mojo and how they have every thing exept whats really important to them.

I can totally identify with Duffy's struggle as I'm sure most guys can. It's not like we're totally afraid of commitment - it's like Duffy says in the book we just have to come to terms with it. Gayle has a real talent for finding humour in the small things of life and it's this identification that makes this book such a winner from the word go.

More power to your pen . . .typewriter . . . word processor Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bloody, but wonderfully crafted story.","review":"This book shows Paul Doherty at the peak of his powers as a novelist. The plot is tight and the characterizations are wonderful. The setting is limited to in and around an abbey where it appears that a murderous plot is afoot. Hugh and his two henchmen are asked by their King to go to the Abbey to determine what happened to his old friend who was the Abbot in this abbey. He is found dead in his locked chamber with a dagger through his chest. Hugh, Ranulf and their groom, Chanson arrive only to find an abbey that is cloaked in mystery and in blood. While Hugh is there, many more murders occur, and he needs to find out what is going on in order to stop the carnage. This book is a real page-turner, and as always we read a lot of historical fact in amongst Mr. Doherty's fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational, but not captivating","review":"I bought this DVD for my 2 1/2 year old niece (which may have been too young of an age). I tried to watch it with her, but she didn't seem to be interested in it. It does a great job of showing people doing things and interacting with things while saying the French words, but nothing actually happens. It's just a video montage with no story and no real reason to keep watching.I'm sure your toddler could learn some French from it, but only if you can get them to enjoy and pay attention to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good balance of breadth and depth","review":"This book has everything from basics to more complicated maths. It also comes with algorithms which then can help you implement the theory you just learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same of the first one","review":"I had read the first volume and found it and the author a bit too self-referencing. Still, there were some good insights and wading through it was interesting, if only to get inside another art teacher's mind. But I am not finding the same value as I did in the first book, finding it more of the same for the most part. Sorry; I think the material covered could have been done in much fewer words."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This book is terrible. If you are looking for a book to teach you how to draw better more realistic and dynamic drawings then definitely do not buy this. Half of the book is on gesture drawing (the annoying five-minute drawings which are usually printed on your homework paper). The other half is full of other people talking about their lives in art. This book is more for people who don't know how they want to draw and is to help you explore very boring sides of art. If you are interested in drawing more active drawings ( possibly comic, realistic, lively, anime/manga, or anything interesting) then look for books by Burne Hogarth. He has done some great books on the human anatomy, hands, head, facial exxpressions, etc. Unless you really want to draw potted plants and scribbling exercises, DONT BUY THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drawing for Older Children & Teens","review":"This is a wonderful book full of very useful ideas for teaching children and adults how to draw. Each step builds on another and my students are doing remarkably well. Would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reasource for teachers","review":"This is a very good book for teaching art to young adults, a great alternative to \\"Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain\\" which is a bit advanced for kids. The personal insights and experiences of the author are definitely a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Proven Drawing System","review":"The single lmost important idea this author imparts is that drawing can be learned by anyone willing to commit to a system of exercises that support observation and practice. Many examples show documented development and there is an openness to all forms of individual creative expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taken in","review":"I have read many detective, mystery, and police procedurals from classics to trash. This is in the middle of the spectrum. It's OK, mildly entertaining, contains no real procedural suspense. The subject is the death of a male model and focuses on the fashion world. The only detail concerns what everyone is wearing. Makes a point of being blase at a raft of gay characters. I bought it because of past success from St. Martin's press. They should have left this one for the trade/genre paperbacks. I would have liked it better [on a] ... sale table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Head over heels on this one","review":"The relationship between Paul and Ben was very undeveloped so not feelings during the last chapter of the book. Their was to many names to keep up with as to who was who.I liked the concept and some of the characters but they were not developed enough for me to feel for them.It is ok but I have read much better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, but tedious execution","review":"As usual, this Zubro mystery is well plotted. Also as usual, it is rather tediously written. It would seem the author was always instructed to give details, to carefully note the appearance of each character. What he comes up with is a detailed description of apparel for each character, from the top down: hair, shirt, trousers (or skirt), shoes. Colors, patterns, and fabrics are always noted. All very good, if or when these are noteworthy. But usually folks are wearing denim and cotton and etc., and giving these details imparts nothing to the reader.This is just a warning--I shall probably continue to read Zubro's books. But I only WISH he wrote a bit better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"REAL RATING IS -----*: THIS IS NOT BOB SEGER","review":"Amazon requires that when you rate a product that you enter atleast one star. The true rating is of this CD is minus (-) *****stars.Anyone who is looking for Bob Seger needs to look elsewhere! The CD is simply \\"The Bob Seger System\\" remixed to make it sound more up to date.It also lacks one other key element;BOB SEGER. If this is actually Seger on the CD, then someone does not how to produce an album because his voice is pushed to the background by the music and the \\"background vocals\\".The mix tells me that Seger's voice is not on the CD, rather a poor substitute."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bad album","review":"They overdubbed his incredible debut album with all sorts of guitars & other trash that shouldn't be there. If you are a true Bob Seger fan you should get this album right away so that you can be as enraged as I am. This sort of thing shouldn't happen. We should all write to Capitol Records & plead with them to re-release his debut album in it's entirety, unscathed. So that we as fans don't have to resort to buying this filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS DESERVES \\"0\\" STARS!! AVOID THIS CD!","review":"This CD has the Bob Seger System album \\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\\" with a lot of overdubs, which makes this CD sound horrible. Whoever was responsible for this should cease and desist with this CD. I have listened to this, and was left very disappointed. The overdubs nearly drown out Bob Seger's voice, and make this CD sound hideous. Anyone who is a true fan of Bob Seger will overlook this CD in favor of the original classic Capitol LP \\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE! THIS CD IS HORRIBLE!","review":"This CD is NOT by Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band. In reality, this is an album by the Bob Seger System, remixed and overdubbed. The result: A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! In fact, the sound quality of this CD is HIDEOUS! Bob's vocals are pushed so far into the background that you can barely hear them. My suggestion is to avoid this CD and search out the Bob Seger System's \\"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\\" album, which has all the same songs, albeit in better sound quality and as nature intended. I wish I could give \\"Train Man\\" 0 stars, because that's exactly what it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOOF this album is no good","review":"Overdubbed so much it hurts your ears. It would be better if fans was given the chance to get the original albums rereleased on cd, instead of this respectless crab. I wonder if Mr. Seger himself heard this. Do not buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Y'all said it: good but loooooong","review":"Kluger's research is impressively thorough, his writing is lucid, and his insights -- well, insightful. But his inability to leave any detail unexamined makes this more of a resource book than a narrative. Slogging through to the end, became a chore. I mean, there ARE a few other books I'd like to get to before I die . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhaustive and thorough history","review":"This is not a book for a quick casual read. Kluger offers a comprehensive, thoroughly researched, and exhaustive history of the cigarette industry in this country. I was fascinated to learn of the backgrounds of the major players, and the data leaves no question that they deliberately set out to addict customers with full knowledge of the consequences. You'll never look at a cigarette ad or display the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most thorough and best books on the tobacco ind.","review":"This book is a masterpiece by Dick Kluger. It covers every aspect of the tobacco industry. FromNewport to the Native-Americans. It was enjoyable, well written, informative and objective. Despite the current climate of anti-smoking, Kluger takes a neutral; he wasn't a shill for Philip Morris and he wasn't a shill form Willaim Novilli and the rest of the anti-tobacco crazys. After you read this book, you will know everything that there is to know about tobacco and cigarettes. He fulfils everything that was promised in the sub-title: Americas hundred year cigarette war - check. The Public Health- check. The unabashed trimph of Philip Morris double-check. I couldn't put this book down. You think that this book is only a few pages- despite it's 800 pages. It is fast reading. And it will be one of the best books you'll ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, but good","review":"I'm not a smoker (fortunately my parents totally discouraged me from it, and I had enough smarts to avoid it anyway) but I found this history of the cigarette industry to be quite interesting--especially the facts about the early years.It got a little dry towards the end, and the whole indictment of the industry has gotten a bit repetitious; I suspect at the time the book was published the message was new, but the message has gotten old fast. (Yes, it's clear that they knew about the health issues, and yes, they did very little about it.)Overall it's a good read, especially the first half. If you're at all curious about how the cigarette industry came to be, the book does a great job of describing the companies and personalities involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk","review":"All the punk bands from this era were great and enormously influential on everything we listen to now (including the pseudo-punk radio pop), but Crass was the only true punk band that mattered. P.S. If you have a mohawk in this day and age, you are trying too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Ideas, terribly executed","review":"Crass is a band i wish i could like, but i just can't. The band had some great political ideas, but their lack of ANY musical ability whatsoever ruins any possibility of a promising record. The only reason i give this record 2 stars is for some of their political philosophies, i.e. their disgust at government and the system. Despite this, crass can't play a note to save their lives, and listening to this is unbearable. Also, their negative attitude towards bringing about change(singing that they would never change the system) is rediculous, because thats what they were supposed to be fighting for! How can you accomplish something when you don't believe you will? A dissatisfaction with government is not enough to make me like Crass."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is horrible","review":"Any band who disrespects the clash clearly has no idea what they are talking about. You can say that crass was \\"more hardcore\\" than the clash, because they were really anarchists, but that just shows how stupid these people were. Anarchism does not work as a political or social structure. Believing in anarchism is just a sign of immature problems with authority. Maybe these guys parents never let them watch tv after 9 oclock or something. The Clash makes better music. They are better songwriters. They are intelligent enough to branch out and experience other styles of music other than what the mohawk-wearing \\"non-sellout\\" punks would call \\"real punk\\". Anyway, Crass is horrible, their lyrics are just angry tyrades against authority and those around them who are more successfull and skillfull (the Clash). Buy this record if you want people to think you are a real hardcore \\"punk\\". What a crock."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST AND FIRST","review":"This release (originally formatted on vinyl, thank you) was intended to only sell a maximum of 5000 copies, hence the title. Unspoken of in the music press, however is the fact that it was near 1,000,000 copies at last count a few years back. This first release by CRASS is my favorite by far. Two versions of the song \\"Do they owe us a living\\" are on this cd. If you like anything by crass, then you'll like this release.If you've never heard them before, then you are really missing out on some great British anrchist/peace punk.Simplistic form of music- not poppy skate punk and no emopunk lead guitar solos here- and biting hard comentaries on the state of affairs in late 70's/early 80's England. Alot of the ideas have been passed on to later punk bands on both sides of the atlantic lake. With out exception, Dead Kennedys, Circle Jerks, and Propagandhi (as well as many others) got a lot of their influence through these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crasstastic!","review":"This CD is great. The first song by Crass I ever heard wasn't on here, I thought it ok, but when I heard Do They Owe Us A Living? I started to listen more and more of this CD....I love it.Anything is a target here.As for the music's quality?INCREDIBLE.Steve Ignorant's delivery (although it annoys some) makes the lyrics shine, while the drumming and guitars give the album a really unique flavor.I personally consider this the Fresh Fruit of Rotting Vegetables for british punk rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of CRASS's finest","review":"This is a well album. However, it isn't as good as stations, but it does have some very good songs on it, such as: \\"do they owe us a living?\\", \\"punk is dead\\", \\"banned from the roxy\\" and \\"so what?\\" actually, just about all the songs are great, its just missing something that stations has."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you.","review":"If I had rated this album when I first heard it, I would probably have given it one or two stars, it sounded really bad. Fortunately, I gae ot a few more listens and now I love it. The music is so crap is wonderfull. The lyrics remain completely loyall to the punk/anarchist philosophy and crass really believed in their message, they used to give out anarchist propaganda at their gigs! If your looking for some hardcore, or music to rock out to, avoid this album. If, however, you are looking for lyrics with a political message and music so wonderfully crappy it sounds beautifull, you've come to the right place. Anyone into old school punk should get this album, it may not sound as good as the sex pistols or the clash or dead Ks or whatever, but it is definately a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't be hearing this on the radio","review":"Crass is a fantastic band with a strong message. One star off for being a bit \\"crap\\" when it comes to music, but thats not what crust punk is about. Its very creative and the distorted sampling on a few tracks to me as an industrial fan is really neat. They're crude and straight forward and thats what what I really like about them. Anyone who liked this should really check out Penis Envy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the prodigal son (daughter?)","review":"I was given a tape of this album back in 1990, which was already years after it was released on vinyl. I FELL IN LOVE with this album, but of course my freak mother called it satanic and I had to get rid of it. I had secretly taped it on another tape and that somehow later on as my musical taste shifted it was taped over...years later I was listening to this taped tape and heard about 25 seconds of \\"do they owe us a living\\" and remembered that I LOVED that song, but couldn't quite remember who it was by, thinking it might be crass I found a couple MP3s online and guess what I heard! My beloved song once again, now I've found it again after nearly 10 years and well I still love it and I'm so glad it's now on CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"unbeliveable!","review":"These guys are just absolutely amazing. Reminds me of Rudimentry peni with a cleaner sound, not much distortion on the guitars making for awesome base lines. Somehow the lack of distortion and crisp sound of the band make for a more spurratic chaotic sound. True punk."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEAN and LEAN","review":"When i first heard this album i just couldnt believe that it was true. The message Crass puts forth is very strong and very heartfelt. D.I.Y. to the extreme with infectious beats that stick in my mind. Crass was not about good musicianship. They werent about getting money and being famous. It was quite the opposite. They didnt even plan on being a band. They stole, begged and borrowed all of their equipment. They made their distortion by playing through unused A.M. stations and they really did live out the punk lifestyle. They strived for change and that was what punk was about. The liner notes are very good reading and they make me want to pump my fist and go out and change something. Enough yapping. Listen to the album and prepare to be astounded. CHEERS. anarchy and peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"heartbreaking, but not surprising","review":"As with all of chomsky's work (books, cd's, videos) everything you hear from him makes you so mad, but it's nothing that should surprise you.

This is indeed a wonderful spiritual memoir, and I cannot get enough of this genre when it's well done!But what I most enjoyed about this book, aside from its lucid and heartfelt writing, is the fact that the author was so honest about her ambivalence toward Catholicism. It was so palpable, right along with her deep yearning to belong. As a lapsed Catholic, she is drawn back to the faith yet she is a thinking seeker, and not totally in agreement with the rules set down by her old patriarchal church.Would she re-join the church or not? Were the Poor Clares the catalyst she needed to find the faith again? Or not? This conflict creates a marvelous spiritual tension throughout the book -- and that is what kept me reading until I finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in the family","review":"So many of us have questioned our faith at one time or another. I found the author's struggle for belief and longing for faith to be the most compelling part of this story. It's nearly universal. And that's why \\"Stalking the Divine\\" wound its way through my family. My sister read it before I had the chance to buy it for her and was raving about the story. I knew I had to read it because it was written by a local author and I like to support their work. My parents read it after my sister and I described the author's journey and that of the nuns. While visiting family in Columbus, my grandmother picked up the book and was curious about the story. I told her a bit about it and she said she would very much like to read it. So I loaned her my copy and two days later she called to tell me it was one of the best books she had read recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland with a capital B","review":"This recording made me not like Scriabin at first.

One gets the impression that her biggest regret at the end was not the fact that she caused Peter Pyle to lose his job, or did anything illegal, or nearly lost an expensive boat, but simply that she didn't see one of these bigger sharks.

Her story is interesting, and i was fascinated by a lot of the things I learned about white sharks. It's unfortunate that she didn't get to experience more first-hand encounters with them, and I hope that she writes again about white sharks.I also hope that she never, ever reads for her own audiobook again. She has a pathetically monotone voice, with a distinct lack of verve and character. You would think that someone speaking the words that they wrote would imbue them with emotion and feeling, making the listener feel privileged to hear the story from the source. Not in this case.

It gives information without the sometimes dictatorial attitude that books written by wildlife biologists can have. Ms. Casey is an average journalist with no specific biological training. She follows her subject with the passion that comes from truly wanting to be doing what she was.The author's insights on the Faranelle biologists, the islands themselves, the great whites and the intrusive 'real world' just 27 miles from the 'Devil's Teeth' are peppered with her own unique brand of humor.I thoroughly enjoyed this and recommend it without reservation.

You've got to be kidding. The book is full of details of little relevance. She manages to find space to recount her pull-up exploits, how stylish and cool the scientists are, and describes her time moored off the island as if she survived the \\"perfect Storm\\". I found myself hoping she'd slip into the water and get munched by one of the \\"Sisters\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who cares about the author","review":"Great idea for a book, but the focus gets lost, it is about the author more than the Farralons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Enjoyable Read","review":"In addition to vivid descriptions of the individuals in the two distinct groups of sharks which frequent the Farallones (one group males/the others females), there is an overall description of the birds, the boats, the people.

While she seems to enjoy breathlessly relating her fascination with the sharks, she fails completely as a science writer. Basic knowledge about shark behavior and conservation is inexplicably missing, much of it written up over the years by exactly the scientists she is supposedly profiling. The conflict between the cage divers and the scientists begs for a thoughtful analysis--it was the catalyst for the troubles at the Farallones, and the underlying issues have profound implications for how we treat endangered wildlife--yet Ms. Casey skims airly over it.

And all without seeming the least bit at fault!!

I persevered, but, by tape six, I was weary of the author's \\"sharky dreams\\", her ouija board and her whining about the conditions under which she was living. For example, in the first couple of chapters, she repeatedly outlines the harsh conditions of the waters surrouding the islands. In her zeal to return to the islands \\"under the radar,\\" she docks a boat in what will prove to be overwhelming conditions. What did she expect?The material was probably enough for a couple of good magazine articles. As a book, it could have used a good copy editor to whittle it down to a reasonably focused narative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this book hoping to learn more about white sharks at the Farallones, but the main point of the book seems to be how clueless the author is about field science and seamanship. If you are really interested in sharks, shark biology, and how scientists do field research on sharks, a much better book is Peter Klimley's \\"The Secret Life of Sharks.\\" Klimley did a lot of the original shark research Casey talks about, and unlike Casey really does know something about the subject.

The potential is here for an excellent book: sharks, remote islands, rampaging storms, fascinating history. Unfortunately this version showcases human folly (e.g. Ouija boards, Gucci underpants) more than natural history information/shark-related adventure. There is a disappointing lack of shark details in this book, and the writing is unsophisticated. Give me John Krakauer instead.That said, it's an occasionally-entertaining read that brings up interesting questions (totally unintentionally) about human actions. How can a person claim to love something, then ruin it for themselves and everyone else?

Her fascination and admiration of the creatures comes through, as does the passion behind her personal quest to spend time on the Farallones. However, by the end of the book, I was angry with Casey. Her blind passion put the entire Sharkwatch operation in jeopardy and resulted in the firing of one valuable researcher. I think that she succeeds in translating the majesty and awe of the white shark, but I think that the story comes off as a selfish city reporter who is no better than the tourists (whom she criticizes) who pay to cage dive with the sharks.

The shark parts were not that great and actually take a second seat to her stay on the island. She does illustrate that each shark in itself is a unique animal with personality.

Glad someone was able to get out there and pseudo-report on the importance of the research going on. Reads like a long article from an outdoor mag. Definitely an experiential book. Not a lot of hard numbers on anything of importance if you're interested in whites considering her hosts, but the Farallon history is right thorough.

I like learning about the Great White to, but I wouldn't begin to qualify MYSELF as an expert opinion on the subject, even if I did see one up-close (which I have not).

However, what a disappointment this one turned out to be. The background on the Farallones was interesting. But the sharks were minor players in what turned out to be a self-centered tale of a spoiled brat who wanted to get on the islands at any cost.

Like other disappointed reviewers I found the actual shark information lacking, although I did enjoy reading about all of the other wildlife on the islands.I really couldn't believe, however, that at the end Casey takes such flaccid \\"responsibility\\" for the demise of the shark project and the ruination of Pyle's career. I suppose her self-absorption and determination to put her own wants first are what permitted her to have such unprecedented access to a place few are allowed to visit in the first place, so it should be unsurprising that she will accept the accolades and gloss over the damage done by her \\"work\\" there.

As a surfer in Northern California, I'm fascintated in the topic and thought this would make a readable natural history and well researched book. While the book is very readable, it falls short of being the informative book on sharks and the islands. She is a compelling and good writer and manages to make most of the book about the difficulties she encounters in trying to write the book. The best compliment that I can give her is that she still manages to make this very readable. In actuality she spends almost no time during her limited stint on the islands, with sharks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting tale about the ocean, sharks, and some drama","review":"I quite enjoyed this book.

And whereas the book's notion of sexual union involves tapping into the \\"oneness\\" of the universe, the Bible does not at all.For a Christian take on sex, see Sexual Character: Beyond Technique to Intimacy, by Marva Dawn, available on Amazon.com.

To my bias, the horn playing on 7 & 8 are other-worldly; the principal horn playing is second to none.(It may be Barry Tuckwell, who was with the LSO between 1955-68).I think my favorite thing about these recordings are the proper amount of weights between slow, winding down melodies in the woodwinds to the blast of the full orchestra back at a sprite tempo.

Also, the writing style is fine, but not great.I would say that if you could acquire this book used for a couple dollars or less, it might be worth acquiring if you want something to loan out to concerned friends/family. But, if you are willing to spend more than that, I would check outThe Well-Adjusted Child: The Social Benefits of Homeschooling, which I rate as 5 stars.

It may be kind of fun to play it the first time through, but i would never want to replay the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"Although I expected a lot more from this game, I would have to say that the current features are satisfactory for a GBA game. You don't really get to interact or experience that you are in a \\"wizarding world\\" as much as the PS2 version, but it should keep you pretty busy for a while. One reason is the limited technology on GBA that the publisher can't make the game as detailed or as long as the PS2 or Game Cube version. However, this should satisfy a lot of people, especially for kids 12 and under and Harry Potter fans. I would have to say that the graphics are excellent. Much better than the Game Boy Color one. The game is not really difficult, but there are still some levels that will challenge your skills, such as your first flying lesson (which took me a while) and the jelly bean challenges. Overall, it's a pretty good Harry Potter game for GBA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I've had a little issues staring the game, but if you hold down the START button and turn it on it starts up just fine.

Prior to this I had one semester of Arabic in college, many years ago, and had worked my way up to half a dozen hard chapters of a \\"Teach Yourself Arabic\\" book.Pimsleur is awesome as a supplement to this. I could make very basic sentences in standard Arabic, but it was stilted and formal. As it is, this course is giving me an excellent intro to casually speaking in the actual rhythms of spoken Egyptian Arabic. I'm having a lot of 'a-ha!' moments. It's great for confidence boosting, and I have a sense that my base is much stronger, and that I will be able to speak that much more quickly when I actually land in Cairo.I'd give it five stars if you use it with a text book, three if you use it as your sole introduction to Arabic.

If you like the sounds of that, go right ahead and buy it, you'll lap it up - but make no mistake, this is not popular science.By looking at the microwave spectrum of the sky, COBE revealed that the galaxies present today were merely inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter 300,000 years after the big bang. He takes 300 pages to convey what I've said in one sentence. The book should have been made half as long, then it would have been twice as interesting.At every stage throughout reading the book, I wondered when Smoot was just going to get on with it, but no the whole damn book is an autobiography written in first person.

He asks his friend to cast down his rituals and rites and instructs him to find the Lord in quiet and somber prayer and service.The author writes to his friend the only hope and cause for joy; that is, a life of full and true committment to the Lord Jesus Christ. He doesn't look for wealth, nor does he strive for great fame. He contents himself as a potato peeler, seeking only to please the Lord with a meek life of service and worship.Christians and non-Christians alike should read the compilation of this man's work.

I am puzzled as to why this disc includes \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" and \\"10-Inch Record\\", as neither song is doo-wop. That being said, they are both jump-blues classics (and are the orginal versions of songs that would be familiar to Aerosmith fans, since that band covered both of them in the 70's). Also interesting are the King tracks by The Platters, quite different from the dreamy neo-operatic sound that became their trademark with their Mercury hits. One more puzzlement: why is \\"Can't Do 60 No More\\" (a sequel to \\"Sixty Minute Man\\") the lead off song on this disc, with it's predecessor featured later on in the program.

Among other things, it omits any mention of error logging and tracing (i.e., writing out error info to a log file, and tracing the error stack).

When a famine strikes an ancient and culturally stagnant society, changes must be made to avoid starvation. Two sisters follow two roads to change; Shadarii preaches love, while Zhukora champions violent revolution.

Try it, you'll love it !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A glorious, majestic world","review":"This story struck to my heart. Once I got into the story, I was just swept away. The heroine is so passionate, so loving, and the forces at play so frighteningly powerful, that you are on a rollercoaster of amazement. A lot of other reviewers here have actually talked about the plot, but I don't want to ruin it for anyone. I think that if you like Fantasy, and you are the kind of person that can get gripped and held by a story, this is one that you will never forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mother's Tongue","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the lyrical and gorgeous poems. All are sweet and meaningful, and beautifully, thoughtfully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I am posting the first review for this CD -- I am very surprised that more people were not inspired to comment on it, and hope that I can direct some attention to this masterwork. Solti, best known as a conductor, was an equally great pianist, and won the Geneva Competition in 1942. His piano recordings are rare, but worth seeking out. On his disk, Solti is joined by Daniel Barenboim and Andras Schiff, who need no further introduction as interpreters of Mozart. The result is remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Class Electric Shoe Polisher","review":"This is the best shoe polisher for its price. I know some people don't like how the buffer stops under high torque, but you just have to learn how to be more delicate. But the thing does a good job. This is the second one of these I bought. One is at home, the other at work, which I use for touch-ups, plus it is a nice thing to have around for visitors. I really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I am returning my unit. The brushes are too soft and the motor is too weak to actually do anything but take the dust off your shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyday use!!!","review":"This shoe polisher lasted less than three months and it was only used by my husband for a quick buff to shine up his shoes before leaving for the office. The brush broke off and we couldn't find any replacement parts anywhere. So we just bought another thinking that we'd at least have spare parts if anything broke again. Well, the same side brush broke as did the one on the other side. The problem is that the brush should be on a metal axle rod and not plastic. This whole thing is made of cheap plastic with the exception of the tall handle! Definitely NOT worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoe polisher review","review":"Works well, could be a little easier to attach polishing pads, it took an inordinate amount of time to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cobra GPS not worth the price","review":"I purchased the Cobra GPS for my husband, and it won't even show the location of our new house. The elevation is different everytime we try to use it. It is difficult to use and doesn't tell you how to get somewhere. Use the money for a down payment on a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"very nice pump","review":"This is a very nice pump. Having the thermostat, timer and check valve all in one package really simplifies the installation. It's very quiet, consumes little power and does the job of bringing hot water to you instantly. One word of caution: this model requires additional items (brass union fittings) that must be purchased separately and are not cheap. A simpler solution is to buy the NPT or sweat model instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute movie","review":"At first I was a little hesitant about seeing another movie about young gays. It seems there is so much focus on youth and beauty. But since this is a coming out story, it works. The lead seems completely believable and charming despite a couple of unkind actions he makes as he lashes out in pain and confusion. The gay rowing team is fun to watch, and it is nice to see that the coach of the protagonist's team is not homophobic when he meets the gay team. Despite the pain of the main character, there is a lot of humor, and while this film may not be a classic, it is one I can see more than once. It is basically a feel-good film and was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need another novel Mister Mann!!!!!!!!!","review":"I picked up Blinking Red Light from the Library and I loved it I learned that he had Wifebeater in stores and I immediatley went out and bought it I read it and loved it as much as Blinking Red light after that I vowed that I would buy every single Book that he put out.Wifebeater takes you on a wild ride and you think your going in one direction but you get pulled into another one.I strongly suggest that you pick this book up if you want to go on a adventure through the streets of Philly!I can't wait to get my hands on your next masterpiece!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Mister Mann Frisby","review":"I love the way this author writes. I read both of his booksand can't wait for more. I was engrossed from the first pagetil the last one. The mystery of not knowing the main characters name was hot!

Very suspenseful, I love this author's style of writing. You can't judge a book by its cover. Both of Mister's books have horrible covers that don't give you any idea what the book is about or how good they really are.

Maybe because I'm not from South Philly but some of the jargon kind of threw me, like what is a \\"boaw\\" or a \\"jawn\\"? And the story seemed a little unbelievable to me, I mean here you have this guy who has no visible means of income caring for his daughter and he thinks that can't nobody in the world care for her like he can but he doesn't want to go out and get and keep a job to always provide for her. He's blackmailing the biggest rapper in the game, he's beating up football players and he's really a nobody and in the end the rapper is going to let him keep some money? It was a little unrealistic to me, but that's just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was one of the worst books ever written","review":"If you are thinking of getting this book, I would suggest that you do not waist your time. Pick up Blinking Red Light instead. This book defied all logic and made absolutely no sense. I am sure anyone who wrote something good about this book is a friend of the author but this book was the worst.Not to give anything away, the premise of the book was someone saw a video tape and tried to blackmail the original owner of the tape in order to give him back the tape. The original owner wants the tape back and does what he has to do to get it back.The first thing a sane person would think is, all you have to do is make copies of the tape and you could blackmail him forever...so why all the drama to get a tape back, JUST HORRIBLE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not keep my attention","review":"I don't know what was up with this book...

This book was horrible. Maps were wrong. Prices, hours and addresses were way off. The section on the Torres Del Paine is absolutely worthless. I doubt their guide writer even went there.

I find it to be well made and the plastic on my product is thick and does not seem like something that would chip easily as another reviewer had commented on previously.I roll out my cookie dough and use the cutter to cut the cookies as opposed to baking all the dough and then cutting it out as the instructions recommend. Less waste that way.One trick to help someone using this is to be sure when you begin making the sandwiches to only lightly press the white piece into the mold, otherwise it's a bit difficult to remove it when you've finished assembling the sandwich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"The plastic cutter was chipped at the corner when it was delivered. But luckily - with amazon's great customer service, i was immediately refunded fully for this damaged item! But I can see tht this item is of poor quality - the plastic cutter is thin n can be easily chipped n the chipped part is rather sharp n can be dangerous to young children using it! Much better to buy the Tovolo ice cream sandwich makers - different type of plastic, thicker n durable, will not chip easily n I think the fun shapes will appeal to kids n young- at heart- adults as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Save Your money","review":"Product is cheap, bag was all smashed and ripped.

I had to call the order in since it was going to Alaska and their customer service was great. Very friend, actually left me with a smile on my face when I got off the phone. The basket arrived sooner then expected! (Which is worth an extra star to me.) It was beautifully done and I totally recommend their service if you are trying to buy for someone who already has everything. Everything came as discribed.

I can't think of a single redeeming quality of this abysmal performance. The orchestral direction is stumbling, awkward and drags (oh, please, dear god, let it be over).

It is a horror-comedy of a higher standard. The movie varies from hilarious to grotesque. The comedy in this movie is derived from the killer being way over the top. Most you see coming, but some catches you off guard. The plot is very rarely on track, and this movie is VERY confusing. However, it gets 4 stars, because the death scenes in this are BRILLIANT on the budget the movie had.Cheeky comedy, mixed with horrific violence.Overall, a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"what gives here","review":"There is nothing funny about a movie that was as horrible as this one,,,instead of being a horror movie,,,it was more of a tragedy,,,tragic that it was produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Slightly Amusing\\" Man...","review":"After a solid opening scene, followed by a promising set-up, \\"Funny Man\\" loses all it's steam with a series of unimaginative murders, surreal settings, and only moderately amusing jokes from the titular character at the expense of his victims. This British answer to Freddy Kruger lacks any suspense, irony, or wit as it seems to be an excuse for whacking a buch of mostly undesireable characters. The ending is somewhat flat, and at this point I felt no vested interest in neither victim nor killer. Not even my appreciation of English humour could really keep my interest. As a huge fan of the macabre, this one really dissapointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculously Twisted Fun !","review":"Simon Sprackling's \\"FUNNY MAN\\" is a horror/comedy like no other! If you took the movie \\"Leprechaun\\" mashed it together with the comedy style of \\"The Kids In The Hall\\" add a few buckets of chunky red stuff & then took some lysergic acid diethylamide the outcome would be something like this demented nightmare.

(Always played it with my best friend, so never played it alone) Having such enemies as the crazed dentist, the chicken patrol, and that pesky ice cream truck forever burned in my mind is not a problem. It's more of a privelage. From roller scates to Icuris wings, from throwing tomatoes to having them rain down upon you, the game was a gem. Now number 3 is coming out? on X box? Hmmmm.... All i can say is, it is a good time to be alive. (Because it looks like it keeps the formula of the first Toe Jam and Earl) It might not be the number one game on X box, or might not even be a hit, but for me it is the game of the decade. RENT IT, BUY IT, BORROW IT, JUST PLAY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And a great series comes to a sad end","review":"What happened! ToeJam and Earl was an awesome series then this POS came out and totally shot the series to death with cheesey looking characters. The new female character is a stupid joke, a true Toejam and Earl fan would wanna play Lewanda or maybe Sharla instead, or heck even Peabo would be awesome. This game should be banned from the Xbox library it is seriously that bad!

Its a bad game that really taints an excellent and unique video game series and also a good system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum.","review":"The idea of this game is to go around and collect funk records. Yup, that's about it. The game is simplistic and, although it does have some nice graphical effects, it is, overall, rather bland (and the funky music gets old rather fast). With that said, the game should keep the younger crowd occupied for a while, though. Although I would rate the game on the lower end of a Teen rating (i.e., closer to an E), I fail to understand why Sega would create a game obviously intended for the 10 and under crowd, and then put elements in it that give it a Teen rating. In this case, it is the standard \\"comic mischief\\" and some wiggling."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best tj&e ever hands down","review":"This game is definately one for the fans.

This is a game for TJ&E Classic hardcore fans. If you didnt play the original, forget this one, you cant appreciate it the way the oldskool fans do. Its all about seeing things you used to love (like the hula dancers) and remembering what it was like back in the day. Reminds you of great things, like getting a rank-up to a poindexter, or using a game genie, and putting on the invincibility code, and on level 1, swim to the bottom left of the screen and fall down a secret hole to level 0, where you can get lemonade or sit in the hot tub with hawiian girls.

I removed all the patio caps and poured a trail of SM pellets inside each cement block and above ground next to my rhubarb.

Ironing at the maximum setting with the iron real hot and using bottle water produced continuous and incredibly annoying dripping. The dripping still occurred with the steam off. Running the iron through the cleaning cycle didn't help either. The cleaning mechanism is pretty awkward as well, you have to hold a little lever for 1 minute in order to activate the cleaning cycle. If it wasn't for the dripping, it gets hot enough, glides nicely, and I could live being a little inconvenienced while cleaning it. I was expecting better quality from Rowenta, especially after all the positive reports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this iron, only one fault","review":"This iron glides so smoothly more than any iron I've ever used. I do a lot of quilting and it works beautifully. The only fault I see is the cord placement, where it goes into the iron. It's smack in the spot when you go to set the iron upright on the ironing board. I looked at my old iron and this cord, is placed off to the right or left side. The Rowenta is in the middle and I hit that everytime I place the iron in upright or rest position. It takes a fair amount of water but that's not a problem for me. Would have given it a 5 star if not for the cord in my way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I finally broke down and decided to buy me a Rowenta Iron after using my sisters and loving it.

Lots of good things to say about the Rowenta in use.Except one thing: for my use (2-3 times a week), a Rowenta iron just doesn't last. Three $60-ish irons in five years? You get NO inclination that it's going on the fritz, except, one time, you'll need to iron something, you'll plug it in, and it won't heat up.I treat my irons with great respect, as these babies cost double what a cheapie iron costs. But today was the last straw. No more Rowenta irons for me. I'm going with a cheapie with a great rating. Looks like a Panasonic for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it","review":"We are returning our second one in a week. Right out of the box,the first one didn't hold water, whatever you poured in at the top, ran right back out. OK, obvious manufacturing defect, very annoying but it can happen. The 2nd one didn't leak after pouring the water and for good measure we let it sit for 24h. However, we just finished ironing with it for the first time and it drips constantly over the clothes.That will be the end of our Rowenta experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst iron I have ever had!","review":"This is the second Rowenta iron that has disappointed me. Within a year I bought two and both don't steam properly. I fill the iron with water, plug it in and the light goes one. It heats for a while and then turns off suddenly and leaks on my garment.

The self-clean mechanism doesn't seem like it does much. The iron continuously collects grime on its soleplate even though I don't really use it often or on too hot of a setting or with starch, etc.Luckily I think Bed, Bath & Beyond has a good return policy...so I think I might just try my hand at returning it tonight ordering a highly-reviewed one off of Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"You'll see similar comments in these reviews.

This means that my white shirts end up with water stains, which means that they have to be washed again. And this is from brand new irons! I can't imagine how well this iron will work after a couple of years.From reading the reviews of this iron, it seems that the quality is something of a crapshoot -- some of them have been exceedingly well built, making their owners very happy, while others are not built as well.

Second, it automatically turns off right before you will use it again if you are doing a sewing project... pain in the butt! I found it to be unstable on my ironing board... fell off a number of times, partly because of the base of the cord and possibly my board's problem. It just fell off the board for the LAST TIME!

I'm trying another one this time around. I will never spend that kind of money again for an iron (Consumer Reports has rated a $20 black and decker as high as the Rowentas, and I'm a lot happier about losing $20 if the B&D; doesn't work as promised)!I am a sewer--I sew a LOT. The Rowentas, until the water starts leaking, is great as far as pressing stuff and steaming out wrinkles, don't get me wrong.

The new one immediately leaked, so I returned it for a replacement. I've had the replacement model for about 4 months. This one continually turns the steam off. I have to manually turn the steam switch on several times while ironing. It's now developed a nasty habit of engaging the auto-off feature while I'm ironing.This is the last Rowenta iron that I'll buy.

A previous DX1700 I owned lasted about 6 years with heavy usage. The replacement I have now is garbage. The first replacement DX1700 I brought home made strange noises from day one and fizzled out within a week. The second replacement has spit when the vents are wide open from day one and I only chose to keep it because of the hassle of another return. After two years, the burst of steam button is now sticking from constant use because of the other problem. When I noticed that these irons were made in China, not Germany as was the case in the past, I contacted Rowenta to let them know that their quality was suffering. I was told that the facilities they use in China match the quality of those made in Germany. If that's the case, why are the models made in Germany approximately 100% more expensive than the DX1700?

As for Amazon, they want me to deal with Rowenta. They wash their hands.

When I saw Made in China on the bottom, I started to wonder if this was the Germans trying to be funny. Gonna try the next model up to see if there's something to be gained.

This goes on for a while and then I find myself shaking the heck out of the iron trying to get it to turn back on. At this point water from the iron has leaked all over the shirt I am trying to iron.

Now all of a sudden the Auto-off comes on every Minute after plugging it in and I learn from other reviews, that that's a common problem. How annoying! Of course there's no warranty on the iron anymore. I would have lived with the missing lid for the opening to fill in water and I would have lived with the unconvenient cord, but the price was definitely too high for something that stops working after such short time.

When notified of my problem, the company sent a boilerplate letter, and did NOT send a replacement iron. I would NEVER buy a Rowenta product again. I replaced this iron with a Black & Decker iron, which I am very happy with. Thus, my advice to anyone planning to purchase a Rowenta product is - Do NOT purchase Rowenta products, but buy a comparable iron made by a different manufacturer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give a LOWER score I would","review":"I've had this iron for about a year. Before that I had a cheap old iron for about 15 yrs. Today I am throwing it in the trash. It has been a PIECE OF JUNK from the beginning -what a waste of $50!! It LEAKS, all the plastic dials kept popping off and I had to DUCT TAPE the whole thing to keep it together after a month. Everyone who saw it laughed and told me to get a new iron but this WAS my new iron! If I hadn't spent so much $$ on it I would have tossed it in the trash and bought a new one a while back. It would constantly shut off WHILE YOU ARE USING it, making ironing even MORE annoying and finally just won't heat up at all. I strongly recommend getting either the cheapest one you can find or splurging on a STAINLESS STEEL iron. NEVER EVER get anything with ANY plastic on it at all. This should have been a $10 iron. Now that I learned my lesson the hard way, I've invested in a commercial grade stainless steel iron, and it's NOT a Rowenta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This is the worst iron I have ever owned. I read the reviews on here but was disappointed. From the get go the only way i could get good results was to have the temperature on Linen and the steam on. There was absolutely no temperature control. I called Rowenta customer service and was told that I would have to send it to them at my own expense (plus pay for shipping back). Now the iron has packed in completely, it won't stay on for more than a minute at a time, and only if I wiggle the cord.Perhaps I just had a bad apple of an iron but I will never buy an iron over the internet again that I can't return to a store if I'm not happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a year","review":"I loved this iron until it stopped working after minimal use for 1 year. That being said, I'm giving Rowenta one more try with their German made pro version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"After less than a year it's died. This thing was incredibly thirsty, but I put up with it because it did a decent job. For some reason the steam only seemed to work when the iron was vertical rather than horizontal, so I'd iron a piece of sheet and then stand the iron up and a massive jet of steam would puff out into the air.... useless.Over the last 3 months it has started to leak from the handle down onto my hand no matter how full it was. Useless.Then today it started making a random clicking/sparking noise and the light has been flickering on and off. My last iron exploded in sparks and smoke so I'm not taking any chances with this one, it's going in the trash and I'll have to waste yet MORE money on another iron. In 12 years I've had about 8 irons. I do a lot of ironing (I find it enjoyable and clothes just look better when ironed) but really I expect items to last longer than this. Useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Shut-Off is Turn-Off","review":"I was really hoping for a much better iron, but was greatly disappointed. As with many of the reviewers here, this iron leaks incessantly, leaving stains on my shirts. But the most annoying aspect is that the iron suddenly turns off right in the middle of ironing. You have to go unplug it, then plug it back in. Super annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST IRON EVER OWNED","review":"This review is from my wife.I should have listened to review of one of the people who purchased this iron before I did. The person said they were disappointed because the all this iron did was leak. All I've ever owned were Rowenta irons so I figured this person got a defective porduct. WRONG!!! I ordered it anyway and my steam iron turned out to be a \\"GET DRENCHED AS YOU GO\\" iron. I cannot iron anything without this iron leaking all over everyting I iron. I never leave reviews because I am always satisfied (my bad) however people PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS IRON. YOU WILL REGRET IT.My Mom's Proctor Silex is so better than this one. Unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this iron","review":"I have had the Rowenta DX1700 Effective iron for just over two years. This iron was amazing for the first year, heats up quickly, gets wrinkles out effortlessly, the steam feature worked great and it works with tap water. About a year later it started leaking and shortly after that it would turn off and cool down while the iron was in use. I take really good care of my things even so this iron quit working and started leaking after only a year of careful use. DON'T buy this iron! There's a good iron out there its just not the Rowenta DX1700 iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"This iron includes a \\"3 Way Auto-Off\\" feature. It is documented as:\\"- If the iron is not moved while it is plugged in, an internal safety switch will turn it off.- It will turn off in 8 minutes if left vertically or in 30 seconds if left on its soleplate or tipped over. A red flashing light indicates that the auto-off has been activated.- To switch the iron on again, move the iron or gently shake it.\\"In my case the the auto-off activates 30 seconds after being plugged in and there is no way to deactivate it. Therefore, it is not possible to keep the iron heated and it is not functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and ineffective Iron","review":"This iron worked great for the first 6 months...then it went downhill from there. The first problem was that the plastic dial for the steam kept sliding down to no steam once the iron got hot. There was nothing that could keep the dial on steam unless you actually taped it there. I figured I could get past that...it was just a cheaply made dial.The second problem started occuring shortly after that. The auto shut off is definitely working! Even when the iron is upright. At first, I could just shake it to get it to turn back on. Now, I can't do anything to get it to turn back on. So I no longer have an iron that can stay hot or iron any of my clothes. Looks like I'll be buying a good old black and decker in the future to replace this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last","review":"I bought this iron in June 2009. It quit on me this weekend. This winter the auto shut off was failing. I constantly had to unplug and replug the iron in the last few days so that it would reset itself. It is not suppose to leak but it does. The sole plate needs to be cleaned often when you use the high cotton setting and iron dark fabrics. For a Rowenta I expected it to last longer than it did - I didn't even get 2 years out of it. I do not recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"leaking iron","review":"The rowenta Iron model 1700 w Has leaked a little since the day it was new, should have returned it then, my mistake. a little more then a year later water is pouring out the bottom.

Until you put up good faith money they will not even acknowledge you. This Company is lacking in integrity!I will never buy or say anything positive about ROWENTA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enrages me every day....total crap...Leaks like a sieve","review":"Do not buy this over-priced piece of junk. I spent somewhere around $70 for this item at Best Buy, thinking that Rowenta is the \\"Cadillac of irons\\". Not quite a year after purchase, the iron started leaking from the blue plastic housing below the grip. So basically as you get 1/4 way through ironing a shirt or pants, it drips water onto the garment and you have to run the iron over the spot to dry it out. The iron continually does this, in effect doubling your ironing time. It's clearly a manufacturing issue. I owned a cheap Black and Decker iron for years before buying this, and I never had any similar problems. Rowenta really failed to live up to the respect their brand holds. I won't be spending another $70 on anything from Rowenta...total piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Fragile","review":"This binder did not survive a single week of regular use. I do place above-average load on my binders, but I certainly expect them to last more than a week. The bottom locking ring no longer aligns and the close switch will not stay in the locked position.I would not recommend this binder for anything but the lightest of archival duties. Under no circumstances should it be utilized in an environment where it will encounter physical stress.I purchased the 6\\" variant of this binder."},{"rating":"2","title":"310 series","review":"I picked this up because it looked good for one and another because it's written by Beth Killian (aka Beth Kendrick).

DO NOT BUY","review":"I bought this expensive recording hoping to find something slightly better than the much cheaper Shaw recording I had bought a week previously. I could not possibly have ever spent $30 so poorly. Intonation is ghastly (both in the choir and the entire recording tends to be flat), tempos deadeningly slow, nuancing entirely missing or mis-interpreted. My college concert choir recording of this piece sounds 100 times better. A pitiful rendering of a beautiful piece of music. Sorry, but the other reviewers have absolutely no clue."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tougher gummy","review":"These letters are a nice simple gummy. They are very flavorful, and come in a variety of fruit flavors like lemon and fruit punch.Despite what the product description says they are not very soft. In fact, I would characterize their consistency as pretty tough, and requires that the consumer do some jaw exercises. Personally I like a little chewing, but this may not please all. The toughness also lets the gummies hold their alphabet shape well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gummi Alphabets","review":"Haribo Gummi Alphabets were a hit at my twins party, they are great tasting too.

A great treat or snack or any child especially those that are learning their ABC's or learning to spell, there are just a few things to keep in mind when purchasing this product, especially if you are ordering for a young child.Since they are Haribo they will have the extra stiffness, most people have come to love about this particular gummy company, but for any small child this could pose a choking hazard if they don't chew it completely.These Letters are Big, nearly twice as big as normal gummy bear.Other than that this would/could be a great learning tool or just a great snack.Enjoy: p"},{"rating":"1","title":"large abc gummi","review":"I was disappointed with the items purchased.

The flavours are very mild but definitely distinguishable. Soft, chewy, stretchy, absolutely perfect texture and bite. If you like your gummies this way then get Haribo!

He has a CD that I absolutely love called \\"Experience Yoga Nidra\\" (see my other Amazon review). I was disappointed when I tried this CD, which I realize now is Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati. He talks in a monatone, no music or sounds and alot of silence and pauses. At some of the moments I thought something was wrong with my CD player ;o) This CD was boring for me and became rather irritating even when I put it away and tried it again later.I guess my expectations were quite high after experiencing \\"Experience Yoga Nidra\\" with Swami Janakananda Saraswati. If you're looking for a really good Yoga Nidra CD, I would recommend his instead. I like his soothing voice, and lovely music and nature sounds. I use it time and time again and it is well worth the money.See my other reviews on meditation and yoga CD's and DVD's on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"yoga nidra","review":"i think this is a good honest relaxation tape,it takes a long time from start to finish and if you are feeling a bit sleepy anyway its easy to nod off!

Sometimes I can't fall asleep at night because my mind is whirling, so I like to listen to the radio or CDs that keep my mind just distracted enough so I can relax and go to sleep. Though I find Mr. Bharati's voice and intonation a little rapid and stiff compared to the narrators of other relaxation CDs that I own, he is still able to take me to that state where I can quietly and smoothly make the transition from frantic mind-dancing into restful sleep. I would buy it again, but I wouldn't make it my only relaxation CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of yoga nidra","review":"There are other yoga nidra CDs out there, but this one is by far the most authentic. It is derived from a genuine yoga tradition. It involves focus on parts of the body, breathing techniques and then proceeding through certain chakras to abide in the yoga nidra state. It does not have all the distracting frills, music, annoying sounds and confusing images of other yoga nidra practice CDs I have heard. If you have any desire to sincerely practice yoga nidra, this is clearly the best tape available. I give it the highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for guided relaxation","review":"As some other reviewers have complained, the voice rather drones, but that isn't the worst thing in the world: who needs an excited guide when looking to relax?

The product is very small and fragile. The plastic is no more than a couple millimeters thick and I managed to break the battery compartment within about 2 minutes of opening the package. The overall idea is a good one, however, the product needs to be built better. The whole unit is so extremely fragile, which is not a good thing considering you have to apply pressure against your tongue while using the product. I will say that it does what it is supposed to, but there are too many cons to give it a good rating. G.U.M brand makes a nice manual tongue cleaner that you can pick up at any local drug store for $2-$3. You will likely get the same results. My opinion is not to purchase this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best!","review":"I can't imagine why anyone would write a bad review of this item! I have used it for years - at least 10 - and woulnd't switch for anything! This item is especially good if you have a strong gag reflex - with a little practice it won't bother you at all. And it cleans wonderfully, allowing you to clean way back without gagging. And the head isn't sharp! I do recommend that you wipe it dry after each use before returning it to the stand. I'm not very good at this and have had to replace it a couple of times because water leaked down and got under the battery cap, but that was entirely my own fault. From time to time I soak it in mouth wash to clean it. Otherwise, this is a terrific product which cleans much better than some scrubby thing! I tried many different kinds before finding this one.

It's very easy to switch from/to any stroller (less than 1 minute). When we visited relatives in Canada at Xmas, I installed the bundleMe on the infant car seat and it kept her warm during our trek from the airport to the parking spot. In San Diego one fall day, when she went down a slide at the park that was still wet, she ended up wearing only a diaper but the BundleMe kept her warm as we walked back home. Never had to worry about losing a blanket on the road, or having enough blankets to keep baby warm, or whether her feet were sticking out of the blankets, lost a shoe/sock, etc. I am now using the same bundle me with my second child.

It can fit on the neck and upper back and on your instep quite comfortably. The heating element heats up quickly and the great range of speed of the massager is an added plus. The only little disappointmoint is that the heating element on the head of the massager is separated from the massaging part of the head which is made of a gel-like material. You can use the metal heating part for the massage, but it is not made of the soft gel material and it is not as flexible on the neck or feet.

The soloist, Konstantin Scherbakov, is superb but the Russian State Symphony Orchestra is simply not up to the task. This performance was released by Naxos in a 2 channel and a DVD-A mix, where Surround Records got a 7.1 mix out of the original masters is, well, a stretch.

Aside from solving the Chamber of Secrets puzzle, you can involve yourself in collecting famous wizard and witches cards, look for other hidden passages and ride around the castle rooftops on your broom. The difficulty is about a \\"medium\\"; easy enough to solve and win over but challenging and inventive enough to keep from getting bored. One complaint: maneuvering Harry to stand exactly where you want him to (required in a handful of critical moments during the game) is a nuisance.Highly recommended for hopeless HP fanatics (like myself) and lovers of RPGing (ditto)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, But Short","review":"I tried this game and it was fun, including the part with the Basilsk.

Prof. Lockhart looks like someone hit him with a can opener. Doby looks like a rat. Colin Creevey is tiny, and Ginny Weasley looks like a pig. Harry FINNALY TALKS. Moaning Myrtle and Peeves are annoying. Myrtle chucks toilet pipes at you for some odd reason. Peeves also steals Rons present to Nick.

For whatever the reasons, a Bush presidency seems to bring out the best in them as these last two albums have an intensity and focus that were lacking on most of the albums that followed _Psalm 69_ like _Dark Side of the Spoon_, and _Animositisomina_ (or however that last one is spelled). As someone who is 41 and has been listening to Ministry for almost 20 years, I can't wait to see them this Sunday night at the Ridglea Theater in Fort Worth, Texas, as they kick off this tour! Do I dare tempt the fate and destiny of the free world by hoping for a Jeb Bush presidency just to see if Ministry can keep it up?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohh, happy day!!!","review":"Rio Grande Blood-my new favorite Ministry album. This is Ministry's most brutal release yet. I think they are one of the most creative bands out there. This is a \\"must have\\" album for all Ministry fans. Every track on this disc is killer, especially Senor Peligro, and Gangreen (gang of green:marine corps). Houses Of The Mole shows us that Al doesn't like Gov. Bush all that much but Rio Grande Blood takes it up several notches to explosive, seething hatred for George W. and the rest of his crooked cronies. It's an all out assault of ferocious contempt and I love it. BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ministry keeps the faith","review":"Wow this is another Ministry album I love. I got the \\"Bush trilogy\\" in reverse order, beginning with The Last Sucker. That entire CD is great, so I worked my way backward (after a long personal hiatus from Ministry since 1992's Psalm). Well, Rio Grande Blood is right in the same vein as Last Sucker - trashy, bashy, and freaking speed-heavy. Excellent stuff. While the political lyrics might wear thin for some, I actually like having this kind of music with something other than \\"Satanic\\" lyrics for a change. It's kind of difficult to find music this intense with lyrics outside of the \\"evil\\" realm, and Ministry fits that bill nicely for me. Al delivers the goods and then some on Rio Grande Blood."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Milk's Gone Bad","review":"Ministry lost something profound with the departure of P. Barker. Something is missing from everything Jourgenson's put out since. He's been trying for this head-bang-a-thon and the results have been dull and sour. With FILTH PIG and DARK SIDE OF... they seemed to be evolving into something strange and very unique. Their last few recordings have been so juvenile compared to their previous efforts. This album is mostly 16th notes layered with noisy down-strumming and over-the-top sampling. I found it to be tired, boring and very un-original. Take the most annoying parts of PSALM 69 and THE MIND... and repeat them over and over. What happened to the Ministry that cranked out the bone chilling \\"Game Show\\" and \\"Nursing Home?\\" I've listened to Ministry for years, and this album is an absolute waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Al Jorgensen needs new material","review":"Seriously, his political theme has really become cliche.

Ministry has been political and on the left for many years. Why are some people suprised? And on top of that, why are they fans to begin with? I am a leftist and I do not listen to any band or individual artist who supports the right wing or considers themselves right wing. So why then are there right wingers or right wing supporters even listening to bands like Ministry or acting surprised by the politics of the band? Go and listen to your Ted Nugent, Three Doors Down and Toby Keith albums instead. If you want to support the right (the rich and powerful elite ruling upper classes of the world) instead of the left (the poor and working class masses of the world) then be consistent even in your musical tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Al is musical genius, however....","review":"I have a number of Ministry's earlier albums, the last album I purchased was \\"A Mind is a Terrible to Taste.\\" Then over the years my occupation and family absorbed most of my time, I stopped going to clubs (and I never watched MTV) so I stopped keeping track of a lot of my favorite bands.A friend convinced me to check out the 6/22/06 Ministry/Revolting Cocks concert at Harpos (Detroit). The music (without lyrics) was awesome and mesmerizing. Al is a musical genius. However, I was greatly disappointed in the relentless anti-bush, anti-military, anti-war, leftist message being steady rammed down my throat via imagry onscreen and lyrics. My reaction was visceral, but I forced myself to remain until after NWO was performed then I split. I do not share the politics of the left, and I will leave it at that.

At least it will be more readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, but not his best...","review":"I found Paths of the Dead quite entertaining. The book fills in several unanswered questions that readers of Brust's other works undoubtedly have lingering in the back of their minds. Still, the particular sort of quasi-historical fantasy style he adopts has its ups and downs. I appreciate how clever the writing is, but find it a bit self-indulgent at times. Like most of Brust's writing, it's a pleasure to read because the author obviously enjoys his created universe so much. On the other hand, it's a bit undisciplined for the same reason. At his best, Brust matches Peter Beagle's efficient compelling style and even manages to make it more fun than Beagle's more serious novels. Overall, I heartily endorse Paths of the Dead for Brust's regular readers, but I'd recommend starting with an earlier novel for folks that aren't familiar with his style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Writing Style","review":"The supposed narrator, \\"Paarfi\\" is verbose and inane.

I didn't like either one of those books but I really enjoyed Brust in his Vlad Taltos series. Maybe I have just read too much of his work lately but \\"it ain't working for me.\\" Setting is the same, language the same, but again, it just couldn't get my interest. I would lay it down, read a couple of interesting books, pick it up, try to read it and lay it down again. I am now taking myself off of Brust for the foreseeable future. Maybe if I let my mind clear I can rediscover what I found so scintillating in the Vlad Taltos series. Of course, maybe, that series was just better. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaarghh!","review":"I hate to say this, but the only character in this book that comes across as \\"real\\" is Sir Paarfi of Roundwood, and at that it would have been best had the reader been apprised of his death at childbirth.This is a story that you really have to work for, dragging the relevant bits and pieces from the dregs of \\"Sir Paarfi's\\" stilted writing style, which I enjoyed in the other books. Perhaps that is because the style is not used to enhance, but to enlength the book to something with the requisite number of pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice book","review":"Very nice book with a lot of SAS code.

Yep.It's not actively bad - even Heirs of Empire wasn't really bad - but whenever gods get into it, your main character has a really, really bad tendency to become, well, boring. You know, in this one, exactly what's coming. All the fun rests on seeing how the author handles the expected heroism.Weber is not the world's greatest at characterization. He's not the greatest writer I've ever read. But he does keep the story going, and I get a kick out of his books. This one was just, well, lightweight.On the other hand, I'll still buy anything he puts out, in hardbound, and down it at one gulp."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Successful Sequel","review":"I enjoyed Oath of Swords in large part due to its lack of complexity, readability and strong character development. The War God's Own maintains these strengths while further developing the world of Bahzell Bahnakson.Admittedly, some parts of the plot are rather predictable and this is not a book for those who chiefly value suspense in fiction. For me, the lack of suspense was not an issue though because, like Oath of Swords, I enjoyed this book primarily because it is such a well-executed and polished example of the genre. Because of its polish, execution and acceptance of traditional fantasy elements, The War God's Own was a very comfortable and enjoyable read even if it didn't offer any major innovations in the genre.

The discussion is generally shallow and has a tendency toward casual errors. It also presents blacksmithing traditions as fact despite modern dispute (E.g., Edge packing, pp 168-169, is now generally considered nonsense by reputable blacksmiths). If you want to learn about practical blacksmithing techniques, Jack Andrew's \\"New Edge of the Anvil\\" is much, much better.

Yet Mr. Bealer is sharing not only knowledge with you. But opening doors to the same past we came from.

A word of caution is in order here though; no book can teach you all of this skill. I would recomend, in addition to reading this book, locating a smith or a college with a blacksmithing course near you and talking to them to really learn the trade. That being said, this book is a great and accurate introduction to the art.

For example, the issue of \\"States' Rights\\" was always a red herring on the part of rapacious and racist slave-owners for the maintenence of brutal and evil slavery.The fugitive slave law could have been nullified by Northern States on the basis of \\"States' Rights\\" but the Southern States always howled about how federal law, IN THIS INSTANCE, had to be maintained.The author points out that in the South, they only obeyed those laws that suited them.This book would be a fine antidote to Foote's narrative and somewhat pro-Confederate \\"The Civil War\\" series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Idiots Account","review":"Very disappointing. This is the usual \\"virtuous north fighting to free the slave\\" dribble which considering his excellent works on WWI and the Revolutonary War is uncharacteristically shallow.

The light didn't stay in position, seemed to occasionally get in the way of my hands, and frequently blocked my view of the screen. Nothing was a showstopper but I wanted to get rid of the annoyances if possible.Then I tried a new reading light:Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Light (Silver). It throws a very even, very white light at two intensities. Batteries will run it for over 20 hours. The neck is stiff enough to keep the light were you put it. Best of all it attaches to your book with nice wide and padded jaws.It took me about a minute to realize that all these benefits could be used with my netbook by clipping the light to the slide of the display. It's the best I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little light","review":"this light is exactly what you need when working on a laptop at night. i like to watch tv and be on my laptop and this allows me to see both very well. the light has adjustable intensity, it's very bendable, but stays in place very well. it also stays in the usb port well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Notebook Light","review":"There's really not much else to say. The light is clean and bright and there's more than enough to illuminate the keyboard. I generally use the dim setting as the full setting is almost too bright. On/Off switch is a real plus.

The beam is too hot and too narrow to allow this thing to illuminate more than a tiny bit of the keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice light","review":"Whoever is complaining about this light not being bright enough maybe legally considered blind. I use this light in my vehicle and it gives me plenty of light and then some just using the half-setting. If I use the full-setting, I can blind the car next to me.

One complaint told of the inability of the lamp to illuminate the entire computer keyboard. This is somewhat true. The lamp, however it is positioned, indeed shoots light to a particular area, but the light does spill over to rest of the keyboard. I have an ASUS laptop that has black keys with dark gold lettering and the keys are somewhat hard to see even in the daylight.So, I found the lamp to work very well. And, as the manufacturer says, \\"90 seconds of battery power per hour of use\\", which simply means you won't even notice the drain on your battery (unless of course your laptop battery only lasts for 90 seconds and even then the amount the lamp uses with be small).

Of course this will add weight, making it even more \\"floppy\\" and \\"bendy\\", so I will have to attach it somehow to the screen/lid.BOTTOM LINE: if you hope to get something of quality for $20 here -- forget it!

Of course there is the obvious one. It does work well for lighting up my computer keyboard in the dark thereby reducing eyestrain.

My only complaint about it is that the weight makes it a little wobbly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Was Looking For","review":"The FlyLight is exactly what i was looking for. Perfect while working on my laptop at night in the living room without having to turn on an end-table lamp to see the keyboard. Also perfect for using the laptop while in bed.I do agree with other reviewers that if the light was diffused, the lighting would appear evenly distributed across the keyboard. However, you CAN still see the entire keyboard without the light being diffused. I have an HP Pavilion dv9000, which has a full size keyboard; I have NO problem seeing any of the keys. I also agree with the other reviewers that there really isn't much difference between the low and high light settings.My only concern is for the USB ports on the laptop; in general, USB ports can easily break after a lot of use and the cost to replace them can be excessive. While the light is very lightweight, I'd suggest that you hold the connection firm while adjusting the gooseneck...just as a precaution."},{"rating":"1","title":"flicka","review":"The light was fine for the first couple months but now it flickers annoyingly and that is why I am buying another, this one came up again and i just had to put in my review!

Within 2 months, 2 of the LEDs stopped working. They both affected the dim setting, making it too dim to be useful, while the bright setting was still too bright. Since the item was outside of Amazon's exchange timeframe, I went to Kensington and got a replacement. The replacement worked fine for about 6 months, when the first LED went out. A second one went out shortly thereafter. Now last week, another LED malfunction... one of the LEDs has now started flashing, which is very distracting.

It's certainly bright enough, but the beam is so narrow it simply makes a bright spot in the middle of the keyboard.

Please correct title (\\"Dirty money\\") and actors links, mistaken with \\"Dirty money\\" (1994).

I had purchased it after reading that the author has got a big advance. At the end of it I wonder for what? The story is pure pretense; the language usage amateurish. Dollops of incest inserted do not sound genuine and do not read well too. Maybe the writer was intersted in the foreign markets. But I have not been able to relate the story to the Indian reality. My advice__ avoid the book !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't recommend this book to other people...","review":"which is why I'm giving it only 2 stars. I enjoy reading Indian writers, but this was the most disappointing book by an Indian writer that I have read. I went right from \\"The Blue Bedspread\\" to \\"Shiva Dancing\\" by Bharti Kirchner, and it was such a great relief to read another evocative, beautifully written, story about India. \\"The Blue Bedspread\\" had a few moments of clarity and good storytelling, but overall I found it difficult to plod through--and I found myself scanning through pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, pretty much bad....","review":"Well, this book is pages and pages of disappointment and boredom. The storyline is vague. In fact if the plot is not important then the language and imagery should have been. But that too is really poor. Maybe Jha should read some more, for his creative talents and writing skills seem non-existent. Some chapters of this book are vague. The whole thing in the end leaves you wondering what was this all about. My advice--- run a hundred miles from this one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"boil it down to some short stories","review":"This book was ok. There are some really nice moments of writing--evocating, tender, clever, thoughtful. The structure was interesting--more so than a straightforward linear narrative. Some of the gaps he leaves enhance the text, while others are merely puzzling. The conceit of writing to his niece is appealing, as are the glimpses of Calcutta . However, his treatment of the (approaching tired) topic of incest was thin and boring, and added *nothing* to the book. Maybe he thought he was being daring, but he wasn't. (Surely *someone* can come along and treat this topic in an interesting fashion?!) Overall, the material in this book might be better served by cutting out the dross and turning it into a collection of short stories. This would trim away some of the contrivance. I can't really recommend this book--let's see what #2 looks like."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it....","review":"Having read one or two reviews of this book in the British press, I was convinced I was going to enjoy it. I loved the God of Small Things and wanted to explore more contemporary Indian fiction. Sadly, having read it - and I have to say I had to force myself to get to the end - I feel it was a triumph of marketing rather than a great, or even good, work of fiction. The title and the jacket are imaginative and evocative, but the content fails to live up to the book's exterior. As other reviewers here have noted, there was nothing in it that made me care about the characters, I didn't feel I got to know them at all, and the affected writing often stood between me and a sad story that I tried to care about but couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad writing,good networking","review":"The blue bedspread is definitely the death of the written word and no amount of window dressing and networking can change that. The story --- there is really none --- is contrived, the situations trumped up, the characters nameless zombies. This is the real Y2k bug of a book! I was so grossly disappointed and bored by the book that I made it a point to read every word of it just to figure out what the critics saw in it. Well, either the few reviewers are the Tom Hanks, for believe me this entire effort is amateurish and bad. Maybe the subcontinet has produced good authors like , Salman Rushdie, Vikram Seth and Amitav Ghosh. Jha certainly is not even a fraction as talented. However if you want to make sense of nonsense, you could try your patience here. For me this required two aspirins to get over...."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing,overhyped,poorly written","review":"I had gone through the reviews of this book before I purchased it. It seems that either people hate it or a few like it. But when I started going through it, I realised that it took a lot of patience to wade though the book. I could not make sense of most of it. Maybe that is what the author wanted. Or maybe the only thrill one got out of the book was the feeling that one had done a difficult and tiring journey! Phew! Once it was over, you could congratulate yourself that you had managed to last the journey! And you could even find some bright spots during what is certainly a cumbersome book. I feel the author should read more. Maybe read authors like saul Bellow and Mark Twain, Hemingway and Salman Rushdie to know what real writing is about. I think the critics have been too generous or ignorant of what the book is about. At least all I can conclude is that this is poorly written !"},{"rating":"1","title":"no good !","review":"Hi readers! I am going to write this review from my heart. And my heart says-- this is a bad book! The first problem is the sheer pretense of it all. The devices Mr jah uses are so cliched, that they will make you yawn; his writing style is pedantic and imagination and creative abilities very limited. In the end we have a few pages of sheer boredom. Being a teacher of literature, I have not come across many books which have been hyped so high and fall so low. My advice to readers....This is F grade stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"its the pits!","review":"...This book has got no plot, no sentence structure, no logic.

And that is certainly not a good prospect...."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and contrived","review":"This is a bad book written in a confusing manner to create a false pretense of being arty. I put in a tremendous effort to read it but failed every ten minutes. The theme of incest is certainly hot. But the execution is poor and weak; the story line contrived. And the entire effort banal. How did it get past the honourable editors of the publishing house? In the end this is as one critic put it \\" bad writing and just good networking.\\" There is more to Indian writing as Vikram Seth and Shobha De have shown.

The first are the plot driven,interesting novels which deal with real India; novels which are read and enjoyed. The other are the export quality, badly written books which have no bearing in reality.

The plot line is vague, the style pretentious and the net result horrendous...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stars say it all...","review":"After reading the book, I ended up with more questions than answers. There are so many unanswered questions that I couldn't stop thinking about the book. I wonder if this was the author's intention. At first I thought that I am too young to understand this book as I am just a teenager, but after reading the other reviews on this site, I realise that is not the case. Kamal Raj Jha kept opening new stories of the past and didn't really end it, leaving us with a blurry picture. I understand this is his debut, and wish him better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANTED TO LIKE IT, BUT IT WAS WAY TOO CONFUSING","review":"I read many of the reviews on this book, and while it has been well received, it was difficult and confusing to read, way too disjointed for me.

In the end, I'm left wanting something better written than what this was."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, pretentious writing","review":"As an American who coems to India every few months, I am a keen follower of the new burst of English writings here. However this book certainly left a bad taste. I think it was dragging, boring and plain pretentious. God knows how the publishers managed the reviews. The entire story is confusing. U need an Aspirn after page 6. And I can swear that all comparisons with Carver are misplaced. There is no building up of a tale or characterisations. Even the sex is unerotic, seedy and false. What remains in your mind after you complete it is the feeling that you have been conned. Maybe the author needs encouragement, being a new one. However, I dont think this should be at the readers cost !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and self-absorbed","review":"This book is painful to read -- the style is contrived and the language is, in equal measure, pretentious and corny. What explains all those great reviews? Danmed if I know. The publishers have done a tremendous job marketing this book. Jha does cut a nice \\"pretty boy\\" image (just look at his pic. on the inside jacket) and incest - gratuitous or otherwise - seems to sell.Save your money, don't spend it on this one. Use it help other young talent instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"corny,boring,confusing...","review":"This book is difficult to read and is pure pretense. I believe that Jha is a new writer, but I guess he has slipped up badly. People outside India may make some sense out of the whole thing, but for me this was pure disappointment. There are structural problems as well as a problem of credibility in the entire story; Such subjects require more senstivity. I think Jha should put in more effort in his next book as well as be more honest and less showy."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious, boring, stupid","review":"What a ghastly book! Dreadful story and overly written. The only character worth remembering is the family's faithful housemaid. And the ending - puhleeze! Like you couldn't see the big secret from ten miles away. I didn't want to give it even one star; maybe amazon should rethink their rating system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really wanted to \\"get\\" this book, however, the author failed to deliver. The inconsistencies are hard to overcome and his writing style is disjointed. Bonding with the characters is futile as they are bland and lifeless. I must say, certain passages were riveting but it wasn't enough to carry the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I found the story very pretentious and at times there seemed to be an attempt to make things seem bigger than they are. It's a pretty boring story which seems to aspire to take on epic proportions which it does not deserve. If this book was published after 'The God of Small Things' , i really can't help but think of it as a blatant imitation of sorts which lacks momentum and literary beauty of the former."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"Jeez, I guess anything can be printed these days. Indian authors seem to be popular now - maybe that's it. Jha seems to be trying to be disturbing and avant-garde but just ends up with a poor writing style and bizarre yet dull plot. I'm amazed that so many reviewer's have given this one high marks."},{"rating":"1","title":"a boring bedspread","review":"Mr Rajkamal Jha may have invited endless comparisons and won big prizes, but I wonder on what basis. It takes a lot of patience to wade through the book. Somehow the story is not clear at all. At points it seems this is a series of short stories, while sometimes it seems like an amateur effort at scandalizing. The subjects dealt with like incest, child abuse and loneliness are never explained. In fact all the time you keep wondering what is happening. I think the author should have rewritten parts of it to keep the reader informed about outcome of the various subplots. Or is confusion a qualification for labelling a book as arty?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have certainly read better!","review":"Raj Kamal Jha's debut novel has been compared to Raymond Carver's work. First of all, I happen to think that The Blue Bedspread isn't worthy of such comparison. The writing is bland, the characters are boring, the story isn't particularly shocking -- which surprises me, for the serious issues in this novel, such as abuse, betrayal and incest, could make even the most experienced reader cringe -- and the surprise ending isn't so, well, surprising. In the end, I feel as though I have wasted hours on a book that should have been kept on the store's shelf. ... Whatever you do, skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a voice to carry you in","review":"Jha crafts a well interwoven story of reflection and prediction through changes of narrative style and character emphasis. It is an encapsulating novel that creates a resonant narrative voice in your mind. THis is the voice that carries you through the past, both imagined and real. The reader gets a sepulchral glimpse of life in Calcutta as told through the painful anecdotes of a young boy, brother, and middle aged man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Affected and insincere","review":"This story of incest just doesn't work because it is artificial, the characters are ersatz, and the author seems to have introduced situations just to fill the pages. There is no redemptive power in the story and the writing. One of the low points of Indian English writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"corny,boring,bad!!","review":"I would probably be the last person to trash a book, especially from a first timer. Yet this one deserves to be reviewed honestly for an attempt is being made to redefine Indian writing by sheer publicity and not on the strenght of the product. In this case advance publicity about a handsome international advance was leaked out so that there was curiousity all around. But did the book do justice to this advance and the publicity?? Good God NO!! For one thing Raj kamal has no story telling abilities. You can go through the book or maybe even the first twenty pages to judge that. Maybe his stint as a journalist has killed it. Here there are attempts to be sensational-- Incest in many forms; To be falsely arty-- few names given to places and people; To sound profound-- few images thrown here and there. And so on. On the whole very very disappointing fare. Somebody has said this is bad writing.

I chose to do a final project for a college course on the book and the film adaptations, but, upon reading the book, there was so much in it that I didn't even get to the films.The book is marvelous, and I recommend it to anyone who likes early twentieth century literature, film, or the strange and macabre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Tasty Herbal Salt","review":"Organic Herbamare tastes great on almost everything.

This bag is just as big as my last one with a small front compartment. Even bigger plus is that the main large compartment has a zipper for closure. Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the canvas seems a lot thinner than my last bag, and I worry that it won't last as along, lugging heavy notes and supplies every day.

But these are a lot of the same pictures that are in most TFH books, some of which they are low quality. A better book for pictures is Conkel's book, the first hardbound edition. Some of his theories are questionable. For the Central American Cichlid fishkeeper, this book should be one of the top on their buy list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary!","review":"Whether your first sample of Tangerine comes from the audio collage opening the CD, or visual contact with the striking cover art, you'll know from the start this is something different.David Mead's songs are always a delight for fans of finely crafted lyrics; a combination of storytelling and poetic descriptive phrases, often with a nice dash of whimsical humor tossed in. The arrangements of this studio masterpiece give the perfect framework for showcasing the songs. There is a veritable smorgasbord of instruments not often found in a pop/rock setting, and they are all interwoven with just the right touch. Glockenspiel, clavinet, vibraphone, and calliope are just a few of the surprises. David's distinctive voice, with trademark upper register wonder-notes, completes the unique presentation.This album is the result of giving a creative artist complete freedom. The result is, not surprisingly, vibrant, boldly unusual, and a bit exotic. Not unlike it's namesake: Tangerine."},{"rating":"2","title":"why has this gone out of print","review":"It seems impossible that a collection of stories as ground breaking as these could disappear from the bookshelves, but here it is. I came on to find out about ordering a copy but found the publisher was out! Then let me say, having read it a few times already that while In the Heart of the Heart of the Country gets and deserves much praise in this collection, The Pederson Kid is MASTERFul in its language, pacing and style. Order of Insects also is rumination as short story. I am in love with this book and like your true love, it will always be there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mass of Gass","review":"This collection of long short stories will not let you relax while you read. As with the other Gass I've read, he wants to make you think deeply. There are no clear cut endings, but these aren't clear cut stories.The best thing about this edition (ISBN 0879233745) is the preface by Gass himself. I usually save such for reading as an afterword (too many prefaces and introductions have too many spoilers).

To start with, this is a great guitar if you want to learn to play or general playing. It comes with lots of accessories, including a set of strings, bag, and strap. The color of the guitar is fantastic! And, the tuner pegs are made of brass, not some cheap pice of plastic. The pegs did slip the first few times I played, but after a while they seemed to stick...I guess it just takes some time and getting used to. This guitar produces a nice tone. The action seems fine to me (neither too high or too low), which makes it relatively easy to play. I think that it is a great guitar for the price! I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Cheapest guitar ever made. Did not work at all!

The different colors are each differently flavored, and you can eat this chewy treat slowly or quickly. I like to bite off the outer layer first and then eat the inside, but my wife eats the inside part first. Just a very different candy from what we are used to--it doesn't taste overly \\"sugary\\", won't feel like you are greasing your mouth with fructose, etc...give it a try. I wish I had bought two boxes. I wish Amazon offered the Balla-Balla, too. I can't wait to try that sometime, but I would rather wait until I can get it at a good price.

I have owned the phone for about 4 months and have been quite pleased. It is easy to use, compact, and allows me to keep scheduling, contacts, phone, etc. in one device. My one complaint is the battery life, which is relatively short. It has been improved since the upgrades that were available last month. Other than battery life, I haven't had any problems that other users have described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good looking, light weight phone","review":"This phone is very light weight and smaller than the usual huge phones with the same features.

It's a nice looking phone. That is the best I can say about it. If it rings, the ringing will stop instantly as soon as I touch the phone. Not when I touch a button or the screen but anywhere on the body of the phone. I have called for warranty service three times. Each time they tell me the same thing -- it's a software problem! But when I finally convinced them that after trying three times to fix the software and it never worked, it had to be a hardware problem. But then they wanted $25.00 up front to replace the phone with a refirbished phone. The tech supporrt is somewhere in Asia so getting them to understand that it was a hardware problem was very difficult. So the phone doesn't work, and the tech support really stinks! Don't buy this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't trust the preview samples","review":"All song \\"previews\\" except one are wrong; they are most definitely not Django Walker!

The crash of the Hegelian movement and the reversal of thought in the post-Hegelian generation saw many influenced by the (quite metaphysical) Comtean positivism, among them none other than Charles Darwin. The effect is practically cast in granite in the works of Marx who unwittinlgy signatures the trend. The tide of positivism carrying its distinct set of hidden metaphysical premises and limits was fairly well exposed at the time, but in the age of dominant Darwinism it has made a comeback in disguise. Hughes goes through the whole development tracing the stream of influences and gives us an significant portrait of intellectual history we seemed doomed to relive none the wiser.

I think it is out of print now. The D'Indy is head and shoulders above many versions of this work, although Nicole Henriot-Schweitzer's recording with Munch is also wonderful. This symphony should be much more well known, as well as other works by D'Indy. Thibaudet plays the difficult piano part with much panache. This is not a piano concerto, but a definite symphony with piano solo.

I was unable to tell the difference in handling or ride when wheeling across the concrete barn breezeway or the uneven terrain in the pastures.Our wheelbarrow was converted to a 3 wheel version.

The investment is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tire!","review":"It is everything advertised. Product saved a perfectly good wheelbarrow with a flat from otherwise becoming landfill. Any replacement is near the price of a new household wheelbarrow, but for not much more than the cost of an inflatable replacement, which could still puncture at anytime, the only thing that will put my wheelbarrow out of action now is rust. The tire appears durable enough to remain a spare for any future wheelbarrow. I would like to see this replace the cheap inflatables on new equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"My standard inflatable wheel went flat in the middle of a project.

This was very good, but not on the same level as the others. The plot here is excellent and Sandford does his usual job of developing strong characters - both the villains in this book and the main characters who we see from one novel to the next. By now we're really starting to understand Lucas Davenport, the variety of cops surrounding him, and his girlfriend Weather. As good as all of this is, the story itself started to go from break neck pace to a slow plodding for just a little while. It then jumped back to fast action, making the story seem choppy at times. Overall, though, still a great read and definitely should not be missed if you are enjoying all of the other Davenport books."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All About Revenge...","review":"This is another page turning installment in John Sandford's Prey Series. In the beginning, the \\"prey\\" seems to be a pair of female bank robbers. Suddenly, the \\"hunters\\" become the prey and are hunted in a cruel, quick and shocking fashion. The family of the bank robbers hunt down the police responsible for their demise. Add into the mix a \\"bad\\" cop, and nobody is safe. The ending has a major impact on the next book in the series. If you are a fan of action and suspense, you won't be disappointed.I've read several of the later books in the Prey series, and am going back and reading the ones I've missed. I only wish I had started in the beginning. It's a great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling read","review":"Sudden Prey is one of the best and most fast-paced mysteries I have read this year. Lucas Davenport and his team are on a man-hunt which quickly turns into a war between the good guys and the bad guys. The suspense is intense all the way through, and the book is un-putdownable. It is a book in John Sandford's Prey-series, but one does not have to have read all the previous novels to be able to really enjoy this. Do not read this book if you have things to do, you will not be able to do anything else but read! Highly recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Davenport book - even better than","review":"A few days ago, I wrote a review on Amazon after finishing \\"Mind Prey,\\" and how it was the best Davenport book so far (I am reading them in order). Well, I have just finished \\"Sudden Prey,\\" and for as excellent as \\"Mind Prey\\" was, \\"Sudden Prey\\" is that much better, believe it or not.Something is always happening, pretty much from the start. There are a few areas where Davenport \\"figures\\" out something, and you think how impossible that would be in real life - but Davenport is human and does make a few mistakes as well, so he is not fullproof. He comes across as being very bright and on top of his game. This series is a blast to follow, especially seeing how Davenport has slowly changed throughout the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly bad!","review":"As a reader of several of the 'Prey' books, I found this one to be a waste of time.

Save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very twisted","review":"This was my fourth Sandford novel and I have tried to give him a chance. In the first two, I found Lucas to be appalingly sexist and disliked him immensely. After reading this one and \\"Winter Prey,\\" I have decided I will spend no more time reading Sandford. Stephen King is a pussycat compared to this guy. I just find these novels to be increasingly twisted and disturbed. I suppose there are people out there like these folks but in this case I would have to say ignorance is bliss on my part. It disturbs me that someone would think as Lucas does and that any women would put up with him. Time better spent elsewhere...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most powerful and suspense-filled Prey book of all.","review":"From the robbery at the beginning to Weather's rescue at the end this book was gripping-I read it in just over 8 hours with time out for a nite's sleep.

So far, I have not been disappointed.In Sudden Prey, the hunters become the hunted as the death of two female bank robbers inspires a vengence quest on the part of their husband/brother and his militia buddies.As always, Sandford/Camp masters pacing and realism (if you can believe so much happens in freezing cold MN). Nothing more to say other than: If you like any of his books, read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't blink or you will miss it","review":"This was a very fast paced novel.

This one failed me completely. Absolutely implausible story. Frustrating to have read it to the end hoping for some twist, some reward, and...nothing.

Without a doubt the most disappointing Sandford novel I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets Better As it Moves Along","review":"This was the first Sanford book I've read, and it won't be the last. It will never win my \\"Book of the Year\\" award, but it was a better than average, entertaining read.My only complaint is that early on, there are too many characters introduced too quickly, and it easily confused as to who is who. But as it moved on, and the story spread out, that problem diminished. It's not the most original novel, but that's not what Sanford's shooting for here. He's shooting for In-Your-Face, Fast Paced supsense - and he delivers!Anybody who is a fan of TV shows like \\"NYPD Blue\\" or \\"Murder One\\" will appreciate this book. The fast paced, back and forth action takes on a similar pattern to these shows.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many implausible situations","review":"I like action books that contain at least plausible scenarios.

I'm trying a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak battery, impeller disintegrated","review":"Like others, I found the battery charge to be very short; I have a small lot and could barely do both walks and the driveway before the power faded. But the final straw was having the plastic impeller break apart for no apparently reason; I am a small woman who handles the device delicately and it's never been dropped or treated roughly and yet ... it's now useless. Very disappointed; I think I'll stick with a regular broom from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable Electric Broom","review":"I owned this unit for about two years when for no apparent reason, the impeller shattered.

I would only purchase one of these blowers if you are able to accept the fact that you will most likely have to throw it out when it breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use, but only for a short time","review":"This unit was very easy to set up. Basically, you slide on the nozzle. Then you attach the unit to the charging base. And you plug the charger into the wall. That's it for setup!Using the unit is also very easy. There is a single switch on top that you flip and away you go. Since the unit is completely battery operated, there are no cords or gasoline issues to worry about. The whole tool is idiot-proof.However, with the battery on a full charge, you only have about 15 minutes of full power. After that time, the unit looses charge quickly until it only puts out a small puff of air. By then you're waving the thing around so much you might as well get a broom to do some actual work.I give this item 5 stars for ease of use, but only 1 star for doing what it's actually intended for, which is blowing. Considering I don't normally buy blowers for any other use, I give it 2 stars overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for small jobs","review":"I really enjoy this cordless blower.

It comes with a self contained battery and its own charging station, meaning it's ready for use when you are. It maintains about a 10-15 minute charge, and the airflow force is more than adequate for most \\"smooth surface\\" applications. Now the bad news: the plastic impeller, which forces the air from the broom, will last on average about 2 years, before it instantaneously shatters, rendering the broom useless. You cannot order the plastic impeller by itself; and instead, you have to order the complete \\"blower assembly\\", at a cost of about $15 less than a completely new power broom. Accordingly, unless you wish to replace the blower assembly or complete cordless broom every couple of years or so, I believe you would be better served by purchasing a model which contains a metal impeller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little plastic impeller ruins the whole product","review":"I'm one of the many who are complaining about the plastic fan.

However, worse is after 28 months (just out of warranty and they will not exchange it at their warranty centers) the impeller breaks and they do not sell non-battery parts for this blower so a perfectly good unit otherwise ends up in the landfill.

Like everyone else who has ever owned this product for more than one season, it worked okay for the first year. Then in season two, the impeller started vibrating during use, and eventually burst into dozens of pieces. The most annoying part of this is that you cannot replace just the impeller, even though it would be very easy to do. So you have to spend $50 to buy the entire blower assy (everything but the battery charger and tube), all to repair a $75 blower, which has the same inherent defect. No thanks. I cannot believe that Black & Decker has not stopped selling this product and not offered a free replacement blower assy to all who have bought one.

Broke after about 18 months.","review":"This purchase was a replacement for the identical model, so we liked the unit well enough to buy a second one. We bought this model of cordless broom because it is light weight and comfortable for my wife to use. We use it exclusively for clearing leaves off the pool decking (concrete/Sundek) and it works great for that. As for negatives, the battery life was a bit short - by the time we got all the way around the pool - maybe 15 minutes - the battery was dying and we had to cut some corners. Also, as you will read in other reviews, the plastic fan blade inside the unit will break after about 18 months - that is exactly what happened to us. We bought the unit assuming an 18 month life and it was still the right decision for us due to the light weight and ease of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Decker not made to last","review":"Just a little over two years with sporadic use and the impeller shattered. Scared the daylights out of me because when it shatters, it blows up into pieces and is a quite loud little explosion. It is useful for quick cleanups but you must rememember; this is Black & Decker. Use it for a while until its time to throw it away. For the most part, B &D only makes throw away tools. Battery life is about 15 minutes when new and about ten minutes after a year or so. A little after 2 years, battery does not hold full charge and lasts for about 5 minutes. B & D should have used lithium-ion batteries. I would have paid more for this feature but they dont offer it. For the impeller to shatter after two years is unacceptable. A metal impeller would have prevented this. But again, it's B & D. Fancy tools with nice colors. Poor tool function and even worse quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impeller Exploded / No Replacement Parts","review":"I was happy with this blower which I owned for approx 2 years until plastic impeller exploded.

Never again! Purchase at your risk but know service life is ????"},{"rating":"1","title":"My impeller also broke.","review":"Decent unit but the impeller/fan shattered, as in the other reviews.

I have several B&D products with 12 volt batteries and it would have been nice to use them as the charge on this blower is very short lived.

That kind of defeats the purpose of purchasing this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Black and Decker product","review":"Like others, my impeller shattered today. I won't bother trying to get a new one based on the reviews here.Yesterday I received two \\"pod\\" style 14.4 volt batteries for my cordless B and D hedge trimmer from Amazon (thank you) because the product is obsolete. With the new batteries, I learned the charger is dead, so I ordered another from Amazon so I can keep using the trimmer.My second B and D string trimmer just died at a little over two years. The motor burned out on the first after, you guessed it, a little over two years.Based on my experience, Black and Decker equipment is worthless junk. I will never buy one of their products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality impeller - shattered after 1.5 years","review":"Like many other reviewers, my CS100 impeller broke off from the motor shaft after 1.5 years with average usage of once every 3 weeks. See it for yourself:[...]The plastic material cannot withstand the stress of the load.I was actually quite happy with the product before this happened.A few months before it shattered, I had notice the sound getting louder and louder with every use. The real shame is that they will not sell you only the impeller.

Google for cs100 and read other reviews and you will find very consistent reports of the impeller breaking after 18 months. Even worse, Black&Decker does not sell a replacement part, so you get to buy a new one after 18 months and chuck this in the landfill. What a waste. I suggest you keep looking for another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"impeller/fan shattered","review":"Convienient to use but the impeller/fan shattered. It is made from a very brittle plastic.

It had enough battery power for about 15 min, just the right amount of time to clean out the garage and deck. But...the impeller fan broke after about two years of use for no apparent reason.

While her other releases vary quite a bit, going from mellow to heavy, this one is all ballads, all the time. Lana Lane's special edition cd's are a shining example of how to do a special edition that is truly worth buying. Many of these songs have been at least partially re-recorded for this album, which is actually the Ballad Collections 1 & 2, with a few new songs thrown in. I love this woman's voice, it wraps itself around you in a warm embrace and soars like an eagle through the sky. Her cd's are all awesome, but even among the great, this one stands out. Every song is a classic that you will want to hear time and again. From the opening Netherlands to the last song, you'll be in heaven.

Though I loved the entire cast, my favorite has to be Scott, the devilish brother always there to give Kelly both advice and a headache.

In fact I'm only three quarters of the way through and it's taken four weeks to read this far (I normally finish a book within a week). I could quite happily put the book on the shelf and forget about it; the only thing keeping me reading it is the fact I don't want to waste the time I've already invested.

Perhaps even more darkly satirical (if possible!) than Pest Control, which, even though it dealt with characters such as hit men, had a somewhat lighter touch.Integral to the book's plot is an international traffic in organs and organ donors. I don't know if things have come to the state depicted in Fitzhugh's book, but if they aren't, they probably will soon. Aside from being hilariously funny, Fitzhugh's book made me consider some of the issues surrounding organ transplants and organ donors for the first time.Until now, I wouldn't have thought it possible for someone to write a funny book about a subject like organ transplants.If you liked Fitzhugh's zany brand of dark humor in Pest Control, you'll like this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book!

Landis truly is a horrid, self-absorbed man, providing plenty of impetus for Paul's evolution from solid citizen with a social conscience to Mother Nature's front line guerrilla, with help from his Amazon lady love, Georgette. Contrasts abound in this book, which alternates between screwball comedy and paragraphs which seem to be straight from the Zero Population Growth Handbook.

For everyone's info, I could not finish the book.The story itself was also pretty bad. There was no sense of pacing. There would be pages upon pages in which the main character is describing the woes of his childhood, and then suddenly he goes to collect signatures for a petition.

It made me question, are superheros lonely becuause they are busy all the time saving the world, or are they lonely because they have personality flaws and are crazy?

Well, as with many early relationships, this one just is not working out...she's a bit needy/possessive and he's in love with someone else, but how do you break it off with a superwoman.

The male lead Matt was extremely unattractive, and Uma as the insecure jealous, spiteful ex was just disturbing.I didn't find anything very amusing about G-girl stalking the dim-witted loser Matt. I also didn't relish the numerous and corny sex scenes in this film. I don't mind sex scenes, but these were just coarse and stupid, not romantic.I did think Professor Bedlam was actually quite good, and I would've liked to see more backstory for him.Overall, I didn't like the film. It was corny and the humor half-baked. 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Absurd! (In a very good way!)","review":"Reitman was successful in creating an absolutely farce.

My husband is a fan of Rainn Wilson, but even he could not salvage this horrendous movie. The storyline and the dialogue were just awful, and not even in a funny good-awful kind of way.

Eventually like all romantic comedy, it has a happy ending when boys get girls and it all works out.I don't like Uma Thurman so maybe that was a problem although no one I thought acted well.Also a superhero is suppose to have respect. Uma Thurman's superhero was comical. The special effects were surprisingly quite poor. It just did not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick & Gross","review":"I saw this movie and a lot of bad stuff for kid of the age 13. This should be rated \\"R\\".

Jenny immediately falls in love for him, they have sex and she discloses her true identity to him, telling that she is the powerful superhero G-Girl. After meeting his co-worker and friend Hannah Lewis, the needy Jenny becomes jealous, controlling and manipulative, and Matt follows the advice of his best friend Vaughn Haige and dumps her, breaking her heart. Jenny turns Matt's life into hell, while he has a romance with Hannah. However, the archenemy of G-Girl and former high school sweetheart of Jenny, Professor Bedlam, proposes Matt to lure Jenny to strip her superpowers. Uma Thurman is perfect as the mercurial super-heroine, mysteriously named G-Girl. It's a delightful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Funny!!!","review":"Dang, I don't remember the last time I laughed this much in a movie. And it wasn't just me, the whole theatre was cracking up BIG time!!! No, this movie isn't gonna win any awards or anything, and yes, the plot is silly and ridiculous, but that is exactly why I go to the movies. To escape from REAL life. And this movie was a great escape. Uma Thurman was the perfect choice to play G-Girl. She is so damn good at being funny, bad, just everything you would want in your not so average superhero. Luke Wilson also does an outstanding job as playing the witty boyfriend of G-Girl. All in all, I highly recommend this to all who are looking for a great romantic comedy that includes a superhero. lol You will not be dissapointed!! 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Why did G-Girl just throw a shark at us?\\"","review":"A very pleasant surprise, My Super Ex-Girlfriend, is a romantic comedy that brings to the screen the story of a rather unlucky (when it comes to relationships) guy who catches the eye of one hot superheroine. Things become a bit complicated when he realizes that dating a superheroine is not easy...Luke Wilson, Uma Thurman, Anna Faris, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music (!) are all wonderful!In short, My Super Ex-Girlfriend is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely put you in a good mood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy movie","review":"This movie is so bad, we stopped it after 1/2 hour!

The currently popular reversal of gender roles (strong woman and a weak man) is boring too - who wants to see a total moron as a hero? And how could a supposedly super-intelligent super-heroine fall in love with smth like that? Though the heroine does not show any super intelligence either - mostly she displays strong hysterics and deep rooted neurosis.Wasted time - Uma Thurman's and wasted money - mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Girlfriend is a Dud","review":"If it wasn't for the talents of the very funny Uma Thurman.

It features some case studies and interviews, but they tend to be somewhat superficial and limited. I didn't find much that was enlightening or exciting.

If you're a little more advanced in scene play -- meaning if have played in public a lot with a variety of people, and have gained exposure to a wide array of kinks in person already -- this book is still interesting but less helpful. However, for someone who lacks that sort of experience/exposure, you'l find this to be a realistic, valuable guide to the cornucopia of kinks that exist in this world.Please be aware that the pony play section isn't accurate, but most of the rest of it seems to be. Even though the book is a little old, it isn't outdated in the sense that its information remains obviously relevant today as more people find themselves exploring their kinks and related communities.Again, for a newbie, this book will on average be an excellent introduction, but for a more advanced person, it might be less groundbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is very informative.

Although the Three Tenors have numerous other album, this album is special because it is live and when you listen to it you really do feel their magic prescence.

His command of metaphor and descriptive text is unmatched in today's creative writing arena. While still referencing one of the seminal periods of England's 20th Century history, _The Fall_ demonstrates that Mawer is equally comfortable developing a consuming narrative about later 20th century characters who are only minimally linked to World War II.

It is appropriate for home remodels, new home builders, developers, and anyone getting started in the construction business. Read it and you will be able to converse professionally with architects, engineers, builders, and subcontractors. This is not a technical book on how to frame a house or plumb a bathroom. Rather, it gives you an insight into the construction process and a game plan to make sure that you are ready to deal with construction professionals. Amy Johnston's checklists and recommendations for various parts of the process are spot on. Follow her guidance and you will save thousands in time and money and navigate your way through the construction process with confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it from the library then bought it","review":"I borrowed this from the library and decided that it was well worth buying. If you're going to build or renovate the more information you have in advance the better the experience is likely to be both for you and your builder. It really spells out some of the simple things you can do to help your project succeed. My favourite tip is about thinking ahead for the future - e.g if you can't build all the extension in one go what could you do this time to cut the costs next time e.g. framing a door into the room that won't be built for a while and hiding it with drywall."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Owner builders","review":"This book was easy reading and was recommended by Amazon after I bought another book on owner building.

Best book on the subject of how to go about building or substantially renovating a home. Clearly written, eminently practical.Now that we are halfway into the building phase of our ground up new home construction using a GC who we selected through competitive bidding using the fixed price contract approach (with alternate options on various materials) as recommended in the book, I am an even bigger fan of this book. Our project is on schedule and within 1% of the originally budgeted amounts.If you follow the steps in the book and if you take the time in the planning stage to make 99% of your decisions and come up with extremely detailed plans, specs, material choices and alternates, then use those to put the project out to bid, reduce the winning bid to a contract and manage the process through weekly meetings and the line item budget, you will be so much happier than if you try the typical ad hoc approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE IF BUILDING OR RENOVATING","review":"I just want to make a short review which is this book is wonderful by helping everyone out in the construction process because the more you are informed about what is going on, the better your decisions will be not only making you happier, but making the project and experience more successful. I am an architect in which I deal with many people who are not sure of any part of the process from conceptual to realization and it can be a daunting task which there are truly few contractors who don't take advantage when they have the upperhand.

It explains the differences between materials and provides tips on how to make sure you get what you put in your plans.

This book has many helpful details that have positively impacted our renovation. Amy articulates that most standard trim on houses is too small and therefore looks bad.

Orientalism was formed as a way to firstly understand the middle east definitely through imperalist powers, but Orientalism has affected even those who are not 'enemies' of the west. and I would argue has lead to islamophobia, while there is not a direct racism (that I know of) directly negatively shaping and affecting the lives of \\"white\\" people the way other groups of people are affected.The title appears to be a strict focus on those who do not like the west, and those are not the only stereotypes that should be taken into account.But hey, most americans are obese, is that a fair assessment of the west? i do not know.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occidentalism - not worth reading","review":"The Book is full of double speak and nonsensical text.

I may sound biased in my review, but I'm sorry, this album is simply a must have. Probably one of the best Pictures at an Exhibition recording I have ever heard (I own four recordings and none are as good as this.) Well what can I say, the CSO is simply formidable in execution and clarity. The Prokofiev comes out beautifully and is very exciting throughout. The 1812 Overture, yes, has a lot of canons and bells, but without them then it would just not feel right. But not to worry, don't think that with all the canons and bells the orchestra is drowned, on the contrary, the CSO is able to project, and nothing is overdone, simply the strong, solid sound that the CSO is known for. I truly recommend this album to anyone.Another album, if you want another interpretation of Pictures, is the one with Fritz Reiner. If you are able to get both, then do so. I highly recommend both."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting commentary on Solti","review":"As a Solti fan, I enjoy his fast paced and vigorous paced performances. I was interested to see that it works well for the 1812 Overture and Pictures. It works less well, I learned, for other types of music such as Prokofiev's Classical Symphony, which needs a lighter touch to be fully appreciated. A first rate performance of that piece can be found on the Orpheus Chamber's recording, coupled with symphonies by Bizet and Britten. Still, Solti's breathlessly paced 1812 overture and Pictures are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very refined","review":"I was disappointed. Why would I pay money to hear a recording complete with split and miss-centered notes in the high brass?There are also intonation issues in the woodwinds at times.

I suggest looking elsewhere for a good recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too Long","review":"This is an exceptionally promising and challenging idea, but the book runs a good 200 pages longer than it needs to. Many of the scenes fail to move the plot forward or develop the characters, which is a real shame -- Powers is a master of atmospheric detail, and he has a talent for making the bizarre seem routine.

Fans of John le Carre or Frederick Forsyth (or Graham Greene -- the foregrounding of Hale's Catholicism is deft and real) may experience some turbulence as we (and the hero, Hale) get suddenly dumped into the supernatural.

His latest assignment is to bring to completion Operation Declare, a mission gone disasterously wrong under his leadership twenty years before. As the story unfolds we find spies and counter-spies, and catch a glimpse of the wheels-within-wheels machinations of an ultra-secret service.'Declare' is primarily a novel of espionage, in the tradition of John le Carre, but in the hands of Tim Powers the tale takes on a supernatural cast. Powers masterfully weaves facts and fantasy in a compelling story told across decades and continents. This novel is a must-have for Powers fans, and a great read for anyone who likes a complicated spy-thriller, and is willing to believe that there are beings greater than ourselves afoot in the universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying this CD, despite digital sound.","review":"Even with digital recording and generally great sound quality, Dorati and the DSO produce lifeless performances of Copland's work, especially in the four suites from Rodeo. Dorati chooses a plodding tempo and the Detroit players seem to be just generally going through the motions. One can say the same about the rendition of the Dance Symphony, but better results are acheived in Appalachian Spring and Fanfare for the Common Man, where the digital sound really adds extra sparkle.

But her portrait of Violetta is a very dull one. One of Sutherlands' faults throughout her career was her diction. And in this recording it is no exception. At the most dramatic moments in the opera Sutherland isn't very convincing. She isn't being helped at all by the conducting of Bonynge, who fails to give real thrust to the drama. Pavarotti gives a splendid performance as Alfredo Germont.

Her recipes fit in well with her tasting notes, and the extensive listing of olive oil varieties and brands from different countries dovetails with her resources section. She give guidelines for a tasting. It is important in the beginning that Krasner gives us a warning on \\"the dark side of current olive production in countries of the European Union\\" relating to quantity production and environmental damage. There's also the question of possible corruption and chicanery in popular European oils. Perhaps the growing presence of high quality California oils is the answer.Food writer Elliot Essman's other reviews and food articles are available at www.stylegourmet.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information","review":"This book is a great source of information about olives and olive oils, The regions, types of olive oils. and generally good basic stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"good knife","review":"Great knife. really light doesn't add weight to your backpack.

The precision, expression, and energy present in the conducting, performance, and recording are unbeatable. This is the Cleveland Orchestra at the zenith of symphonic performance. It is not only the best recording of these two works, though there are many outstanding ones to be recommended, but it is a nearly flawless display by the Cleveland Orchestra and among the best of any symphonic recording ever produced! A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent recorded sound","review":"When I first purchased this disc, it was my first experience of Dvorak. To say I was impressed would be an understatement. I fell in love with Dvorak's music because of this disc. The Cleveland Orchestra has a long history of performing Dvorak well, and it really shows in this disc. Also, it is immediately clear this is a digital recording because the sound is unusually clear and defined. The final movement of the 8th is particularly spine tingling. At mid price it is a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"the spirited Czech","review":"As a high schooler first exposed to classical music by way of some scratchy family LPs of Tchaikovsky and Dvorak symphonies recorded--as memory serves--by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia, this spirited Czech composer has a special place in this reviewer's heart.Dvorak is nothing if not large and lyrical, not least in his symphonies 7 and 8, performed here by Christoph von Dohnanyi and the Cleveland Orchestra.Dvorak is capable of evoking in the unschooled listener's ears all four seasons, but especially Summer and Fall. It seems as though he was incapable of tossing off a symphony without at least one birdsong motif. The lushness of his lines brings one, as well, to autumnal sentiments, particularly when he sets himself down to writing an Adagio.This is the way of the Romanticist and Dvorak practically incarnates the type.This inexpensive CD is an excellent way to enjoy Dvorak or introduce him to someone who does not yet do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"$5.99 was borderline ok, but $10/month is too much","review":"The paper used to be $6/mo, but is now $10.

The most recent edition was really light on content - I read every article, except the sports section in 47 minutes - I am not a speed reader... Said Sports section took up a 1/4 of the file...

I occasionally purchase other newspapers on my Kindle. They include photos and other images as well as much more content. So, I know it is possible and the Times just chooses not to include everything.

He met a blind girl named Alicia and they bacame really close friends. Bobby and Alicia think that the electric blanket Bobby uses every night might have to do with this problem. So they go to Sears, where the blanket came from, and found information about the blanket, and all the people who had returned the blanket because of a problem.I think that this book was a very good book and I liked it a lot. I think the reason I liked this book so much was because it's realistic fiction, my favorite kind of book. Maybe 5th grade is a good grade to be reading this book because you have to understand everything in the book to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things Not Seen","review":"Things Not Seen is a very good book but it is not as good as a book like the Lord of the Rings or other books like this.

I would recommend this for a one time reader. Also to look for books by Andrew Clements, the auther. This book is about a boy who wakes up one morning and he is gone. He tells his parents and they are immediately on the scene.

Will he be able to find a way to get back to normal?At first I liked this book and thought it was intresting, however as I read farther into the book it got slow and not so intresting. I also thought it was hard to understand some parts of the book like when they tried to describe stuff scientifically and it wasn't relatable. So I would give this book two stars.

Simple enough. What does he do now? From this you may think that he goes out, pulls pranks, has fun and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, that may be what you'd expect, but you'd be suprised to fimd out that this story is a LOT mote than meets the eye. Through the story, the author emotionally connects with his readers on multiple levels. He shows the vulnerability each and every one of us has. He portrays that feeling of being invisible to others we sometimes have. He reminds us of all those adolescent feelings. The delicately interwoven symbolism is absolutely beautiful. It actually made me cry at the end. Don't worry, this book is also packed with adventure and science fiction, and will not disappoint.

He was in a tight spot because the cops searched his house but right before his mom made him clean everything so it looked like he hadn't been there.I think that it was a bad idea for Bobby to sleep with his electric blanket because he called someone who had the same blanket that became invisible from it and they became invisible and when he woke up he was visible but something wrong could have happed from doing that.

I wish I had not seen it or read it or been asked to waste words or original thought to describe it. Much like the \\"Witches of Waverly Place\\" is an appropriated age-appropriate version of a concept which had some value when done by it's original author (Sol Saks: Bewitched), so too was this book a supposed age-appropriate vehicle based on an appropriated concept (H.G. Wells: The Invisible Man).Two things are missing, or should I venture three: one, the fun; two any opportunity for the reader to add imagination; and three originality.As an added insult, and certainly no favor to our youth, the author depicts a Cal Tech Physicist (with among other honors a degree in Electrical Engineering) and a \`cutting edge' U of C professor of astronomy being impotent to apply themselves to problem solving as he draws them bound to an unapproachable quest for data."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever Written","review":"This is the best book ever written.

The plot is not advanced, and the book is cluttered by the repetition. I became frustrated with the lack of plot movement over entire chapters.

I was rather fearful when I first opened this that we were going to be handed typical dogma from one point of view or anther. This was not so. This is a wonderful book to enable you to open up a conversation with your child, teach him or her, and still leave room for the child to grow on their own. The book is well written, very well illustrated and treats a sensitive subject kindly. Children are always afraid of death and start asking about it at a very early age.

This book was HORRIBLE and incredibly BORING. The way she writes is just so mundane and many parts of the dialogue were completely unnecessary.

But even worse was when Mrs. Piggle Wiggle told the parents to plant radish seeds in the dirt so that the radishes would grow on the child. UGHHHH! So this was supposed to make the child want to take a bath. Well it worked in the story because they pulled the radishes (yes - pulled them and washed them)and the little girl is standing there on the last page all shiny and clean with the plate of radishes that they were going to then eat!

This little hedge trimmer is lighter than I expected, even with the heavy battery, and lasted longer on a full charge than expected. I managed to trim my waist high boxwoods and cut back some other bushes on one charge and still had enough juice in the battery to pop it into the blower and blow off the front sidewalk. Keep in mind I have a small yard in the city so we are not talking about maintaining 2 acres here. I was also impressed with the strength of the trimmer. It buzzed right through bush limbs up to 3/8 inch in diameter. I am impressed and pleased. I just hope it proves to be reliable in the long term."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Cut Cords!","review":"I agree with what was said in the earlier review. My own comparison is with the 10 year old B&D 22\\" electric that it replaced. I was impressed in that it gives up nothing in terms of power. I used it today for the first time on my 150' of hedges and lots of other bushes, especially hugh forsythias. It did all the trimming with no sign at all of battery fatigue. It's much smoother in operation than the old one. There are two things I didn't like about it. The forward handle is made so that it's only comfortable to hold at the top and not at the sides as in the old models. Also, as was said, there's not a lock-on switch. You have to hold the switch on. They did that, no doubt, for safety reasons, but that's probably where the fatigue enters. Many folks will rig up a clip to achieve the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary of reviews by people that just purchased this item!","review":"I have had this unit for almost a full year.

As it is now, the battery doesn't hold a charge just sitting on the shelf even though you might have charged it fully before putting it away. I just went to use it one last time... it lasted all of 5 minutes. Who wants to sit around waiting for 3 hours for a battery to charge and then bam!, get right to work before it loses any power... and I have tried that too... it konks out after about 20 minutes on a \\"full charge\\" now and the last ten minutes of that is not very powerful.

It worked great until the battery stopped accepting a charge after just a few uses. I have had this problem with other Black & Decker cordless products and vowed never to buy another from them (and have not had this issue with other cordless tool manufacturers). However, at the time this was the only cordless trimmer on the market with an 18V battery. I should have listened to myself. What a waste of money.*** Turns out it was not the battery that had the problem. It was the charger. It died after only a few uses! So, I unnecessarily bought a new battery. When that didn't charge, I got a Black & Decker rapid charger. Unexpected expense but now have two batteries and a rapid charger.

Edging a 15-foot-long walkway consumes one battery charge without completely cutting some edges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Battery Life","review":"I have a decent size yard in a subdivsion, but it's only about 1/2 an acre total (that's including the large chunk taken up by the house and the deck). So when I got this electric trimmer I thought, \\"No problem, I should have enough power to do at least the whole backyard or front yard\\". I was sadly disappointed to find out that even with two 18 volt battery packs I couldn't even get the smaller front yard completely done like I'd like to. I get about 10 to 15 mins of power out of each battery. I am also not thrilled with the self feeding line either. To me it stays way too short; I have to practically hold the trimmer so it's touching the ground. All and all I wish I hadn't bought this product and will be replacing it with either an electric one I can plug in or go back to gas powered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another throw away tool after 2 seasons","review":"Just be aware that while this can do basic trimming, it will need to be repaired or replaced very quickly. The plastic is as cheap as it can get for a unit that needs to hold any weight at all. The battery is heavy, and if you dropped it from so much as four feet, I'm sure it would break. That being said, I took great care of mine. Today I plugged in the battery to find that the charger is broken. I went and bought a new charger and low and behold, the battery is dead. Cheap, cheap, cheap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn from my experience","review":"This works well to begin with. Then after a few years, the plastic dries out on the shaft between the handle and the battery. Should it fall over at this point even on the lawn, it will crack and break in 2 with the wires inside being the only thing holding it together. It is virtually useless. I have owned 2 of them, one at a cottage and the other in town. Both of them broke in the same manner after 5 years. Too frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good product","review":"Works about as well as any corded trimmer that I have ever had. Battery life is no problem, it did my whole (large) yard with the two batteries included. since I have several other B&D; products, I could trim the whole neighborhood if I wanted to!Easy assembly too, and was delivered quckly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker 2018 is a great trimmer!","review":"I'm handicapped and have a hard time holding anything heavy. I got this trimmer because it's much lighter than our gas trimmer. I was looking to do some small clean up with it, but I'm amazed at just how much it will actually do. Even my husband likes using it. Yes the battery is short lived, especially using it on thicker items, but then there's a second battery! I'm very happy I made this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY better than Gas trimmers","review":"AMAZING! My Craftsman and Feather lite gas trimmers died and although I understand that things will stop working at some point, they both should have lasted longer than 1 year! I decided on something that didn't have a \\"yanking, yanking, and more yanking...\\" problem as my wife calls it, and saw the great reviews for this trimmer. I am AMAZED at how well it performed! Especially after I let my average sized lawns edges go for about 2 months and they really were a mess (thanks feather lite). Although I admit that my gas had more power, the comfort of switching a button on as well as this being super light just destroys the competition(gas powered ones at least). You know what, I have read that the batteries get weak after a while, but I would rather spend $35 for a new battery than a $100+ on a new trimmer each season! Definitely a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"exploded, so sent it back","review":"After a short time of usage of this underpowered device, the string spool and its covering exploded off and parts were lost making it impossible to reassemble. I sent it back for a full refund. I bought an earlier model of a Black & Decker cordless rechargeable trimmer in 2000 that was better powered and better built. Its rechargeable battery finally would not accept a charge anymore and was an integral part of the device so wasn't replaceable, leading to the current unfortunate purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"This weed trimmer is wonderful!","review":"In the past 10 years, I've tried several different companies' weed trimmers, all gas-powered. None delivered as promised, even though some were high-end models. We have a somewhat small yard, so I thought I'd try this electric trimmer. SO glad I did. It was easy to assemble, and it works great. As others have noted, it's not meant for huge lawns or to cut through thick branches. For routine lawn maintenance, it's perfect. The charge easily lasts long enough to complete a 2+ hour job. I have yet to need to switch to the spare battery to finish what needs to be done. DON'T try to bump-advance the line. It advances on its own perfectly, and bumping is just being rough on it for no reason. It very easily converts from trimmer to edger, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I got this trimmer a few days ago. Love it. I put it together in 5 minutes and have it used it a couple times already. It is light weight, but really does a great job. I love that it is so portable, no cords, no gas! I brought this to the cemetary and it did a fantastic job edging and cleaning up around the family headstones.The battery seemed to have no problem working for a good 1/2 hour and appeared to have plenty of charge left. I really like that this came with 2 batteries. Definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the smallest of yards","review":"If you're only looking after a few dozen square feet at your condo, get it. It'll be fine. If you have anything bigger, don't. While you get two batteries, it's not enough juice to get around the whole yard and I end up finishing the next day after the batteries are recharged. Additionally, the most sure-fire way of shutting the thing off is by hitting it with the butt of my hand. The power switch locks on (don't know why) and is a pain to unlock and shut the thing off, so I smack it. I've had mine ~4 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like a non-trimmer","review":"from buying this item new I never got more than 10-minutes of trimming with either battery. 10-minutes of trimming then 9-hours of charging. any other trimmer would be better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"I had read all the review complaining about battery life.

Auto string feed seems to work fine. Great for an edge trim but not for taking out serious weeds. I also have a corded trimmer, and a gas trimmer. The cord is a hastle, and the gas rig is almost too powerful and a lot of work to operate. The combination of tools is great. Once a month do the heavy stuff, and otherwise the Grass Hog does the work just fine with a whole lot less hassle.

I have given up now and hired someone to do the work.It takes about 8 hours to charge each battery and they only work for about 30 mins each. So for every 16 hours of charge time you get about an hours work. It is light weight and when the battery is charged works good, if you have a very small yard it may work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"When I received the Unit it didn't work properly. Even though it was refurbished in Mexico and inspected by at least 3 different people. Nobody noticed the line wouldn't stop coming out when running. After sending it back, I quickly received another that works just fine. All in all I'm a happy camper with the product. Decades ago Black and Decker was just another off brand people laughed at. Today I feel they build good, quality products. While the housing of the unit isn't real durable (Thin Plastic), I believe it was designed that way to lighten the weight. My last cordless weed whacker was a Black and Decker 12 volt. It ran great for 6 years before it gave up the ghost. Unlike that one, my new one has an adjustable telescopic shaft. I'm tall so no more bending over for me. It was everything I hoped it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, terrible battery, am returning it","review":"I had bought the little Earthwise (I believe the name is) trimmer, which feels like a toy and is not at all powerful.I thought I'd try a B&D; and see if it is any improvement.The B&D; has a bit more power, and is substantially heavier. Yet it is incredibly poorly built. No pieces fit together easily. And the battery charger is a joke-- you charge and charge and charge. I was waiting for the red light to turn green, but get this, it does NOT turn green. You just have to guess!Instructions are useless. Kind of a bad diagram and that's it.There are two batteries, which is something, but you will only get 13 minutes out of each one.SO... while it has a bit more power than the Earthwise product, and two batteries, I will stick with the Earthwise unless I find something better. At least the Earthwise usually gets me 15 minutes of cutting and weighs less. Oh, did I mention the B&D; is incredibly noisy? It sure is.Back to the store with it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"After using B&D; cordless polesaw ,had to buy 18v grass trimmer .No cord & no gas.No it's not a weed wacker but cuts most till you try cutting \\"wood like \\" stalks.Shoes & pants stay cleaner LOL.

A fully charged battery (overnight) lasts all of about 5 minutes and I can't even get half of my backyard trimming done (which is not a big yard). I think B&D knows this and in order to keep you from taking it back, there is actually verbiage in the instructions that state the batteries start having longer life after extended used. Well I've had this product for about 10 months and it only got worse. I went and bought a gas-powered Weed Eater today after finally giving up on what could have been a great product. Things I like about it are the \\"no bump\\" string feed and that it's pretty lightweight. Those features do me no good when the product doesnt last long enough to use to finish my yard though. Go with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for light duty/ homeowner use","review":"This unit works as good as my corded trimmer, but having the auto feed is great, since every bump-n-go trimmer I've ever had ended up becoming a bump-n-jam-stop-and-unjam-then-go trimmer.

It's lightweight and there is no fussing round with cords or mixed gas -just grab it and go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent improvements","review":"I had the previous model Battery operated Grass Hog and the battery/handle finally died after 5 years. The improvements in this model are wonderful. The old unit's battery was also the whole handle/switch assembly and made the unit a lot heavier than the new one. The new model's batteries are wonderful. After initial charge I did my entire front lawn (30'x60'), my driveway and around the garden bricks with one battery for all but the last 5 minutes. The adjustable length is another feature that makes this unit very comfortable to use for extended periods.

This unit does a pretty good job of trimming, I'll admit, but the batteries are absolutely worthless. Know doubt it comes with two because each one individually isn't going to last very long. I don't have a big yard, but it takes both batteries, fully charged, to trim half of it. I get about 10 minutes of use from each battery before it slows to the point the trimming line no longer cuts itself off.I've had this trimmer almost a year and a half.

Unless you can do all your trimming in under 15-20 minutes you will be unhappy with this product.

I have two batteries: the one that came with the unit and a spare. One battery is defective and only holds a charge for about 2 minutes tops. The other batter holds a charge for roughly ten minutes, which is just not long enough to get all of my weekly weed whacking done. I like the idea of a cordless, electric weed whacker.

They would not hold a charge and had very little power.I solved this problem by draining the batteries completly and then charging them.I put a battery in place in the unit, pushed and taped the on/off switch to on, and let the motor run until the battery was completly drained.After a fast charge (about 2 hours) the batter worked almost as good as new.I now make it a habit to drain the power completly from the batteries after about every other use then fully charge them.Freckles"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Trimmer w / Grass Hog","review":"OK.Listen to this :A friend showed me his GrassHog.

The one thing that I like about the version on Amazon is that is 18V. The ones at the big box stores are usually 12 V. I suggest getting this one. IF you have a B & D 18 V drill or other product you can exchange batteries. The reason that I gave it 4 stars is sometime the battery life is not long enough for big jobs. Thankfully I have three batteries becaue I have the drill and it came with 2. If you need more than 3 batteries you need a gas trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Purchase","review":"I read all the reviews prior to purchasing, the Trimmer / Edger is easy to use, light weight and very handy for a small yard.

This makes the unit totally useless. After 2 years one battery doesn't hold a charge and getting the front lawn edge-trimmed on a 1/5 of an acre city lot is impossible on one battery. I'm talking the front lawn on a 1/5 acre lot, remember. On 2 batteries there is no way possible that a person could get the front and back lawn trimmed on a 1/5 acre lot. Definately, poor build quality and underpowered. I'm a scientist telling you like it is. If you want the convienence of a rechargeable then buy a second set of batteries. To give you a better idea, I generally do the sides of my driveway, the sidewalk and curb then my front walkway. One battery will tackle 60% of this and the second battery would only let me start the back yard.Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Electric 12-Inch Grass Hog String Trimmer/Edger #NST2018"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product...Good Value!!","review":"Used it four times now exclusively for edging and no complaints.

It took me a while to get the hang of getting the edging done right but I keep getting it better and I,m still on my first roll of string too.

I highly recommend this for any woman who needs to do the yard trimming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight string trimmer.","review":"I use a gas powered string trimmer but my wife wanted something lightweight and less noisy so with many recommendations I chose this B&D Trimmer. It is fairly lightweight and is relatively quiet. With just one string (vs two on a gas machine) the trimming is slow.

I have to hit the battery to remove it as it sits so tight, after a year or so of having to do this the plastic handle is breaking. If only their moulding tolerances were better and they spent a bit more time creating something that will not break after a year or two this would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the cordless B&D Grass Hog","review":"I love this thing. I have an average size yard (8600 sq ft including my house) and I trim all around the foundation, all around my fenced backyard, both sides of the driveway, and the street curb every time I mow (well, almost every time). This trimmer never runs down before I'm finished. I always swap out the used battery for the freshly charged one before I start (it comes with 2 batteries that are interchangeable with all B&D 18V cordless tools). I do know that after a couple of years of regular use these batteries will begin to not hold a charge, then it's time to buy new ones. But the ease of use is great, and putting in a new roll of trimmer line is so easy, so it's worth it to me. I'm spoiled. Never again will I settle for an electric trimmer and screw around with the stupid extension cord, and never again will I deal with the aggravation of starting a gas trimmer. Cordless all the way for me, baby!!! I have the cordless leaf blower, too, and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still looking","review":"This worked okay the first year, for light duty. It charged out after about 45 minutes. The second year sometimes it would give the same charge(always charging up overnight),and sometimes it would give less.

I have yet to find a reliable trimmer and I have tried corded, gas, and now this one. Maybe it's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"B&D Electric String Trimmer","review":"I have had MANY yard/garden tools over the past thirty years.

I would feel guilty even selling it in a yard sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little yard tool","review":"I purchased this cordless trimmer in conjunction with a lawn mower. I needed something that I could use to edge on curves and cut areas that were inaccessible to the mower. I really like the cordless freedom and the instant power without gas. However, I am glad that this came with 2 batteries. I didn't think I had a large yard, but I guess all of the edging I needed to do added up to a lot. The fact that the trimming head swivels easily to edging mode, is my favorite feature. This particular trimmer has enough power to cut grass, but nothing much thicker. I had used a gas trimmer before, and that could tackle much thicker brush. This trimmer also has an automatic spool which is supposed to feed more line when it gets cut. Sometimes, however, I felt that the string was too short and was not feeding out enough string. I will need to take a look at that and see if it can be adjusted. Overall, I am happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not usual standard","review":"I have owned Black and Decker cordless products for years. My first was a Canadian made cordless mower which lasted 11 years with year round California use, then a US/Canada model which is in its 7th year. I bought a Black and Decker cordless trimmer which had US and Canadian addresses on the box,but it has been returned twice when the battery failed to charge or hold a charge...it is made of light plastic instead of the tough rubbery plastic in the Canadian/US made mower. I am surprised that it is made in China.(not Canada or USA). I have nothing against China,but the Canadaian products were much better quality. Why not stick to them. This experience turned me away from Black and Decker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"This trimmer works like a charm. It is plenty good for trimming needs around the home. The automatic string feature is nice. I was always use to having to tap the trimmer on the ground to advance the string. This you don't have to do anything.

Adequate power for trimming, not powerful enough to cut an edge in hard soil in the \\"edger\\" mode. Nice design features, well-balanced, but the batteries do not hold a charge after repeated use.

They are also heavier.This is a nice little unit with 2 batteries (which I need for my yard). This unit does the job for light trimming and edging. It edges nicely with the little wire guide that you flip down when edging. All in all a good bargain priced cordless trimmer with adequate battery power for the average yard. It won't cut through any thick weeds or grass because it's just not powerful enough. It also has only 1 string but the automatic feed works great (no bumping). Charging takes about 10 hours for each battery.I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love how it just turns on without any strain at all","review":"I love how I can just push a button and turn it on plus how I don't have to stretch the string anymore. One battery lasts for my entire lawn ONLY IF you don't let the lawn grow too long such that you have to edge the grass to death. Other than that, it works great...still not AS powerful as a gas trimmer where you can rev things up more than you can with this one, but the convenience and ease of use makes up for taking a wee bit longer to trim my lawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad idea","review":"Purchased the 18 volt cordless B&D weedeater; very disappointed; another bad performer for B&D, but nice idea; it just doesn't do the job unless you want to work about 5 mins at a time and it doesn't seem to have enough torque to cut more than grass. Very disappointed. I tried it once and returned; what a hazzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"I was used to a gas trimmer but purchased this model because I was sick of pulling my arm off every spring. It does not have the power of a gas trimmer so it does take a bit longer, but it will work for most smaller yards.

The two batteries can't hold enough charge to accomplish that small feat in one day. And today, after less than a year, it blew up and the motor caught fire. Do yourself a favor and buy another brand cheap $20 electric weed eater with a long extension cord. We had bought one to replace this one and were only using this one to reach where our extenstion cord wouldn't reach for the other.

My biggest complaint is the vibration- not really noticable while working, but my hands are tingling for some time after I'm done. Next cutting I will wear some thick gloves and see if that helps.

Disc 1 is the 9-track 1987 RCA budget compilation \\"The Best There Is,\\" while disc 2 is her 1989 Columbia album \\"White Limozeen.\\" While there are plenty of love songs and plenty of hits to be found, it is just a strange release, and it's quite apparant that no one put much thought into it at all. It would be more worthwhile to pursue proper releases or compilations from either RCA/BMG or Columbia/Sony.

Given that it is one of my favorite CDs in my collection (2,000 and growing), I must have laid it in another room. The other reviewer sings the praises of the Symphonic Dances. Ashkenazy's handling of the Isle of the Dead is no less magical. His delay at the climax of the second theme is breathtaking, and the handling of the Dies Irae canon verges on the mystical. That same elasticity comes into play with the Symphonic Dances. The second movement in particular benefits from the fact that Ashkenazy treats it *as* a dance: one can feel the give and take between the partners of conductor and orchestra.Since I cannot find the one disc, I'm taking this opportunity of ordering a second ... and in letting others know that this disc -- now at mid-price! -- is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book let down by poor support","review":"Visual Basic.Net in 60 Minutes reads well from the beginning.

After completion of the text, I was left confused. My problems with the book:1. This book is poorly organized. I realize that this is an introductory book, and some people are looking for walk through examples, but the book needs to cover the basics better.2. The book has awful coverage of the different DHTML implementations in Netscape and Explorer. Besides acknowledgement of the differences, the author does little to explain items.3. The examples don't work. The typical user of this book is a beginner and would not be able to debug the examples. This is terribly irresponsible behavior by the publisher.

The writers were pressured to get a product to the stores before any other publishing house got their books out. The result is a book that provides very little substance for a five hundred page book.While not coming with a CD, the publishers provide a companion website to compliment the book. That website? One file with the examples from the book, for the Mac or the PC. Yes, it is cheaper than slapping everything on a CD and jacking the price of the book up $10, but, like other \\"CD included!\\" books, there is nothing of value at the site. The reason why? The examples just don't work.\\"Teach Yourself How To Code Something That Looks Like Dynamic HTML (But Really Doesn't Work) In A Week\\" is a good buy if the corner store is out of Duraflame logs.

These guys don't understand what they are talking about. Much of the book is filled with confusing talk about the WWW consortium and how they might effect the HTML document object model, but little time is given to clearly explaining how things actually work. When the authors are not babbling on about vague abstract object models, they present poor examples and dig very deep about how these examples represent something useful.

However, it is hard to find a good team for this music. I think Mars and Uranus require a brass section of Wagnerian proportions, whereas Mercury and Saturn are closer to Ravel or Debussy. Karajan in Berlin was a fine exponent and so was Dutoit in Montreal. While Solti can naturally give excitement to this music, he is not as adept with bringing out the shading of the lighter movements. Especially, at the end of Saturn where Karajan, Dutoit, and Mehta have used a more spacious tempo, Solti seems uninvolved and determined to get the movement overwith. The recording quality, while good for its period, is inferior to that of newer versions of this work. There are plenty of good digital versions available, and unless Solti as conductor is a must, other versions do more justice to this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRAN VERSION","review":"Un hermoso disco de música británica, con una lectura de gran vitalidad de Sir Georg, como es habitual.
