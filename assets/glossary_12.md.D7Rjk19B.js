My chiropractor told me to start taking Oil of Oregano everyday. That was in 1998.Olympian Labs is the only Oil of Oregano, that I have found, that is not combined with Olive Oil!! I have used 5 drops of Olympian Labs Oil of Oregano in a cup of Everyday Detox tea and a Liver Guard Vitamin every day since 1998 and this past year, for the first time, my liver fuction count was NORMAL!!

It would never have occurred. This Australian writer attempts to depict the American frontier but fails miserably. The dialect doesn't ring true. The characters are one dimensional. Several times Holmes makes Watson the butt of his jokes. He even sells him down the river, something Holmes would never do. The attempts at humor border farce and are tiresome and overdone. It's formulaic and predictable. It falls short of delivering what Holmes fans have come to expect from stories written about him and Watson."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprising Pleasure","review":"With the hokey cover to this book, I had expected to be disappointed.

This could have been very corny, but the author does a good job making the tale credible. I really enjoyed the humor interspersed throughout the story. Clearly, the author had fun writing this book. Having read a lot of Sherlock Holmes pastiches, I was pleased to find that the author kept true to the characters of both Holmes and Watson, while developing them both a bit more. Unlike one of the other reviews, I did not find the relationship between Holmes and Sarah to be jarring. Rather, I found it credible. Holmes still managed to be rude and superior.

This one seems to be much more of a band effort rather than simply a solo project for Flower Kings bassist Jonas Rheingold. Former Flower Kings drummer Zoltan Csorsz is still here, but the rest of The Flower Kings basically just serve in guest spots on a few tracks. The band, on this one, is a four piece with vocalist Goran Edman and guitarist Krister Jonzon rounding out the lineup. Overall I think this is a better album than the bands debut. The album covers similar musical territory with all of the musicians turning in top notch performances. The album is a mix of progressive rock vocal pieces and instrumentals. The two instrumentals on the album \\"Do U Tango?\\" and \\"Hindby\\" are both very good. The vocal tracks are all solid as well. If you like The Flower Kings, The Tangent or other similar bands you would probably eat this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD Wouldn't Play","review":"I opened this CD & immediately put it in my CD player and it wouldn't play the first track.

The text itself was easy to follow and logical, but the derivations of the equations and finding the solutions to the diff eq's were rather brief with few intermediate steps. It does, however, explain the applications of the mathematics to other fields such as physics, engineering, even biology. It even includes a few computational computer programs to illustrate the applications in computer science. It was an ok book to read, but was weak in the area of \\"teaching from the blackboard.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Elementary Differential Equations","review":"I found this book too steep for my abilities. I was attracted to its small size, for I hoped that this would provide an easy way to understand DE's. However, I should have remembered what Pythagoras told the anxious king: \\"There is no royal road in mathematics.\\" This book is a case in point. The reason for its brevity are that its demonstrations are terse, and it provides only occasional answers to the problem sets. Moreover, I find it asumes that the reader is an astute mathematician.The book might serve as a good refresher (see other review comments), but not a sufficient introductory text for someone with no previous experience in DE's or at the very least, someone who does not have a strong mathematics background. I gave this book 2 stars and not 1, only because part of the problem might be me.

This disc was his second post-Genesis album released in 1979.The question I had about purchasing this album again was \\"is it worth it?\\". If you are an audiophile wondering if you will hear the difference, I suggest that you will. Most of Steve Hackett's material was well recorded but the Japanese releases were able to capture the best of that for reasons I don't fully understand but have heard upon ownership of them.Bottom line: this is one of Steve's two best.

The recipes are simple enough for children without compromising quality of finished product (example: the author teaches you how to make your own beans rather than opening a can, so there is a focus on using whole/fresh ingredients). There is a lot of good information about food, cooking, and safety. There is a large, attractive picture of almost every recipe and line illustrations of how to do certain steps that may be unfamiliar.I think the book is at a level appropriate for about 9 and up.

The staples are Italian, French, and Chinese/Asian. As someone with German heritage, I would like to have seen some German recipies, but overall the recipes are a wonderful mix of easy-to-understand and follow recipes with pictures.

Instead, his interpretation and exposition of scripture was so flagrantly misleading and misconstrued, that it had the precise opposite effect on me! His scholarship -- that is, pure, objective scholarship -- was so poor, so lacking, that I couldn't get past it to the truths he was trying to elucidate. If one is NOT familiar with basic scriptural texts, this book may be of interest. But for anyone with a basic understanding of the New Testament in general, and the Gospels in particular, this book will come across as either sophomoric, or worse, deceptive -- actually an attempt to make a point at all cost.

The violin concerto with Tasmin Little is a rhapsodic single movement with a lot a variations and thematic transformations that make the concerto a treat to listen to as it was written at the he was a the height of his composing career. It is like a romantic tone poem rather than traditional concerto.The piano concerto although written much earlier and also in a single movement. is also worth a listen/ I was also quite entranced by the Two movements for cello and piano which was also beautiful. I believe that this CD bellongs in the collection of all classical music lovers.Please excuse typos I have neuroogic disease/"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste","review":"This book does not adequately prepare anyone for the actual exam, which consists of more research material comprehension and translation than the basic material offered in the book.

I give him that.The girl who played Sadie I wanted to smack the smirk off her face.Where was the court scene? There was no court scene. In the 1976 version those court scenes were magic.Also the scene where Sharon, Voytek, Steven, Abigail, Leno and Rosemary (The victims) were a bit too graphic for me. I almost threw up seeing Abigail getting stabbed to death. I couldn't bare seeing the Sharon character getting killed.It's an OK movie but not beter then the 76' version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dis-information and Mis-directed","review":"Very inaccurate film that makes Linda Kasabian more innocent than she was and ventures into areas that are almost insulting (allusions to Sharon Tate plans to cheat on Polanski while she is pregnant).This version makes no effort to capture the era with set design, dialogue, and even worse the abysmal soundtrack making it seem like a cheap attempt to sell DVD's with the fascination of true crime films based on serial killers (Fincher's ZODIAC being the only top rate film among them)The Van Bebber film is still the best FILM RE-ENACTMENT of these events. The only thing his version lacked was hiring better actors (which seems to add more character to his version and that is something that is required for this subject)and that is the only thing this film has going for it. Casting Jerry (her last name eludes me at the moment) from MR.SHOW as Squeeky Fromme is genius and the only thing that prevented a 1 star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really didn't care for it","review":"its only my opinion but I didn't care for it no action, mostly talk of people talking about him and you never hear his side, but as I stated it's only my opinion every one got one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap","review":"This film blew chunks.

It was absolutely horrible. I kept hoping for a commercial interruption and remembered it was on DVD. The acting was abysmal. Absolutely horrendous. Charles Manson's life and times are almost hypnotic in their base interest. How then could I be checking my watch ever 2 or 3 minutes to see how much longer I had to watch? At one point I swear, the clock actually ticked backwards. Don't buy this, don't rent it, don't borrow it. AWFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one!","review":"I've seen the original several times and loved it as a fantastic how'd-they-catch-'em. I bought this one by mistake, thinking it was the original, and was very disappointed in it, regardless of wether it was the one I intended to buy or not. The title of this one should be \\"The Lives and Times of the Manson Family.\\" It's not good sociology or police procedural. I really don't give a rip about the Family except as the cause of the murders, the manhunt, the near-misses in apprehension, the ultimate catch, and finally the trial. Except for the scenes of the Family, the movie completely lacks focus and drama as well as being a waste of talent in Bruno Kirby's and Mark Snow's cases. Deserves to go in the trash bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fight the Good Fight by Opposing Unnecessary Remakes","review":"People, let us keep in mind that in addition to not being very good in its own right, that this TV movie's greatest sin is that they are ripping off one of the greatest made-for-TVs ever and had absolutely nothing new to add to the story.In fact, simply by casting milksop Jeremy Davies as Manson shows that no one involved with this remake had any idea what Vincent Bugliosi was communicating about Charlie in Helter Skelter (ranking with TC's In Cold Blood as our paramount true crime stories).Just one of many sins committed in this rip-off. Let us hope someone with some idea of Manson Family values will make a documentary/update of this story.

Pretty damn gruesome, by the way. The actress who portrays Linda Kasabian is very good here.Writer/director John Gray does fine work.

You learn about what the Manson family did from their point of view. The details were interesting because they told you what had happened during the murders and how Manson became more demanding from his followers. This movies shows how the family started down their road of destruction. Nothing like the book or previous movie which was from Bugliosi's notes. This movie is solely from the Manson family and Krenwrinkle's perspective.

Ronny Marshall's review is \\"right on\\" because I thought the same thing, the person playing Sharon didn't begin to capture a 1/10th of her beauty. The '76 version is so much more suspenseful and captures the true feeling of the time and the crime. This new one is a joke and at times made me want to laugh. What a sorry actor playing Vincent B.! He made me want to laugh everytime he spoke with that accent which Vince doesn't have. Really a huge disappointment but then remarks ususally are. The guy playing Manson was also laughable after Railsback's portrayal. Don't bother with this movie.

Graffman was truly enraptured and inspired as Ormandy did. This team made the most incandescent and Imperial performances of these two Piano Concertos Two and Three played with minor frequency than the First one.Finally these Pictures are authentically sparkling and superbly performed.

This is just a re-hash of the few issues of the magazine published without them. The writing is a weak imitation of Ackerman's lively style, ripping off patented puns like \\"You Axed for It\\" and \\"Beast Wishes\\". Even the cover is a 5th rate copy of a painting from the original magazine. I hear the current publisher of this volume lost a lawsuit for stealing Ackerman's nom de plume, \\"Dr. Acula\\". The Famous Monsters of the '50s and '60s was a cool phenomenon once, but the '90s incarnation is a pointless anachronism, since only nostalgic baby-boomers like myself are interested, and there are so many superior efforts dealing with the subject on the market now. Famous Monsters without Forry Ackerman is like a Beatles reunion without John, Paul, George, or Ringo."},{"rating":"1","title":"High priced T.P. !!","review":"As the prior reviewer indicated this item is living proof that everything that Ray Ferry touches seems to contract a case of irritable bowel syndrome hence my suggestion that this product would probably make great TP.

It was shipped very fast and I would buy from the seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Liltingly Musical","review":"First, the thought of yet another version of the Well Tempered Clavier in my collection seemed not merely unnecessary, but truly pointless. But how wrong I was, and how delighted I am with this magnificent performance and production. It is clear, crisp, and unslurred by the artificial colorings of the pedal. The musicality of it comes through definitively and liltingly. It stands head and shoulders above the other recordings I have. I will never come to the point, as Andras Schiff has, of being able to play this set of four CDs from memory(!), but I will definitely be listening to it far more than the others I have. A lifetime of practicing has paid off stunningly for Andras Schiff. This is a real accomplishment, and makes this precious achievement of Bach's all the more eternal. His feet may be flat on the floor, but his fingers are dancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and Clean, but short of profound","review":"I have difficulty summing up what I felt about this highly-marketed release by Andras Schiff. It's honest and there's a consistent aesthetic point of view applied between each pair of preludes and fugues. This, for me, makes it a nice \\"reference recording,\\" one you can always come back to.An apt comparison is the set by Edward Aldwell; I think Schiff's is better. Compared to Jarrett's book 1 on ECM, this is much better. But I also like the idea of using Bach's music to inject a little creativity into the performance. Fredrich Gulda, therefore, is a favorite of mine on piano. Schiff's own nuances are far more subtle, but they are there, at least in enough of the performances.That's why I'd say they are, as as set, short of profound... instead they're honest, well-done, and well-captured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally rewarding experience, recommended","review":"This was a Christmas present for myself, after hearing excerpts on various NPR stations.Although I've been enjoying the Glenn Gould recordings for decades, along with Wanda Landowsky's harpsichord recordings, I find myself frequently replaying this version.There's new life in the performance, previously-overlooked details emerge, and the sound quality is thrilling on good equipment.

One of the sins of this movie is that it has no pace, this movie has no tension, this movie has no characterization. I watched this movie with hope but it has no hope. I really think you should not even look at this movie. Dont rent it. Dont buy it, definitely. So many things were wrong with this movie.

Anyone who has been stuck in a video game knows the frustration of watching this movie. With no sense of moving forward at all, the main characters walk around in circles watching people die. The acting could have been better (there were some good points there, notably the dude at the end). The sound is unforgivably bad - I actually missed dialog because I couldn't hear the actor. The budget for this movie should have at least been big enough to include a microphone and HD camera. Redubs could have been put in using free software tools available to anyone. The plot has nothing to do with H.P. Lovecraft, fear or anything of interest. I have been very impressed with some indie, low budget films in the past, which makes this one even more of a failure in my eyes.I hope the crew had fun making the movie, because no one will enjoy watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent this one if you must!","review":"This really is a bad movie... and not in a good way.

One of the most annoying things about the film was the use of broken toys, Halloween masks and decorations as if they were occult objects.

They had some things that looked creepy to conservative Christians but did not surround themselves with cheap Halloween junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. That may seem a bit harsh, but it is completely deserved. The plot is basically no-existent, and the movie begins well into \\"the story\\".

It is a shame that Crone was forced by Columbia University Press to write this kind of general survey. The book only repeats what has been know for more than 50 or 60 years. Scholars such as Laoust have already given us a much better account of these issues. In fact, one feels that this is almost a translation of Laoust's book. Importantly, there is no political theorizing in this work, only description.This is really nothing but a basic and not so practical textbook that pretends to be scholarship.

But everything is virtually the same--the text and the recipes! The only difference is that there are a few Indian recipes tossed in, and there is less interesting information on the countries. The format is also less convenient.

It is a good introduction to soul. Shapiro is well-informed about the music. I found interesting information about the Meters, Ann Peebles and James Carr some of the unsung heroes of soul. The main criticism of the book is that it includes lots of greatest hits selections. I think this really isn't fair because in the 50s and 60s soul artists concentrated on hit singles not albums. Shapiro is right to focus on the Greatest Hits as the best works. Remember it is just an introduction and if you really like the music you can start investigating the back catalogue. Shapiro's book is a good starting point to investigate the wonderful world of soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm perplexed","review":"I bought this on the strength of the glowing reviews here, and I can't figure it out.This is an awful recording. Ms. Peyroux has no musicality whatsoever, is often off key, has no sense of phrasing...The band is competent, not great, but vastly superior to Ms. Peyroux. But I don't buy a vocalist's recording to listen to the band.I cannot fathom how this artist has received the reviews she has. Her voice may be an attempt at a carbon copy of Holiday, but she has none of the depth, and none of the empathy for the material, of the original.Save your money. This one joins Jane Monheit and Stacy Kent in the \\"huge disappointment\\" category."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song","review":"Her cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Dance Me To The End Of Love\\" rivals the original. But the rest of the album is pretty bland. She has a very good voice that's almost just like Billie Holliday but not quite. Her backing band is very good but just not good enough. Although many people hate her, Norah Jones had found her own voice and that's why her first album was so great. Madeleine Peyroux has yet to find her own voice, both literally and figuratively speaking. If she does, she'll become a much more accomplished artist. But until then, save yourself the money and just download the Cohen cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"will she ever be herself?","review":"There is not doubt that this CD will be a commercial success. She sounds so nice. However, she is simply Billie Holiday. You are not listening to anything new. She will be nice to listen to live but will she ever become herself in time? If Peyroux happens to get out of Billie Holidays influence, then will anybody listen to her? Very nice but sad at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good CD well worth the money","review":"When I first heard Peyroux on the radio and what was being said about her by the DJs, I knew I had to get the CD.

Unfortunately, they were reigned in far too tight and for me the music never really lifted or \\"took off\\". I don't know if MP only sings ballads but it is a pity that she did not up the tempo a bit now and again. The arrangement for \\"Careless Love\\" in particular did not work for me, whilst interesting for perhaps the first refrain, to maintain the strict thumping tempo throughout was a mistake.

That seems to be Madeline Peryoux plan. Unfortunately for her she picked Billie Holiday whose voice is so distinctive that I, who am not knowledgeable about Billie Holiday, can tell the difference. Not only that her singing irritates my ears which is weird because the few times I listened to Billie Holiday I enjoyed it, but Billie also had the ability to connect with the listeners, an ability Ms. Peryoux lacks.

When I put it on the cd-player and let it flow on, it immediately stunned me.As a singer, I thought, I would pass my life getting over identity crisis if I had my voice even barely similar to Elvis' one, or Elton John's one, or Freddy Mercury's one.Well, that's it: Madeleine Peyroux sings exactly (E-x-a-c-t-l-y) as Billie Holiday. My God, this is not a good thing.I mean, this is probably the only reason for the release of this cd: Billie Holiday is old enough to be forgotten and renewed, and this young lady could be the new Lady Day.But, in my opinion, it's so much better to prefer the original version to the... remix. And Madeleine Peyroux it's just an insignificant copy of the late, great jazz woman: Billie Holiday.There are so many Billie's cd out there, buy some of them and enjoy... more and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Billie Holiday impersonation ever!","review":"Do you love ripoff artists such as Lenny Kravitz and Norah Jones? Does true originality disturb you and drive you to seek cover in the soft womb of corporate created fluff marketed as the real deal? Then you're in for a treat with this album! Not even Rich Little could do Billie better. Texture of voice AND delivery expertly stolen without a qualm, but without any of the icky sincerity and authentic pain of the original. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"anesthetized on a table","review":"It took her 8 years to come up with this?

It's a good thing she's not a doctor.The arrangment on Between The Bars is fantastic - I would pay good money to hear just about any other singer cover it.This album is coma inducing. If Dionne Warwick and Karen Carpenter were cloned into one female jazz singer, this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven and more~","review":"I agree with all the kudos from the other reviewers.

I drift off to dreamland to it every night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"Madeleine Peyroux's voice is just perfect. It's the kind of voice you just desperately want to listen to--she could be singing the dictionary and I'd be enthralled. But of course, she's working from a brilliant and interesting combination of songs here so it really is a wonderful CD.\\"Dance Me To the End of Love,\\" \\"Between the Bars,\\" and \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go\\" are my absolute favorites. In each, Peyroux brings the song to her--you temporarily forget that anyone else has ever sung it. \\"Lonesome\\" is particularly good; just a subtle change in her voice and it all comes together amazingly. A lot of the time I wonder what some wonderful song would sound like in a female singer's voice. Now I ponder more specifically: what would it sound like if Peyroux sang it?Her French is wonderful and so CLEAR which is a blessing for those of us with high school French, who nevertheless want to understand the words.A necessary CD. If only to put you to bed with sweet dreams every night. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Imitation Here!","review":"While tempted to write a song by song analysis of this CD, I will show restraint and simply comment on the Holiday imitation complaints. As a collector of vintage Holiday, I actually had to listen for the similarities before I made the connection at all. Some of the phrasing is perhaps similar, (think any male singer in the late 40s and Sinatra) but Peyroux sings with her own voice, hits the standards with a new and often superior interpretation, with a band that is quite competent. A bit of repetition on the cymbals left me with a sense of one sound fits all, but Peyroux herself is a delight. If you love Holiday this CD won't give a Rich-Little-like shiver. With the rest of the music industry still trying to sound like Aretha Franklin, this is a relief. Peyroux has a bright future, send us more like her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionless Billie Holiday Wannabe","review":"While Ms. Peyroux's voice bears an undeniable resemblance to that of Billie Holiday, her singing is another matter entirely.

I just want to underline that, even if you use to look for new wonders, this is a voice you won't find easily in your everyday searches. It's something you can almost only find by accident beacause it's so rare. It happened to me when I found it in the Rainer Ptacek tribute (1997 - The Inner Flame) when Madeleine's voice hit me like an instant classic coming from another level.

A nice re-styled 1930's blues-jazz music. It has a sultry relaxed feel that is absent in current music. It almost feels like the antidote for today's sound. The bad: Most of the MP3 songs I bought are distorted. None of my other Amazon downloads are like this. I doubt the CD has the same problem or people would not rate it so highly.

Same problem on different players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another pleasing effort","review":"If it hadn't been 8 years between albums, would Madeline be mentioned in the breath as Norah Jones? She certainly is equally as talented and she has that Billie Holliday thing going for her. She truly shines on covers by Leonard Cohen(Dance Me To The End of Love) and Bob Dylan(You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go)and adds some of her own stuff as well as tracks by W.C. Handy and the late Elliott Smith. I have just one minor complaint about this album. The arrangements don't add to the music and the album as a whole. They sometimes seem to act as merely sweetener for Madeline's voice. That could be the fault of Larry Klein, though. Recommended for Norah Jones, Diana Krall and Julia Fordham fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"GrownUpMusic.com recommended!","review":"It's kind of spooky the way this woman channels Billie Holiday. The jury is divided: some argue that if you want to hear Billie Holiday, just put on some Billie Holiday. But we hold to the belief that good music is good music, and you can never have enough. Born in Georgia, raised in New York and Paris, Peyroux is this year's Norah Jones (she even penned a song with Norah collaborator Jesse \\"Don't Know Why\\" Harris). But this CD has a little more whiskey in it than Norah's records. It has the sweet, sweet stink of juke joints and barbecue and old \`78s (without the scratches). Songs range from Holiday standards like \\"No More\\" and \\"I'll Look Around\\" to Josephine Baker's \\"Jai Deux Amours.\\" But Peyroux truly shines on contemporary covers of Leonard Cohen, Elliot Smith and especially Bob Dylan's \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"PREJUDICE","review":"As a huge fan of brian lumley, I was extremely disturbed by this book.

I'm also relatively comfortable with routine computer use but I'm by no means an expert.Its pretty easy to set it on automatic and take wonderful quality photos. Getting them onto the computer is not too bad using the nikon 4 software (once you figure out the complicated order). The encorporated cumulus software and fractal software are really tough to load much less figure out. There really isn't much user friendly text included to help out. Nikon support was pretty good but with regards to much of the software all they can do is refer you to the software manufacturer.Don't misunderstand, I really do like the camera.You will however need extra memory and you'll probably end up buying the recargeable battery system as well.

Nikon, the company, is not very helpful and sometimes even rude. The view finder makes it difficult to make closeup pictures in bright light and the automatic focus works great on large items. Almost impossible to take pictures of lacey items like delicate flowers cause it does not have enough to focus on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pleased customer","review":"I am very disappointed in Nikon.

He's from the mega production duo Holland & Dozier who were behind top hits from Motown bands like The Supremes & The Four Tops. His hit song 'Going Back To My Roots' was a dancefloor smash hit when it was 1st released back in 1977 (What a year!) & was redone by several dance bands such as Odyssey, but none lived up to the original 10 minute extended version found on this album. All the songs are incredibly well produced. My other favorite song on this album is 'What Am I Gonna Do 'Bout You (Girl)'. I think you'll agree, this is Motown at it's finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighters in Black and White","review":"First impression that this book creates is the thoroughness and dedication to the subject.

Jon Guttman duly discussed the Slovak air forces. I do hope that he re-issues the book, in color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Hot Band","review":"The band *really* tears it up on this DVD.

There the novelty ends, however, and the book's enjoyability takes a big plunge. The novel is filled with cliche, cartoonish characters, and the writing is at best tolerable and at worst plain bad. There are so many errors of grammar and logic that I'm surprised an errata sheet wasn't provided. Perhaps this was just the author's first draft which TSR shamelessly rushed to press in pursuit of a quick buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flint deserves better","review":"This type of writing really shames the whole fantasy genre. It's an embarrassment to Douglas Niles, who is capable of much better writing; it's an embarrassment to TSR/Wizards of the Coast, who really detract from the quality of Krynn by allowing such drivel to be published; and it's an embarrassment to Mr. Fireforge, who deserves a better novel.

This book presupposes that animal research helps people, which evidence shows is faulty at best. 92% of all new drugs that pass animal testing go on to fail in human clinical tests because they are too toxic or ineffective. Of the remaining 8% that pass the human tests, HALF are later withdrawn from the market because of side effects (sometimes lethal) that animal tests did not predict.

This book has major verbal bloat, and is unfortunately myopic in it's focus on Britain. The authors have the arrogance to label a myriad of leaders from history as lacking in intelligence, without the backbone or clarity to define it or state why. Although the book does cover the basic facts, one gets the impression the authors were more impressed with their own observations and verbosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded and extremely boring.","review":"I normally love stories of the Second World War, which is what prompted me to buy and read this 1,360 page book. I thought I would never get through it. Though the authors did a good job on the atomic bomb section, the rest was pure drivel, a lot of speculation, unnecessary background information, and enough to put an owl to sleep at night. There are many great World War II books out there, but this is certainly not one of them. The inserted maps are pretty good, but other than that, the only thing good I can say about this book is that thank goodness I finished it.

I chose this book over sleep several nights, Have your dictionary nearby as you read, and do read this book if the subject interests."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unbalanced Account","review":"A fully satisfactory one-volume history of the Second World War may be an impossibility, but this tome doesn't come close. Its worst faults are its weird misallocations of space (pages and pages on British social developments and Japanese politics in the 1930's, for example, but only a single chapter on the Russian front) and its very summary treatment of most military developments. As a result it is not very useful as a reference. Although the political and diplomatic history of the war is emphasized, the analysis of this area is disjointed and undeveloped, bogged down by details that are never fitted into a framework. Lesser faults are sloppy writing and editing in many places and a preachy and moralistic \\"PC\\" tone that misses no opportunity to denigrate the Allies and especially the United States. The only recommendation, and this is only for buffs, is that you may well find some factual nuggets that you were previously unaware of."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Disappointment.","review":"I thought this history of WWII was disappointing. It has way too many minute details about unimportant British details. It is unbalanced about the most important battles and unbalanced in telling the story of WWII. The book is a bit pedantic. It feels self serving in the approach. Hypocritical, it mostly justifies the British bombing efforts in Europe that drove the war's mass bombings and was dubious in effectiveness, but then calls the devastating bombings of Japan \\"mass murder.\\"There are better books than this on WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent additon to the collection of any fan or DJ","review":"While I generally tend to find remix collections rather tedious, I still feel the need to recommend this CD. It's a necessity, of course, for any Rosetta Stone completist, and club DJ's will likely find it nice to have an alternative to the album versions of \\"Adrenaline\\" and \\"The Witch\\". The various remixes of these two club hits are still easily recognizable as the songs from which they were culled, but bear just enough distinction in comparison to the originals to warrant spending the money.The shining star of this EP, however, is the cover of \\"Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves\\". This track is, again, very easily recognizable, but the band has brilliantly applied their own sound to it without detracting from it a bit - personally, I'd consider it just as dance-worthy as either of the other two songs featured here."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD PRODUCT","review":"WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! this wire is so bad and delicate will break as soon as you take it out of the package this is the first review i ever wrote in my life i just had to write this-- the product is so bad the company should b sued for making it"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Shielding and very noisy cable !","review":"I installed the original Q-see 100ft(Q-See QS100B) and 50ft cable on my 4 cameras and all suffer huge noise especially on the 100ft one.

It is a well done retelling of the story, but with all the misogyny, death and betrayal of the original -- with the added visual impact of lots of red blood and dead bodies. So, not for young children -- but enjoyable for adults! The story focuses more on the Victorian plot rather than the mathematics, but I did not feel I had wasted my evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll wait for the movie as opposed to the film","review":"Great graphics, terrible story line.

I thought its treatment of females, subservient creatures with shrill piercing voices, was added by the filmmaker. Pulled the book off the shelf and started reading and found it's all from the book! Which is gratuitously contemptuous of women who are called the Frail Sex that are \\"wholly devoid of brainpower.\\" And a whole lot of other put-downs.The film follows the book closely, and both are badly flawed.

So why not read a funny, fabulous, book about it.Poop grabs your attention from the funny cartoons on the dust jacket to the smeary brown streaks on the inside covers.Nicola Davies knows how to create a lure for that reluctant reader, to engage, entertain, and educate.The young reader gets so caught up in the hilarious illustrations and the absorbing, fascinating text, that he doesn't even realize he's reading and learning effortlessly. And loving it.I highly recommend this book for readers of all ages. Check out Extreme Animals also, another of the Nicola Davies gems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book From A Great Medic","review":"George Steffenson's book is a non stop thrill ride of being a medic in the NYC 911 system. As a rookie medic myself, it was awesome to see that a great medic like george, felt the same way as i do sometimes on calls! I couldn't put the book down; every story is captivating and different, it was also really cool to see how the East Village was back then.

Experienced professionals will find some solace in hearing from another veteran that Buff jobs lose their appeal and excitement over time. Educators and historians will also find Buff to Burnt useful. George's real life cases could be modified for patient assessment drills, simulation lab scenarios, or mass casualty drills. George also captures historical treatments for major trauma and cardiac arrest. Medicine is dynamic and some aspects of emergency care are handled very differently now than they were fifteen or even five years ago.You can also listen to an interview I did with George about the book on the Medical Author Chat podcast"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I was disappointed with my purchase.

This book is as exciting and real as it's author, who is still practicing as a paramedic, and still collecting stories-- hopefully for the sequel.

I laughed at a few of the analogies that were definate truisms that define the differences between the new buff and the older experienced medics. Also interesting is how New York presents experiences that are unique to many other services, cities and working environments.Mr. Steffensen my suggestion to you is to continue to write your view of the EMS world according to George with future editions, assure that all your work is properly edited to make you shine in the academic light that becomes you, and expound upon your thoughts, feelings, and concerns about how society has created each situation that you become involved with. Thank you for doing the work that you do and for sharing your experiences in our book."},{"rating":"2","title":"paramedic buff to burnt","review":"Steffensen gives us a look into the riveting possibilities one can never anticipate as a medic in nyc.

I personally love the book. Being from all the areas discussed in the book, it wasn't too hard for me to picture everything and I found myself nodding in agreement to so many points of view on just about every topic. I can totally relate. For those not from the NY-Metro area but who love EMS, this book was a legit insight into what life is like on the streets of NYC. George, we actually traded messages initially and I love the fact that not only is this about the System currently burning me out lol, but that your wife actually worked in the area I'm in now. Great product, great story...

I used to by new editions of this series every two years but quit several years ago because I was getting less information and more op-ed preaching. I did pick up a copy of this edition at a local book store and spent a great deal of time flipping thorough it and saw that little has changed. Barone is simply a blind apologists for the Bush administration and contemptuously dismisses anyone who does not subscribe to his philosophy as merely being a part of the \\"feminist left.\\"It is such a shame, as a lot of the information in here is valuable to someone with an interest in US politics and elections.

I have bought this book every election cycle since 1984 and I keep going back to each one for information. If you love politics - this book needs to be in your library!

That's a tell tale sign as far as 24 TV news networks are concerned.I have bought every edition since I turned 18 in 1978, but have decided not to purchase the next release after the 2006 election cycle. The hard factual information is accurate and well-presented. But the partisan slant compromises the book's credibility as an analytical product. With so much tendentious material, how can anyone not desirous of receiving the Fox News party line have confidence in the soundness of the commentary--the \\"soft\\" factual information? Michael Barone made an excellent and original contribution to political research when he introduced the Almanac back in the '70's.

I didn't get that but I got a great ballad album. Fury was quite a crooner. If you like Roy Orbison you'll definately. Very well written, recorded and produced songs. I don't hear much of Fury's music in Moz's music but I do hear an influence in the way Moz deliver's his singing. It's cool Moz was influenced by an obscure artist such as Fury rather than just a big mainstream artist such as Moz.

At 70 mm you are just about at life size so you don't get much pull for distance, and if you're taking people pictures, you want something that will enhance faces more, and give you more flexibility when shooting things farther away. This is your lens. The picture quality is excellent and it picks up where the stock lens leaves off, so in combination with the two lenses, you're going from an 18mm to 300mm. Picture quality is excellent, what you'd expect in a Nikon lens in this price range. Cons: it's a large heavier lens, not even including the lens hood, and at f/4-5.6, you really need a good quantity of light for it. But if you're looking for a lens that will give you the magnification you find missing in the stock lens, then this is it.

Such as for multiple org. she says to keep the stimulation even if too sensitive, use indirect pressure. Good advice but that's all she gives. For kissing she says for you to kiss how your partner likes, then vice versa.

The wrist support does what it is supposed to and keeps your wrists very comfortable. The keys are solid and do not get jammed easily like my former eMachines keyboard. It is also not excessively loud like my Dell Quietkey Keyboard. It is superfluous because it goes beyond being a great keyboard by offering some great nifty button things. Although some of the buttons are very useless for me, like the back, forward, stop, refresh, search, and web/home because I use keyboard hotkeys, but the others like the mute, volume, calculator and my compputer (which I programmed for my own things) are extremely helpful.

This isn't really necessary except to make things neater without going all out and getting wireless (which I've had -- performance isn't perfect with wireless just yet).However, it is extremely useful for laptop/notebook owners that didn't bother getting a port replicator or docking station. All I have to do is plug in the monitor and the USB from the keyboard, and voila, everything I have is plugged in via the extra USB ports on the keyboard.The keyboard has a y-shaped end, one end being ps2, the other being USB. Remember though, the USB ports can only be used if you plug the keyboard into the laptop via USB, not PS2.I sort of wish it didn't have PS2 at all -- sort of gets in my way.Feels nice...I hate ergonomic keyboards.

In terms of humor I wish he would put \\"My Daddy is a Mummy,\\" or \\"I Got the Hots for the Smarts\\" on a disc someday, but that is a minor quibble that detracts nothing from this disc. RT is one of the best lyricists around and his guitar playing whether acoustic or electric is amazing.

There is a whole lot of information about developing SQL Server 2000 apps. Some of the chapters are getting old though using Visual Basic 6 code. I found there is a lot not covered in this book that is in the 70-229 Microsoft certification exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks, Rob!","review":"This is perhaps the best technical book ever written. Using this manual I was able to solve problems in SQL 2000 that had eluded me for years in Access, as well as solve some tricky issues in having my code talk to the SQL database. The couple of pages on correlated subqueries alone are worth the price of the book (particularly the bold hint about aliasing), and the excellent section on stored procedures is absolutely essential for the developer trying to make their program talk to the database. Being able to use stored procedures effectively has drastically increased the response time of my ASP and Java web sites, as well as simplified maintenance.My only issue is that I wish there was a dedicted section with regard to commenting and variable/table naming conventions. As a neophyte developer trying to make business and entertainment apps this would be help.If you want practical SQL in an easy to read and understand format, this is the book for you.

I wish I had a nickel for every time I have looked the index for a certain topic, only to find it wasn't there. In a 1389 page book about SQL Server programming, you would expect to find a reference to \`SET ROWCOUNT' somewhere it in. Well, guess what, it isn't there, at least not in the index. This is only one of many examples. I have yet to find any useful information in this book, yet its packed with verbiage. So I can only conclude it was written for someone else, and mis-titled.

There's abosolutely nothing in this chapter that isn't in the BOL (in fact, there's far less).The other complaint I have is how woefully bad the writing is. Wrox books are known for being the worst in the industry, but this one takes them to new lows. The guy cannot write. The wording is the strangest, most uneven stuff you'll ever see. It's horid.

It's more about graduating from office secretarial design, (maybe using PageMaker) to commercial publishing. The books is badly designed itself, and poorly written, with poor typography to boot. It offers next to nothing about the program InDesign and most of its other content seems to be recirculated PageMaker publishing advice.

But before the 20 seconds elapse, the camera shuts off (energy saver), and you have to reprogram the mode button, which of course throws you into Groundhog Day mode. Yeesh.

Taymor re-creates this very difficult play amazingly well for the screen. Some criticize it, but if you're interested in shakespeare (but not an inflexible elitist) and if you embrace modern theater, you'll love it. The movie takes the effectiveness of theater and combines it with the advantages of film. It is a gruesome story and has some graphic scenes that will make you shiver, but they are ultimately well done and effective in the film.

It has a great cast, with Anthony Hopkins in the title role.The blending of Ancient Rome and the modern world in the set and the costumes is surprisingly effective -- Roman armour and weapons fit in perfectly beside cars, microphones and other modern props. The on-again, off-again \\"play within a play\\" idea was annoying and never really went anywhere, but it wasn't shoved in the viewer's face too much.Beautiful as it is, the film is a disturbing parade of violence and cruelty that makes most horror films look tame by comparison. In this, it is true to the play on which it was based, and the Shakespearean dialogue actually lends a certain creepy respectability to what would otherwise be a spectacle of depravity."},{"rating":"1","title":"titus","review":"even julie taymor can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. it is a horrible story of horrible people doing horrible things to one another."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT WAS DISGUSTING","review":"I just wanted to write this review to let people know that if you are easily impressed by blood and gore, DO NOT watch this film!!!I had to see it for one of my classes and it was a nightmare-- at points it was so gory it was ridiculous... but I guess that was really the point... to make exaggeration funny.So please be careful because it's very very nasty"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare's worst play & Anthony Hopkins' worst film","review":"The critics said that Titus is the worst play of Shakespeare, although I may not fully agree... but difinitly this movie is the worst of Anthony Hopkins.The movie should have not been placed in the current century, this has killed the movie and made it senseless!I loved the music of this film, loved the settings and acting but all together with Shakespeare language did not make any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My oh My......","review":"It was Horrible with a capital H.

The idea of Taymor making her debut in movies by directing Shakespeare is preposterous in itself, and as soon as you see the first time she inserts ridiculous \\"visions\\" of limbs being burnt and men wearing deer heads, you'll realize that this \\"Lion King\\" directress has absolutely no place touching works by the great Bard. In addition, the \\"grand finale\\" of the movie consists of 3 entire minutes of NOTHING but a boy walking out of a theatre in slow motion. Such monstrosity and \\"post-modernism\\" may have a place on MTV, but they do not in the eloquent world of Shakespeare. Before she is allowed to touch another script, Taymor needs to learn the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"The mixing of old and new elements doesn't work","review":"I couldn't go for the mixing of elements. Motorcycles and chariots together? Uh-uh. It doesn't work. It's neither one thing nor the other.And I didn't like having the mute kid running around everywhere. It was annoying.The acting is great; Shakespeare is, well, Shakespeare. Same incredible depth of characters, even supporting characters who, sometimes, suddenly leave off their character, inexplicably developing a momentary conscience which they never had before. I suppose that'd be my only complaint about the genius himself.But really, this adaptation, this mixing of armored track vehicles with Goth and Roman helmets--it just doesn't do it.It distracts more than anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subhuman","review":"I recently bought 22 movies on Shakespeare's plays, and Titus is, by far, the worst of them. A distinct customer would have given it no star if possible. I totally agree with him. Another one has warned us against it. Let me do the same. It is poorly acted - but, even if not so, what a well-directed actor could do for that film? Are not there the words of William Shakespeare? But they do not help Julie Taymor's Titus at all, which, with its extreme vulgarity, muffles any serious reflection and spoils the otherwise sublimity of Shakespeare's writing. His wisdom is, with no pause, engulfed in an ocean of barbaric ultraviolent and dissolutely disgusting scenes merely performed to shock your family, or any household with a drop of graciousness and decorum. Not merely unrefined, Titus is subhuman. Avoid it forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent before you buy","review":"My wife and I rented this video anticipating a nice evening watching two of our favorite actors perform together. Our bewilderment started when the movie started off with a modern day kid playing with gladiator dolls at the kitchen table and absolutely trashing the place. It was messier than the food fight in Animal House. We became perplexed when shortly thereafter was a scene of gladiators marching, amongst which were carts being pulled by motorcycles. I guess some folks have better drugs than others. It didn't take us too long to get our fill of this bizarre movie. We were so glad we didn't waste more than a DVD rental fee and either see this in the theater or buy it. So if you're considering purchasing this film, rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"I'm afraid I have to agree with another reviewer that the \\"time shift\\" employed here completely destroys the story.

It was his favorite, and is the favorite of scholars around the world, especially in Rome London where more performances of this play have been produced than any other play by Wm Shakespeare. During his lifetime, Shakespeare made more money from the play than any of his other plays, including Romeo & Juliet. To say that it is his most bloodied is true but betrayal and discovery of betrayal was his favorite subject, and many of his followers of his day believed this to be true, too.San Diego, California"},{"rating":"1","title":"aaagh!","review":"this was the most boring movie I have seen for a LONG time.

Believe me, this is not for children; this play in particular was written in the style of the Roman playwright Seneca with it's emphasis on supernatural elements, bloody violence, and obsessive passion. Although these elements are prevalent in Shakespeare's later, tragic works none (in my opinion) are to the graphic degree of this piece.Taking that into consideration the director did an excellent job of redeeming this difficult play and Anthony Hopkins plays the titular character in such an excellent way one relates to his madness.One thing of note is the character Aaron, Tamora's moorish lover. One can see how Shakespeare later developed Othello's Iago from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"TITUS the movie","review":"The ordering, price, and delivery of the movie \\"Titus\\" was excellent. Good communication between Amazon and me was also excellent; it was as if Amazon really cares about the customer and product. However, the one thing that they did not take into consideration was that the product was going to Australia. As it was my first time at ordering something ONLINE I have learnt valuable lessons about ordering on the net. For a start the product \\"The movie Titus\\" seems to be totally useless with it being incompatible with Australia DVD players. How one establishes if the product being purchased is compatible to Australian electronics seems to be beyond me... being an aged person (or an Old Fart as my kids say) it may take me some time to figure this out. I was about to purchase more products online but after my Blue-ray DVD player rejecting Titus I will not be purchasing any further products until I find out the \\"do's & don'ts\\" about buying on the net."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Great","review":"I have seen several Shakespeare adaptations, but this one is clearly the best. I was not familiar with the story of Titus before I saw this film and I had no trouble following it. The true test of conveying Shakespeare(in my humble opinion) is telling the story without the losing the audience in the diologue. Titus accoplishes this. It is visually spectacular and the performances by Anthony Hopkins and crew are wonderful. The story, though, is what makes Titus so amazing. I won't spoil it for you, but if you like truely twisted tales, then by all means check out this film. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing movie with outstanding acting and costumes.","review":"This movie based on Shakespears, \\"Titus Andronicus\\" is an amazingly accurate portrayal of the book. The lines do not forfiet Shakespears original plan of satire, and yet the movie gives it more. Whether it be more gruesome violence or more sex. The costumes and scenery put you back in time and rate up there with \\"Talented Mr. Ripley\\"'s designs. The movie does start out very oddly, and poorly with a boy playing with his food, after that its amazing. For those who loved the \\"Run Lola Run\\" vibe, it shines through in more than a few scenes and adds to the pleasure of the movie. Great acting on the part of Jessica Lange who plays, the empress. But the real Breakout performance is from Harry Lennix who plays the Moor, Aaron. All around spectacular film, One of the top five of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heady Union of the Surreal and the Visceral","review":"What I found most remarkable about Taymor's excellent adaptation of one of Shakespeare's most-maligned plays is the effectiveness of the time-scrambled imagery. One of the great things about film is its ability to visually comment on text and \\"Titus\\" does so in a way that is both accessible and challenging. Seeing Saturninus as a decadent Fascist or Chiron and Demetrius as S&M-chic Droogies resonates more than a period production would; the images help the viewer understand the characters while at the same time encouraging a more complex analysis of the play's outrageous violence and cruelty.\\"Titus Andronicus\\" may well be among Shakespeare's least-important work but the film does an excellent job of making the play seem both relevant and profound. And besides all that, dig Revenge's crazy knife-helmet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Titus - a strange movie","review":"I purchased this expecting something close to an Alexander or some other era movie. It is a modern representation of a Roman time with cars and protests. Its almost a 70's rendition of the Titus character. Its not for eveyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Take My Shaksespeare Straight","review":"If you admire Shakespearean plays AS THEY WERE WRITTEN, then don't watch this film. The neo-classical approach of mixing modern day conveniences with antiquity just doesn't work, at least not for me. It's a little unsettling when you see guys shooting pool, people driving caddy's, and soldiers carrying handguns - while at the same time carrying swords and speaking in ye olde english.This movie is very graphic in it's violence and sexual content and should NOT be viewed by young children, incest and cannibalism being among the more disturbing themes that run their course in this film.The acting of course is impeccable, but then again what do you expect from Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange. That being said I have to profess my bias for the traditional approach to Shakespeare and would have loved to see them in something a little closer to what the Bard had in mind when he penned his famous prose. Call me close-minded but I'll take my Shakespeare straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTING!!!!!","review":"THis movie was disgusting!! If you don't have a strong stomach I would advise you to stay away from this movie. Plus, if you don't understand Shakespeare too much you might get lost in the story. THe acting and the directing was good, but I didn't think the movie was good. There were too many questions in my mind at the end of the movie. If you don't know the story, than figure out the story before you watch this. I'm still creeped out by how real this movie seemed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I hadn't seen it","review":"When I first saw this film I left the theatre weeping uncontrollably. I can't deny the artistic excellence that went into the production, but I rate it with one star because I didn't like this film. It tore out my heart. It is a film about cruelty and lack of mercy. (I suppose the blame for this must go to Shakespeare, who wrote it.) The small ray of hope shown at the end of the film is too small and comes too late to redeem the movie from the dark, miserable images which overwhelm it. I can't forget this movie, but I would like to, because when I think of it I want to cry again. Inhumanity brings only misery. Perhaps that is the point. Mankind would do well to spend more time considering the power of kindness, forgivenss and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES","review":"Well I love anthony, but the movie blew big chunks. now I know why this movie quietly appeared and disappeared from the big screen.

Well as you might have guessed, looks can be quite deceiving. Although the actors were all talented, the entire movie was done in Shakespearian English. So you spend the entire movie going what did he say? what was that? and then pressing rewind to find out. A trick is to turn on the sub-titles options if you get the DVD version. Although you will still have to occasionally push the rewind button to catch a line or two, it will make the movie much easier to follow. As for the movie itself, the plot was great and if it was in modern day English would have probably been a pretty good movie (maybe). As for the bonus disc you get with your two DVD set - well that is a joke and an out and out insult to DVD technology.

THE ONLY SAVIOR IN THIS STUPID MTV MESS.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring, pompous mess","review":"I'm not going to go into a long explanation of the film here, since many other reviewers have already done so. I will simply say that this movie was a major disappointment. I'm a great fan of serious film, but this movie was a classic example of overzealous direction and production. The arrogant Julie Taymor is obviously trying to \\"teach\\" us things with this mess, but instead has produced a haphazard melange that is neither entertaining nor particularly attractive. It's just boring. And it's insulting, too, because you get the feeling that Taymor feels it is somehow beneath her to simply create entertainment. Instead she's trying to produce \\"art,\\" and the heavy-handed results are embarressing to watch. Jessica Lange and Anthony Hopkins try gamely to breathe life into this flaccid film, but even their enormous talents can't raise the dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece in contemporary medievalism","review":"What a wonderful version of Shakespeare! As a literary scholar and patron of the arts, as well as an artist and writer, I can honestly say that this is possibly THE BEST modern rendition of Shakespeare in film format. The psychedelic and highly stylized Rome of Titus is a creative masterpiece, showcasing a gothic beauty absent from much of modern film and slightly reminiscent of Baz Lehrmann's Romeo and Juliet. Sets and costume design are so good and so striking that they alone make this a film worthy of purchase. And the script is true to the evil and brutality that characterize the bard's original play; the social commentary is also extremely pertinent as we try to balance the degeneration and moral depravity of our own modern western society with honor, ethics and morality. Extremely haunting, although slow at parts, this film is a must for anyone with a refined taste for word and image, set and setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Passion for Teaching","review":"I am a student at Macon State College in Macon, GA finishing up my teacher certification in Deaf Education and read this book for a class.

Its the first time I've come across karaoke tracks where, at several points throughout the songs, the \\"guide\\" vocals come in for a line or two, comletely unexpectedly. This may be fine in certain settings....e.g. if a whole gang of people are already singing along, who is going to notice...but if one person is giving a solo rendition, this sudden vocal intrusion can be very disconcerting. It also makes recording a vocal performance impossible, as the guide vocal cannot be removed. Now, is that Irish enough for you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The sad part is that the arrangements on some of these are very pretty. However, for some reason they fixed so that you couldn't remove the guide vocals. They come in at the beginning of each new verse, bridge and chorus, then go away.

The writing is beyond formulaic-- it's so awful that it's almost funny. The characters are so flawed that they are almost cartoonish. The camera work is so ridiculously amateur that it brings to mind the awful products of high school film classes-- in the 70s. It is so predictable in its plodding that the most interesting thing about it is the outdated hairstyles and fashions embraced by its cast members. The white-centered stereotyping in this movie is shockingly racist, and the characters are completely unbelievable. Even Denzel Washington cannot save this film in possibly his worst film role ever.This film is part anti-drunk-driving docusaga, part movie of the week, and part low-budget white nuclear family period piece.

The SB 50DX speedlight is superb with the N80 - providing TTL metering and a wide range of settings. Even better, if you shoot with film, the SB 50DX is readily available in the used market for $50-75. What an amazing price for a flash unit that retailed for more than $200 in early 2004. For digital flash, the SB 50DX works well with the older models, but check carefully. For example, the D70 and D50 have iTTL metering - which is not supported by the SB 50DX. But for other digital models such as the D1, the SB 50DX is fully functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Price for Little Functionality","review":"For the price of this flash, I would consider alternatives such as a Sunpak PZ5000 which offer many advanced features for a smaller price tag. Also the batteries that this unit requires tend to be costly versus commonly used AA cells. The \\"pro\\" flash, SB80DX is a great product but more than double the price of the PZ5000! I wish Nikon would keep up with its competitors in the amateur photographer market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery guzzler","review":"The flash is not so reliable as it goes off just after a few shots and the battery signal indicates."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - DANGER D70 Owners!!!!!!!","review":"If you bought or own a D70 DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!

Now its an expensive paperweight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty much required reading for Godzilla fans.","review":"Whether you agree with Steve Ryfle's criticism of the the later and contemporary Godzilla movies or not (and I do not not, with the exception of the American version, I rate no Godzilla movie lower than three stars), his book remains a fairly exhaustive look at the legendary monster and its decades long film franchise. Just about any question you may have about the still running series will probably be answered in these pages. Sadly legal hassles (i.e. it being unauthorized) prevented more photos of the star attraction appearing in the book, but that it is a pretty nitpicking quibble for such a book as this. If you want cool pictures of The Big \\"G\\", then buy the Cerasini/Leeds Companion. If you want an affectionate, yet candidly unvarnished, look that people who created and/or appeared in so many wonderfully entertaining movies, then get this. You will not be disappointed. I can only give it my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Great Subject","review":"This book is great. It is fun, enjoyable, easy to read and surprisingly moving in places.The lack of photograps of the key Mon-Stars can be a little disconcerting but since this is an unoffical guide quiet understandable.Clearly Steve Ryfle loves his subject and after reading the book I am sure you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla Rules! ... But Where's Angilas?","review":"Overall, well-written, well-researched, well-done. Authoritative without being unapproachable to the less-than dead-serious movie monster fan. And yet, while one hestitates to criticize a Godzilla book for having *too* much Godzilla, one also can't help but wonder, Why exactly *is* Godzilla, Japan's favorite \\"mon-star,\\" as it were? Where does Angilas figure into all this? And what of that Jaguar Jet fellow? ... In any case, a small quibble. I'll put it on my shelf next to \\"Love Story\\" anyday! And how!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vertebrate morphology supreme","review":"This university textbook on vertebrate morphology is clearly written and is actually suitable for the general reader with no experience in the subject. Basic concepts such as morphological concepts, phylogeny, paleontology and evolution are discussed at the start of the book. A good overview is presented regarding theories of chordate emergence. Early vertebrates are then presented, starting with a reconstruction of a conodont animal. Chapters on biological design (ie, what adaptations are actually possible) and embryology then follow. Chapters describing and comparing organ systems in various vertebrates then follow, and include the integument (ie, skin), skeletal system, muscular system, respiratory system, circulatory system, digestive system, urogenital system, endocrine system, nervous system and sensory organs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good improvement from last edition","review":"This is the book that I used to teach comparative vertebrate anatomy. The previous major flaw of the book was the many inaccuracies in the figures. However many of these appear to be changed. All in all this book is a good book to reference to for a variety of questions about vertebrates. Not the easiest of books to wade through for a beginner but Kardong for the most part does a good job in explanations and descriptions for a book of this level"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Science and Exaggerated Claims make this book useless","review":"First, much of this book deals with issues in the delivery of healthcare, not genetics. Second, while genetic engineering poses serious risks that must be managed by our government, the authors have proposed one of the most ludicrous ones in their chapter \\"Silent Bombs\\" discusion of Monsanto's \\"Terminator\\" gene. They write \\"It renders crop plants sterile, thus enclosed, monopolized, and growable only from patented one year seed...If the gene spread into the wild, it could sterilize other species and possibly drive them to extinction.\\" (p. 190-191) I'm embarrased to be caught with this book!

It features outtakes from Elvis' American Studios recording sessions in 1969. These recordings are acknowledged as being among Elvis' best. This CD features alternate versions of Elvis classics like \\"Stranger In My Own Home Town\\", \\"In the Ghetto\\", \\"Suspicious Minds\\", \\"Long Black Limousine\\" and \\"Kentucky Rain\\". It's fascinating to hear early versions of these songs, without the horn, string and girl group overdubs the finished versions have. Recommended for all Elvis fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Storytelling Despite Budget","review":"A nice little story about self-sacrifice and redemption disguised as a low-budget sci-fi shoot-em-up. While most of the special effects are a little cheesy, the characters and storytelling are solid. Scott Plank in the lead is both heroic and vulnerable, Jocelyn Seagrave is both ballsy and tender (easy on the eyes, too). The director does a nice job with both the action and drama, and there are even a few great comic moments (the \\"real\\" Neil Armstrong story). Revelations, about the characters' past, add some emotional layers to the movie, and a couple of fun twists help round it out as well. Check out Robert O'Reilley (StarTrek's Klingon \\"Gow-ron\\") as the main bad guy (He's pretty intense as a cold-blooded convict desperate to highjack his way back to earth)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Shallow","review":"Though it does provide the steps to publishing children's books, it does so with as little depth as possible leaving the reader with a multitude of unanswered questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it if you get a good price.","review":"For those interested in the topic, this has got all the basics.

The case is nice for the $80 price. It is pretty tight inside. I had to replace the existing fans with larger ones on the side mounting points because the motherboard would hit the back mount. This is a Dell specific issue though (and there are a lot of Dell specific issues like non standard connectors). The front of the case is aluminum and has a nice heavy feel to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased this case for a HTPC I am building. Several reviews I read made mention of several areas of concern which included missing screws and parts. I dismissed them as being the exception rather than the norm. I was very mistaken.After waiting 2 weeks for the case to arrive, I was disappointed to find that indeed, a case screw was missing (not a big deal, internal fans were missing, and to top it off, the front panel hinge was broken. All this on what was supposed to be a new case!I would strongly recommend choosing another case, as quality control is a foreign term to NZXT.Amazon's customer service was very friendly and very quick to RMA the case and issue me a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collecting dust","review":"I was so angry that this product didn't work that I couldn't wait to write a review.

The \\"karaoke\\" function was poor at first and soon nonexistant. We used it as a boom box for awhile, but the sound wasn't great, and it ate batteries (you have to buy an adapter separately). It didn't help that the kids had a tendency to leave it on, and there's no handy \\"on\\" light to indicate this to parents (all the controls are awkward at best).

When they arrive to meet the guy-he is no-where to be found. Then after a few days he contacts where they are and sends word to come to another place-to audition.

The scenes with the thousands of rats is pretty effective. The dubbing is pretty bad and hinders the actors (?) performances. The story revolves around a rat infestation in Frankfort, where the bitchy mayor lowered funding for waste removal thereby causing a strike, in which the garbage isn't picked up; it's also the hottest summer in Frankfort history so this situation inflames the rodent's appetite and ferocity.Not a complete time waster for fans of this kind of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency and World-System Theories (SAGE Library of Social Research)","review":"It's an easy reference book for the understanding of development theory.

This CD is a useful round-up of Rosetta Stone's earlier work in the form of their demo tapes and early single releases and album tracks from 1988-1991. The main influence is quite blatantly the Sisters of Mercy, but they do this in such a tongue-in-cheek way that you can't help but listen(namely: Cimmerian borrows riffs from the SOM's Heartland, Whispers nicks from Walk Away, to name but a few . . . but so what). If you've never heard of this band, who are a Liverpool-based two-piece, then check this out.

They where Royksopp, Zero 7, Badly Drawn Boy, Radiohead (whats this doing on a trance album), Bent, Faithless and IIO.

Everyone has some loss in their lives, whether it be from death of a loved one or other losses. The author did a wonderful thing, writing this book. It is truly inspiring. It encourages people to follow their hearts. She talks of freedom from judgement, of openness, of compassion and love and doing what's best for YOU without letting others interfere.

The sound quality is mediocre.I am not a big fan of their music from this period. It is too much heavy German electronica. To me, it is mostly noise. It does not have the medolic flow of Autobahn. I ripped the songs I liked off of the CDs and came up with about 50 minutes of music (about 40%).It was rare when it was released and now it is out of print.

I used this book as a minor source in research for a major 30+ page history paper on the Nazi economy and foreign policy. While too short to be something to rely upon, it is a fine introduction by an excellent historian. Good data is provided as well as some keen insight by the author. If you want to learn about the Nazi pre-war economy in quick fashion this work is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Except for the little chat (on the DVD included) about how FCE differs from iMovie, there is not much quality in this book.

Don't waste your money","review":"Ok, I admit.... this book looked really cool at first glance (the chapter on the Brady Bunch theme showed promise), but when I actually got into the book, it was hard to follow, and I felt the author's bias shadowed over the book. He continually made reference to things he wished they had in the software that weren't there and other opinionated things like that. I really wanted to like this book because of the little movie talking about the differences between iMovie and FCE2. That was about the only thing that was valuable in this entire book.

This is a \\"must have\\" book for learning FCE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this book on the basis of the positive reviews, and boy, do I regret it. This was very little help and is written in a schizophrenic, haphazard form that is maddening. Example: right after he has you load up the first lesson, he goes off on long explanations of functions that he then says will be used in later chapters, not that one. Then he gets back to the lesson - supposedly - and goes off explaining other controls. Finally, the chapter ends and YOU'VE NEVER EVEN USED THE LESSON! He tells you to close it up and start importing your own material.And, as stated before, there are many typos, or worse, errors like telling you to use the button on the right when he really means to say left, so it's confusing and frustrating. I used to tutor English at university level and if this had come across my desk I would have considered it a rough draft. Even from a pure logic standpoint, it's a jumble. If you're a beginner to Final Cut Express, stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book gets you started, plus a wonderful author to help you out of tough spots","review":"Not only is this one of the best titles on the market for getting you into the nitty gritty of Final Cut Express, it is written by a man who is clearly devoted to teaching the product. Just today I was on Apple's help forum trying to solve a problem that I couldn't find the answer for in his or any of the other books I have. It turned out the solution was simple, but it was such a nice surprise that Tom Wolsky himself (author of this book) was the one to respond!! Looking through Apple's and other web based forums on video editing I found that he devotes quite a bit of time to selflessly helping out people with questions that range from the simple (mine) to the very complex and particular solutions. Combine this with the online expertise from Wolsky and many others who are incredibly helpful, and you are off to an excellent start editing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on FCE, Without a Doubt!","review":"I bought this book recently to supplement my new G5 that was coming pre-loaded with Final Cut Express. I did a lot of homework, reading reviews, looking at discussion forums, and all the signs pointed to this book.. I have to say it lived up to its reputation - it is clear and concise, but goes pretty deep into the program. Some books like this, that try to stay user friendly, often only scratch the surface of a topic.

Too much information about locations (too specific for a non-flemish) and regiments and batallions. The author should have focused more on tactical warfare and possible different strategies and their implications. This is just a too detailed chronological report of the facts, nothing more. The few comments he published from soldiers that survived the battles are too short and do not fit in the structure of his book. The author should have worked out this book much better. I was disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A guide to Biblical theology","review":"Christians today find themselves in an environment where information of all types is easily and readily accessible. Most all subjects are open for the reading with a simple click of a mouse. In these times the Christian must be more discerning and grounded in Biblical faith than ever before. It is in this environment that Basic Bible Doctrines by Michael Gowens shines the brightest.BBD brings out the truth of the scripture plainly, and one page at the time. Most systematic theologies are weighty and can take great amounts of time and experience to work through. However, BBD brings forth these same concepts with a readable and accessible nature that laymen can easily understand.If you are looking for a book that makes the difficult doctrines of scripture come alive to the glory of Christ, look no further than Basic Bible Doctrines. No Christian library is complete without a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"cliff","review":"This is the first studio recording by Cliff. It is actually almost a live album. On the day of the recording at EMI studio's, there were so many fans outside, they just let them sit in and watch. This was the closest to Elvis the British had. there are many cover songs here that American's all know, but there are a lot of originial songs most of the US have never heard. If you love early Rock 'n' Roll music with a lot of passion this is for you. Some of the time the girls screaming get so loud it almost drowns out Cliff!

When I heard the first song, I was impressed, along with most of the songs. My only complaint I have is that in a couple of songs, they decided to have at least two additional backround vocals. One of them sounding like the Rammstien vocalist (which he actaully makes it sound neat) and another one sounding (ugh) goth. Goth vocals do NOT belong in either death or black metal. Don't let what I just said stop anyone from buying this album, this band is truly excellent. All I'm saying is that on some tracks, they were fully cabable of making those songs perfect. Even so, I still like listening to \\"Past Shadows\\" despite that particular vocalist on it. And the rest of the songs (except for \\"Sacred Divinity\\" being the only real song I don't care for) are beyond great. Take my word, if you are into black metal, you should at least give this album a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"I was very excited about this cd coming out.

I'd recommend Blacken the Angel last for it's less than great production value, but still a good cd. The only think I didn't like about this cd was the art and pictures in the booklet. I liked the art from their other cds because they try to show Agathodaimon's I guess \\"artistic\\" side. I think that this cd's art just shows what they've been wasting their money on. Sorry guys.

I'd reccomend buying Cradle of Filth's Thornography before this and i hate Thornography with every fiber of my being.

In this story a young and disturbed girl says that her father molested her. In the real world Ned (the father) would have been arrested and child protective services would have gotten involved. The author left all of that out. What happened the night Kate was watching her little brother? What became of the little brother. Was he damaged by his fall?

I first thought the abrupt change in the daughter's behaviour, that leads to her being mentally ill was just not quite right in the description. She was perfect one moment, the child from hell the next. She returns from camp with a navel piercing: no professional would do that for a 14 year old and it is practically impossible to do yourself. Then there was the accident, it seemed almost as if Kate was going to admit she was on drugs or drinking when it happened,but she never did. It seemed a little too trite considering the heavy tone of the writing in the aftermath. However, the description of the borderline personality mother was perfection in itself: how they ruin the lives of others. That alone was worth the read. Rest of it was just below average. Also, as it was called Family History, it never linked the mental illness to the family, in my estimation."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could of been a Contender!","review":"In the United States there is not much information for the general public about the History of the Orthodox Church.

The speakers are at the bottom of the screen on the 61\\" model, instead of the sides like the 42\\" model and don't really sound as good. I rely on my stereo hookup for quality sound now, but the neighbors don't appreciate it. In addition, reception through my DVR is worse on the 61\\" model than my 42\\" model (fuzzy diagnal lines). Did I get a lemmon, or is the 61\\" model magnifying a distortion that wasn't as noticeable on the smaller version? I personally think it's the TV.

The ideas are simplistic, the author's voice irritating and pedantic, and she seems to violate the first rule of spirituality by implying that her book contains all the answers.The most striking thing about the book is how the author claims that she asks her minions to seek out their own answers, yet it appears, from reading the book that what she truly means is that they should seek their own answers as long as they agree with her proclamations. The book has so many stories about all the bad things that happened when people disagreed with or chose to ignore the author's advice and opionions, yet it claims she wants spiritual freedom! Truly a contradiction, if you ask me.I am so sorry I bought this new age cultish nonsense. I should have just stuck with the classics!

I do not believe the author researched the book very well. He refers to Semmes first ship the converted packet Havana as the first Florida when she was actually the CSS Sumter.

There were too many flaws in this book to make it enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did ANYONE fact check this book?","review":"A decent account of the naval portion of the Civil War in the Atlantic, marred by sloppy editing, and inexcusable mistake. the author TWICE claims an event took place after Second Bull Run (Aug 1862) when he's still discussing 1861 events. Then he describes a 51\\" thick steel armor for an ironclad! And goes on to claim that no ships were sunk by submarine between the Civil War and the sinking of the Lusitania (May 1915) even though U boats had been attacking and sinking British ships since the previous fall of 1914! Other parts of the book use repetition of phrases and sentences, giving the appearance of a book cut and pasted together with poor editing. This mars the story. An additional problem is that the author gives no proper comparison when he discusses gun sizes -- mixing 32 lbers and 12\\" guns, without ever giving the reader any indication of how these compared."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great idea","review":"I am very happy with this product.

First few chapters were ok, but the book became progressively harder to read and considerably less realistic. First of all, the author should remember what Eleanor Roosevelt said \\"Nobody can make you feel interior without your consent.\\" Just because a person claims someone else is a \\"nobody\\" that doesn't make it so. Secondly, no one will ever rid the world of rank. People by nature will form a pecking order. That's just the way it is. Without some sort of leadership, there would be anarchy and chaos in the world. Thirdly, the author is in academia, is male and is white, therefore a \\"somebody\\" if you go by his definition. So who is he to criticize when he is part of the problem rather than part of the solution?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The concept is a bit half-baked","review":"Other than defining \\"rankism\\", there is not much else to this book. The author spends most of the book defining and giving examples of rankism. He does not talk much about \\"overcoming the abuse of rank\\", as the title suggests he will. He cites a few examples of where some groups are already making progress, but he does not really say what others should do, except maybe \\"join together\\". On some occasions, seems to be implying that the world is on its way to eliminating rankism, so we can just sit back and wait for this new utopia to come about.He also likes to compare rankism to both sexism and racism. He suggests that rankism can be eliminated, just like sexism and racism have been. Huh? There has been progress made against these other \\"isms\\", but Fuller really is living in an ivory tower if he thinks they no longer exist.\\"Somebodies and Nobodies\\" does a decent job of pointing out that rankism exists, but does very little to provide answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good warnings","review":"If our economic system collapses and our democracy with it, it will be because the lessons of this book were not learned by those wealthy capable of paralysing our cooperative way of dealing with imperfect life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idealistic naivete","review":"Actually, one star is too many.

If she had ever really chosen to write sex scenes, they would have been far wittier and more creative than any of these were.

While it does use Jane Austens characters, the style is superficially similar (at best) to the great author. I wasn't expecting more character or plot insight into Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but I also wasn't expecting something that virtually spits on these works! It was a WASTE of money and I had to pick up Persuasion and read it cover to cover just to get my soul back!

It's only redeeming feature is that it can be perused in 30 minutes or less. No prude I, do not look for eroticism in this stinker; though blessed with a healthy sense of humor, I never laughed nor even mildly chuckled. In truth, I was stunned that something so completely awful could be published.

Either way, I was badly let down by this book. Standing in the book store, holding in my hands what I thought was a historical gem and a literary revelation, I read the claims by the authors that this was the \\"real\\" thing. Hooray!I rushed home to read it, and no more than 30 seconds later, I realized that this was obviously a parody. I felt duped. Because it is a parody? No. I have a sense of humor (although I *really* wanted it to be real) But, as someone else has already mentioned, never in 200+ years could a true fan stretch the imagination far enough to believe that this was written by Jane Austen. It was 21st century grammer and *yes*, punctuation, staring me in the face. Oh well, I can always turn it in to my local library for a freebie swap.The bottom line: If you are not into accuracy, buy it. If you are truly a fan of Ms. Austens, reread the real thing and use your erotic imagination instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pride and Promiscuity: The Lost Sex Scenes of Jand Austen","review":"I was dreadfully disappointed in this book.

Little merit as literature, parody, or pornography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice effort... but not good enough to tempt me.","review":"Let me start off by saying how much I really really really wanted to like this book. It was a great idea, but falls short of the mark. Not only were the characters incestuous in some cases but I also couldn't enjoy it because of the unbelievability of the situations (Jane sick at Netherfield park because Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingly coerce her into lesbian sex???)If you are at all interested in the more intimate side of Elizabeth and Darcy I recommend the Pemberley series by Abigail Reynolds. Otherwise, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wise and save your money","review":"Being a huge fan of Jane Austen's work, I was appalled by this book.

So I will stop because I cannot find anyhting else nice to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time.","review":"I was hoping to find this book amusing, and, well, I didn't. I pride myself on a fairly decent sense of humor, and I guess that if you're going to \\"go there\\" (as in, write up \\"lost sex scenes\\" from Jane Austen's novels) you might as well go all the way, and this book simply did not do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Your Corsets On ; Not Funny","review":"Very disappointing. My daughter and I are Austen fanatics, and the idea of x-rated parodies of Jane was too delightful to pass up. Sadly, they are trite and predictable, and not funny for the most part. In a fit of madness, I bought each of us a copy of this tripe, and that was two too many. The idea had great promise, and it was a very clever idea, but the execution was poor. Try and find this on sale or at a garage sale. It's not worth the full price."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh.","review":"It's a fun premise, but it's a pretty light development. Most of the scenes are only mildly funny, and once the delightful thrill of being bad wears off, they become almost boring. On the other hand, the Darcy/Elizabeth scene is utterly hilarious. The prose is solid, but hardly Austenian. Since the entire book takes at most an hour or two to read, it's really not worth the cover price, unless you intend to pass it around to your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witty idea, but disappointing writing","review":"This book's inventive claim is that the scenes it contains were cut from Austen novels by censors. Actually, they were cut by good editors--it's hard to sound like Jane Austen and this author misses by a mile, so the little essays just sound precious. Sorry, but its leaden prose, and surprisingly passionless given its subject. Unlike a few other reviewers, I had no objection to the idea of eroticizing the classics, but this book doesn't, in many ways, pull it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm damning with faint praise, here...","review":"Oh, so disappointing! I very much looked forward to this sexy parody of the beloved Jane Austen; such a shame it just doesn't work. While the style is often quite close, there are just too, too many jarring modernisms that destroy the necessary suspension of disbelief. And... while there are some quite funny bits, there are more that aren't. It needed a good edit - but that would very likely have left the authors without a book. I should think Jane Austen would have approved of and enjoyed the idea, as one who certainly had a sense of humour, but as a perfectionist in writing I doubt she'd have approved of the execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"ADDS INSULT TO INJURY","review":"If I could rate this book lower I most certainly would, -5000 would be too high! I was never so disappointed in my entire life. If this is Jane Austen I am Jack the Ripper! I waited with such anticipation being an avid fan of Jane Austen. This is most certainly NOT Jane Austen! It is an insult to the intelligence of Jane Austen fans. This is nothing but ... plain and simple. Anyone who believes Mr. Darcy would seduce Elizabeth outside in plain view, her Aunt and Uncle only a short distance away do not know Mr. Darcy. This would be an abhorrence to him, of this I am certain! And who in their right mind would believe Fanny Price would even consider a role in the play and particularly that role! It is absurd and I can not believe any Jane Austen reader could believe this to be her work. This is ... and nothing else!! IN SHORT - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do A.

I was extremely excited when I finally received this book after months of having it on special order. Reading the first \\"manuscript\\" astonished and disgusted me, that someone would try to pass this off as a lost work or even letter. I am a huge fan of Austen and have been a long time, the most stimulating aspect of her writing is the fact that she took her time developing her characters and didn't rush them into any obscene acts. This book has been a major disappointment for me and a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe.","review":"I bought this under the mistaken impression that it was factual. Yes, I read the introduction and faux authentication by \\"Elfrida Drummond\\" who it turns out is the author's husband. Nowhere before the commencement of the book did it say that this was a farce. That's what upset me. Once I found out the truth there was no reason to continue reading it. If it wasn't written by Ms. Austen, why continue? If Ms. Eckstut had been forthright about how she billed the book, I think many of us would have been more forgiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give this book ZERO stars, but Amazon understands only 1-5","review":"Pride and Promiscuity seems a perfect hoax; it disappoints me that I, thinking it similar to the clever reparte in Pride and Prejudice, bought this book. If the scenes were lost, or not included due to their salacious content, you would think there would be a continued connection with the way everyone involved would treat the other with all this heavy sex going on.

By following its instructions carefully, I manage to put it together only after damaging a few minor parts and putting in a lot of muscle. Took about 30 minutes.Turning the unit can also be hard for a small person when it is fully loaded. If you are not careful where you put your hand during turning, the cover comes off and out comes the half-done compost. Overall, it is still worth it due to its simple design and operation.

Nevertheless, this album is a real accomplishment. His tone in the Concertos is large and appealing, and he never just pounds. His phrasing is lyrical, almost a little subdued--not a bad way to hear these works. If you believe that Liszt wrote music rather than just showpieces, you probably will enjoy this. Salonen's accompaniments are vigorous and exciting. In the Sonata, Ax seems to play very literally, especially at the beginning. As the piece proceeds, his approach pays off in emotional impact. He almost makes it sound easy to play.

The reasons, Scripture-based or emotion-based, I have always heard about believers being raptured before \\"the wrath\\" never added up. Van Kampen treats God's Word with respect and awe, and his explanation of hermeneutics in the first chapter of the book is first-rate. He gives an intelligent, coherent, Scripture-consistent opinion on the timing of the rapture. Believers in every age have not been spared tribulation. I recently read a great book about Jewish believers caught in Europe during World War II. Most Jewish believers in the world were in Europe up to 1940, and very few of them survived. Read the book carefully, all the way through, then ponder the Scriptures Van Kampen lines up. I didn't find that he left any out, and reconciled Daniel with Revelation with Matt. 24. I've never read a book that is that honest. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another view about the Rapture","review":"This is a good book to read if you are confused about when the rapture will occur. It is all based on the Olivet Discourse in Matthew 24. It is a timeline formed based on the Holy Bible scripture. Keep in mind No One knows when Jesus Christ will return. This is a book to get your mind and heart ready for when Jesus returns to rapture us up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lens, but soft at f/1.4","review":"This lens generally gets good reviews, so maybe I got a bad copy. It was pretty soft at f/1.4 and not much better at f/2. But from f/2.8-16, it's amazing. Very sharp and contrasty. But it does have other positives. It will just about fit in your pocket and is fast enough to shoot in low light. Build guality is very good-much better than those zoom \\"kit\\" lenses. And it's inexpensive for a f/1.4 lens. The 85mm f/1.4 costs 3 times as much. So does the 28mm f/1.4 With the 1.5X crop factor of digital, it's like having a 75mm on a film camera. So it becomes a short telephoto instead of a standard lens. Which makes it good for sports and portraits."},{"rating":"2","title":"F1.4, need I say more?","review":"Before purchasing this I debated between this and the cheaper F1.8 but now that I have it I'm glad to have spent the extra $$. I've never had a lens with an f-stop this low and it's truly amazing how much more light this lets in than my other lenses. With it wide open you can shoot hand held at ISO 800 in a partially lit room. Of course there's almost no depth of field with it wide open so you have to focus very carefully, especially at close range. Autofocus doesn't have a lot to do but it's fast and accurate. Using this with the new Nikon D700 and the pairing is excellent. Between the low fstop of this lens and the high iso sensitivity of the D700 you can shoot handheld in nearly any condition. So far I've shot a flashless indoor wedding, new years eve celebratory fireworks, an early morning nature hike, and countless other random shots..."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME LENS, CHEAP PRICE!","review":"If you want a standard nikkor prime lens, this is the one to get!

Can't get that with a 1.8.Very light so portable in many situations. The contrast and color saturation rivals some of the best lens from Nikon and Canon.Sharp sharp sharp and very little flare. Don't get the 1.8 because it's cheap, get this for its solid build and its low light capabilities. This is an excellent investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic lens, still very useful","review":"The Nikkor 50mm f/1.4 is a classic 135-format lens that is still invaluable as a portrait lens or for taking advantage of the fantastic existing light capabilities of today's digital SLRs. Its optics are excellent, but one would expect that from a 50mm. I only gave it 4 stars because it is not necessarily the best value out there: it's still a plastic-barrelled lens with no SWM or VR, and it's more than twice the cost of af/1.8. You're basically paying for the extra 2/3 stop of optical speed and the shallow depth-of-field. All that said, the lens is very fast and very sharp and it's a joy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best 50mm f1.4 lenses available","review":"The current 50mm f1.4 D-series AF Nikkor lens is the latest in a venerable line of 50mm f1.4 Nikkor lenses produced by Nikon since the early 1960's for both its manual and autofocus Nikon 35mm SLR systems. Performance-wise, it is probably the best autofocus 50mm lens available on the market now, with excellent contrast and resolution from at least f2 and below (I have found as a rule that Nikkor lenses don't quite have the \\"snap\\" and contrast I have seen from Contax Carl Zeiss lenses, of which one of my favorites is the venerable 50mm f1.4 Carl Zeiss T* Planar lens which has been around since 1975 and was recognized as the best 50mm lens available by Popular Photography a few years ago.). If I was still using Nikon equipment, I wouldn't hesitate acquiring this lens, which still ranks among Nikon's finest. The excellent pictures I have seen from those using this lens are a clear visual testament to its optical excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lens","review":"This lens is very sharp. sharper than the new 1.4G IMO.

I tried the lens for 2 days, pictures are great but hard to get right a moving target. I ended up returning it and buying the auctomatic focus version of this lens. PLEASE type somewhere that this is not an automatic focus lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy Autofocus is very distracting","review":"The lens does take very good, tack sharp pix, within its depth of field (perfect for portraits and other special needs) but I found the constant clicking of the autofocus extremely distracting. Click, click, click, back and forth, the lens hunts for focus and lets you know it. I agree with all the positive reviews cited above, but the noise is a big drawback to me. It distracts my subjects, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good portrait and night photography lens","review":"There are plenty of great, maybe better, lenses on the market. I chose the 50mm f/1.4D because for me, it is a versatile lens to an extent. It is a prime lens, therefore one cannot zoom in (for those of you not familiar or new to prime lenses.) I'm satisfied with the photos it produces which are crisp images. Overall, it's great for portraits and even landscapes (my favorite is to shoot in low light with this lens, and when you have the right techniques set on your camera, you can have a lot of fun -and be creative with your shots!The only one drawback I may see is the sound the lens makes when photographing, so if quiet is important to you, look into the 50mm f/1.4G."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lens I own","review":"I know there are tons of positive reviews on this lens, but let me add another!Photographers are NOT lying when they say that this is the only lens they use. It hasn't left my camera since I got it. The DoF is awesome and it's a fast lens. I do a lot of live band photography in indoor, low light situations and this lens performs beautifully. It's detailed at f/1.4 and is amazingly crisp at a f/2 or so. I'd say go for the f/1.4, but I haven't tried the f/1.8, so I can't make a fair comparison. I can tell you that I love this lens and it's all that I plan on using for portraits and low light photography moving forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this, not the F/1.8.","review":"I had initially tried the 50mm f/1.8 version and hastily returned it due to its soft image characteristics at f/1.8. This lens on the other hand maintains great sharpness at f/1.8 trough f/16. While it is more expensive than the f/.1.8, it is worth the extra money if you are looking for a a lens that you can actually use at f/1.4. SWM focusing would have been nice, but the focusing on this lens is quiet and fast. I am very pleased with this gem's performance on my D300s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, fast glass.","review":"You could not ask for a better lens.

Any photography field could use this glass.You just couldn't ask for a more versatile lens. It's also amazingly light, and it makes carrying the camera around all day so much easier (no more bumping into everything with the long lens!). Buy it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best and most useful lens in my bag","review":"I love this lens. For those asking whether it is worth the extra $100+ for the 1.4 instead of the 1.8, the answer is an unqualified yes. This lens is extraordinarily fast.

When I contacted PCNation to return the lens, they advised me there would be a 15% return processing fee, although they failed to explain that the lens does not work with the Nikon D3100.

This is a sharp lens and I personally like the 50mm focal length on the APS sized sensors. I have owned this lens before (traded it in - big mistake!) - so I was pretty sure of what I was getting. Check out dessertpro dot blogspot dot com for sample pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is an excellent product, especially given the price.The one thing to keep in mind is that the lens does not have automatic focus with the Nikon D40. You will have to manually focus it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get pro results on the cheap - As an amateur","review":"Im an amateur photographer but everyone in my family is amazed at how good the pictures look from this lens. Ive read countless reviews about the 1.4 and the 1.8 and decided that the distortion and fall off compared to the 1.4 does not justify the price difference. As a pro photographer i would get the 1.4 but for around the house and parties the 1.8 is great. Just set your aperture to 1.8 and put your flash on wireless and see what beautiful pictures you can get from this lens. I barely use my kit lens anymore........Nikon D90"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon 50mm 1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras","review":"This is a must lens especially for the money. Great with the flash and portrait photography. Quiet, fast focus and sharp. Don't use at 1.8 as most auto cameras gravitate to . Set at f stop 4 and get some really sharp shots. Light weight, small and you'll find yourself walking around more to get that shot, but it will probably be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest description and review.","review":"Bought this product for daughter, photogapher, after much research.

Initial impression is this thing is a beast!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portriat Lens","review":"This lens is my first prime lens and now I am hooked. It is my absolute go to lens when I am wanting to get great close ups with a nice bokeh. I have this on a Nikon D3000 so its the equivelent to a 75mm. Manual focus is not my friend and takes some getting used to but you can take as many pictures as you want....its digital after all. I love the options t gives me over my none-prime lenses and the creativity it allows in portraits. Its cheap enough to take the plunge so what are you waiting for, get one! :) You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great quality","review":"This lens is very fast. It is well worth the money. It is easy to shoot indoors at a low shutter speed without a flash. It is very sharp at all aperatures. I use it on a Nikon D80 without any trouble focusing. A must have for shooting indoors at museums/aquariums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Buy It","review":"How else are you going to get a sharp, fast lens like this for about $100? I don't use this lens a lot but when you need speed or very shallow depth of field, it is more than worth having.I also add extension tubes to it for (non-moving) closeups and macros."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure joy","review":"I was using this lens for a week now with D50 and I can tell you that in low light indoor shooting this lens is AWESOME. At 1.8f this lens should be fast enough for any semi-professional (like myself). At 8f this lens produces the sharpest photos ever and given that you shoot in NEF (RAW) format and use photo editor software (I use Nikon's Capture NX) photos become master pieces. At 22f, outside group portrait are sharp to the last hairy detail on each single person. I highly recommend this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"For amatuers, as good as the faster F 1.4 at less cost","review":"I have had this lens for a while now, bought to replace the Nikon F 1.4 lens after that lens was stolen while on vacation.The lens is lighter than the F 1.4, presumeably because it contains less lens elements, and is slightly slower @ f 1.8. For the majority of photographers ( we amatuers and weekend warriors ), the lens is MORE than fast enough, and I have noticed no difference compared to my old F 1.4 in how sharp my slides are when using the same film ( Ektachrome 100 ).Considering the lens is available for less than $ 100, compared to the F 1.4 ( which I have seen as high as $ 269 ), I believe it is a steal. Every aspiring photographer should have a 50 mm lens in their arsenal, and I believe for the money, you cannot go wrong with the Nikon F 1.8"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens!","review":"I just received this lens from my boyfriend on my birthday and all I can say is that I love it! It takes sharp pictures and clear pictures. I mostly do portraits so it was a perfect fit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary, but for DX check out the 35mm f/2","review":"After a year of using my D80, I can pick out the photos I made using this lens as the sharpest, best contrast, most special. It is fantastic. But with a DX camera, the 35mm f/2 lens is a better choice, because 35mm gives you a more \\"normal\\" lens perspective given the crop factor of DX sensors. 50mm on a DX camera is perfect for portraits, but if you're looking for an everyday lens for street photography, photojournalism, or just shooting fast-moving kids (or anything else indoors) you'll get frustrated with this lens because the DX sensor in the D80/D90/D300 \\"zooms\\" it to 70+mm. Oh, and I don't think it will autofocus on the D40 or D60. On an FX camera (d700, or d3) it is pure perfection, but if you're buying an FX why not spring for the f/1.4?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot be beaten for the price","review":"This lens is fantastic!

At the price everyone should have one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best portrait lenses available for DX format DSLR","review":"This is my go-to lens anytime i am going to shoot portraits, mugshots, faces, interior, low light - you name it. This lens is amazingly sharp, and dead cheap for the quality you are getting. Fast auto focus, exceptional low light performance at f/1.8 By stripping out the zoom and concentrating on delivering superior performance this little lens sharpness delivers on the same level as the much more expensive 24-70mm f/2.8AF-S, and has twice the light sensitivity - but for a fraction of the cost. I love shooting available light with this lens!To put it simply, if you are even thinking about considering adding this lens to your bag - get it. you can't go wrong with the price and you will be blown away at the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sharp little lens","review":"It's cheap and good. Very fast auto-focusing on my D300. Looks tiny but does the biz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best","review":"I am just starting with digital SLR and this is the best lens in my tool kit. My D70 came with 55mm and 70-300mm but this one tops off both of them in clarity and speed. It is so small that I started carrying my camera almost everywhere.Only problem with this lens is zoom. I find myself moving back and forth to get the right frame.Definitely, recommends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I had a dilemna choosing between the 50mm f1.4 vs f1.8 and after reading all reviews from amazon and other internet sites I came to the conclusion that perhaps the f1.8 is a superior all around lens and true enough this lens is sharp, bright, fast and just simply awesome. Ken Rockwell talked about lesser distortion for this lens vs the f1.4 that really tipped me to decide on this one. This is a good all around lens and a great bargain too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the price","review":"The Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF prime lens is as good as it gets for the price. I've used this lens with the D200 and D90 bodies and it's never let me down. Fast focusing, sharp images, great depth of field, outstanding in low light... overall, a great lens. It won't autofocus with the cheaper Nikon DSLR's, so be sure to check if it will with yours.I also use this lens on a Nikon F100 and it works great on that body, too. Overall, it's awesome, so I'd recommend it if you don't yet have a low light lens and are looking for great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat this lens for the price!","review":"Yes, it is manual, but I really like that! There's no zoom to it...the manual part means you are adjusting the focus. So you have to get used to it and check the eyelashes to make sure you're focused on the right subject. But man, this takes some seriously great pictures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Auto focus aside this lens is a excellent","review":"I love this lens, it's great in low light situations and actually good for portrait photography. When using it with either my D3 or D200 the auto focus motor is a tad loud but I can deal with it. And even using it with a D40 I still consider this a great lens. Although the D40/D40X cannot use the autofocus feature I have no trouble at all going manual and still getting great shots. Overall I would suggest that you defintely try this if your using it with a D40/D40X but at $99.00 I would say this would make a great addition to anyone's lens collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing lens for the price!","review":"Don't let the tiny, plastic body fool you; this little guy is powerful! The low-light capabilities are beyond measure and the bokeh is brilliant, making this the perfect potrait lens. And the price is unbeatable!The only problem I have with it is the fixed focal length. Sometimes I feel it's too close to the subject. But of course, that is fixed by simply moving farther away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp, fast lens with unbeatable price.","review":"I like this len's light weight, sharp focus and ability to shoot in low lights. It does make noticeable sounds as it brings to focus, but not untolerable.If you are single and love photography, get it....you know you want it.If you are married, then convince your spouse that $100 is worth about a month of Latte, and you will stop drinking Latte for a month to get this lens.....that's what I did and I did not regret it a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not able to use it on my D50","review":"In all the reviews or specs it does not tell clearly if it is compatible with Nikon D50. i bought and could not use it, so i returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE D60 USERS ***","review":"I received the lens, couldn't wait to use it in action. The lens has NO AUTOFOCUS with the D60!!! What an incredible disappointment! How could a Nikon lens not have AF on a camera that was just released? This makes no sense but it works fine on a d300...no fair! Shots are sharp but it stinks to go back in time and have to manually focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I read every review in this item and decided to purchase. What I didn't notice was that it doesn't have a auto / manual focus switch. I am just an amateur photograpgher but it makes it almost impossible to capture the best portrait shots because you have to manually focus and constantly check it. When you do have to get an in-focus shot it is stunning, I'll admit. But I'm not sure why they would offer such a lens. I'll probably end up buying the similar lens with the auto focus now that I know. Hopefully this saves some people the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Thrifty Fifty\\" Is a Must for Your Camera Bag","review":"I purchased this lens for my D80 after I decided to try my hand at photographing my nephew's high school basketball game. The results were better than I hoped for. The low-light capability of this lens is great, and I got some great shots under the usual terrible gym lighting.This lens is indeed made of plastic, but when it delivers such sharp images with creamy bokeh - who cares? It was just the ticket for basketball action, but it also can be a great portait lens. The bokeh (background blur) really makes the subject stand out, delivering punchy images that anyone would be proud to hang on their wall.Order this lens - it will be the best ~$100 you've ever spent on your dSLR. It doesn't come with a lens hood, so I'd recommend purchasing that as well. Witht the light-gathering ability of this lens, it's more susceptible to lens flare, but with a lens hood this is dramatically reduced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nikon 50mm","review":"Nice lense but it does not work with a Nikon D5000.

Still doesn't feel as crisp as my 18-200, tho it def lets in more light, which is the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"good little lens","review":"I always carry my camera, but when it comes to \\"just regular\\" close range pics like at parties and just sitting around with family and friends this is the perfect lens. I can still be in the same room and not have to back all the way up. Pictures come out well even in low lighting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic lens for doll photography","review":"Yes, it's a BIT difficult to learn to use if you've always relied on point and shoot cameras prior to moving up to your DSLR, due to lack of auto-focus. However, it's a gorgeous lens that takes gorgeous photos. I'd recommend it for anyone considering close-up work with relatively static subjects, like doll photography.Lack of auto-focus makes it somewhat difficult to use on subjects that are moving around a lot, like cats or fidgety children, but it gives crisp, beautiful portraits of posed subjects.I'm a bit wary of prime lens because I like having the ability to zoom for wider use when I'm out and about, so I prefer saving this one only for posed subjects, but I have to say it does a much, much better job than ANY of my zoom lenses, even other ones manufactured by Nikon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even manually focusing, great lens for the money!","review":"I FINALLY bought this lens after much research! I didn't have the money to spend on an AF-S lens for my D40x, so I decided to buy this lens. I am so glad that I did! I have been taking a lot of pictures of my 2 little boys, and they have turned out so beautifully. It only manually focuses on my camera, but it isn't too hard, and it has been improving my photography skills. I would recommend this lens to anyone who owns a Nikon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing lens for the price!","review":"If you've been thinking about getting this lens, get it now.[...].I have a D40, so I have to focus it. I do like that I have to focus, because it makes me work a little harder to achieve amazing pics. Once it's in focus, it does a great job of capturing some very sharp pictures. As mentioned before, it performs very well in low light and it's very fast. I definitely recommend this lens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon 50mm, f/1.8 AF lens","review":"This lens is very sharp and is perfect for low light situations with a digital camera.

A lens cheap, but very powerfull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"I generally use kit lenses as I am new to the photog world, but after reading a few reviews here about this lens I decided to take a chance on it. What I wanted it for was low light pictures or pictures in the woods where a flash just isn't always useful. To this point the lens has proven in vaulable and I find myself wishing all my lens went as low as 1.8 so i didn't have to keep pulling this one out of the bag. I would buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is expected","review":"I am using the lens with a N65 camera.The lens is exactly what it claims. No Frills, but excellent for the price.

For me as an enthusiast I like this lens a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong for the $$$","review":"There are many reviews that go into great detail about this lens, but I just had to add my support. It seems so small and insignificant, yet produces such sharp and colorful images, especially in low light.

Otherwise It is a great deal and great quality for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop reading and buy it!","review":"Absolutely stunning. Not \\"stunning for the money\\" or \\"stunning considering build quality\\". Just flat out stunning.

It will make you a better photographer. The sharpness, light-gathering, and overall effect (\\"bokeh\\") simply have to be seen to be believed. In most situations, you do not need (and do not want to use) flash, as flash just deepens the lines on people's faces.I've been using it for five years and wish I'd bought it, along with a film-type Nikon camera, decades ago.The other superlative reviews do not overstate how worthwhile it is to use this wonderful lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon 50mm 1.8AF","review":"Nothing like a good , fast 50mm. On the Nikon 7000 it translates to a 75mm which is a great all around focal length. Shooting wide open or at F2 gives fantastic results to ISO 1600 or even 3200. This is the \\"older\\" less expensive version that Nikon offers. Works great. It gets a solid recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely sharp and a great bargain","review":"For the price, this is one of the best lenses you can buy. Since it goes to f1.8 it's extremely fast and works great in low light. At such a wide aperture you get a very narrow depth of field, which gives a nice effect. The only drawback is it lacks an internal motor, so it can only do manual focus with a D40 or D40x. It's not really a big deal once you get used to it, since the AF indicator still works to let you know when it's in proper focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A JOY TO USE","review":"On my D90 this lens is fast, sharp and accurate.

It's light, small, cheap yet well-made, and takes consistently great pictures.

Does not work on auto with certain Nikons but doing it manually isn't that bad. Gives a nice sharp image however I found the lens a little difficult to use and understand. Also, the your view is very constricted and would not be good to use on a day to day basis in my opinion.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect, given that you \\"zoom with your feet\\" so to get the photo you want, you physically move to the spot necessary to frame the shot as desired. I absolutely adore this lens. Lightweight, small, produces precise, crisp photos and lovely bokeh. My family traveled across 4 countries in 3 weeks this summer and I brought the Nikon D90, the kit lens that came with the camera, and this lens. I wound up using the 50mm f/1.8 almost every day! I switched to the other lens only to take photos of large buildings that were fairly close to me for example (in other words, using the 50mm, I wouldn't be able to get the entire building in the frame). My subjects include our garden, our kids, our dog, architecture, fabric. The Sony D90 with this lens captures indoor subjects with natural light unbelievably well. Good luck with this lens, you will be thrilled with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great glass","review":"The lense was everything I expected from professional opinions.

I don't really know anything about Nikon, but I figured this would be a rad lens. The problem is that it won't auto focus on the D40. I know I know, I should have researched it more and learned about it, but really? Come on, who makes a camera this day and age that can't auto focus with certain lenses. Whatever, I'm returning it and getting the 35mm 1.8. I played it with it a bit and it had some really nice results. Amazon also got it to be super quick, overnight actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Lens was received promptly and well package.

This info was not listed in the product overview, and I only learned this by reading the details in the manual after I bought the lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"This is a very sharp, lightweight, fast, small lens for Nikon SLR cameras. It will not autofocus with Nikon's entry-level cameras like the D40 or D60. You need to manual focus with the green focus-assist light. Fast autofocus prime lenses for the D40 are $400 and up, so this lens is a good value to help you decide if prime lenses are for you. Prime lenses take more time to compose your shots than zoom lenses, so the extra time to manual focus is not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent lens for this cost","review":"No doubt one can see the 1.8 magic. I found this lens a bit soft at 1.8 in low light. Apart from it, excellent bokeh and images. One of the best in line for Potrait shots"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little lens with big results!","review":"I was skeptical about this lens but after reading so many positive reviews, I just had to give it a try with my D90. I had looked at the 35mm and the 50mm f1.4 version but the prices are considerably more. I wanted an AF lens mainly for product shots and some occasional candid portraits. This lens certainly delivers the goods with nice sharp subjects and creamy soft backgrounds. It feels a bit plasticy but for under $100 the optics are very good. I haven't tried any low light shots or scenery yet but I'm sure this lens is more than capable. Obviously there is no zoom so you do have to move around a lot, but the trade off in sharpness and image clarity makes it a keeper. Highly recommend this lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to love","review":"Finally purchased this to use on my D80 after reading \\"all\\" the reviews and for the price, who can complain! In a nutshell, this lens is a perfect addition to any kit offering great low light-fast shooting and excellent picture quality. I used this lens to photograph a new baby in the family and it worked perfectly in a dimly lit hospital room without a speedlight to avoid blinding \\"new\\" eyes. The picture quality is sharp and beautiful and the 50mm is perfect for those closeup shots. I also recently used this lens while traveling and found it worked great for low light no flash shots in an aquarium and historical buildings. The only downside to having a fixed lens is that I found myself changing the lens frequently for landscape or wide angle shots. Aside from low light shooting, my Nikon 18-200mm VR lens stayed on the camera for the majority of the trip. Overall, this is a great inexpensive lens that offers great low light/indoor flexibility and beautiful quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lense. AF doesn't work with Nikon DX cameras though. . .","review":"This is a great lense. I didn't realize that the AF doesn't work with Nikon cameras that need DX lenses (I have the D3000.)

It is a small and light lens, so is useful when wanting to limit the bulkiness of the camera. However, while it reads a 50mm lens, since not all DSLRs are the same as a film camera, the range becomes a low range telephoto lens instead. Since it is a prime lens, you can't zoom out and need a big distance to walk backwards to take portraits and close up photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lens","review":"I bought this lens as an addition to a Nikon D3000 camera w/ 28-55 VR AF lens.

If I had it to do over, I would have gone for the 1.4D AF lens, but only because I picked up a classic N90s film camera recently and the lack of aperature ring on the \\"G\\" lens does not work with the older camera. But no complaints with my D300. Of course as with any prime lens, one must remember how to move forward and back (old school) instead of twisting the wrist to compose the image. My \\"go to\\" lenses are a 17-55mm and 24-70mm, both f2.8. When they are not fast enough or I am looking for bokeh, the 50mm/1.4 is light in the bag and always with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"This was my first purchase of my own from amazon. Very good lens.It's very light, I don't even want to use my other one (18-135mm) since this one is so tiny and cute.The only con would be that it doesn't zoom in or out, so all the photos appear to be extra close, otherwise 5+ product.Thank you Canon!!!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I dont own this lens I just have a question I was hoping someone could answer","review":"I have a Nikon d3000 (Nikons new entry level dslr not the d300) and really want this lens. I have shot with the 50 mm f1.4 lens before and it autofocuses just fine, but I was wondering if this lens would autofocus on my camera. If I have to manually focus it is not a big dealI just want to know before I buy it if this lens would autofocus. Anyone who caould answer my question that would be really helful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Portrait Lens!","review":"I bought this after it was recommended to me by a friend. It is a very fast lens and great for portrait photography! I will warn you though that you will want to step down to f2.2 as the f1.8 can be a little soft. It can also be a little too tight on a DX camera for indoor photography (you'll have to have room to back up). Overall, it is a great lens and a steal at this price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great when you get it right","review":"Takes beautiful portrait shots when it's focused correctly. It can be a bit fussy. I'm still learning/playing with this lens, so maybe I'll get more consistent results once I have more experience with it. The great thing about digital photography is not having to pay for any wasted film from experimenting! Where I've been frustrated with the blurry shots, I'm super pleased with the ones that have turned out. It took some wonderful low-light shots at Christmas. This lens is very, very flattering on the faces of my kids. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens!","review":"This lens is wonderful for close up work and portraits. I've used it for close up macro work as well, when paired with a 10x optical filter. It takes exceptional photos, and is very clear and sharp. It will not AF on the Nikon D60, but no matter, for close up work you would want to manually focus the lens anyway. This lens is really sharp, and is a great addition to any kit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every dollar on this \\"tiny\\" lens","review":"A great lens for an amateur photography lover. Fast and sharp if you know how to use it correctly. It works well on my Nikon DSLR D60, but I understand that the auto-focus is not working. It takes some practice to master the manual focus. Great on DOF and low natural lighting. Recommend to all beginners who are serious on photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens!","review":"I am a novice photographer mom who needed an inexpensive lens to take pictures of my young kids. This lens has not disappointed! Love the low f-stop to give me those nice blurry backgrounds. I constantly get comments on what great pictures I have, and I give full credit to this lens. Even when I put my Nikon d90 in Auto mode, it still does not disappoint. Unfortunately, I am not an experienced enough photographer to give the technical details that some of the other reviewers have, but for all of you mommies with cameras out there, this lens is perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"This is an amazing piece of work by nikon.

So, the crop factor is that of a 75mm.This is my first lens...and I am extremely happy with it. The broad headroom afforded by the f/1.8 aperture provides dramatic DOF effects. However, I rarely stop below f/3.5. The focus ring is plastic and feels a little cheap but it stays in focus.Aside from wanting a wider-angle lens in addition to this, I don't see any reason to replace/upgrade my Nikkor 50mm f/1.8D AF anytime soon.If lost/broken/stolen, I'd probably get it again (@ $125).[ Camera: Nikon D3100 ]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens for the money","review":"Great lens for the money.

I've found it! This lens arrived an hour ago and I am already using it well enough to take the grandkids photos on Thanksgiving without a flash. I own a Nikon D3000 so the auto focus does not work with my camera. However, there is a light that flickers then stays lit as you manually focus the lens in the viewfinder. I wear glasses so I was concerned about relying on my own eyes but once I read about the focus light I decided to give it a try. Works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I am in love with this lens! I bought a D50 with the 28-80 kit lens.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well for the Price","review":"Although I like the hefty metal Nikon 50mm f/1.4D better this plastic lens does a great job and is a third of the price. I see some say it is cheap and breaks. I have always been careful with my equipment so to me common sense takes over on how you treat your equipment. I have used this lens for some time with no issues and it helps produce some great shots for me whether on my D80, or D200. Shop around as often you can find it cheaper, but also lookout for refurbished, meaning that often the term is in small print. I have bought refurbed items and fortunately never have had any problems, but if you don't want refurb just make sure you read the entire description whether amazon, ebay etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome lens!","review":"This lens is really great. It's my first prime lens and I have been very pleased with the purchase. It really makes you think about image composition and planning your shot. I think my next purchase will be the 24mm lens as I need something a bit wider for hiking. However, for portrait photography, this is simply the best lens I have ever got. Sharpness is amazing and ease of use equally so. I highly recommend purchasing this lens for your kit. You will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a lot of fun","review":"I am not very experienced photographer, but I can say that we really can capture the true light with this lens.

(I also have a 18 - 135 f3.5 and a 70 - 300 VR f 4.5).

If you enjoyed Kris's images in Roffman's book \\"Three\\", you will love this tribute to him and glimpse we get into Kris's life. These very intimate pictures show Kris over a period of three years, as he matures from a rather shy young man to the handsome, confident, young man he is now. This blond Adonis has the ability to hold anyone's gaze just by being himself and displaying his natural good-looks, and eroticism. Only a talented photographer like Roffman could bring the natural beauty of this youth to these 80 pages of black and white photos in such a sensitive way. Roffman is the author of six best selling books of photographs, and this is one of his best! This book of nude-images will be a lasting addition to any collector's library! Enjoy.Joe Hanssen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, pleasing but not quite his best.","review":"I like Roffman's work. I like his models and his style.Pictures of Kris, \\"with the highly tuned intimacy for which Roffman's pictures are known\\", gives us a glimpse into Kris's life over a period of three years. Kris, one of the Three from Roffman's collection of pictures of the same name, matures from a rather shy youth to a confident young man, whose clear gaze and natural eroticism have already bewitched many an observer.His previous book of Johan Paulik was slightly better than this, perhaps because it contained solo photographs but nonetheless, Pictures of Kris is a worthy addition to your coffee table or bookshelf.

The book was so well written, earthy and well paced that I was sorry I could not find any joy in reading it. I don't mind some horrible scenes and sadness (it was 1546) but I wanted to scream at the total lack of happiness or hope. If you like feeling down and depressed, this is the one for you.

I was very disappointed. I felt it was poorly written and edited. The plot was mediocre and the entire story line was just not up to par. The rivalry between the two lieutenants was sophmoric and the ending was inane. Why not let us know how Lt. Dixon made it back to brigade hq and how the platoon was rescued.

The characters are one-dimensional, and lack his former depth. The story almost feels \\"un-Coyle\\" in that it remains with one view-point throughout the story, and still fails to follow a clear, concise line. His former technical and tactical proficiency has also fallen by the wayside. As a serving sergeant in the Army, it is a dissapointment sometimes to see our profession mispoke of. Coyle has done a good job in the past of avoiding this, putting in much time and research. This feels as if he wrote it while on the run, for quick money. For a better, more in-depth read, try \\"The Ten Thousand\\". And let us hope he shakes his pursuers and is able to return to his former proficiency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coyle goes Clancy on us","review":"I bought this book because Coyle wrote it, and I love Coyle. Unfortunately, Coyle has gone the way of Clancy in his later books--too much unnecessary verbiage just for the sake of verbiage. Too much discussion of a second lieutenant's place in the modern army.

Personally, While I could identify with both protagonists, I tired of their characters early on. The author's coverage of Reider's internal struggles (new second lieutenants are filled with self-doubt. . .shocker!!) went on. . .and on. . .and on. . .and on. Similarly, Nathan Dixon's character got old quickly(tho' a bit less quickly). Finally, the author did a poor job developing the characters of the enlisted men and NCOs.Lastly, unlike his other books I've read, there really was no \\"tiering\\" of the drama. In previous books, we would have been privy to the happenings at Fort Apache and we would've been with Seargeant Taylor when his Bradley Fighting Vehicles were attacked. This book, much like the soldiers of 3rd Platoon, rambled along in the fog (as I write this review, I wonder if that was the point).Bottom line: if you like military fiction, it is worth a checkout from public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coyle's Worst","review":"This book was frustrating. Too much was missing or unexplained. For example - What was Dixon's performance in Idaho which was referred to but never described? How were the Hungarians captured just before the end?

Imagine my disappointment when I couldn't get it to calibrate! The first step in the calibration process is totally nonintuitive. After a frustrating period, I finally finished the calibration process only to find that when I began the flight program the plane immediately took a huge roll to the left! Some of the reviewers reported frustrating experiences with tech support. I ran into the same situation. I got the calibration download but, it didn't help at all. In the long run I wasted a lot of valueable time. I wound up buying Microsoft's Sidewinder Precision 2 which installed easily, has programmable buttons and was well worth the extra ten bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad until it stops working correctly","review":"Stop working after 2 months, it became totaly limp.

There is literally no excuse for software installs to lock up a system, requiring a full restore to fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissapointed customer","review":"i bought this joystick a while ago and never used it much. at first i strictly used it for racing games so i never knew that it was broken. when i push foward it only regesters a little bit and when i put it back to its original position it thinks im pushing down and messes up my gameplay. it has no nutrel position, it dosent spring back to the right position and leans to the bottom. every time i plug in the FF it starts to violently shake foward and back, even during gameplay, but without it the nutrel position is even more indefinite. as for the stick itself, the palm rest on it tends to make you shift the weight of your hand to the right and taking the stick along with it.the problems with the FF and the controls might have been because of damage during shipping or someting like that, but it could happen to you. anyway, im not happy with this design, get a sidewinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weakling.","review":"I have two Sidewinder 2s and there was a shortage a while ago.

It is not worth the money.One of the Sidewinder 2s broke after three years recently, and I am looking for replacements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"It's too complicated.

The one I bought from Radio Shack does everything the Logitech does, and is more stable, for less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought the WingMan Force 3D to use with Microsoft's Return of Arcade Anniversary Edition software. Both of them were supposed to send you back to the days of playing the Ms. Pac-Man and Pac-Man arcade games. None of this came true. The joystick is not capable of the quick movements required to play these games. Now we're only talking about up, down, left, and right!! The range of motion required for these basic steps is much too great to get the proper reaction time. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Force Feedback Rules","review":"Force Feedback (TM) technology is great. This thing does kick like a mule. It is no doubt a good joystic. But you only really truly in need of a joystick for flight simulators and air combats. Since I am not really into this, I do not enjoy this product as much as a true enthusiast probably would. Also, do follow the instructions and install the softeare before you plug the joystick into the USB port, otherwise it may not work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad while it lasted.","review":"When I first tried out the Logitech Wingman Joystick, it was great. Good control and feedback affects. However, six months later, the stick has lost its x/y axis and can not be recalibrated.

Sent back the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice stick- for a while...","review":"I have had two Logotech sticks: the first, Logitech's Wingman 3D. It lasted a year and a half, but toward the end lost center and never recovered. My second, this one, lasted for 3 months. Then the twist started to go leaving me guessing where neutral on my rudder was (every time). I have read of others who have had similar centering issues: it is a good product out of the box, but the quality of components inside the base are not what I expect.I ended up replacing it with a Saitek Evo Cyborg Force- it may cost a little more, but it is much more adjustable, and the feel is more substantial to me.I won't be buying Logitech again from my experience. Some others may have had better luck- but from the centering issue, well that's pretty basic in any flight sim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great force feedback but horrible centering","review":"So I read a bunch of reviews on here and gave this stick a try for Microsoft Flight Sim 2004 [the only \\"game\\" I \\"play\\"]. Installation was a breeze. The force feedback was excellent, and simulated well the forces on the control surfaces! I had a horrible time trying to get a little simulated Cessna to fly level for instance - the centering on the stick is terrible, even after playing around with sensitivities and the null zone galore. After 30 minutes of a short flight, my wrist was aching. Trying to keep pitch was pretty difficult too, especially while landing. I must add that I'm a southpaw, and using a right-handed stick was probably a bad idea to start with. I don't know if the experience would be different for right-handers. Anyway, I decided not to risk carpal-tunnel, and it's on its way back to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain awesome","review":"I have only used this Joystick for several hours but I can say without a doubt it is just plain awesome. The feedback is great, setup is extremely easy, and the accuracy with which it operates is so realistic I forget that I am at home and not in the aircraft I am flying. The only improvement might be to light up the translucent plastic in the base for true nighttime fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash and Burn","review":"The design/ ergonomics are ok, but it feels cheaply made, and,when not playing in force feedback mode, it lacks the precise handling qualities of,say, a CH Fighterstick. Even worse, the Logitech's force feedback feature died about a year after purchase. I have recently purchased a Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback 2 and I find that it is much more substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I went back to my old buggy joystick after using this thing. Since the stick has no natural center point, if you let go it will fall off center. This becomes increasingly annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"stick figure","review":"This is a great book by Lori Gottlieb. It always has you wanting to read on. It had me doing that, really a great non-fiction book. I know how hard it is to write about yourself, but she did it with such easy, which really caught my eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"11?!?!?","review":"Are you kidding me? Was this really Lori when she was 11? I'm 11, and I'm reading this book and this girl is so immature. She acts like a four year old or something. I've only just gotten to the part where she's at her aunt and uncles and wont eat, but she seems like the only reason she's not eating is because she doesn WANT too. As if she's just doing it to piss off her parents. Sure she throws in a couple \\"Oh my thighs are so fat\\"'s, but really this book is more about growing up then being anorexic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not read this twice...","review":"Honestly, I'm still struggling with my eating disorder I've had for 6 years, and for some reason I'm falling into a rough patch. So I picked this book up looking for some triggering material. I didn't really get anything out of it. Not even psychological explanations that normally come with a book on eating disorders. The book is cute, to say the most, and I would recommend it for seriously bored human beings. I wouldn't call it triggering really, so I might let my niece read it one day when she's old enough to understand the concept of an eating disorder, and when I know that she over the age of aquiring one. So I suppose this book is for the mature audience who has been through that part of her life. Very easy reading also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable Book","review":"Stick Figure is a remarkable book, both deeply disturbing and humorous in turn. Perhaps the most compelling aspect of Gottlieb's story is the voice in which it is told. The author is an intelligent, perceptive and fiesty eleven-year-old that tells things exactly as they are. These qualities are the source of many funny episodes as Lori, in demanding the same verbal honesty from others, exposes the hypocrisy of adults around her. Sadly though, they also, I suspect, contribute to her undoing. Reading everything from her mother's magazines to Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Lori seeks to emulate her older role models and becomes so obsessed with dieting and looking thin, she ends up in the hospital. Fortunately for her, and for us, she recovers and lives to tell her story. I enjoyed this book immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe a good read, if you are 10 years old","review":"I was really excited about reading this book, being a former anoretic myself and reading all the reviews that claimed it was a great read but I have to say I was very disappointed! I thought the book was rather repetitive and did not manage to keep me interested, maybe because it talks about kid stuff like boy-girl party and how dramatic everything is in her little 11 years old world. If you want to know about anorexia nervosa, read Wasted by Marya Hornbacker instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking, compelling","review":"I admire this author's willingness to bare her truths, no matter how stark, and her unflinching honesty. I found myself nodding in agreement at our society's obsession with weight and it is easy to see how so many young girls and women buy into the idea that weight is everything. I read in it two sittings and was duly impressed. great first effort....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hm.","review":"I couldn't help but be a bit offended by this book. I mean, I read the whole thing and it wasn't terrible, but it didn't portray eating disorders in a way that I would want individuals who have not suffered from the disorder themselves to see. \\"Wasted\\" by Marya Hornbacher is much more realistic and a better use of one's reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"read Wasted instead","review":"it was entertaining, but not what i expected. i was so excited to buy it, then very disapointed. read Wasted instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining if not helpful","review":"I appreciate this book for the way it is written (it really is Gottlieb's childhood journal and she was a smart, funny kid) but I'm not sure it's a valuable account of anorexia. She felt pressure to be thin so she stopped eating. Then she realized it was wrong and started again. If this was really all there was to anorexia, if one could just decide logically to stop it, people wouldn't die of it. Just the same, there are worse ways to spend an evening than reading this. More interesting than her anorexia is her insight into how American women treat men like infants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I find the people who are insulted with this book highly entertaining. This is NOT supposed to be some complicated scientific approach to anorexia. If you are doubting that this was really written by an 11 year old girl maybe it is only because you are insecure with the fact that you weren't as smart and as aware as this little girl was at that age. Seriously people, this is not supposed to be some hardcore case study on the causes and effects of eating disorders. Take it for what it is: a diary written by an 11 year old who unfortunately had a downward spiral. Stop being so damn cynical and hateful towards things you don't agree with."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want substance this book is NOT for you","review":"I entered this book wanting to like it--experiences involving eating disorders intrigue me, besides the fact that I suffer myself. However, I found this book to fully lack substance and definitely did not mesh with my needs of a well-written thought-provoking book. All this book is is some woman's diary from when she was eleven, which I felt was quite flat and never really entered the psychological depth behind eating disorders. In the end I'm glad it only took me two hours to whip through, despite utter dissapointment. If you want a good read, I recommend Marya Hornbacher's Wasted--I can't tell you how many times I've read it and still find myself lost and found in her world."},{"rating":"1","title":"too superficial","review":"This book should be classified Young Adult reading, I don't think the writing would hold the average adult's interest. Could the author mention ANY more often how gifted and wonderful she was in her eyes? This was unusual, for a child who apparently thought highly of herself to create issues with food. Eating disorders are so complex and I felt the author came off as a rebellious brat who didn't really have an illness, just a power trip she was winning. It didn't seem that her thoughts/feelings around eating changed, it was like she said, \\"Oh, okay... I'm bored with starving myself now.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Beverly Hills Brat\\"","review":"There is a review of this book here that calls Gottlieb a \\"Beverly Hills brat,\\" and I'm sort of ashamed to say I agree with that particular appellation. This should have remained in the realm of \\"diary.\\" Overblown prose in bad need of an editor crossed with a poor understanding of the topic (herself!) makes for some sadly self-indulgent nonsense. There isn't much sympathy to be mustered up for the \\"brat\\" who thinks her tale of woe quite so interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXACTLY LIKE ME WHEN I WAS HOSPITALIZED.","review":"I actually cried when I first read this book. I have never related to a character as much as I related to young, sarcastic, Lori. People may say she is immature but what they don't realize is when you are dying it is very hard to be kind to everyone. You can barely function. I was in the hospital for 3 months 3 years ago when I was 13 and I made the same slightly immature comments to the nurses, everything. This book IS very realistic. The only thing I found less than realistic was that all of Lori's friends were dieting when she was only 11. This is clearly not going to happen. But 11 is by no means too young to have an e.d. I have met 9 year olds in my treatment. All in all an excellent book that explores childhood anorexia in all it's horrors, but with wit and hilarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but this is not an authentic diary","review":"I defer to a previous reviewer who stated, \\"This book was no more written by an 11-year-old than it was written by my Himalayan cat.\\" This book sounds like an adult desperately trying to sound 11. I also found the book lacking in any real or useful substance. It's more like a Juvenile Fiction book--interesting while reading it, but ultimately forgettable. In absolutely no WAY is this book as \\"amazing as Wasted!\\" (by Marya Hornbacher)!! For an infinitely better book than \\"Stick Figure,\\" I highly recommend \\"Diary of an Anorexic Girl\\" by Morgan Menzie. Really insightful, funny at times, and beautifully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Celebration of the 11 Year Old Mind","review":"I highly recommend this book to all people who have any 11 year olds in their life. Lori's 11 year old mind reflects what any bright, thoughtful, questioning 11 year old might think if only she/he allowed herself to think out loud. The conclusions she comes to based on her observations of adult behavior are hysterically funny and frightenly accurate. Many of these refer to food, but other's are just about life in general.While especially helpful to anyone wanting to understand the beginnings of eating disordered thinking, this book is just a plain good read for anyone who enjoys seeing life from another's perspective.Thanks to Lori for sharing this part of her life with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me understand -PELASE READ-","review":"One of my best friends (who is now in a physc ward for slitting her wrist) was anorexic... she didnt actully tell me she was... but you could tell. I had no idea y someone so great, would want to ruin her life in such a sad way. This book made me see y, it made me understand y some people do this. After reading this book i knew how to talk to my friend, i knew what to expect in her responses. I told her about this book... and she read it... she got some help afterwards. As for her slitting her wrist... im now starting to read up on that subject... maybe someday I'll understand that too. Im not saying cutting and starving yourself is good, but the book makes you look at anorexia a little differently.

Buy this book if you can afford the ten-bucks for fire starter in your fireplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"No emotion!","review":"This book was all facts and little emotion and feeling. She didn't explain the deep down feelings and the pain associated with anorexia. Very little depth into her treatment. It was an interesting book to read but if you're looking for honest and raw emotion read \\"Wasted : A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia\\" by Marya Hornbacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!!!1","review":"Why our Catholic high school is making our kids read this book - that reinforces pathetic stereotypes of girls, bad relationships with their moms, uses dirty words and culminates with a trite rendition of - what else - a girl who handles her 'coming of age' not with strength, dignity and guts, but, alas, an eating disorder. Don't get me wrong - that's a real deal but to have our nations teens - nations girls - read this drivel is downright sad. They need MORE BOOKS ABOUT GIRLS WHO SHOW STRENGTH THRU ADOLESENCE, NOT THIS GARBAGE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I actually finished","review":"Eventhough I have sons and am well past 11 years old, I really enjoyed this brisk and witty take of growing up,mother-daughter relationships and self image. I like the quick pacing but the ending was really abrupt and I don't know if overcomimg anorexia is really so simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shallow Look at a Disturbing Subject","review":"I was quite disturbed by this book, not because of the subject matter, but by the cavalier treatment of it. The final resolution was scripted enough for a sitcom; does such a terrible disorder really just go away from one look in a mirror? I also was a little put off by Lori Gottlieb's self-aggrandizing attitude toward her intelligence. And the life-sized portrait on the back cover did nothing to dissuade my opinion of her as a self-absorbed Beverly Hills brat."},{"rating":"1","title":"This woman has not recovered","review":"Although this book has some nominal entertainment and educational value, it left me irritated and insulted. Ms. Gottlieb was an eleven year old crying out for affection and attention, but instead conveys her \\"former self\\" through her over-achievement as an eleven year old and her mother's inadequacies. Her tone comes across as arrogant and less than believable. This coupled with the seductively posed author photo on the book jacket leaves me wondering if Ms. Gottlieb 'gets it' when it comes to the fact that a woman/girls self-worth should not be wrapped up so closely with Sex-appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloss over story","review":"The book is a dismissive attempt to address a very serious subject matter. One day, Lori decides to become anorexic, another day, she decides to eat again. Along the way, she verbally assaulted doctors, nutritionists, school counselors, friends and her family. The most offensive aspect of the book is this 11 year old's personality. I am sure there are many young adolescents that deal with serious eating disorders, hopefully they are not as mean spirited as Lori was. The author may like to believe she was \\"persecuted\\" because she liked math more than shopping, but this girl was \\"left out\\" and \\"unpopular\\" because she made it difficult to like her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a mockery.","review":"I have read many books on eating disorders. While I somewhat appreciated the lighter side of this book, as eating disorders are very serious issues, it almost seemed as though she was mocking people with eating disorders. That's just how it came across to me, and I'm not sure why. The story didn't seem to have a real ending- she shows no signs of complete recovery or destined to a life in hospitals. I feel like it was written just as a \\"me too\\" type of story- everyone wants credit for their own little story to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking...","review":"As I am in recovery myself, I expected to find something I could relate to in this book. However, I found that the case of Ms. Gottlieb just didn't ring true to life. This book does little to portray the grip of obsession that anorexia can have over one's life, nor did it describe the heartbreak that can come with this disorder. Most troubling was the book's conclusion, in which Lori seemed to realize, in a bolt-from-the-blue fashion, that her eating disorder wasn't worth it. Amazing how a person could magically get over an eating disorder so quickly! To recover from anorexia requries a lot of effort, and although I'm sure Lori Gottlieb must have put forth that effort in her own life, she certainly didn't clearly portray that in her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I can't describe it. I bought this book and finished it in 1 week, which is great for me. ;) I found myself thinking about the characters all day and couldn't wait to get home to read more of it!MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful book from a precocious inner child","review":"Reading this book, it is hard to imagine these are the words from Gottlieb's diary. She has insight and wisdom beyond her years. Her books takes the reader down a path of pain and abandonment, of a young girl seeking only her parent's love and approval. The reader feels as if he is right there along with Gottlieb, seeing how people around her judge her without understanding her. The explainations behind the eating-disordered thinking are impeccable. The reader easily can see why Gottlieb thought this way. My only criticism of this book, if there is one, is that Gottlieb seemed to end too abruptly. The transition from deathly ill to well again was unnaturally short. Gottlieb's work represents a wonderful statement on society and eating disorders. I highly recommend this book ... and could only hope all media executives would as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I highly recommend this book. As someone that has struggled with ED's for over ten years I could very much relate. I also think this would be an excellent book for anyone that has a daughter to read. Lori's feelings and descriptions are so dead-on when it comes to the mind of young girls (how quickly you seem to remember when reading). As it has been described before, it does read very much like a novel. An excellent choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"There is no way in haydes this was really written by an 11 year old.

Stick Figure is excellent - funny, touching, logical, and just a plain good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, Surfacy, and a Bore","review":"As a former anoretic I found the off-handed, immature approach to the disease insulting. It makes anoretics appear shallow, stupid, and sarcastically trivial. I absolutely could not relate to the experience of the author. Yes, she makes some stabs at dry humor throughout, but it only makes her careless treatment of the disease all the more distasteful. To truly relate to the heart of an anoretic, read Wasted by Marya Hornbacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Revaltion","review":"When Lori was first developing and going through her eating disorder it seemed extremely true to life. I myself have an eating disorder and I could relate to her denial and the control that EDs can have on your mind. However, although it happened to her, the way that she understands and changes her eating disorder is COMPLETELY out of the ordinary. I don't think I would recommend this book to an ED victim because I think that they would be waiting to see their \\"skinny self\\" in the mirror. For most ED patients, this never happens. Even after they get the ED under control they will never see themselves as this. Through treatment you learn to accept yourself regardless of how you look, but that never changes how it looks in the mirror. Lori was very lucky to be able to see the destruction she was doing to herself, but for most people, they will never see that image in the mirror. God Bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus","review":"This book was no more written by an 11-year-old girl than it was written by my Himalayan cat. I don't doubt it was inspired by Ms. Gottleib's real-life experiences or even her actual childhood diary, but the narrative style is so obviously contrived it cannot possibly be that of a young girl. I would have preferred to read the author's story in her own, adult words; while there may in fact be serious cultural and social issues at stake here, I put the book aside almost immediately since I couldn't get past the idea that I was being duped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, But With Too Much Unfinished Business","review":"This is a wonderfully written novel about betrayal, forgiveness, and redemption.

We are led thru the young family's life in Shanghai, and their separation when Eve (her mother) and Anna return to the states without Joseph.He tells Anna that he wrote his journals so she will understand why he did what he did.

You will not be sorry for having taken the time to read Bo Caldwell's amazing achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distant Land of my Father, Bo Caldwell","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author painted a very vivid picture of not only the culture and architecture of the times, but of the people with an inward glance to their feelings and emotions. There was an intense accuracy to the horrors of war, without portraying more detail than was necessary to tell the story. It was helpful to see it through a childs eyes, which gave it a certain innocence. You felt protected as she did from some of the truths, which only revealed themselves to her later in life.I recommend it for lovers of historical fiction, it is about a time in fairly current history, that not all of us fathomed or imagined, even though we lived in a parallel time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous read.","review":"Hard to believe it's not autobiographical.

Sadly, as Shanghai itself is transformed into a government bureaucracy?s vision of modernity, books such as this are one are some of the few surviving places that the old city lives on. Ironically, the main characters infatuation with Shanghai can be seen again with the large influx of foreigners returning to the city in the past five years.

I felt like I was really seeing the Shanghai through the eyes of a child and a piece of military history from a very unique point of view - from someone whose civilian life was incredibly changed by the events of the time.

I felt the child's adoration of her father and her deep desire of his approval and love. Her feelings of abandonment were real to me.

It is interesting that the ONLY review, other than this one, comes from his half brother and a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but can use an update","review":"I got this lens to supplement my Nikkor 70-200 f/2.8 VR lens for daytime outdoor sports. The lens is sharp and a bargain and should be in your bag if you shoot distant subjects. Used with the Nikkor TC-14E II (1.4x) Teleconverter AF-S, there is no loss of sharpness which pleasantly surprised me. The only issue is the open area at the mount which could possibly allow dust into the aperture area. With the TC-14E II mounted on the lens, the issue vanishes. The f/2.8 version is something like four times the price of this gem, so it is certainly worth the bucks. VR would help when this oldish D lens is updated, but it would make it heavier and not as easy to use hand held. I do use it mostly with a tripod or monopod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikkor 300mm f/4 ed-if af-s","review":"Excellent lens so far. I was able to handhold it much easier than I had expected, even with a 1.4x teleconverter attached. The images were very clear. I have only had the lens for about 1 month but am glad I purchased it. I will probably leave the teleconverter on most of the time for birds. Birds do still have to be fairly close. For small or distant birds, I think a 500mm or 600mm lens would be better, but they are much more expensive and heavier. I do not miss the vr so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor sharp images","review":"I will not get into a lengthy discussion using technojargon that most people could care less about..........the bottom line...........this is one of the best lenses that Nikon has ever produced, and the images this lens turns out are razor sharp..............you will NOT be disappointed with your investment in this lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"tasty but dry, and the seeds aren't kidding","review":"These bars had a pleasant granola-bar-type flavor, and the varieties were very true to their names.The texture is light and crispy.The tiny hard flecks of what I presume are hemp can make the eating experience somewhat tedious. These small bits are entirely edible but are harder than anything else I consider food."},{"rating":"2","title":"To those who love Beatrix Potter, this book is a must!","review":"This is a delightful Victorian mystery. We are introduced to a wonderful Beatrix Potter, and we get to meet characters from her books - like Jemima Puddle Duck, Peter Rabbit, Mrs. Tiggy-Wiggle. Plus we get to see more of feisty Kate Ardleigh. This is the second book in the Kate Ardleigh series and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The characters are warm and fun, and the Victorian times are depicted so wonderfully! The murder and mayhem are good and of course half the fun is in the detecting of who actually did the dastardly deed! I am enjoying this series, and if you like warm, funny Victorian mysteries, you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great ... Sounds great ... Easy to use","review":"Easy to load and delete music with simple interface. Holds its charge a long time. Music sounds great and doesn't \\"skip\\" when running. Fairly priced also. Neat storage area for earphones when not in use. Sunglasses look pretty stylish also."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Monsterous Failure","review":"Ray Ferry is at it again. The book has no insite and gives nothing new to the fans. It rehashes material produced for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Classic T.P. from Ferry !","review":"Once again...this is another over-priced inferior re-hashed Ray Ferry Book which, like his previous books, seems to be best suited to be used as T.P. I just bought the 2006 Book \\" A Celebration of Monsters: Universal Studios by Martin Owens & I paid $ 17.43 for it in new condition. Owens book is 1000 X better than this dribble by Ferry who has pretended to be a monster film afficianado & historian for years. Don't waste your time or money on this one....the only thing Ferry is a good at is being a Classic Pretender !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get's Boring Pretty Quickly","review":"The jacket drew me in...first time I've read one of Jane Heller's books. Chapter 1 kept my interest, Chapter 2 I started to lose interest, and by Chapter 5 - I was wondering if it was ever going to get better. It didn't. I read it...but was disappointed.First of all, this female character isn't very intelligent. The main male charater is totally unrealistic. No Fortune 500 CEO would waste the time of day doing what this guy did...... It was totally unbelievable. It was suppose to poke fun...but I just didn't get it and thus didn't find any of it amusing at all. Oh yea, except for Chapter 1............. I probably won't read any more Jane Heller's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Intelligence?","review":"Now, I'm not an elitist, I love books like \\"Briget Jones' Diary\\", and \\"Amanda's Wedding\\" (Highly recomended); but this book was terrible. It's not only the frivolous nature or the impracticality of the book that made it so bad; but characters were flat and shallow, the plot was innane and predictable, and the events that took place would never happen. This book was so disappointing. The \\"two stars\\" are for the fact that it is not the worse book in the world, and some parts are funny, and- who knows? you might even like it; even though it's mostly bad. It started off \\"okay\\", so I stuck it through the end- but I still didn't like it. I have to strongly emphasize, if you are thinking of buying this book- DO NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to real female intelligence","review":"I have to admit I was sucked in by this book's title, but I should have trusted my own instincts and dropped it the minute I realized how terrible it was. The only thing worth reading in \\"Female Intelligence\\" is the dust jacket. The premise is decent -- worthy, even. But I found myself routinely saying -- out loud, mind you -- \\"Oh, come ON! She can't be this dumb!\\" The book's main character, Dr. Lynn Wyman, is supposed to be a therapist who wows the pop-psych-loving public with her \\"woman-speak\\" therapy for men. In reality, she's a complete idiot who can't see the most obvious plot points creeping up in her life. The dialogue is horrifically unrealistic (don't authors read anything out loud before they publish?) and her supposed heroine is a ninny. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read all of it, but just barely","review":"In the book's favor, the desire to find out what would happen kept me reading until the end, but that was all that kept me going.This book was not well-written, had over-the-top stereotypes as characters, was funny in about two places, was badly edited, and was very formulaic. I would not read another book of Ms. Heller's. Luckily, I didn't buy this one: it was loaned to me by a friend. I recommend reading Bridget Jones again or reading _Simply Divine_ if you want a decent novel of this type."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far her worst","review":"I'm a big fan of Ms. Heller, but I don't know what she was thinking when she wrote this book. It was by far her worst, and it may even be one of the worst books I've ever read.The main character, Lynn, was just a total nitwit. For someone who was supposed to be such an expert in language and communications, it was totally unbelievable to me that she could be that naive and stupid. And the character of Brandon was close on her heels in the unbelievability department.The supporting cast, the premise, everything...just stunk. The only thing that kept me from giving this book 1 star was my respect for Ms. Heller's previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I took this book out of the library as it had a catchy title and I had read good reviews of other books written by Jane Heller. If this is indicative of her work, I will not be reading more titles by this author. Although the book started off promising, as soon as Lynn becomes involved with Brandon (about one third of the way through) it goes completely down hill. Although Lynn is supposed to be this brillant PhD, she is incredibly stupid as the reader can see the plot turns coming a mile away. I had to force myself to finish this book. The only reason I did not give it one star is because I enjoyed the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't love it","review":"I didn't care for this Jane Heller book. I found the dialogue stilted and the plot a parody - just not based enough in reality for my taste. And I would never want a guy who went through the Wyman Method - yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Terrible, unbelievable dialogue. Example, from a woman: \\"Between work and the kids, I barely have time to take a crap.\\" This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Okay to Make Fun of People","review":"The reviewers who stated that they didn't like the book for a variety of reasons, just didn't understand what JH was trying to say. JH was making fun of how males/females communicate. JH wasn't trying to write a \\"know it all\\" book on the subject. She was shedding light on a very humorous issue. I think a lot of the reviewers saw themselves in the \\"scripts\\" and they didn't like what they read. If you can't laugh at how differently men and women think, then you won't enjoy this book.I enjoyed the book. It was easy to read. Each character stood alone. I would have given it 5 stars if the epilogue would have included information about the \\"friends\\" and her assistant. It seems JH forgot they existed in the epilogue. That was a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God for libraries!","review":"I've read all of Jane Heller's previous books...and sadly to say, this was by far her WORST one ever written! Where was the wit? I laughed ONCE and only ONCE! The plot? Weak, tired, and made absolutely no sense whatsover! I found it ironic that the title would have the word \\"intelligence\\" when there was barely any to be found in the book. By the time I was midway in Part Two, I was thankful that I didn't buy the book and just checked it out from the library..it barely held my interest. I hung in there, HOPING that Ms. Heller would redeem herself somewhere in the rest of the book, (boy was I ever hoping!) I suspect that the next book Ms. Heller writes, I'll rent it from the library again..just to make sure I don't get suckered twice! In the meantime..I'm hoping Ms. Heller takes some vacation time and try to restore some creative engery...she could use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still hopeful ......","review":"I have read all of Jane Heller's books. I loved Cha Cha Cha and hope that Ms. Heller's next book is more along the lines of that title. I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed in her latest novel as it was extremely thin. More of a romance novel then general fiction. I do enjoy Ms. Heller's style of writing which is what got me through this book. The reader never had a chance to really get into any of the characters. I did develop a better understanding of men though! I still look forward to her next book but hope there is more to it than this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little unbelievable","review":"This book was a little unbelievable, but it did keep me reading. I went form having little or no sympathy for Lynne to having more as she confronted her own communication issues and learned from them. The characters were somewhat under-developed. As a reader, it was frusterating to know who betrayes Lynne before she's willing to believe it herself. A fast read that does lightly examine the communication isseus between men and women. Though the book does ove simplify the subject, it's still a page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was drawn to this book because of the great things I heard about the book/author and the humor of the plot. Boy was I dissappointed. I kept waiting for the laughs to start and only found one line that delivered. Although teaching men to communicate with women was a great concept for a book, I found the character teaching men to say things like \\"Gee ___, I don't know about you but I don't how I'm going to keep that mousse I ate last night from going right to my thighs\\". If my husband ever said that I'd have his head checked. If you want laughs, read the awesome Janet Evanovich, Mr. Perfect by Linda Howard or Anne George."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyed every page","review":"A few years ago I read Heller's The Club and loved it. Then I somehow forgot her and was reminded by a friend who'd just reviewed this title for amazon. This book is a really fun read, and it makes some good points without being preachy--i.e., that both men and women have a lot of the same faults and both can change for the better if they want to. I particularly enjoyed the major characters. Personally, I'd go out with Brandon Brock in a New York minute, even before his sensitivity training. He could call me Honey at a Yankees game too. I'm going to start looking at the other Jane Heller books I've been missinng."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopeful Romantic","review":"This was my first Jane Heller Book. I was totally impressed with her wit and abiity to laugh at women as a species. I readily enjoy an author with a genuine sense of humor. Romance and comedy, that combimation is hard to beat. I also enjoyed the secondary story of the relationship between the women. The only other thing I would have added, would be a little more romance and development of the relationship between the main characters. I look forward to reading her other works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it -- especially in hardcover.","review":"I read this for a book group, because we wanted something lighter than the recent \\"downer\\" books we ha've been reading. This was a little too light. You could spot plot developments a mile away. Dialogue was fake. Maybe as a paperback...at the airport...when I have spare change in my pocket and will read just about ANYTHING..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Female (NON)Intelligence","review":"Truly one of the worst, most predictable, pieces of pap I've ever read. Perhaps her other books were clever, but I honestly can't find a single compliment, however reaching, to pay this piece of junk. Kept feeling as if I'd seen this TV movie about 15 or 20 years ago. Certainly read more like a failed screenplay than a novel,with its cliche dialogue and rudimentary narrative. I'm sure Ms Heller is a lovely woman, and as my mother would probably say, she'd probably read this review and laugh all the way to the bank. It was a clever premise fully unrealized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Usually books by De Vosjoli are very helpful. This is not one of them. The subject matter does not cover designing the actual cage, something that is essential to a vivarium, but rather gives few resources on where to buy cages. There are some sections that are rather useless as well, including necessary items for a vivarium store. I found this section to be a waste of space, besides not having enough information for one who is actually considering opening a store.The biggest turn-off for me was that the author showed how egotistical he is through his writing on every page. He seemed to discourage readers, and I felt that he thought one would not be able to create a home for their cold-blooded friend.I do not think that this is a resource that one needs to own. If you are looking for ideas, flip through the book at a local bookstore but it is neither necessary nor helpful in designing your own vivarium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but true","review":"Having bought a \\"summer home\\" in upstate New York my wife and I really related to this very funny book. The good news is it is really all true. The bad news is it is really all true also. His description of the \\"locals\\" is right on. We like Jim finally decided that we couldn't beat them...so like him we joined them! You have to have lived in the city to really appreciate this book, but if you want a really pleasant afternoon, buy this book and get a soft chair and laugh your head off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and so real","review":"City boy and wife move to the country (well, just on the weekends--at first), experience culture shock, go through a transition period, wind up loving the country and moving there permanently. Heard it or seen it all before, right? Well, never mind that, this is a funny, funny book. Although the actual town is fictionalized, and I'm sure many events were also fictionalized or exaggerated, this book has the ring of hilarious truth. I was expecting this to be a lot like the movie \\"Funny Farm\\" with Chevy Chase, but this is much funnier and much more true to life. Plus, it brings a particular geographical area along with the accompanying mindset of the residents to life. So all the time you're laughing, you're getting educated as well. Highly recommended for light reading on a lazy afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesnt work on mac like they said","review":"I tried in 3 different macs and it doesnt work. Try another brand with a bigger name, more expensive but it gonna work for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savor the \\"Real\\" New Orleans Carnival","review":"If you wish to view the real New Orleans carnival celebration, take a look through this window opened by its legendary artist/historian, Henri Schindler. Schindler is a local icon, the touchstone of this unique cultural expression. Students of cultural and social history as well as art lovers and designers will share delight in Schindler's masterful recreation, through well-researched and entertaining text and beautiful color plates, of the \\"golden age\\" of the celebration--an oeuvre to which Schindler adds annually through his own designs for several of the old-line carnival organizations, thus keeping alive the artistic and cultural tradition of which he writes in this and his previous books. The reader comes to know, through the insights of a true \\"insider\\", the meaning and spirit of the \\"real\\" Carnival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Controller","review":"The wheel worked great for me, but I am always using it so, after 5 or 6 months, the flimsy gas pedal snapped into two pieces. The wheel feels comfortable and is easy to use. The paddle-shifters work great and have very quick response. I have gotten a problem with it within the last 6 months where when you turn it left, it goes left, then right, then left/right/left/right. I tried calibrating it with the included software but it was no help. I did it in the control panel but it still didn't help.
